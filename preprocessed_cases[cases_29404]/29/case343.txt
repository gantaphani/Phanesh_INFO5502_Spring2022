by law,the copyright royalty board sets the terms and rates for copyright royalties when copyright owners and licensees fail to negotiate terms and rates themselves.as part of its statutory mandate,the board sets royalty terms and rates for what is known as the statutory license.that license allows individuals to make their own recordings of copyrighted musical works for distribution to the public without the consent of the copyright owner.
in carrying out its statutory responsibilities under,the board instituted a percent per month late fee for late royalty payments.it also implemented a royalty structure for cell phone ringtones,under which copyright owners receive cents for every ringtone sold using their copyrighted work.
the recording industry association of america challenges those two aspects of the board decision,arguing that they were arbitrary and capricious for purposes of the administrative procedure act.we conclude that the board decision was reasonable and reasonably explained.we therefore affirm the board determination.
most songs played on the radio,sold on cds in music stores,or digitally available on the internet through services like itunes embody two distinct copyright in the musical work and a copyright in the sound recording.see.the musical work is the musical notes and lyrics of the song as they appear on sheet music.the sound recording is the recorded musical work performed by a specific artist.
although almost always intermingled in a single song,those two copyrights are legally distinct and may be owned and licensed separately.one party might own the copyright in the words and musical arrangement of a song,and another party might own the copyright in a particular artist recording of those words and musical notes.
this case involves licenses in a limited category of copyrighted musical opposed to sound recordings.section of the copyright act allows an individual to make and distribute phonorecords that is,sound recordings of a copyrighted musical work without reaching any kind of agreement with the copyright owner.that right does not include authorization to make exact copies of an existing sound recording and distribute it if a musical work has been recorded and copyrighted by another artist,a licensee may exercise his rights under the license only by assembling his own musicians,singers,recording engineers and equipment,for the purpose of recording anew the musical work that is the subject of the license.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at.for example,a licensee could pull together a group of musicians to record and sell a cover version of bruce springsteen hit born to run,but that licensee could not make copies of springsteen recording of that song and sell them.
the licensing regime operates in a fairly straightforward manner.when a copyright owner distributes work to the public,provisions are triggered.a.once that occurs,anyone may obtain a compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of the work under so long as the primary purpose in making the phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private use.id.assuming the copyright has been registered with the copyright office,the licensee owes the copyright owner a royalty for every phonorecord made and distributed in accordance with the license.id.c.for purposes of the copyright act,a phonorecord is distributed and an obligation to pay the copyright owner a royalty the person exercising the license has voluntarily and permanently parted with the phonorecord.id.in other words,the licensee sale of its recording of the copyright owner work triggers the royalty payment obligation.see nimmer h,at.
because the license issues without any agreement between the copyright owner and the licensee,the system needs a mechanism to figure out how much the licensee owes the copyright owner and what the terms for paying that rate should be.although that mechanism has changed over time,the copyright royalty board currently serves as the rulemaking body for this system.see generally procedural regulations for the copyright royalty board.may,discussing the history of royalty ratemaking.the board is a panel appointed by the librarian of congress and removable only for cause by the librarian the board sets the terms and rates for copyright royalties when copyright owners and licensees fail to negotiate terms and rates themselves.see nimmer c,at.
as relevant here,the copyright act requires the board to set reasonable terms and rates for royalty payments made under the license when the parties to the license fail to do so.b.when establishing terms and rates under that license,the copyright act requires the board to balance four general and sometimes conflicting policy objectives maximizing the availability of creative works to the public providing copyright owners a fair return for their creative works and copyright users a fair income recognizing the relative roles of the copyright owners and users and minimizing any disruptive impact on the industries involved.id.b a d.
at specified intervals,the board holds ratemaking proceedings for licenses issued under the copyright act.section ratemaking proceedings can occur every five years or at such other times as the parties have agreed.id.b.
in,the parties with an interest in the license such as the recording industry association of america,the songwriter guild of america,and the national music publishers association agreed on various terms and rates for the compulsory license.they also agreed that the settlement with respect to those terms and rates would expire years later.in,after the parties found they could not reach a new compromise,the board instituted proceedings to set certain terms and rates governing the operation of the license.the process was long and complicated,involving days of live testimony,more than exhibits,and more than pleadings,motions,and orders.see mechanical and digital phonorecord delivery rate determination proceeding.
when the board published its final determination from those proceedings in,it announced one new licensing term and two new royalty rates.first,the board instituted a late payment of percent per month for overdue royalties,measured from the date payment is due.second,it established a royalty rate for cellular phone sound cell phones can make when they ring that often samples a popular song.it set the rate at cents per ringtone sold third,with respect to physical phonorecords like cds and permanent digital downloads like those purchased from itunes,the board set the royalty rate at the greater of cents per song or cents per minute of playing time.
the recording industry association of america,known as riaa,is a trade association representing companies that create,manufacture,and distribute sound recordings.it participated as a party in the licensing proceedings.after the board issued its determination,riaa filed a motion for rehearing.the board denied the motion.
riaa now appeals two aspects of the board ruling the imposition of a percent per month late fee and the imposition of a royalty structure for ringtones at cents per ringtone sold.
riaa does not contend that the board contravened any specific statutory limit.in other words,this is a state farm case,not a chevron case.the board rulings are subject to review in this court under the arbitrary and capricious standard of the administrative procedure act.d see a.as a general matter,our review under that standard is deferential.see fcc fox television stations,motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins.and we give substantial deference to the ratemaking decisions of the board because congress expressly tasked it with balancing the conflicting statutory objectives enumerated in the copyright act.soundexchange,librarian of congress.to the extent that the statutory objectives determine a range of reasonable royalty rates that would serve all the objectives adequately but to differing degrees,the board is free to choose among those rates,and courts are without authority to set aside the particular rate chosen by the board if it lies within a zone of reasonableness.recording indus.ass of america copyright royalty
