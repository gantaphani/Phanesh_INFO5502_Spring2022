iii.the complaint 
lewis alleged the following facts.youtube web site provides users with a way to share their videos.users create an account,select a video from their computer,and upload it to youtube computer servers.youtube does not charge users to upload videos or visitors to view them.youtube annual revenue of several billion dollars is generated through the sale of advertisements.
youtube posts its terms of service on its web site.a copy of the terms of service was attached as an exhibit to the complaint.
lewis created the former youtube channel,bulbheadmyass in.she accepted the terms of service and was bound by them.in january,she posted her first video featuring her musical group remington riders.between january and november,lewis posted videos,which gathered nearly views,garnered many favorable comments,and were linked to by other musicians.lewis spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars producing these videos.there was no commercial component to the production of the videos she did not sell the videos or audio versions of the music and the remington riders did not perform in public.her sole reward was the acclaim that she received from the youtube community and the opportunity to make new friends lewis responded to comments and shared her videos with other users who she thought might like them.she only engaged with the youtube community by means of conventional web browser software.
on november,lewis discovered that youtube had deleted her channel.she received no notice that the channel was going to be deleted.on november,lewis sent an to youtube and asked for help in restoring the channel.she received the following reply thank you for your email.this account was found in violation of tou section h you agree not to use or launch any automated system,including without limitation,robots,spiders,or offline readers,that accesses the service in a manner that sends more request messages to the youtube servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional web browser.notwithstanding the foregoing,youtube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy material from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials,but not caches or archives of such materials.youtube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.you agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information,including account names,from the service,not to use the communication systems provided by the service,comments,email for any commercial solicitation purposes.you agree not to solicit,for commercial purposes,any users of the service with respect to their content.regards,the youtube team 
youtube did not notify lewis which of the different acts set forth in its response resulted in the deletion of her channel.lewis sent a letter to youtube several days later and denied a violation of section.youtube responded by sending an identical to its previous.in february,lewis filed an appeal with youtube.she received an identical to the previous.
after lewis made additional efforts to determine why her channel had been deleted,youtube took the unfounded position that she had been soliciting other users for commercial purposes.
lewis first cause of action for breach of contract incorporates by reference the previous allegations.it also alleges that the terms of service incorporates an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing such that neither party will do anything to destroy or injure the right of the other party to receive the benefits of the contract.when lewis uploaded her videos on the youtube web site and actively engaged with the youtube community,she helped generate the traffic that allowed youtube to sell advertising to those who wanted to target the youtube community.though lewis performed all conditions required under the terms of service,youtube breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
youtube deprived lewis of her reasonable expectations under the terms of service,which included the expectation that if she complied with the terms of service that her channel would be maintained,that the channel would continue to include her videos,and that her channel would continue to reflect the same number of views and comments by fellow youtube users.lewis has no adequate remedy at law because the acclaim that her channel received from fellow youtube users represents a unique article having a special value to lewis,for which lewis can not obtain a duplicate on the open market and there is no criteria by which the fair market value of that acclaim can be measured.as a consequence,lewis requires a court order restoring her channel to its condition prior to youtube breach.
alternatively,the second cause of action for breach of contract seeks damages,which would include,but not be limited to,her costs associated with producing the videos and the reasonable value of her time spent generating her original content and participating as a member of the youtube community.
