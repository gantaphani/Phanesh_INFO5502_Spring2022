three groups of petitioners seek review of a final rule issued by respondent librarian of congress librarian,setting copyright license rates for webcasters.see determination of reasonable rates and terms for the digital performance of sound recordings and ephemeral recordings,fed.reg.july,final rule.the librarian decision was based on proceedings before a copyright arbitration royalty panel carp.one group of did not participate formally in the carp proceedings,but challenges the rates set by the librarian based on the carp recommendations.the also argue that the carp process itself was flawed because it excluded small webcasters and those who could not afford arbitration fees,violating their rights to due process and freedom of expression.the include and three other entities who seek to join or intervene in this case,as well as one,education information corporation eic that only seeks to intervene.a second group of owners and performers that include the recording industry association of america riaa and other industry groups jointly,owners argue that the librarian set rates arbitrarily low by not adequately considering past agreements he had on the record.the third group of participant licensee petitioners includes radio broadcasters who simulcast via radio and internet simulcasters and internet webcasters who broadcast solely over the internet webcasters jointly,broadcasters.these broadcasters,who were parties to the carp proceedings,claim that the librarian rates were arbitrary,contending that rates should be lowered because they were not based on real market factors.respondent librarian attacks the standing of the,while defending his rate determinations.because we hold that the have no standing and seek to intervene only to impermissibly raise new issues,we dismiss their petition for review and do not permit intervention.as to the issues properly before us,raised by the owners and broadcasters,we find no reversible error and therefore deny their petitions for review.the owners challenge to the payment date set by the librarian is moot.
background 
statutory background 
since the enactment of the digital performance right in sound recordings act of,pub.amending,copyright owners have had exclusive rights in performances of their works by digital audio transmission.the digital millennium copyright act of dmca,pub.amending scattered sections of,expanded copyright protection to webcasting and created a statutory license in performances by webcast.f.the dmca creates a negotiation period for copyright owners and statutory licensees to privately determine rates and fees for these licenses.id.f a.if no agreement is reached at that time,the librarian convenes a carp to set rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.id.f b.the carp decision is to be based on economic,competitive and programming information presented by the parties,including 
i whether use of the service may substitute for or may promote the sales of phonorecords or otherwise may interfere with or may enhance the sound recording copyright owner other streams of revenue from its sound recordings and 
ii the relative roles of the copyright owner and the transmitting entity in the copyrighted work and the service made available to the public with respect to relative creative contribution,technological contribution,capital investment,cost,and risk.
id.the same standards are to be used to determine the statutory license rate for ephemeral recordings,the temporary copies necessary to facilitate the transmission of sound recordings during internet broadcasting.id.e.
any person entitled to a statutory license may become a party to the carp proceedings by submitting relevant information and proposals to the carp.c.parties are entitled to discovery,presentation of evidence and witnesses,and a formal hearing before an arbitrator.the carp then acts on the basis of the written record and precedent from the copyright royalty tribunal,other carp decisions,and the librarian.costs of the arbitration are imposed on the parties to the carp proceeding,with the carp determining the allocation of costs among the parties.c.
within days after receiving the carp report,the librarian must either adopt or reject its determination,adopting it unless the rates and terms are arbitrary or contrary to the applicable provisions of the statute.f.if the librarian rejects the report he may set a fee based on the record before the carp.id.a ny aggrieved party who would be bound by the determination may challenge the librarian decision before this court.id.g.this court then has jurisdiction to modify or vacate a decision of the librarian only if it finds,on the basis of the record before the librarian,that the librarian acted in an arbitrary manner.id.
b.the carp and the librarian decision 
the carp proceeding at issue here was instituted to set rates and terms for statutory licenses during the period between october,and december,after the period for voluntary negotiation had expired.none of the took steps to join the carp proceedings by filing notices of intent to participate.one,eic,wrote a letter to the carp asking permission to present an pleading because it had only limited interest in the results and could not afford to participate in the full proceedings.this request was denied.the owners and broadcasters did take part in the carp arbitration.the carp completed its proceedings on february,and presented its report to the librarian on february.see rate setting for digital performance right in sound recordings and ephemeral recordings,docket,available at http carp report.
during the private negotiation period prior to the carp arbitration,the riaa formed a committee of five major record labels to develop and carry out a common strategy for engaging in collective negotiations with prospective licensees.this committee ultimately negotiated agreements which riaa submitted to the carp as evidence of market valuation of the licenses.the carp determined that the riaa strategy was targeted at licensing fees to conform with its view of the sweet spot for the royalty rates.carp report at.riaa then would only close deals that hit its sweet spot to create a favorable record before the carp,generally with businesses driven by factors other than the value of the sound performance rights.id.the carp found that the rates in of these agreements were higher than the majority of buyers was willing to pay and thus did not establish a reliable benchmark.id.at.nonetheless,it did accord them some weight by using them to justify rounding ephemeral recording rates from percent of performance fees up to percent.id.at.to corroborate the rates in the benchmark agreements,riaa also submitted record label licensing agreements between individual record companies and licensees.the carp disregarded all of these agreements because they did not involve the same digital performance rights at issue in the proceeding.id.at.
the one riaa benchmark given great weight by the carp was an agreement between riaa and,a company recognized to be a major player in making sound recording transmissions the agreement.carp report at.this weight was not without qualifications,however.the carp found that due to dominant role in the industry it stood to bear a substantial portion of any arbitration costs and thus was willing to accept an inflated royalty rate to avoid these costs.id.at.also testified that it anticipated significant savings in arbitration fees and opportunity costs by making an agreement with riaa.id.even so,the rates negotiated by were considerably lower than those of the other agreements offered by riaa as benchmarks.id.at.the terms of the agreement provided that pay million for the first billion performances and after that cents per radio retransmission performance and cents per performance.final rule,fed.reg.at.
the broadcasters also submitted a proposed benchmark for determining the fair market value of the performance right based on a computation of the performance fees paid by over radio stations for rights to musical works.using this analysis,their expert concluded that cents per radio retransmission and cents per performance was appropriate.the carp determined that actual marketplace agreements for webcasting were a better benchmark than a theoretical model.carp report at.thus it relied entirely on the agreement to set its rates and terms,while acknowledging that this agreement was inflated.id.at.
the carp determination was challenged by several parties.the librarian rejected it in part on may.see final rule,fed.reg.at,citing order,docket carp dtra may.the librarian agreed with the carp that the benchmark and record label agreements were generally unreliable,but found that the carp minimal reliance on the benchmark agreements to round ephemeral rates up was arbitrary.final rule,fed.reg.at.because he did not consider benchmarks from the agreements,he lowered ephemeral royalty rates from the carp recommendation of percent of the royalty fees paid to percent.id.the librarian based his decision solely on the agreement,refusing to reduce its value to account for any litigation cost savings might have realized by avoiding the carp process.id.at.the librarian abandoned the structure adopted by carp to differentiate between radio retransmission and webcasting,adopting instead a average of the two rates,cents per performance.id.at.the librarian did accept the minimum fee recommended by the lowest such fee in all the benchmark that riaa would not have agreed to it if it was not at least sufficient to meet costs.id.at.finally,although no parties had requested the change,the librarian altered the terms of the carp agreement to move the due date for royalty payments back two months to october.id.at.
the broadcasters,owners,and petitioned this court for review of the librarian decision.also sought in the alternative to intervene in the case.these issues have been consolidated for review.
ii.analysis 
status of the.standing 
as a preliminary question we must consider whether have standing before this court.the supreme court has repeatedly observed that f ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.they possess only that power authorized by constitution and statute,which is not to be expanded by judicial decree.kokkonen guardian life ins.of america,d citations omitted.the statutory grant of jurisdiction under which we review this order of the librarian provides for appeals by any aggrieved party who would be bound by the determination.g.claim that they should be allowed to petition for review because they are aggrieved by the order,and the word party should encompass them and all other entities both aggrieved and bound by the determination.the librarian counters that party refers to a party to the carp proceeding below.
the language of g has not been interpreted by any federal court of appeals.this court has,however,considered similar language in other contexts.we have consistently interpreted the hobbs act grant of jurisdiction to any party aggrieved to be limited to parties to the agency proceedings giving rise to the order.see simmons icc,interpreting.we have held that identical language in the bank holding company act similarly limits jurisdiction to parties to the agency proceedings.jones board of governors,interpreting.we note that the district court has also held that the plain meaning of this language in the context of the federal election campaign act limits it to parties to the administrative complaint.judicial watch,fec,d interpreting a a.it is thus consistent with precedent to similarly construe g.
the plain language also mandates such a construction.because congress chose to grant review to parties,we have no reason to believe it meant persons or anything else other than parties to the proceeding.when it means to grant broader review,it says so,as in the administrative procedure act,which accords judicial review to any person aggrieved.emphasis added see simmons,at.we can find no instance where congress has used party to simply mean person.
furthermore,the congress that first enacted this language in as knew of our interpretation of party aggrieved.see,gage atomic energy comm n,interpreting the hobbs act easton utilities comm atomic energy comm n,referring to interpretation of hobbs act outward continental north pac.freight conference federal maritime comm n,hobbs act see also first nat.bank of charles board of governors of federal reserve system,cir bank holding company act.assuming as is always appropriate that our elected representatives,like other citizens,know the law,we take congress use of any aggrieved party to mean that judicial review is limited to parties to the proceeding below,as similar language has consistently been interpreted.cannon of chicago,d.
intervention 
although do not have standing before this court as petitioners,they have,in the alternative,requested leave to intervene.however,a n intervening party may join issue only on a matter that has been brought before the court by another party.edison electric institute epa.brief makes first amendment and due process claims not addressed by any of the other petitioners properly before this court.the bare assertion in reply brief that the other copyright licensee petitioners shared their first amendment and due process concerns,and that the briefs intentionally address different arguments to avoid repetitious submissions is not sufficient to bring claims into the purview of this action.reply br.at see edison electric,at.we will not permit intervention for the purpose of raising these new issues.
review of the librarian decision 
we turn to the issues raised by parties properly before us.this court has jurisdiction to modify or vacate a decision of the librarian only if it finds,on the basis of the record before the librarian,that the librarian acted in an arbitrary manner.g.this standard is exceptionally deferential.recording indus.ass of am.librarian of congress.we will uphold a royalty award if the librarian has offered a facially plausible explanation for it in terms of the record evidence.national ass of broadcasters librarian of congress,nab.
understandably,the owners challenge the librarian ruling as setting rates too low,and the broadcasters argue that the rates have been set too high.the owners initially argue that the librarian failed to adequately consider the label agreements and riaa benchmark agreements in setting the royalty rates for sound recording performances and ephemeral recordings.they also criticize the librarian choices of minimum fee and due date for payments in arrears.broadcasters argue that the librarian reliance on the agreement was inappropriate,that he should have adjusted rates further downward because of litigation cost savings in that agreement,and that the rejection of the carp different rates for simulcasters and webcasters was inappropriate.under our deferential standard of review,we find no reversible error in the librarian decision.
failure to consider the riaa proposed alternate benchmarks 
the owners argue that the librarian acted arbitrarily by rejecting the label agreements without sufficient explanation.in their view,these agreements provide corroboration for riaa benchmark analysis from rates reached in the actual marketplace,unconstrained by the statutory license.owners br.at.accordingly,the owners maintain that,by failing to consider the label agreements,the librarian arbitrarily neglected a tremendous amount of economic and competitive information that would have permitted him to make a far more informed decision on rates for use of copyrighted sound recordings.id.this claim is without merit.
the carp rejected these label agreements as useful benchmarks for two reasons.it first explained that,unlike the riaa benchmark agreements,all of which addressed the precise rights at issue here,the label agreements involved rights not subject to a statutory license.carp report at.the carp additionally explained that,were it inclined to rely on these agreements,the effect would likely be to undermine,not corroborate,riaa proposals in that many of the agreements reflect rates below those which riaa is proposing.id.the librarian accepted these rationales,see final rule at,and in so doing was not obligated to fully recapitulat e the carp analysis.nab,at see f.the owners nevertheless maintain that the librarian should have looked harder ultimately relied label agreements.
their challenge can not succeed under the deferential standard of review applicable here.nab,at.the owners purport to attack the sufficiency of the librarian explanation for eschewing reliance on the label agreements.but at the bottom,their challenge seeks to undermine the substance of the carp and librarian determinations regarding the weight to ascribe to these agreements.as the nab court explained,it is emphatically not the court role to independently weigh the evidence at.even to the extent that the owners argue that the librarian set rates in an arbitrary manner by failing to place some greater emphasis on the label agreements,their contentions are unpersuasive.
under the applicable exceptionally deferential standard of review,we conclude that there is nothing compelling in the label agreements,or in the carp and librarian treatment of them,that would allow the court to hold that the librarian set the rates in an arbitrary manner.see nab,at.the librarian decision to eschew reliance on the label agreements in favor of the agreement seems perfectly sensible because the label agreements,unlike the agreement,indisputably cover rights not subject to the statutory licenses involved in this proceeding.furthermore,as the librarian explained,the agreement was particularly reliable and probative not only because it was an actual marketplace agreement pertaining to the same rights for comparable services,but also because it involved a successful and sophisticated market participant with resources and bargaining power comparable to riaa own.final rule,fed.reg.at.
at oral argument,the owners asserted that the librarian inaccurately described the content of the label agreements in a footnote,and,therefore,his estimation of the value of these agreements was necessarily arbitrary and can not have been based on an analysis of the agreements.final rule,fed.reg.at.the details of the librarian description are in the sealed record and redacted from the federal register to protect trade secrets,but are ultimately not significant in our determination.the description of the agreements was at worst harmless error,if error at all,as the agreements were never tendered for anything more than corroborative evidence of evidence upon which the librarian chose not to place great reliance.even if described properly,the agreements could have been no more than a shadow of a shadow.
owners challenges to the treatment of riaa benchmark agreements 
the owners claims concerning the librarian treatment of the riaa benchmark agreements likewise fail.they maintain that the librarian acted arbitrarily,and contrary to and,by only relying on the agreement and not the other riaa benchmark agreements.more specifically,they assert that the librarian acted in an arbitrary manner by ignoring the weight the carp gave the other benchmark agreements by adopting a unitary rate instead of a dual rate structure rejecting the carp reliance on the ephemeral recording rate contained in eight of the other agreements to set an ephemeral recording rate of percent and adjusting both the sound recording performance rate and ephemeral recording rate downward through the application of rounding.owners br.at.these claims all fail.
the owners contentions,like the ones addressed above,are unpersuasive under the applicable standard of review.see nab,at.in deploying this standard,the court will set aside a royalty award only if it determine s that the evidence before the librarian compels a substantially different award.id.at.despite the owners arguments to the contrary,the librarian has offered a facially plausible explanation in terms of the record evidence for the royalty rates under review.id.the librarian thoroughly explained his decision to base the sound recording performance rate and ephemeral recording rate on the terms of the agreement,as that agreement was particularly reliable and probative because it reflected actual marketplace rates.see final rule,fed.reg.at.the librarian further explained how,based on the terms of the agreement,he arrived at a unitary cents royalty rate for sound recording performances and a rate of percent of performance royalties for ephemeral recordings.id.at.given the librarian reliance on the agreement,the other benchmark both the carp and librarian found to be not resonate as evidence so compelling as to require a substantially different award.nab,at.
moreover,each of the librarian specific decisions challenged by the owners is adequately explained and based on record evidence.first,the librarian thoroughly explained his decisions to select a unitary rate for transmissions of sound he based on the finding that the agreement differential rate structure did not reflect a true distinction in value between webcasts and radio to set the sound performance royalty rate at the between the blended rate established for the first period billion transmissions and that set for the second period.see final rule,fed.reg.at.furthermore,in setting the rate at the of this zone of reasonableness,the librarian explained that it makes more sense to use both values and take the average of the two because,i n this way,the final unitary rate captures the actual value of the performance made in the initial period and the projected value of the transmissions at the agreed upon rates for the remainder of the license period and it falls within the range of acknowledged values for these transmissions.id.at.
second,the librarian explained that the carp decision to give any weight to eight of the other riaa benchmark agreements in setting the ephemeral recording rate was arbitrary.see id.at.because the carp had previously repudiated these agreements,the librarian explained that,absent a clear explanation,it was arbitrary for the carp to use these agreements which contained ephemeral recording rates around percent of the performance royalties to justify its decision to round the percent ephemeral recording rate up to percent.id.at.as the carp did not clearly explain its,the librarian set the ephemeral recording rate at percent.see id.at.this decision was not arbitrary because the rate was derived from the agreement,and the carp had previously determined that the other benchmark agreements containing higher rates were unreliable and did not reflect going market rates.
third,the librarian application of rounding was not arbitrary.as explained above,the librarian declined to increase the ephemeral recording rate to percent,because the carp did so based on agreements that it had found unreliable for establishing marketplace rates.see id.at carp report at the panel concludes that the license agreements are unreliable benchmarks.the librarian also did not act in an arbitrary manner in setting the sound performance royalty rate at cents,rather than at cents.as noted above,the librarian explained why he set the zone of reasonableness for the sound recording performance rate where he did,and he ultimately selected a rate that fell within that identified zone.we can require no more.see nab,at,our job,rather,is to determine whether the royalty awards are within a zone of reasonableness.citation omitted.
minimum fee 
the owners next challenge the librarian selection of a minimum fee for eligible services.they contend that,in accepting the carp determination,the librarian arbitrarily failed to consider the full range of minimum fees established in the licenses riaa negotiated in the marketplace,or base the annual minimum fee on the agreement.accordingly,the owners ask the court to modify the librarian decision by increasing the annual minimum fee to.because the librarian did not act in an arbitrary manner in determining the fee,we have no power to modify it.see g.
after examining the marketplace agreements offered by riaa,the carp set the minimum fee based on the lowest value that riaa had accepted in one of its prior agreements.see final rule,fed.reg.at.this choice was not arbitrary,as the lib
