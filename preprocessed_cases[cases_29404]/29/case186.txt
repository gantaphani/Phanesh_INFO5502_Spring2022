owners of copyrighted popular music filed a number of closely related suits,which were consolidated and transferred to the northern district of illinois by the multidistrict litigation panel,against john deep and corporations that are controlled by him and need not be discussed separately.the numerous plaintiffs,who among them appear to own most subsisting copyrights on american popular music,claim that deep aimster internet service recently renamed madster is a contributory and vicarious infringer of these copyrights.the district judge entered a broad preliminary injunction,which had the effect of shutting down the aimster service until the merits of the suit are finally resolved,from which deep appeals.aimster is one of a number of enterprises the former napster is the best known that have been sued for facilitating the swapping of digital copies of popular music,most of it copyrighted,over the internet.for an illuminating discussion,see tim wu,when code is law,esp.and with special reference to aimster,see alec klein,going napster one better aimster says its software skirts legal quagmire.post.to simplify exposition,we refer to the appellant as aimster and to the appellees the plaintiffs as the recording industry.
teenagers and young adults who have access to the internet like to swap computer files containing popular music.if the music is copyrighted,such swapping,which involves making and transmitting a digital copy of the music,infringes copyright.the swappers,who are ignorant or more commonly disdainful of copyright and in any event discount the likelihood of being sued or prosecuted for copyright infringement,are the direct infringers.but firms that facilitate their infringement,even if they are not themselves infringers because they are not making copies of the music that is shared,may be liable to the copyright owners as contributory infringers.recognizing the impracticability or futility of a copyright owner suing a multitude of individual infringers chasing individual consumers is time consuming and is a teaspoon solution to an ocean problem,randal picker,copyright as entry policy the case of digital distribution,antitrust bull,the law allows a copyright holder to sue a contributor to the infringement instead,in 
effect as an aider and abettor.another analogy is to the tort of intentional interference with contract,that is,inducing a breach of contract.see,sufrin hosier,cir.if a breach of contract and a copyright license is just a type of contract can be prevented most effectively by actions taken by a third party,it makes sense to have a legal mechanism for placing liability for the consequences of the breach on him as well as on the party that broke the contract.
the district judge ruled that the recording industry had demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the merits should the case proceed to trial.he so ruled with respect to vicarious as well as contributory infringement we begin with the latter,the more familiar charge.
the aimster system has the following essential components proprietary software that can be downloaded free of charge from aimster web site aimster server a server is a computer that provides services to other computers,in this case personal computers owned or accessed by aimster users,over a network,which hosts the web site and collects and organizes information obtained from the users but does not make copies of the swapped files themselves and that also provides the matching service described below computerized tutorials instructing users of the software on how to use it for swapping computer files and club aimster,a related internet service owned by deep that users of aimster software can join for a fee and use to download the top files more easily than by using the basic,free service.the aim in aimster stands for aol service.aimster is available only to users of such services of which aol is the most popular because aimster users can swap files only when both are online and connected in a chat room enabled by an service.
someone who wants to use aimster basic service for the first time to swap files downloads the software from aimster web site and then registers on the system by entering a user name it does have to be his real name and a password at the web site.having done so,he can designate any other registrant as a buddy and can communicate directly with all his buddies when he and they are online,attaching to his communications which are really just any files that he wants to share with the buddies.all communications back and forth are encrypted by the sender by means of encryption software furnished by aimster as part of the software package downloadable at no charge from the web site,and are decrypted by the recipient using the same software package.if the user does not designate a buddy or buddies,then all the users of the aimster system become his buddies that is,he can send or receive from any of them.
users list on their computers the computer files they are willing to share.they need list them separately,but can merely designate a folder in their computer that contains the files they are willing to share.a user who wants to make a copy of a file goes online and types the name of the file he wants in his search for field.aimster server searches the computers of those users of its software who are online and so are available to be searched for files they are willing to share,and if it finds the file that has been requested it instructs the computer in which it is housed to transmit the file to the recipient via the internet for him to download into his computer.once he has done this he can if he wants make the file available for sharing with other users of the aimster system by listing it as explained above.in principle,therefore,the purchase of a single cd could be levered into the distribution within days or even hours of millions of identical,depending on the compression format used copies of the music recorded on the the recording industry anxiety about services oriented toward consumers of popular music.but because copies of the songs reside on the computers of the users and not on aimster own server,aimster is not a direct infringer of the copyrights on those songs.its function is similar to that of a stock exchange,which is a facility for matching offers rather than a repository of the things being exchanged shares of stock.but unlike transactions on a stock exchange,the consummated transaction in music files does not take place in the facility,that is,in aimster server.
what we have described so far is a type of internet system that might be created for innocuous purposes such as the expeditious exchange of confidential business data among employees of a business firm.see daniel nasaw,instant messages are popping up all over,wall,june,david vise,aol makes deal.post,june.the fact that copyrighted materials might sometimes be shared between users of such a system without the authorization of the copyright owner or a privilege would not make the firm a contributory infringer.otherwise aol system,which aimster piggybacks on,might be deemed a contributory infringer.for there is no doubt that some of the attachments that aol multitudinous subscribers transfer are copyrighted,and such distribution is an infringement unless authorized by the owner of the copyright.the supreme court made clear in the sony decision that the producer of a product that has substantial noninfringing uses is not a contributory infringer merely because some of the uses actually made of the product in that case a machine,the predecessor of today videocassette recorders,for recording television programs on tape are infringing.sony of america,universal city studios,d see also vault quaid software,cir.how much more the court held is the principal issue that divides the parties and let us try to resolve it,recognizing of course that the court must have the last word.
sony betamax video recorder was used for three principal purposes,as sony was well aware a fourth,playing home movies,involved no copying.the first,which the majority opinion emphasized,was time shifting,that is,recording a television program that was being shown at a time inconvenient for the owner of the betamax for later watching at a convenient time.the second was library building,that is,making copies of programs to retain permanently.the third was skipping commercials by taping a program before watching it and then,while watching the tape,using the button on the recorder to skip over the commercials.the first use the court held was a fair use and hence not infringing because it enlarged the audience for the program.the copying involved in the second and third uses was unquestionably infringing to the extent that the programs copied were under copyright and the taping of them was not authorized by the copyright not all fell in either category.subject to this qualification,building a library of taped programs was infringing because it was the equivalent of borrowing a copyrighted book from a public library,making a copy of it for one personal library,then returning the original to the public library.the third use,amounted to creating an unauthorized derivative work,see wgn continental broadcasting united video,cir gilliam american broadcasting,cir ty,gma accessories,cir,namely a copy that would reduce the copyright owner income from his original program,since free television programs are financed by the purchase of commercials by advertisers.
thus the video recorder was being used for a mixture of infringing and noninfringing uses and the court thought that sony could not demix them because once sony sold the recorder it lost all control over its use.sony of america,universal city studios,supra,at.the court ruled that the sale of copying equipment,like the sale of other articles of commerce,does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate,unobjectionable purposes.indeed,it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.the question is thus whether the betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.in order to resolve that question,we need not explore all the different potential uses of the machine and determine whether or not they would constitute infringement.rather,we need only consider whether on the basis of the facts as found by the district court a significant number of them would be.moreover,in order to resolve this case we need not give precise content to the question of how much use is commercially significant.for one potential use of the betamax plainly satisfies this standard,however it is understood private,noncommercial timeshifting in the home.id.at.
in our case the recording industry,emphasizing the reference to articles of commerce in the passage just quoted and elsewhere in the court opinion see id.at.c,and emphasizing as well the court evident concern that the copyright holders were trying to lever their copyright monopolies into a monopoly over video recorders,sony of america,universal city studios,supra,at and,and also remarking sony helplessness to prevent infringing uses of its recorders once it sold them,argues that sony is inapplicable to services.with regard to services,the industry argues,the test is merely whether the provider knows it being used to infringe copyright.the industry points out that the provider of a service,unlike the seller of a product,has a continuing relation with its customers and therefore should be able to prevent,or at least limit,their infringing copyright by monitoring their use of the service and terminating them when it is discovered that they are infringing.although sony could have engineered its video recorder in a way that would have reduced the likelihood of infringement,as by eliminating the capability,or,as suggested by the dissent,id.at,by enabling broadcasters by scrambling their signal to disable the betamax from recording their programs for that matter,it could have been engineered to have only a play,not a recording,capability,the majority did not discuss these possibilities and we agree with the recording industry that the ability of a service provider to prevent its customers from infringing is a factor to be considered in determining whether the provider is a contributory infringer.congress so recognized in the digital millennium copyright act,which we discuss later in this opinion.
it is not necessarily a controlling factor,however,as the recording industry believes.if a service facilitates both infringing and noninfringing uses,as in the case of aol service,and the detection and prevention of the infringing uses would be highly burdensome,the rule for which the recording industry is contending could result in the shutting down of the service or its annexation by the copyright owners contrary to the clear import of the sony decision,because the provider might find it impossible to estimate its potential damages liability to the copyright holders and would anyway face the risk of being enjoined.the fact that the recording industry argument if accepted might endanger aol service though the service might find shelter under the digital millennium copyright question complicated,however,by aol intention,of which more later,of offering an encryption option to the visitors to its chat rooms is not only alarming it is paradoxical,since subsidiaries of aol parent company aol time warner,such as warner brothers records and atlantic recording corporation,are among the plaintiffs in this case and music chat rooms are among the facilities offered by aol service.
we also reject the industry argument that sony provides no defense to a charge of contributory infringement when,in the words of the industry brief,there is anything more than a mere showing that a product may be used for infringing purposes.although the fact was downplayed in the majority opinion,it was apparent that the betamax was being used for infringing as well as noninfringing the majority acknowledged that percent of betamax users were fast forwarding through commercials,id.at.sony was held not to be a contributory infringer.the court was unwilling to allow copyright holders to prevent infringement effectuated by means of a new technology at the price of possibly denying noninfringing consumers the benefit of the technology.we therefore agree with professor goldstein that the ninth circuit erred in a m records,napster,cir,in suggesting that actual knowledge of specific infringing uses is a sufficient condition for deeming a facilitator a contributory infringer.paul goldstein,copyright,ed 
the recording industry hostility to the sony decision is both understandable,given the amount of infringement of music copyrights,and industry in its brief offers five reasons for confining its holding to its specific facts.but it is being articulated in the wrong forum.
equally,however,we reject aimster argument that to prevail the recording industry must prove it has actually lost money as a result of the copying that its service facilitates.it is true that the court in sony emphasized that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they had sustained substantial harm from the betamax.id.at.but the court did so in the context of assessing the argument that time shifting of television programs was fair use rather than infringement.one reason time shifting was fair use,the court believed,was that it was hurting the copyright owners because it was enlarging the audience for their programs.but a copyright owner who can prove infringement need not show that the infringement caused him a financial loss.granted,without such a showing he can not obtain compensatory damages but he can obtain statutory damages,or an injunction,just as the owner of physical property can obtain an injunction against a trespasser without proving that the trespass has caused him a financial loss.
what is true is that when a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses,some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement.the court action in striking the tradeoff in favor of sony came to seem prescient when it later turned out that the principal use of video recorders was to allow people to watch at home movies that they bought or rented rather than to tape television programs.in,when sony was decided,the industry was unsure how great the demand would be for prerecorded tapes compared to time shifting.the original betamax played tapes,long enough for most television broadcasts but too short for a feature film.sony competitors used the vhs format,which came to market later but with a longer playing time this contributed to vhs eventual displacement of betamax.an enormous new market thus opened for the movie by the way gives point to the court emphasis on potential as well as actual noninfringing uses.but the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses,present or prospective,are demonstrated.
we also reject aimster argument that because the court said in sony that mere constructive knowledge of infringing uses is not enough for contributory infringement,at,and the encryption feature of aimster service prevented deep from knowing what songs were being copied by the users of his system,he lacked the knowledge of infringing uses that liability for contributory infringement requires.willful blindness is knowledge,in copyright law where indeed it may be enough that the defendant should have known of the direct infringement,casella morris,cir goldstein,supra,as it is in the law generally.see,louis vuitton lee,cir contributory trademark infringement.one who,knowing or strongly suspecting that he is involved in shady dealings,takes steps to make sure that he does not acquire full or exact knowledge of the nature and extent of those dealings is held to have a criminal intent,united states giovannetti,cir,because a deliberate effort to avoid guilty knowledge is all that the law requires to establish a guilty state of mind.united states josefik,cir,illinois tool works,cir to know,and to want not to know because one suspects,may be,if not the same state of mind,the same degree of fault.in united states diaz,cir,the defendant,a drug trafficker,sought to insulate himself from the actual drug transaction so that he could deny knowledge of it,which he did sometimes by absenting himself from the scene of the actual delivery and sometimes by pretending to be fussing under the hood of his car.he did not escape liability by this maneuver no more can deep by using encryption software to prevent himself from learning what surely he strongly suspects to be the case that the users of his all the users of his copyright infringers.
this is not to say that the provider of an encrypted service or encryption software is ipso factor a contributory infringer should his buyers use the service to infringe copyright,merely because encryption,like secrecy generally,facilitates unlawful transactions.encryption comes from the greek word for concealment.encryption fosters privacy,and privacy is a social benefit though also a source of social costs.aol has begun testing an encrypted version of aim aol instant messaging.encryption is considered critical for widespread adoption of im in some industries and federal agencies.vise,supra.our point is only that a service provider that would otherwise be a contributory infringer does not obtain immunity by using encryption to shield itself from actual knowledge of the unlawful purposes for which the service is being used.
we also do not buy aimster argument that since the supreme court distinguished,in the long passage from the sony opinion that we quoted earlier,between actual and potential noninfringing uses,all aimster has to show in order to escape liability for contributory infringement is that its system could be used in noninfringing ways,which obviously it could be.were that the law,the seller of a product or service used solely to facilitate copyright infringement,though it was capable in principle of noninfringing uses,would be immune from liability for contributory infringement.that would be an extreme result,and one not envisaged by the sony majority.otherwise its opinion would have had no occasion to emphasize the fact at least the majority thought it a dissent disagreed,at.that sony had not in its advertising encouraged the use of the betamax to infringe copyright.id.at.nor would the court have thought it important to say that the betamax was used principally for time shifting,id.at.see also id.at,which as we recall the court deemed a fair use,or to remark that the plaintiffs owned only a small percentage of the total amount of copyrighted television programming and it was unclear how many of the other owners objected to home taping.id.at.see also id.at.
there are analogies in the law of aiding and abetting,the criminal counterpart to contributory infringement.a retailer of slinky dresses is not guilty of aiding and abetting prostitution even if he knows that some of his customers are may even know which ones are.see united states giovannetti,supra,at people lauria,d.rollin perkins ronald boyce,criminal law ed.the extent to which his activities and those of similar sellers actually promote prostitution is likely to be slight relative to the social costs of imposing a risk of prosecution on him.but the owner of a massage parlor who employs women who are capable of giving massages,but in fact as he knows sell only sex and never massages to their customers,is an aider and abettor of prostitution as well as being guilty of pimping or operating a brothel.see united states sigalow,cir state carpenter,ohio app d,united states,cir.the case corresponds to sony,and,like sony,is not inconsistent with imposing liability on the seller of a product or service that,as in the case,is capable of noninfringing uses but in fact is used only to infringe.to the recording industry,a single known infringing use brands the facilitator as a contributory infringer.to the aimsters of this world,a single noninfringing use provides complete immunity from liability.neither is correct.
to situate aimster service between these unacceptable poles,we need to say just a bit more about it.in explaining how to use the aimster software,the tutorial gives as its only examples of file sharing the sharing of copyrighted music,including copyrighted music that the recording industry had notified aimster was being infringed by aimster users.the tutorial is the invitation to infringement that the supreme court found was missing in sony.in addition,membership in club aimster enables the member for a fee of a month to download with a single click the music most often shared by aimster users,which turns out to be music copyrighted by the plaintiffs.because aimster software is made available free of charge and aimster does not sell paid advertising on its web site,club aimster monthly fee is the only means by which aimster is financed and so the club can not be separated from the provision of the free software.when a member of the club clicks on play next to the name of a song on the club web site,aimster server searches through the computers of the aimster users who are online until it finds one who has listed the song as available for sharing,and it then effects the transmission of the file to the computer of the club member who selected it.club aimster lists only the songs that are currently most popular among its members invariably these are under copyright.
the evidence that we have summarized does not exclude the possibility of substantial noninfringing uses of the aimster system,but the evidence is sufficient,especially in a proceeding,which is summary in character,to shift the burden of production to aimster to demonstrate that its service has substantial noninfringing uses.on in proceedings,see ftc university health,cir johnson cambridge industries,cir sec lipson,cir liu t h machine,cir.as it might 
not all popular music is copyrighted.apart from music on which the copyright has expired not much of which,however,is of interest to the teenagers and young adults interested in swapping music,bands and performers may waive copyright in the hope that it will encourage the playing of their music and create a following that they can convert to customers of their subsequent works.
