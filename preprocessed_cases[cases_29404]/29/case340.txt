the satellite home viewer act of shva,pub,tit.ii,stat.codified as amended at,as amended by the satellite home viewer improvement act of shvia collectively,the act,pub,et,stat,gives satellite carriers a compulsory,statutory license to transmit copyrighted distant network to unserved households,that is,households unable to receive network programing at a specified level of intensity through the use of conventional rooftop antennas this case involves claims by network stations cbs broadcasting,cbs and fox broadcasting company fox,and network affiliate associations abc television affiliates association,cbs television network affiliates association,fbc television association,and nbc television affiliates association collectively,networks that defendant echostar,a satellite carrier doing business as dish network is retransmitting their programs to served households and thereby infringing their exclusive right,under the copyright act,to control the retransmission of their programs.
in cbs broadcasting,echostar communications,cir echostar i,we vacated the district court preliminary injunction upholding the networks claims and ordering echostar to cease transmitting the programs to served households,id.at,and remanded the case to the district court for a trial on the networks application for injunctive relief pursuant to the act.on remand,the district court found at the conclusion of the bench trial that echostar had not satisfied its statutory burden of proving that the households at issue were unserved.cbs,echostar commc ns,d.in fact,in the district court judgment,the evidence indicated that echostar had been retransmitting the networks programs to thousands of served households.id.at.given these findings,the networks asked the court permanently to enjoin echostar from any use of the act statutory license for distant network programing.the court denied their request,and instead issued an injunction ordering echostar to use a different method for determining whether its subscribers are unserved households.id.at echostar now appeals the court injunctive order and its grant of summary judgment to the networks on echostar counterclaims.the networks,contending that the district court was required as a matter of law permanently to enjoin the carrier from using the statutory license.
we organize this opinion as follows.in part i,we explain the statutory licensing scheme the act created and the burden of proof a satellite carrier must satisfy to permit the court to find that the subscribers at issue are eligible to receive distant network programming.in part ii,we review how the trial proceeded,the district court findings of fact,and its legal conclusions.in part iii,we address both echostar and the networks claims of error.despite reversing the district court determination that echostar use of two vendors was unlawful,we affirm on the remainder of echostar claims and the court conclusion that echostar engaged in a willful or repeated violation of the act.we also hold that the court erred in not finding a willful or repeated pattern or practice of statutory violations,and in not barring echostar from further use of the license.in part iv we briefly conclude.
the scheme the act created is set out in considerable detail in echostar i.we reiterate what was said there only to set the stage for the discussion that follows.
as noted,shva created a compulsory,statutory license for satellite carriers to retransmit copyrighted network programming secondary transmission for private home viewing to persons who reside in unserved households.a b i shvia defines unserved households by dividing them into five categories,the first three of which are pertinent here 
households that can not receive,through use of conventional,stationary,outdoor rooftop receiving antenna,an signal of a primary network station affiliated with that network of grade b intensity as defined by the federal communications commission under section a of title of the code of federal regulations,as in effect on january.id.d a.
households that receive a waiver from each network station affiliated with a particular network that is predicted to deliver a grade b or better signal to the subscriber residence.id.d b,a,a b.
households that a receive a signal of less than grade a intensity for a particular network and b received satellite service of that network signals on october,or had such service terminated for shva ineligibility between july,and october,grandfathered subscribers.id.d c,e 
anticipating that litigation would ensue over whether households are served or unserved,congress,as part of the shvia amendment,instructed that the courts may use two methods to resolve the issue the accurate measurements method and the accurate predictive model.the accurate measurements method requires actual physical measurements to determine the strength of the television station signal at the subscriber residence.id.a b ii ii.these measurements must follow the procedures elaborated in and,including measuring the signal intensity at a minimum of five locations as close as possible to the specific site where the site receiving antenna is located.d ii.the accurate predictive model for determining signal intensity is the individual location illr model set forth by the federal communications commission.a b ii i if used,the illr model permits the satellite carrier to avoid having to make physical measurements of the signal intensity at a subscriber residence by allowing the carrier to establish presumptively that a household can not receive at least a grade b signal and is therefore unserved.see a b ii i echostar i,at.but illr determinations are nothing more than is ultimately based on the signal strength a household actually receives,as measured by testing.see a b ii i indicating that the illr model is to be used i n determining presumptively whether a person resides in an unserved household,at.joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference c ourts should rely on the fcc illr model to presumptively determine whether a household is capable of receiving a signal of grade b intensity t he ultimate determination of eligibility to receive network signals shall be a signal intensity test pursuant to d,as reflected in new section c of the communications act of.
the act makes abundantly clear that it is the satellite carrier who bears the burden of proving that its subscribers are,in fact,unserved.a d plaintiff network stations have no obligation to put on any evidence demonstrating a violation of the terms of the statutory license.to the extent networks put on affirmative evidence of ineligibility,a satellite carrier can not simply rebut or impeach that evidence.the satellite carrier must provide additional evidence that its challenged subscribers are unserved.thus,a satellite carrier may be found to have violated the act even if a court does not find that its subscribers are served.a violation occurs so long as a carrier does not satisfy its burden of proving that its subscribers are unserved.
the act contemplates two categories of violations as it relates to the secondary transmission of distant network service to served households individual violations and pattern s of violations.an individual violation occurs where there is a willful or repeated secondary transmission to a subscriber who is not eligible to receive the transmission under this section.id.a a.a district court has broad discretion to remedy such violation s.see id.a pattern of violations arises where a satellite carrier engages in a willful or repeated pattern or practice of delivering distant network service to subscribers who are not eligible to receive the transmission under this section.id.a b.the act grants a court no discretion in its choice of remedy for a pattern or practice of violations upon finding such a pattern or practice,the act instructs that the court shall order a permanent injunction barring the secondary transmission by the satellite carrier,for private home viewing,of the primary transmissions of any primary network station affiliated with the same network,and the court may order statutory damages of not to exceed for each period during which the pattern or practice was carried out.id.a b i 
despite not having the burden of proof at trial,plaintiffs presented affirmative evidence,in the form of expert testimony from jules cohen as well as illr analyses of echostar subscribers at various points in time,tending to demonstrate that echostar has provided,and continues to provide,distant network service to ineligible households.echostar responded with the testimony of company executives,as well as that of charles jackson,an expert whose testimony was intended to criticize plaintiffs expert testimony and whom the court determined lacked credibility.cbs broad,d at.the court specifically and correctly noted that merely impeaching the plaintiffs affirmative evidence would be insufficient given defendant statutory burden.id.at.after evaluating the evidence presented by the parties,the court made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law 
findings of fact 
echostar history of compliance procedures 
from march to july,echostar offered distant network programming through an agreement with another satellite provider,primetime joint venture.primetime utilized a subjective method of determining subscriber eligibility based simply on a potential subscriber qualitative evaluation of her television signal.in,the united states district court for the southern district of florida issued first a preliminary,then a permanent injunction requiring primetime to terminate the delivery of distant network signals to subscribers who had been signed up using this subjective method.days after the entry of the injunction,echostar terminated its agreement with primetime and canceled its subscribers primetime distant network programming packages.echostar then switched virtually all subscribers to new,distant network programming packages.
after echostar terminated its relationship with primetime,it began evaluating eligibility through a system referred to as the method.under this system,each zip code was designated as either a or a zip code based on predicted signal strength.a household in a area was presumptively ineligible for service.echostar claims that it refused to sign up subscribers who lived in zip codes unless the subscribers obtained a valid waiver from the network station.the district court found,however,that echostar presented no real evidence that its determination of whether zip codes were or areas was reasonably calculated to prevent signups of ineligible subscribers.additionally,the court found that echostar customer service representatives were able to override the is,even if a subscriber was in a zip code,a customer service representative still had discretion to sign up that subscriber for distant network programming.
echostar began using the illr model to determine subscriber eligibility in.echostar illr methodology involved the following three relevant factors first,until october,echostar utilized a dma rule by which it only used the illr model to consider the signal strength of network stations in a given household designated market area dma.in other words,even if a household received a grade b or higher signal from network stations outside a household dma,echostar would consider it potentially unserved.additionally,echostar included interference in its illr analyses until january finally,echostar utilized and continues to use two and its illr analysis.so long as one vendor indicates that a household can not receive a grade b signal,echostar considers the household to be unserved 
the district court found that recently,echostar has taken significant measures to ensure compliance with the act.customer service representatives are trained and are no longer able to override system determinations of subscriber ineligibility.additionally,echostar uses a backup compliance system and,on a monthly basis,reanalyzes all new subscribers to ensure eligibility.echostar terminates distant network programming to any subscribers found to be ineligible.
analysis of echostar subscriber base 
plaintiffs presented analyses of echostar subscriber lists at different points in time.the analyses were supervised and explained by plaintiffs expert witness,jules cohen.
primetime subscribers 
in an effort to dissuade the district court from issuing the original injunction in this case,echostar ceo,charles ergen,made a formal pledge under penalty of perjury in september.in that pledge,he promised that for each of the subscribers that had originally been signed up for echostar distant network programming using the subjective primetime method,echostar would determine if they were served or unserved using the illr method and terminate all ineligible subscribers.to comply with this promise,echostar submitted a list of its primetime subscribers to decisionmark,an illr vendor,for an illr analysis.echostar received the analysis the following month.
the analysis revealed that of the total subscribers signed up for distant network programming with echostar pursuant to the agreement with primetime,the percentages of grade a subscribers were abc,cbs,fox,and nbc these totals amount to more than former primetime subscribers approximately of the total who were predicted to receive a grade a signal from at least one of the four networks.contrary to ergen promise,the district court found no evidence that echostar terminated service to any of these subscribers for purposes.cbs,d at.
subscribers 
the district court found that during the period in which echostar utilized the methodology,it signed up a substantial number of subscribers in the ineligible zip codes.for example,between november and march echostar signed up subscribers for cbs distant network programming and subscribers for fox distant network programming.an illr analysis of this group of subscribers shows that are predicted to receive a grade b or better signal of the cbs distant programming subscribers signed up during this period,were predicted to receive at least a grade b signal and were predicted to receive a grade a signal.id.at.
september subscriber list 
along with its submission of primetime subscribers,echostar submitted a list of all of its distant network receiving subscribers as of september.the results were no more encouraging.of its distant network subscribers,were predicted to receive a grade a signal for abc,for cbs,for fox and for nbc.an additional for abc,for cbs,for fox,and for nbc were predicted to receive a grade b signal.as of september,of echostar distant network subscribers subscribers,regardless of the compliance method used to enroll them,were predicted to receive a grade a signal from at least one of the four networks.the district court found no evidence that echostar,despite receiving the analysis in october,terminated any of the grade a subscribers for compliance reasons.id.at.
april subscriber list 
during the course of discovery,echostar provided the plaintiffs with a list of its subscribers as of april.plaintiffs submitted the list for illr analysis under cohen supervision.this analysis showed that hundreds of thousands of echostar distant network programming subscribers are predicted to receive signals of grade a or of the abc subscribers,were predicted to receive a grade b or better signal from an abc station of those were grade of the cbs subscribers,were predicted to receive a grade b or better signal from a cbs station of those were grade of the fox subscribers,were predicted to receive a grade b or better signal from a fox station of those were grade of the nbc subscribers,were predicted to receive a grade b or better signal from an nbc station of those were grade id.at 
conclusions of 
the district court concluded that echostar has failed to meet its burden of proving that its subscribers are unserved households,within the meaning of the act.id.at the court noted that,after a trial in which echostar presented no illr analysis or signal intensity measurements,echostar had failed to prove that any of its subscribers can not receive a network signal of at least grade b strength.id.moreover,the court found fault with echostar illr methodology.id.at.first it found the dma rule to be an improper method to ensure compliance with the act.additionally,it found that echostar use of interference in its illr model from may to january was improper finally,the court found that echostar past and present use of two illr vendors,whereby echostar always chooses the vendor that designates a subscriber as unserved whenever there is a discrepancy,was,and continues to be,unlawful.
the court also found that echostar has not met its burden in showing that any of its distant signal subscribers meet the grandfathering requirements,of section e.id.at.as previously indicated,to be eligible for grandfather status,a subscriber must have been a subscriber on october,or have had distant network service terminated pursuant to the act between july,and october,and receive a signal of less than grade a intensity.e.echostar presented no evidence that its putative grandfathered subscribers receive a signal of less than grade a intensity,no list of subscribers as of october,and no list of subscribers terminated,for act compliance reasons,between july,and october.more importantly,echostar did present testimony that it does not have a list of its subscribers as of october.cbs,d at.thus,because echostar had not demonstrated that any of its subscribers were eligible for grandfather status,and conceded that it did not have the data necessary ever so to prove,the court refused to acknowledge any alleged grandfather subscribers as eligible,id.at,and held that echostar subscribers are no longer entitled to grandfather status,id.at 
finally,the district court concluded that echostar failed to prove that any of its subscribers are eligible because they have obtained waivers from the relevant network stations,pursuant to a.id.at.echostar again made use of its dma rule in this context and only sought waivers from stations in a subscriber dma.because echostar did not consider subscribers who received grade b or stronger signals from stations outside the subscribers dma to be served,they did not seek waivers from those stations.the court,however,concluded that f or a particular household to have a valid waiver with respect to a particular network,it is necessary to obtain a waiver from every station affiliated with that network that the illr model predicts to deliver a grade b signal to the household.id.thus,because echostar did not present evidence that it had obtained waivers from all relevant stations,the court held that echostar did not carry its burden of proving that any of its subscribers were unserved on account of valid waivers.id.
as a result of these findings,the district court concluded that echostar conduct and failure to satisfy its statutory burden amounted to a willful or repeated copyright infringement,which was actionable pursuant to a a.id.at the court declined,however,to find that echostar engaged in a pattern or practice of violations.according to the act,upon such a finding,the court shall order a permanent injunction barring the satellite carrier from providing distant network service of any network station affiliated with the network.a b i.the court did not find it necessary to determine conclusively whether echostar had ever engaged in a pattern or practice of violations,because no such pattern or practice currently exists which would warrant such an extreme sanction.id.at.accordingly,the court crafted an injunction designed to remedy the willful or repeated individual violations of the act.id.at.
both echostar and plaintiffs appealed.we address echostar appeal before moving on to the plaintiffs claim that echostar engaged in a pattern or practice of violations and,as a result,the district court was obligated by the statute to issue a permanent,nationwide injunction.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its interpretation of the shva de novo.see united states pistone,cir the interpretation of a statute is a question of law subject to de novo review.a in all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury f indings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.
in this appeal,echostar has alleged a staggering seventeen claims of error despite echostar apparent characterization of the trial as one of gross mismanagement,utter incompetence,and widespread chaos,we find the district court orders and opinions to be generally thoughtful,careful,and.we applaud the court efforts in dealing with a complicated,technical in spite of,rather than with the aid of,defendant cooperation.we find the vast majority of echostar claims to be completely without merit and address those briefly in the margin 
echostar illr methodology 
echostar claims that the district court erred in its interpretation of the act and its application to three components of echostar illr methodology.although we reject echostar first two arguments,we agree that the act does not proscribe the use of multiple vendors.because this determination has no bearing on echostar failure to carry its statutory burden of proof,it does not impact the ultimate disposition of this case.
echostar claims that,contrary to the district court determination,the act endorses the dma rule.thus,echostar contends that so long as the network station in a household dma does not provide a grade b or better signal,the household is properly considered unserved.the district court concluded,however,that if a household receives any signal of grade b or better,regardless of its source,the household is served with respect to that network.we agree with the district court interpretation of the act.
the act defines unserved household with respect to a given network as one that can not receive an signal of a primary network station affiliated with that network of grade b intensity.d a emphasis added.the definition is not limited to the primary network station in the household dma.it refers to the signal of any network station.the plain meaning of the statute is not altered by echostar oblique reference to j definition of local market,which is somehow supposed to shed light on the meaning of local service area as used in e.not only is this unconvincing,it is unnecessary given the clear language of the statute.thus,we agree with the district court that echostar use of the dma rule was in violation of the act.
use of interference 
echostar also objects to the district court conclusion that the use of interference in the illr model was improper after may.we agree with the district court resolution of this issue.as the court noted,in may,the fcc issued a first report and order that made modifications to the illr model and provided a cookbook describing how the model was supposed to be run.a prior cookbook had included interference,but the may and july cookbooks specifically and clearly omitted it.after the shvia amendment,the act permits use of the illr model set forth by the fcc,as that model may be amended by the commission to increase the accuracy of that model.a b ii i accordingly,the use of any illr method that does not comply with the specific procedures the fcc establishes for the model can not be said to conform to the act requirements.therefore,because echostar model included interference and thereby did not conform to the fcc specifications,it did not comply with the act and the district court could have determined that the model provided no presumptive evidence of eligibility.
use of two vendors 
echostar claims that it was error to hold that the act prohibits the use of multiple illr vendors in assessing subscriber eligibility.the district court concluded that echostar could have chosen either of these two competent vendors to check the illr status of its subscribers,cbs,d at,but because echostar used both vendors to exploit inconsistencies between the two,it acted unlawfully.we find nothing in the act to support this conclusion.the statute provides that i n determining presumptively whether a person resides in an unserved household,a court shall rely on the illr model set forth by the fcc.a b ii i.so long as a satellite carrier uses vendors whose models comply with the fcc illr guidelines,the carrier may utilize as many different vendors as it would like.we note,however,that the illr model is only a presumptive determination of eligibility,and the satellite carrier bears the ultimate burden of proving that a household is unserved.unless there is evidence that one model is more accurate than,in this case,echostar witnesses did not the models produce conflicting results,it would be difficult to conclude that a satellite carrier has satisfied its burden of proof.in such circumstances it would likely be necessary to obtain an accurate measurement pursuant to section a b ii ii to demonstrate subscriber eligibility thus,while echostar use of two illr vendors may negatively affect its ability to satisfy its burden,it is not necessarily unlawful to do so.
retroactive application and present eligibility 
finally,echostar argues that shvia illr provisions either do not apply retroactively to customers signed up before shvia was passed,or if they do apply retroactively,they do so in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.relatedly,echostar argues that the district court erred by interpreting the act to imply an obligation upon satellite carriers to constantly and subscribers each time the model changes or the model input,such as station power or antenna direction,changes.we address these arguments separately.
echostar contends that any requirement that it qualify its subscribers by an illr model can not be applied to subscribers who signed up prior to the incorporation of the illr provisions into the act.so applying the shvia amendment,according to echostar,would be unconstitutionally retroactive.we do not see how this could possibly be so.neither the act nor the district court opinion imposes any requirement that echostar ever use an illr model in any way.all the act has ever that echostar subscribers be unserved.the definition of an unserved household was originally,and continues to be,a household that can not receive,through the use of a conventional outdoor rooftop receiving antenna,an signal of grade b intensity as defined by the federal communications commission of a primary network station affiliated with that network.pub,tit.ii,stat,d a.prior to the shvia amendments,courts may or may not have regarded illr results as presumptive indications of signal strength.the amendment simply made that presumption clear.but the touchstone of eligibility has always been whether a given household actually receives a grade b or stronger network signal.by incorporating the illr into the act,congress gave satellite carriers a relatively cheap and convenient method of presumptively establishing eligibility.it allowed the satellite carriers to satisfy its burden of could then be rebutted if the network station performed an actual testing at every household.to the extent the illr model exposed households that were previously considered unserved as served,those households were never actually entitled to service.as such,shvia did not apply a retroactive obligation on satellite carriers.rather it provided an evidentiary tool to enable the carriers to prove what it was always required to prove.
echostar raises a related but distinct concern it does not believe that the act imposes an obligation to and subscribers once they have already been qualified according to echostar,so long as a subscriber is eligible apparently,presumptively or actually upon,the subscriber is always and forever eligible.we do not interpret the act to impose such a requirement.to begin,we note that the act is drafted in the present tense,without qualification it limits the license to transmissions to persons who reside in unserved households.a b i emphasis added see also id.a b ii i prescribing use of illr model to determin e presumptively whether a person resides in an unserved household emphasis added id.a b ii ii providing for use of measurements to determine whether a person resides in an unserved household emphasis added.the clear indication is that a person must always reside in an unserved household,not just initially.
we recognize the possibility,however,that a person can be said to be residing in an unserved household,regardless of current conditions,if a household were deemed forever unserved so long as it met the eligibility requirements at.we therefore look to the definition of unserved household.all three relevant definitions refer to present criteria either a household that can not receive a grade b signal is subject to a waiver or does not receive a signal of grade a intensity and otherwise qualifies for grandfathered status.id.d emphasis added.none of these definitions refer to,despite the ease with which congress could have included such a qualification if that had been its intention.
we note,moreover,that there is no requirement that network stations challenge a subscriber at the time of or any specified period of time thereafter.echostar interpretation,however,would either transform the illr model into de facto conclusive evidence of eligibility because it would be difficult to rebut the presumption with an actual measurement done at a later time if eligibility referred only to eligibility at or force networks to perform measurements for every subscriber at the time of latter being a requirement that appears nowhere in the act.accordingly,we conclude that the act imposes a requirement that a household be presently unserved,not unserved solely at,as echostar suggests.
of echostar seventeen claims of error,we find only the district court determination that the act proscribes the use of multiple illr vendors to be incorrect.because we do not believe this decision had any effect on echostar inability to demonstrate that it has not willfully or repeatedly infringed upon plaintiffs,as we discuss,infra,on our determination that echostar engaged in a pattern or practice of do not need to remand for any reconsideration in light of this conclusion.
before we move on to plaintiffs,we pause briefly to comment on defendant approach.while it is not normally the place for courts to second guess the strategic decisions of counsel,we do note that,here,echostar may have been better served by focusing on and developing its serious objections,as opposed to its scattershot approach that ultimately wasted limited space on patently unmeritorious claims of error.
plaintiffs also appealed,challenging the district court conclusion that,because echostar is not currently engaging in a pattern or practice of violations,it was not obligated to issue a nationwide permanent injunction prescribed by the statute echostar contends that the district court ruling was permissible because the court retained a measure of discretion not to issue the permanent injunction despite the mandatory language in the statute.echostar also suggests that the remedy does not apply so long as it is not currently engaging in a pattern or practice of violations.we disagree with both contentions.because we come to the inescapable conclusion,based on the district court findings,that echostar did engage in a pattern or practice of violations,we find that the district court erred in not entering a permanent injunction.
requirements for pattern or practice liability 
according to the act 
if a satellite carrier engages in a willful or repeated pattern or practice of delivering a primary transmission made by a network station to subscribers who are not eligible to receive the transmission,then if the pattern or practice has been carried out on a substantially nationwide basis,the court shall order a permanent injunction barring the secondary transmission by the satellite carrier,for private home viewing,of the primary transmissions of any primary network station affiliated with the same network 
a b i.the act itself provides no further explanation as to what constitutes a pattern or practice,except to indicate that it can occur on a nationwide,regional,or local scale.see id.at a b i,ii.we find some guidance,however,in the legislative history of the act 
it is not the intent of this statute to subject a satellite carrier to pattern or practice liability as a result of good faith mistakes,provided that the carrier is reasonably diligent in avoiding and correcting violations through an internal compliance program that includes methods of confirmation of household eligibility 
in view of the possibilities for error which would occur despite reasonably diligent efforts to avoid them,it is the intent of this statute that no pattern or practice be found if less than of the subscribers to a particular network station on either local,regional,or national bases are found ineligible.
i,at,reprinted in,see also cbs broad.primetime joint venture,d.thus,while the statute itself does not automatically impose pattern or practice liability where the threshold is met,nor does it preclude a finding of pattern or practice where the threshold is not reached,we believe the ineligibility proportion to be a relevant marker for pattern or practice analysis.
echostar would have us forgo even this preliminary inquiry of whether a pattern or practice ever existed because the district court found that no pattern or practice currently exists,cbs broad,d at,and echostar reads the act to impose a requirement of an ongoing pattern or practice before section a b i is triggered.it reads the statutory language,i f a satellite carrier engages in a willful or repeated pattern or practice,a b emphasis added,as foreclosing application of the section so long as a satellite carrier ceases most of its illegal activity,presumably anytime before the close of trial.we do not believe this is the best reading of the statute.rather than imposing an obligation on the networks to identify violations,bring suit,conduct discovery,and complete a full trial,all before the satellite carrier decides to become shva read the statute as imposing liability i f a satellite carrier ever engages in a willful or repeated pattern or practice of statutory violations.id.the moment a satellite carrier engages in what can be said to be a pattern or practice of violations,it makes itself eligible for the specified remedy,regardless of when it is found to have been doing so,indicating that the crime for perjury occurs where a duly sworn individual states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true but not requiring a defendant to be stat ing or subscrib ing at the time of his perjury trial.
we also note that there is no requirement that a court find that the satellite carrier engage in a pattern or practice of actually providing distant network service to served households.this is again a function of the statutory burden of proof.while we do not find it particularly intuitive to think of a satellite carrier as engaging in pattern or practice of failing to prove that its subscribers are unserved,we have but little choice.the statute specifically mandates that i n any action brought under this paragraph,the satellite carrier has the burden of proof.id.a d emphasis added.a requirement that a satellite carrier actually engaged in a pattern or practice of serving served households is inconsistent with that burden allocation.accordingly,we presume,for the purpose of evaluating pattern or practice liability,that a finding that a satellite carrier failed to carry its burden of establishing eligibility is tantamount to a finding of ineligibility.section a b liability is triggered whenever a satellite carrier fails to carry its burden of proving eligibility on a sufficient scale,and to a sufficient degree,such that we can presume that the satellite carrier is engaging in a pattern or practice of serving ineligible subscribers.
echostar engage in a pattern or practice 
based on these guidelines,we now must determine if echostar ever engaged in a pattern or practice of statutory violations.because the district court found echostar current practices to be substantially compliant,it did not believe it necessary to determine if echostar prior conduct constituted a pattern or practice of violations.see cbs,d at.ordinarily we would remand to the district court to make this determination in the first instance.we believe,however,that there is no other possible conclusion that can be drawn from the district court findings of fact.
we first note the length of time over which the district court found echostar to be using inadequate procedures for assessing subscriber eligibility.when echostar first began offering its own distant network packages in july,it utilized the method for which the district court found no evidence that would indicate that it was reasonably calculated to prevent signups of ineligible subscribers.id.at.even after echostar switched to the illr model,it utilized the illegitimate dma rule through october,and unlawfully considered interference from at least august through january.in other words,at no point from when echostar began offering distant network programming through january did it use a compliance method capable of reliably assessing subscriber eligibility 
this year period of unlawful eligibility screening predictably led to a sizeable number of subscribers for whom echostar was unable to establish eligibility.we start with the illr analysis of echostar april subscriber list.the best case scenario,which takes as valid echostar claims of waivers and grandfathered status the same ones regarding which the district court found echostar failed to carry its burden of establishing,indicates that,on a nationwide basis,echostar is presumptively providing illegal service to of its subscribers receiving abc distant network programming,for cbs,for fox,and for nbc.thus,even for the network with the lowest percentage of violations,factoring in claims of eligibility that the district court found not to have been established,echostar exceeds the threshold on a nationwide basis.while we believe this may very well be sufficiently objectionable,we glean some additional inculpatory conclusions from the district court opinion the court finds that echostar has failed to meet its burden of proving that its subscribers are unserved households.id.at echostar has failed to present any evidence that any of its subscribers are unserved as defined under shva.id.at t he court findings support the conclusion that hundreds of thousands of echostar distant network programming subscribers are not unserved households.id.at plaintiff evidence indicates that a significant percentage of echostar distant network programming subscribers receive a signal of grade b intensity or better.id.at echostar has not met its burden in showing that any of its distant signal subscribers meet the grandfathering requirements.id.at echostar has also failed to prove that any of its subscribers are eligible because they have obtained waivers from the relevant network stations.id.at.if these findings do not describe a pattern or practice of violations,we do not know what does.abc,primetime joint venture,cir since primetime could prove that virtually none of its thousands of subscribers in the market was eligible for satellite service,the district court we the carrier had engaged in a pattern or practice of infringement.
as if the magnitude of its ineligible subscriber base were insufficiently disconcerting,we have found no indication that echostar was ever interested in complying with the act.indeed,based on the district court findings,we seem to have discerned a pattern and practice of violating the act in every way imaginable.whether it be overriding compliance determinations of ineligibility more than red zone subscribers per month,cbs,d at making pledges under oath to terminate ineligible subscribers and then failing to present any evidence that this corrective action was taken,id.at blatantly disregarding fcc alterations to the illr model after it was specifically put on notice of such changes,id.at or failing to disconnect subscribers it initially recognized to be ineligible for grandfather status based on an atextual reinterpretation of the statutory provision,id.at echostar has disregarded the limitations of its statutory license and sought to avoid its obligations under the act at every turn.accordingly,we have no trouble concluding that echostar has engaged in a nationwide pattern or practice of delivering a primary transmission made by a network station to subscribers who are not eligible to receive the transmission under this section.a b.
mandatory nature of the remedy 
the act instructs that,upon a finding of a pattern or practice of violations,a court shall order a permanent injunction barring the secondary transmission by the satellite carrier,for private home viewing,of the primary transmissions of any primary network station affiliated with the same network.a b i emphasis added.despite the facially mandatory nature of the provision,echostar argues that the district court had discretion to issue the injunction,and properly exercised that discretion in not issuing the injunction in this case.in making this argument,echostar relies primarily on hecht bowles,for the proposition that,if congress is going to remove courts traditional equitable discretion,an unequivocal statement of its purpose would have been made.at.at see also id.at.at we do not believe that such a major departure from that long tradition as is here proposed should be lightly implied.we believe there are important differences between the statute in hecht and the one before us that lead us to conclude that congress removed courts discretion upon a finding of a pattern or practice of violations.
the hecht court interpreted section a of the emergency price control act of,et,repealed,which provided that,upon finding of certain conditions,a permanent or temporary injunction,restraining order,or other order shall be granted without bond.the court found statutory language or other order and legislative history suggesting that congress had not intended to remove courts traditional equitable discretion.at.at.unlike hecht here there is no ambiguous statutory language in the shva and we are unaware of any legislative history that would indicate that the remedial measure chosen by congress is anything but mandatory,at.the section license contains remedial provisions parallel to those of section,including a pattern or practice provision that requires termination of the section statutory license as to a particular satellite carrier if it engages in certain abuses of the license.emphasis added.moreover,section a b i itself contemplates both mandatory and discretionary remedies upon the same finding of a pattern or practice,the court shall order a permanent injunction whereas the court may order statutory damages.a b i emphasis added.absent evidence to the contrary,we presume that congress understood what it was doing when it instructed courts to provide a specific remedy and permitted courts to provide another.accordingly,we find that congress unequivocally stated a purpose to restrict the courts traditional equitable authority upon a finding of a pattern or practice.accord abc,at because,as discussed,we come to the unavoidable conclusion that echostar engaged in a pattern or practice of shva violations,we hold that the district court is required to issue a nationwide permanent injunction barring the provision of distant network programming pursuant to the act statutory license.
for the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and reversed in part,and we remand the case to the district court for the entry of a nationwide permanent injunction as mandated by the act.
so ordered.
distant network signals are network stations from outside a subscriber market area.for example,a person who lives in fort lauderdale but receives an abc,cbs,fox or nbc network station from new york city is receiving distant network programming or distant network stations.cbs,echostar commc ns,d.
in its report,the house committee on energy and commerce stated that it believes that this approach will satisfy the public interest in making available network programming in these typically rural areas,while also respecting the public interest in protecting the distribution system.ii,at,reprinted in.see also abc,primetime joint venture,cir cbs,primetime joint venture,d.
the affiliate associations are voluntary membership trade associations comprised of network stations that are affiliates with the respective networks.plaintiffs abc,abc and national broadcasting company,nbc were dismissed and are no longer parties to the case.
as of april,echostar provided satellite television services to over nine million americans,including both local network subscribers under the compulsory license in,and distant network subscribers under the act.echostar provided distant network programming to about million subscribers.
in addition to prescribing a method for determining subscriber eligibility,the court held that none of echostar current subscribers were eligible for grandfather status pursuant to e.cbs,d at.
subject to provisions not relevant here,shva as amended,states that a in general.s econdary transmissions,retransmissions of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission made by a network station shall be subject to statutory licensing under this section if the secondary transmission is made by a satellite carrier to the public for private home viewing,with regard to secondary transmissions the satellite carrier is in compliance with the rules,regulations,or authorizations of the federal communications commission governing the carriage of television broadcast station signals,and the carrier makes a direct or indirect charge for such retransmission service to each subscriber receiving the secondary transmission.b secondary transmissions to unserved households.i in statutory license provided for in subparagraph a shall be limited to secondary transmissions of the signals of no more than two network stations in a single day for each television network to persons who reside in unserved households a a,b i.shva definition of unserved households was altered by the shvia amendment.the amended definition is controlling in this case.
the fourth and fifth categories are.subscribers who receive distant signals through a satellite dish located on a commercial truck or recreational vehicle,and who satisfy the strict statutory documentation requirements.id.d d,a.subscribers who receive secondary transmissions by services of network stations that the subscriber received before any termination of such secondary transmissions before october.id.d e,a b iii.
prior to the shvia amendment,shva limited the statutory license to secondary transmissions to persons who reside in unserved households,a b west,westlaw through november,amendments,but did not set out specific ways in which a satellite carrier could demonstrate whether a household was unserved.the fcc adopted illr as a method for determining signal strength in february.see echostar i,at.
this provision states burden of any action brought under this paragraph,the satellite carrier shall have the burden of proving that its secondary transmission of a primary transmission by a network station is to a subscriber who is eligible to receive the secondary transmission under this section a d.
echostar contends that courts retain their traditional equitable discretion regardless of the act explicit limitations.as we discuss infra,we disagree.
the scope of the permanent injunction depends on the scope of the pattern or practice of violations.where the pattern or practice has been carried out on a substantially nationwide basis,the act mandates a nationwide injunction.see a b i.a local or regional pattern or practice results in a permanent injunction limited to that locality or region.see id.a b ii.
we summarize only those findings that are relevant to this appeal.
incorporating interference in the illr analysis can potentially result in weaker predicted signal strength,as the model would then factor in the predicted presence of interfering signals from other stations.
the two vendors might differ in their illr output as a result of database inaccuracies.cbs broad,d at.
we believe it is worth an unserved household is one that can not receive a grade b signal,let alone the stronger grade a variety.d a.subscribers receiving a grade a signal are not even eligible for gran
