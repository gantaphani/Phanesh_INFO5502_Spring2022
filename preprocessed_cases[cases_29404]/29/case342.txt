cable and satellite companies are required to pay royalties into a common fund when they retransmit certain copyrighted television broadcasts.to collect from the fund,copyright owners must file claims with the copyright office annually during the month of july.in,studios mgm and universal city studios had their claims rejected as untimely because they could not produce a stamped postal receipt showing that the claims,which were received at the copyright office in august,had been mailed in july.the studios challenged the rejections in the district court and now appeal a grant of summary judgment for the copyright office.we affirm.
congress has established a compulsory licensing scheme for broadcast copyrighted material that is retransmitted by cable and satellite companies.see,ass of broadcasters librarian of congress,summarizing statutory framework.under this arrangement,cable and satellite companies are permitted to retransmit broadcasts of television programming,provided that they deposit royalty fees with the copyright office for eventual distribution to copyright owners.copyright owners,in turn,must file their claims for royalties d uring the month of july in each year and in accordance with requirements that the librarian of congress shall prescribe by regulation.id.d a,b a.royalties are distributed proportionally by means of settlement agreements among the various claimants or arbitration.see distribution of and cable royalty fund.
copyright office regulations specify that a claim will be considered timely if the claim was actually received by the office during july,or bears a july postmark and was sent via the united states postal service.a.the regulations also expressly state that c laims dated only with a business meter that are received after july,will not be accepted as having been timely filed.id.c.there is an exception to that provision,however,specifying that if a claim was sent using certified mail return receipt requested and the claimant can produce a mailing receipt bearing a july postal service date stamp,the claim will be accepted as being timely filed.id.e.the regulations provide that n o affidavit of an officer or employee of the claimant,or of a postal worker will be accepted in lieu of the receipt.id.
the facts at issue are straightforward.mgm and universal are film and television production studios based in southern california.mgm royalty claims for the year arrived at the copyright office on august.the envelope was sent by certified mail and bore only a stamp from a pitney bowes business postage meter.universal claims arrived the next day,also by certified mail and bearing only a pitney bowes postage meter stamp.both studios estimate the value of their claims in the millions of dollars.
the studios heard nothing from the copyright office until november,when each received word that their claims would not be accepted unless they could produce a receipt with a july postal service date stamp.even at this remove,we can sense the intensity of the searches that these letters must have precipitated,but neither studio was able to locate a receipt.lacking a receipt,the studios mobilized their lawyers.they separately responded with letters arguing that their claims were timely filed because they had been mailed during july,which was all the studios understood the office rules to require.they submitted sworn statements from the employees responsible for mailing the claims,stating that the letters were mailed on july.in addition,they presented declarations from postal service employees about the normal delivery time for a letter sent from southern california to washington,three to five days and statements from pitney bowes employees attesting that the machines used by the studios are.universal later supplemented its initial submission with the results of an experiment showing that none of one hundred letters sent to washington from van nuys,california arrived in fewer than three that its own claim,which arrived on august,must have been sent during july.in the event the office interpreted its rule to require a postal receipt,each studio also requested a waiver.
the copyright office reached a final decision rejecting the studios claims on december.it interpreted its rules to require a stamped usps receipt for all claims received after the end of july that do not bear a postmark.the office dismissed the evidence submitted by the studios,pointing to the regulations express bar on considering affidavits from claimant or postal service employees in lieu of the receipt.see e.moreover,it rejected the studios waiver requests on the ground that they presented no special or unique circumstance that would warrant a waiver.letter to olson moss,at letter to tunberg,at.
the studios filed complaints in the district court alleging that the office had acted in violation of the copyright act,the administrative procedure act,and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the court found no merit to these contentions and,in two separate opinions,granted summary judgment for the office.studios,peters,d universal studios lllp peters,d.the studios appeal.
the studios present several challenges to the office rejection of their claims.first,mgm,but not universal,argues that the office has incorrectly interpreted its regulations regarding timely submission of claims.second,both studios argue that the denial of their waiver requests was arbitrary and capricious because the office has not consistently enforced its regulations regarding timely filing.third,the studios argue that the office violated due process by refusing to accept any evidence,other than a stamped postal receipt,that their claims were mailed in july.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.williams united states.
mgm argues that the office insistence on a postal receipt,and exclusion of all other evidence of a july filing,is incompatible with the copyright act and the implementing regulations.the regulations do not,it argues,categorically bar consideration of other evidence.mgm br.at.on the contrary,it maintains,the regulations specific exclusion of affidavits from claimant employees and postal workers implies that other evidence will be considered.in addition,mgm relies on the language of section e,which states that a claimant may prove proper filing by means of a stamped receipt,to argue that the requirement is only permissive and that claimants may prove proper filing by other means as well.see e.
this is quite a stretch.the rules make clear that claims arriving after july that do not bear a postmark will not be accepted unless the claimant can produce a stamped receipt.section c states the general rule very clearly claims dated only with a business meter that are received after july,will not be accepted as having been timely filed.id.c.section e provides for the one and only exception to this rule for claims without a postmark i n the event that a properly addressed and mailed claim is not timely received by the copyright office,claimants may nonetheless prove proper filing using a receipt.id.e.in other words,the rule is only permissive in that it allows claimants their one means of escaping the consequences of section c.
similarly,the provision excluding certain affidavits can not fairly be understood to imply that the copyright office is required to consider other evidence.the regulations evident purpose is to exclude precisely the kind of factual inquiry mgm seeks.see copyright arbitration royalty panels rules and regulations,the only acceptable proof of a timely filing is the certified mail return receipt bearing a postal service mark demonstrating that the mailing occurred during the relevant time period to the appropriate address.copyright arbitration royalty panels,postmark requirement provides a bright line test which should end all questions of fact regarding the timeliness of the claim.the express exclusion of the sort of evidence most likely to be submitted in lieu of a from opening the door to other evidentiary simply a way to make assurance double sure.william shakespeare,macbeth act,sc.
