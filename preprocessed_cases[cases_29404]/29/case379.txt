celebrities have a statutory right of publicity by which they can prohibit others from using their likeness.an obvious tension exists between this right of publicity and the first amendment to the united states constitution.comedy iii productions,gary saderup,cal th,d,comedy iii.in comedy iii,we considered when constitutional free speech rights may trump the statutory right of publicity.we formulated what is essentially a balancing test between the first amendment and the right of publicity based on whether the work in question adds significant creative elements so as to be transformed into something more than a mere celebrity likeness or imitation.id.at,d.in that case,we concluded that lithographs and bearing the likeness of the three stooges were not sufficiently transformative to receive first amendment protection.
in this case,we apply the same balancing test to comic books containing characters that evoke musician brothers johnny and edgar winter.we conclude that,in contrast to a drawing of the three stooges,the comic books do contain significant creative elements that transform them into something more than mere celebrity likenesses.accordingly,the comic books are entitled to first amendment protection.
facts and procedural history 
in the,dc comics published a comic miniseries featuring jonah hex,a fictional comic book.the series contains an outlandish plot,involving giant creatures,singing cowboys,and the wilde west ranch and music and culture emporium,named for and patterned after the life of oscar wilde.the third volume ends with a reference to two new characters,the autumn brothers,and the teaser,next the autumns of our discontent.the cover of volume depicts the autumn brother characters,with pale faces and long white hair.see,post the autumn brothers are the two lower figures.one brother wears a stovepipe hat and red sunglasses,and holds a rifle.the second has red eyes and holds a pistol.this volume is entitled,autumns of our discontent,and features brothers johnny and edgar autumn,depicted as villainous,offspring born from the rape of their mother by a supernatural worm creature that had escaped from a hole in the ground.at the end of volume,jonah hex and his companions shoot and kill the autumn brothers in an underground gun battle.
plaintiffs,johnny and edgar winter,performing and recording musicians originally from texas,sued dc comics and others alleging several causes of action including,as relevant here,appropriation of their names and likenesses under civil code section.they alleged that the defendants selected the names johnny and edgar autumn to signal readers the winter brothers were being portrayed that the autumn brothers were drawn with long white hair and albino features similar to plaintiffs that the johnny autumn character was depicted as wearing a tall black top hat similar to the one johnny winter often wore and that the title of volume,autumns of our discontent,refers to the famous shakespearian phrase,the winter of our discontent.they also alleged that the comics falsely portrayed them as vile,depraved,stupid,cowardly,subhuman individuals who engage in wanton acts of violence,murder and bestiality for pleasure and who should be killed.
defendants moved for summary judgment,partly relying on the first amendment.the trial court granted summary judgment on all causes of action and entered judgment in defendants favor.the court of appeal originally affirmed the judgment.we granted review and held the matter pending our decision in comedy iii,supra,cal th,d.later,we remanded the matter for the court of appeal to reconsider its decision in light of comedy iii.this time,the court of appeal affirmed the summary adjudication of all causes of action other than the one for misappropriation of likeness.on the misappropriation cause of action,the court concluded that triable issues of fact exist whether or not the comic books are entitled to protection under the test adopted in comedy iii.it reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings on that cause of action.
we granted the defendants petition for review to decide whether the comic books are protected under the comedy iii transformative test.
ii.discussion 
civil code section provides as relevant a any person who knowingly uses another name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner,on or in products,merchandise,or goods,or for purposes of advertising or selling,or soliciting purchases of,products,merchandise,goods or services,without such person prior consent shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof.
in comedy iii,supra,cal th,d,the registered owner of all rights to the former comedy act known as the three stooges sued an artist who,without permission,sold lithographs and bearing a likeness of the three stooges reproduced from a charcoal drawing the artist had made we noted that the right of publicity threatens two purposes of the first amendment preserving an uninhibited marketplace of ideas and furthering the individual right of.because celebrities take on public meaning,the appropriation of their likenesses may have important uses in uninhibited debate on public issues,particularly debates about culture and values.and because celebrities take on personal meanings to many individuals in the society,the creative appropriation of celebrity images can be an important avenue of individual expression.comedy iii,supra,at,d.t he very importance of celebrities in society means that the right of publicity has the potential of censoring significant expression by suppressing alternative versions of celebrity images that are iconoclastic,irreverent,or otherwise attempt to redefine the celebrity meaning.citations.the right of publicity derived from public prominence does not confer a shield to ward off caricature,parody and satire.rather,prominence invites creative comment,quoting with approval guglielmi productions cal d,conc.opn.of bird.
accordingly,we held that some,although not all,uses of celebrity likenesses are entitled to first amendment protection.when artistic expression takes the form of a literal depiction or imitation of a celebrity for commercial gain,directly trespassing on the right of publicity without adding significant expression beyond that trespass,the state law interest in protecting the fruits of artistic labor outweighs the expressive interests of the imitative artist.comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.thus,depictions of celebrities amounting to little more than the appropriation of the celebrity economic value are not protected expression under the first amendment.id.at,d.the holder may still enforce the right to monopolize the production of conventional,more or less fungible,images of the celebrity.id.at,d.on the other hand,when a work contains significant transformative elements,it is not only especially worthy of first amendment protection,but it is also less likely to interfere with the economic interest protected by the right of publicity w orks of parody or other distortions of the celebrity figure are not,from the celebrity fan viewpoint,good substitutes for conventional depictions of the celebrity and therefore do not generally threaten markets for celebrity memorabilia that the right of publicity is designed to protect.ibid.
we developed a test to determine whether a work merely appropriates a celebrity economic value,and thus is not entitled to first amendment protection,or has been transformed into a creative product that the first amendment protects.the inquiry is whether the celebrity likeness is one of the raw materials from which an original work is synthesized,or whether the depiction or imitation of the celebrity is the very sum and substance of the work in question.we ask,in other words,whether a product containing a celebrity likeness is so transformed that it has become primarily the defendant own expression rather than the celebrity likeness.and when we use the word expression,we mean expression of something other than the likeness of the celebrity.comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d.these transformative elements or creative contributions that require firs
