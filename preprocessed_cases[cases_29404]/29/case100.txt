plaintiff john jorgensen jorgensen,pro se,appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york john keenan,judge,dated september,granting the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissing jorgensen copyright infringement case in its entirety.the district court found that jorgensen had not presented sufficient evidence of access to support his claim of copyright infringement,jorgensen had not shown a reasonable opportunity by the allegedly infringing songwriters to hear and copy jorgensen unpublished song.see jorgensen records,civ,wl.
we agree with the district court that evidence of corporate receipt of unsolicited work is insufficient to raise a triable issue of access where there is no evidence of any connection between the individual recipients of the protected work and the alleged infringers.as to defendants careers bmg music publishing,songs of nashville dreamworks,and publishing,jorgensen failed to introduce evidence of any such nexus indeed,those defendants introduced uncontroverted evidence to the contrary.as such,we affirm the district court ruling that jorgensen failed to raise a triable issue of access as to those defendants.
with respect to defendants famous music corporation,fox film music,blue sky rider songs,and sony music entertainment improperly sued as records,however,we find that jorgensen did proffer sufficient evidence of a connection between the recipients of his recordings and the alleged infringers to make the grant of summary judgment on the issue of access inappropriate at this stage of the proceedings.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court as to defendants famous music corporation,fox film music,blue sky rider songs,and sony music entertainment and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
jorgensen,a musician and songwriter,wrote and copyrighted a song entitled long lost lover lover that he claims has been infringed upon by the songs my heart will go on heart and amazed.written by james horner and will jennings,and sung by celine dion,heart was the academy theme song for the blockbuster movie titanic.defendants famous music corporation,fox film music and blue sky rider songs are the three of heart,and defendant sony music entertainment sony manufactured and distributed the titanic soundtrack these defendants are collectively referred to as the heart defendants in this opinion.
amazed,a song written by chris lindsey,aimee mayo and marv green,was recorded by the country music group lonestar and released on their album lonely grill.defendants careers bmg music publishing bmg,songs of nashville dreamworks,and publishing collectively the amazed defendants are music publishing companies that administer the publishing rights to amazed.
jorgensen asserts two primary theories by which he hypothesizes that the writers of heart and amazed had access to,and copied his song,lover i through his unsolicited mass mailings of lover to a multitude of entertainment companies listed in industry songwriter market books,including the defendants and ii through actual receipt of his mailings by two executives at two of the defendant companies,bmg and sony jorgensen has not named the writers of either song as defendants in this suit.
after discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that jorgensen had failed to adduce any evidence to support these theories of access.in particular,the defendants argued that,with the two exceptions noted below,jorgensen had made no showing that any of the defendants ever actually received his submission.even where jorgensen established actual receipt,the defendants asserted that there was no evidence that jorgensen song had been forwarded to the writers of amazed or heart,or to any other third party.in addition,the defendants argued that jorgensen never had any contact with the writers of either amazed or heart,and that jorgensen had no evidence that the writers of either song would ever have received any tapes of unsolicited material from any of the companies to which jorgensen sent copies of lover.
bruce pollock,a managing producer at a bmg division that has no connection with the music publishing company,submitted a sworn declaration in which he admitted having received a compact disc copy of lover from jorgensen.pollock stated,however,that he did not give the cd to anyone at any time,including the writers of amazed whom he did not know and had never met.
harvey leeds,a vice president at sony responsible for reviewing touring budgets for sony artists,also admitted during his deposition that he had received a few tapes from jorgensen but stated that he did not listen to them,and had assumed they were thrown away.leeds also testified that he did not know the heart songwriters.
based on this evidence from pollock and leeds and because jorgensen did not produce any cover letters or other correspondence to the defendants indicating to whom or when he sent his other mailings of lover,the district court held that jorgensen could not establish that the authors of either amazed or heart had a reasonable opportunity to hear his unpublished work.wl,at without more proof of access than has been demonstrated,jorgensen case can not proceed.the court held that bare corporate receipt of jorgensen work by those defendants who may have received jorgensen mass mailings did not create a prima facie case of access sufficient to defeat summary judgment.id.at.and,according to the district court,with respect to bmg and sony,the fact that pollock and leeds,respectively,admitted receiving jorgensen songs,without further evidence that they had forwarded the tapes to the songwriters or anyone else,was similarly inadequate to show access.see id.at.
the district court summary of the evidence regarding jorgensen interactions with leeds and sony,however,was incomplete.during his deposition,jorgensen testified at length about multiple conversations that he had with both leeds and leeds assistants over the course of three or more years regarding several tapes that jorgensen sent to leeds,including at least one tape that contained a recording of lover.according to jorgensen,during every one of these conversations,leeds or his assistants confirmed that leeds had received jorgensen tapes including,in particular,the lover tape and told jorgensen that his tapes had been forwarded to sony artist and repertoire a r department,the department responsible for helping the company find,sign and guide new talent.in addition,in response to jorgensen requests for admissions,sony indicated that on limited occasions,writers,producers or musicians affiliated with sony may have been shown some material solicited by the a r at some point during,and this the district court does not appear to have the defendants claim that jorgensen failed to adduce even a scintilla of evidence that leeds provided jorgensen song to anyone else 
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to jorgensen,the party.see mack otis elevator,cir.moreover,because jorgensen is proceeding pro se,we read his pleadings liberally and interpret them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.mcpherson coombe,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also graham henderson,cir.as the district court observed,however,our application of this different standard does not relieve plaintiff of his duty to meet the requirements necessary to defeat a motion for summary judgment.wl,at 
to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,the defendants must demonstrate the absence of material evidence supporting an essential element of jorgensen copyright infringement claim.see repp webber,cir,cert.denied,d.jorgensen,to avoid summary judgment,may not rely simply on conclusory allegations or speculation,but instead must offer evidence to show that his version of the events is not wholly fanciful.morris lindau,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in a copyright infringement case,the plaintiff must show i ownership of a valid copyright and ii unauthorized copying of the copyrighted work.see feist publ ns,rural.serv,d castle rock entm t,carol publ g group,cir.a certificate of registration from the united states register of copyrights constitutes prima facie evidence of the valid ownership of a copyright.see c.jorgensen secured such registration for lover,and the defendants do not dispute the validity of that copyright.thus,jorgensen has met the first element of an infringement claim.
to satisfy the second element of an infringement unauthorized copying plaintiff must show both that his work was actually copied and that the portion copied amounts to an improper or unlawful appropriation.castle rock,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.actual copying may be established by direct or indirect evidence.boisson banian,cir.because direct evidence of copying is seldom available,a plaintiff may establish copying circumstantially by demonstrating that the person who composed the defendant work had access to the copyrighted material,herzog castle rock entm t,cir see also walker time life films,cir,cert.denied,d,and that there are similarities between the two works that are probative of copying,repp,at.
jorgensen evidence of access 
access means that an alleged infringer had a reasonable possibility not simply a bare possibility of hearing the prior work access can not be based on mere speculation or conjecture.gaste kaiserman,cir see also herzog,at grubb kms patriots,cir ellis diffie,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at to r easonable opportunity does not encompass any bare possibility in the sense that anything is possible.access may not be inferred through mere speculation or conjecture.but id.at a,at noting that a t times,distinguishing a bare possibility from a reasonable possibility will present a close question.in order to support a claim of access,a plaintiff must offer significant,affirmative and probative evidence.scott paramount pictures,aff,table,cert.denied,d see also tisi patrick,d.
the mass mailings of lover 
jorgensen argues,first,that his act of mailing unsolicited tapes of lover to scores of record and music publishing companies,including the corporate defendants,constituted access because the corporate employees who allegedly received the mailing could have provided the heart and amazed songwriters with a copy of lover.with two exceptions reviewed below,however,jorgensen has not provided any reasonable documentation that he actually mailed such tapes or when or to whom these tapes were purportedly sent.jorgensen allegation was,thus,properly rejected by the district court as legally insufficient proof of access.wl,at noting that jorgensen did not maintain a log of where and when he sent his work,or keep receipts from certified mailings to establish a chain of access see also dimmie carey,d,rejecting plaintiff claim that the mailing of tapes to a corporation could be equated with access where there was no evidence that the tapes were ever received or forwarded to the alleged infringers jorgensen careers bmg music publ g,civ,wl,at july,preska,jorgensen i 
the submissions to pollock and leeds 
jorgensen second and more narrow theory of access,predicated on pollock and leeds admissions that they received jorgensen submissions,was also rejected by the district court.wl,at.for the reasons outlined below,we agree with the district court that jorgensen speculation that pollock could have provided the amazed songwriters with a copy of lover did not,standing alone,suffice to prove access,where there was no evidence of any relationship between pollock and the songwriters and where pollock stated in his sworn declaration that he had never forwarded jorgensen tapes to anyone.with respect to leeds and the heart defendants,however,we find that jorgensen introduced sufficient evidence to make the district court grant of summary judgment inappropriate at this stage of the proceedings.
pollock and the amazed defendants 
in his sworn declaration,pollock stated that his job as a managing producer in bmg special products division has nothing to do with the publishing company,careers bmg music publishing,or working creatively with songwriters at all.although he conceded that he had received a cd recording of lover,pollock denied that he had ever listened to the song and asserted that he never conveyed the cd to anyone at any time,much less anyone who contributed creative ideas or material to amazed or heart,mca,see also tisi,d at finding no proof of access where plaintiff alleged that he sent unsolicited tapes to record companies,including the company that released records containing the allegedly infringing song,but there was no evidence that plaintiff song was conveyed to anyone with creative input into the allegedly infringing song.in fact,jorgensen conceded at his deposition that he had no knowledge that pollock did anything with the cd that jorgensen sent to him.pollock stated that he did not have any relationship with the writers of amazed,and jorgensen has submitted no evidence to the contrary.towler sayles,cir a court may infer that the alleged infringer had a reasonable possibility of access if the author sent the copyrighted work to a third party intermediary who has a close relationship with the infringer.an intermediary will fall within this category,for example,if she supervises or works in the same department as the infringer or contributes creative ideas to him.emphasis added moore columbia pictures,cir finding access where intermediary was in a position to provide suggestions to the alleged copiers bouchat baltimore ravens,cir.jury could infer access where intermediary with access to plaintiff drawings had a close relationship to the alleged infringers,cert.denied,d tomasini walt disney,d,finding no relationship between recipient of plaintiff work and alleged infringers.
jorgensen claim against the amazed defendants was properly dismissed because he has not offered any evidence to rebut pollock assertions.the most that jorgensen offers to show a nexus between pollock and the amazed songwriters is his global assertion that anything and everything can very well happen.such speculation does not give rise to a triable issue of access.see ferguson broad,cir holding that plaintiff mere speculation did not support a finding of access where defendant offered uncontroverted evidence of a lack of access towler,at segal paramount pictures,aff,cir table novak broad.at plaintiff tort u ous chain of hypothetical transmittals was insufficient to avoid summary judgment on the question of access.jorgensen has not adduced proof of a reasonable possibility that the paths of the amazed songwriters and the infringed work crossed.towler,at.bare corporate receipt of jorgensen work,without any allegation of a nexus between the recipients and the alleged infringers,is insufficient to raise a triable issue of access see jorgensen i,wl,at dimmie,d at tisi,d at.
leeds and the heart defendants 
at his deposition,leeds admitted that he had received tapes from jorgensen but stated that he did not listen to them and he believed that they had been discarded.leeds testified that his job as a sony vice president involved reviewing promotional touring budgets and that he was not involved in the a r process.leeds also stated that he did not know the heart songwriters.
citing this evidence and echoing their arguments with respect to pollock,the defendants assert that the mere fact that leeds had received a copy of jorgensen song does not mean that the heart songwriters had a reasonable opportunity to hear it.defendants argue that it is undisputed that leeds did not forward jorgensen tape to the heart songwriters,but they do not address the evidence introduced by jorgensen that leeds and his assistants repeatedly told jorgensen that his,in particular,one containing the song lover were being sent to sony a r department leeds,at his deposition,disputed jorgensen version of events,testifying that he did not recall ever making such a promise to jorgensen and that he likely threw jorgensen tapes away.leeds also conceded,though,that it was possible that if there was a tape that he received that he found interesting he might pass it on to
