the united states filed a civil complaint in the northern district of oklahoma seeking the forfeiture of megamania machines operated in indian country.the government asserted the machines operating the game megamania are unlawful gambling devices operated in violation of the johnson act,a district judge subsequently issued a warrant to seize the megamania machines.the machines are owned by the cherokee nation of oklahoma and the tribe of oklahoma the tribes.the tribes and multimedia gambling devices,multimedia,the manufacturer of the machines,filed claims and answers seeking a declaratory judgment determining the machines are lawful under the indian gaming regulatory act,and not illegal gambling devices under the johnson act the district court granted summary judgment in favor of multimedia and the tribes,ruling the megamania machines are utilized for a class ii game permitted by the indian gaming regulatory act and are not illegal gambling devices under the johnson act.the district court subsequently denied the government motion to alter or amend the judgment.the government appeals the decision of the district court.we exercise jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
a.the game 
at the heart of this dispute is the nature of the game megamania.thus,we begin our discussion with a description of this game,which the tribes and multimedia liken to bingo or a game similar to bingo.megamania is played on a machine called an electronic player station.these player stations are located on indian lands in oklahoma,california,and elsewhere.a person playing megamania begins the game by electronically selecting up to four cards with randomly generated numbers.the player must pay cents per card to begin the game.a game will commence once at least twelve players nationwide purchase at least cards.a bingo blower located in indian country in oklahoma selects three numbered balls,and a human operator transmits the numbers on the balls by computer to multimedia headquarters where they are sent through a computer network to each player station.the player then touches the corresponding space or spaces on the player card appearing on the megamania station screen.to continue playing the game,a player must pay an additional cents per card in exchange for the numbers on the next three balls.these numbers are transmitted in roughly ten second intervals.consequently,the player must continue to pay cents to one dollar every ten seconds to stay in the game.
with the purchase of these numbers,a megamania player simultaneously engages in two aspects of the game,namely bingo and cornermania.bingo is won by the first player or simultaneous players to cover or daub five spaces in a straight line on the player bingo card image displayed on the screen.once one or more players cover five spaces in a row on a card,either horizontally,vertically or diagonally,the game terminates unless no player has won at cornermania.the amount the winners take depends on a variety of factors the number of cards played the number of balls drawn the amount of money carried over from prior games and the number of simultaneous winners.
the object of the cornermania portion of the game is to cover two,three or four corners of a card and win an interim monetary prize.cornermania is played until the bingo is won.if the bingo ends with no cornermania winner,additional balls,at increments,are drawn until at least one cornermania winner is announced.the amount a player wins at cornermania is based on a fixed formula that depends solely on the number of corners covered and the number of balls drawn at the time the corners are covered.
on average,multimedia and the tribes retain fifteen percent of the amount taken in by the machines and the winning players receive percent.in every game of megamania,there is at least one bingo winner and one cornermania winner.
b.the statutes 
two pieces of legislation are relevant to this johnson act and the indian gaming regulatory act.both pertain to gaming activities in indian country.the johnson act makes it unlawful within indian country to possess or use any gambling device.a.a gambling device is defined as any slot machine,a,and 
any other machine or mechanical device including but not limited to,roulette wheels and similar devices designed and manufactured primarily for use in connection with gambling,and a which when operated may deliver,as the result of the application of an element of chance,any money or property,or b by the operation of which a person may become entitled to receive,as the result of the application of an element of chance,any money or property.
following the supreme court decision in california cabazon band of mission indians,d cabazon i,which authorized gaming on federally recognized indian lands,congress enacted the indian gaming regulatory act the gaming act,also known as igra,codified at the gaming act classifies indian gaming into three different categories class i,class ii,and class iii.each of these categories is subject to different degrees of state and federal regulation.see cabazon band of mission indians national indian gaming comm n,cert.denied,d cabazon ii.the tribes possess exclusive jurisdiction to regulate class i gaming,which includes social games and traditional forms of indian gaming connected to tribal ceremonies,a.class i gaming is not at issue here.
the gaming act defines class ii games to include the game of chance commonly known as bingo whether or not electronic,computer or other technologic aids are used in connection therewith including if played in the same location,lotto,punch boards,tip jars,instant bingo,and other games similar to bingo a emphasis added.class ii games are regulated by the national indian gaming commission commission and can be operated on indian lands without a compact.id.at,b.all other gaming activity is class iii gaming and is allowed only where a compact is entered.id.at,d.the central issues of this case are whether the megamania game is properly classified as a class ii or iii game,and whether the megamania machines are illegal gambling devices under the johnson act.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.sundance,reno,cir.as we have stated on numerous occasions 
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.when applying this standard,we examine the factual record and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.if there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute,then we next determine if the substantive law was correctly applied by the district court.
id.quotation marks and citations omitted.the facts in this case are not in dispute.the only question in this case is whether the district court correctly analyzed and applied the relevant statutes and regulations.we review the district court interpretation of federal statutes and regulations de novo.eastern inv.united states,cir.
in conducting our de novo interpretation of the statutes at issue,we apply the canons of construction germane to issues arising under indian law.the canons of construction applicable in indian law are rooted in the unique trust relationship between the united states and the indians.montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted.in issues arising under indian law,s tatutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the indians,with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.id.citing mcclanahan arizona state tax comm n,d choate trapp.
in interpreting the gaming act,we look to the definitions of the terms and phrases contained therein as set forth by the commission.congress created the commission,and gave it authority to promulgate such regulations and guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the provisions of the gaming act.b.thus,we afford the regulations promulgated by the commission and published in the code of federal regulations the deference prescribed in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see also maier united states envtl.protection agency,cir.stating where congress explicitly delegates authority to an agency,its legislative regulations are given deference by the courts,cert.denied,d.when reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute congress charged it to administer,we ask two questions 
first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.if congress has explicitly or implicitly delegated authority to an agency,legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.
id.at quoting chevron,at.quotation marks and citations omitted.
we also consider the opinion letters issued by the commission that interpret the gaming act and the interpretations of the gaming act set forth by the commission in the federal register.although we are not obligated to afford these informal pronouncements the same deference prescribed under chevron,such opinion statements are entitled to respect under skidmore swift.see christensen harris county,d falvo owasso indep.sch.dist.no,cir.under skidmore,the weight to be afforded agency interpretations will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.skidmore,at.
a.the designation of megamania as a class ii game under the indian gaming regulatory act 
the gaming act defines class ii gaming as 
a i the game of chance commonly known as bingo whether or not electronic,computer,or other technologic aids are used in connection therewith 
i which is played for prizes,including monetary prizes,with cards bearing numbers or other designations,
ii in which the holder of the card covers such numbers or designations when objects,similarly numbered or designated,are drawn or electronically determined,and 
iii in which the game is won by the first person covering a previously designated arrangement of numbers or designations on such cards,including if played in the same location,lotto,punch boards,tip jars,instant bingo,and other games similar to bingo,
b the term class ii gaming does not include 
i any banking card games,including baccarat,chemin de fer,or blackjack,or 
ii electronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance or slot machines of any kind.
emphasis added.thus,subsections a i i,ii and iii set forth three explicit criteria for classification as a class ii game.
in this case,megamania meets these three criteria.specifically,it is played with an electronic card that looks like a regular paper bingo card containing a grid of numbers,and the first persons to cover a previously designated arrangement of this case five spaces and the necessary corner a monetary prize.the ninth circuit,in addressing the same issues connected with megamania,reached the same conclusion in united states electronic gambling devices,cir.
as it did before the ninth circuit,the government points to certain variations in the game megamania which it asserts make it a class iii game.specifically,the government argues megamania fails to meet the statutory definition of a class ii bingo game because cornermania is a house banking game,and thus is properly categorized as class iii gaming the cornermania game is played concurrently with the bingo game and includes multiple winners per game the ante up feature fundamentally alters the game to the extent it is no longer a class ii game the megamania machines more closely resemble slot machines than the game commonly known as bingo and the megamania machines are prohibited electromechanical facsimiles of the game of bingo.we are not persuaded by these arguments for the following reasons.
in order to determine whether the game megamania is a class ii or iii game,we turn for guidance to the definitions relating to class ii games set forth by the commission as published in the code of federal regulations.in a,the commission defined class ii gaming as bingo or lotto whether or not electronic,computer,or other technological aids are used and followed the definition of bingo described in the commission defined g ame s similar to bingo as any game that meets the requirements for bingo under a of this part and that is not a house banking game under of this part.the phrase house banking game does not appear in the definition of bingo set forth in the gaming act.however,congress specified class ii gaming does not include i any banking card games,including baccarat,chemin de fer,or blackjack,or ii electronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance or slot machines of any kind.b emphasis added.the commission defined a house banking game as any game of chance that is played with the house as a participant in the game,where the house takes on all players,collects from all losers,and pays all winners,and the house can win.in determining whether megamania is a class ii game,we note the gaming commission expressed its opinion the variations of the game commonly known as bingo featured in the megamania game are minor,do not alter the fundamental characteristics of the game of bingo,and meet the criteria of the class ii game of bingo or a game similar to bingo.
house banking game 
the government asserts the availability of jackpot prizes and the continuous win feature of the cornermania game render megamania a class iii house banking game because the house takes fifteen percent of the money paid in and the house may have to pay out more in winnings than it receives in bets in a particular game or series of games.it also contends cornermania is played against the house and not other players,and violates a i iii,which it reads as requiring only one winner.we disagree.
in order to win at either bingo or cornermania,the winners must defeat other players,not a machine.the house,in this case the tribes and multimedia,is not a participant because it does not play a bingo card which players must beat,nor is it ever a winner in the game.see also electronic gambling devices,at.as discussed in the next section,cornermania is clearly an interim part of the game,similar to recognized variations of traditional bingo where more than one prize is allowed for filling in corners.furthermore,even if the jackpot and cornermania features make it possible for players to win more than the total amount wagered by all the players,the commission recognized jackpots are permissible in class ii gaming provided the jackpot,as it does here,remains in place for players to win in future games see definitions under the indian gaming regulatory act,fed.reg.at.finally,nothing in the gaming act or in the regulation definition of a house banking game prohibits a game where the house may on occasion pay out more than it takes in,or forbids the house from earning a profit.see see also electronic gambling devices,at explaining i n any bingo game,the house regularly nets some portion of the money it takes in,or there would be no point in sponsoring the game.we find the commission reasoning persuasive and thus conclude megamania is not a house banking game as defined by the code of federal regulations.our holding is reinforced by the following discussion specifically concerning the cornermania aspect of the game.
the interim win feature of cornermania 
as part of its argument megamania is a house banking game,the government contends cornermania converts the game into a class iii game because a player does not have to be the first player to cover the designated pattern of numbers to win at cornermania.the government points out a player can win at cornermania at any time before a winner of the bingo game is identified,and a player can win multiple prizes in cornermania during one session of megamania.thus,the government contends megamania fails to meet the criteria set forth in a i iii that a class ii game is won by the first person covering the designated arrangement of numbers.
the commission chairman addressed these same issues in an opinion letter written to the president of multimedia,who requested a determination as to whether megamania is a class ii game.regarding cornermania,the chairman noted a number of bingo handbooks,manuals and catalogues describe interim win games where a player in a traditional bingo game may win an interim prize by being the first player to cover a predetermined corner pattern of numbers while playing toward a regular predetermined pattern on the bingo card.accordingly,the chairman concluded cornermania conforms to these pregame prizes which are a part of the game commonly known as bingo.
in addressing the government argument,the district court correctly pointed out nothing in the gaming act or regulations prohibits more than one winner or interim prizes during a game of bingo.the ninth circuit reached the same conclusion,holding winning does not necessarily mean vanquishing all other opponents,and identifying congress intent to permit interim prizes,given that some traditional variants of bingo allow them.see electronic gambling devices,at.moreover,nothing in the act or regulations outlines what configuration the predetermined numbers or pattern must be in,in a,a corner configuration,or both.id.at.thus,the language in the act concerning the first person to win is not limited to a game and should not be read in isolation from the traditional variations of bingo that allow interim prizes and simultaneous winners.for these reasons,we agree with the chairman,the district court,and the ninth circuit in concluding cornermania does not affect the designation of megamania as a class ii game.
the ante up feature 
the government further contends megamania is not the game commonly known as bingo or a game similar to bingo because instead of paying one price for a bingo card,a megamania player must continuously feed money into the machine to receive bingo balls and to continue playing the game.the parties refer to this as the ante up feature of the game.the district court determined the ante up feature did not fundamentally alter the game,relying on the following comment made by the commission during the adoption of the regulations governing the gaming act 
players participating on equal basis 
one commenter questioned whether the definition of bingo should require that all players participate on an equal basis.the commenter stated that in a traditional bingo game,all cards are purchased for a preset price,notwithstanding limited promotional discounts.the commission believes that such considerations are marketing decisions and are outside the act purview.therefore,the commission rejected this suggestion.
the acting general counsel of the commission also concluded megamania is properly categorized as a class ii game not subject to state regulation,stating in an opinion letter to the president of multimedia 
finally,a question has been raised about the ante up feature of your game.while i am cognizant of the similarities between such a feature and slot machines,this feature is not essential to the megamania game nor does it appear to impact negatively on our analysis of the statutory and regulatory criteria for bingo or a game similar to bingo.the feature is essentially similar to the paper card speed bingo or chip up bingo games played in halls where the player antes up money for each number called.therefore,while not traditional bingo,the ante up aspect does not change the game so fundamentally that it prevents me from ultimately determining that this is a game similar to bingo.
we begin our discussion on this issue by noting,as did the ninth circuit,that nothing in the gaming act or the commission regulations explicitly or implicitly prohibits the or pay as you go system for class ii games.see electronic gambling devices,at.when the commission commented that the preset price feature in traditional bingo games concerned a marketing decision and was outside the gaming act purview,it implicitly recognized the act silence on this matter.while the commission may or may not have contemplated the scenario before us,its legal counsel directly addressed the matter in the opinion letter.although succinct,we find this opinion consistent with the commission earlier determination that features for class ii games are beyond the scope of the act.see skidmore,at.the commission counsel reasoning that the feature does not change the statutory criteria for bingo is sound and supported by the explanation that certain other forms of bingo hall games use features.id.holding more weight may be given to agency interpretations.given the act silence on the pricing system for class ii games,and our agreement with the commission reasoning,we hold the feature does not change megamania class ii status.any perceived ambiguity concerning the act silence on this matter is resolved by applying the canons of construction which require us to construe ambiguous statutes in favor of the indians.see blackfeet tribe of indians,at.if congress wants to add a pricing or payment requirement to the definition of bingo or games similar to bingo,it will do so.
megamania similarities to a slot machine 
the government also contends megamania more closely resembles a slot machine than the game commonly known as bingo.the government points out the megamania machines are designed to resemble slot machines,are than traditional or manual bingo,require more investment by the participants than bingo,and cause the individual player to run a greater risk of loss than the average bingo player in a traditional bingo parlor.while the speed,appearance and stakes associated with megamania are different from traditional,manual bingo,megamania meets all of the statutory criteria of a class ii game,as previously discussed.moreover,as the ninth circuit pointed out,u nlike a slot machine,megamania is being played outside the terminal the terminal merely permits a person to connect to a network of players comprising each megamania game,and without a network of at least other players playing at other terminals,an individual terminal is useless.electronic gambling devices,at.we therefore reject the government argument that megamania stations are similar to slot machines.
for all the reasons set forth above,we conclude the megamania game challenged here meets the statutory criteria for a class ii game in the gaming act,a i.we proceed to analyze whether megamania falls within the definition of those games specifically excluded from class ii characterization under b and therefore constitutes an illegal gambling device prohibited by the johnson act.
whether megamania is an electromechanical facsimile of the game of bingo and a gambling device under the johnson act 
in addition to the criteria for class ii games set forth in a i of the gaming act,congress specifically excluded from class ii characterization as games that are house banking card games or electromechanical facsimiles of such games.b electromechanical facsimiles are defined in the code of federal regulations as any gambling device as defined in a or the johnson act.thus,the definition of electromechanical facsimile incorporates the johnson act definition of a gambling device.a gambling device is defined in the johnson act as 
any other machine or mechanical device including,but not limited to,roulette wheels and similar devices designed and manufactured primarily for use in connection with gambling,and a which when operated may deliver,as the result of the application of an element of chance,any money or property,or b by the operation of which a person may become entitled to receive,as the result of the application of an element of chance,any money or property.
a.however,the gaming act explicitly permits electronic,computer,or other technologic aids for use in bingo.a i.an electronic,co
