robert steinbuch brought this action against jessica cutler and several corporate entities for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from the publication by hyperion books of cutler sexually explicit novel and the potential development of a future television series based on it.the district court dismissed steinbuch action against cutler,hyperion books,and disney publishing worldwide for lack of personal jurisdiction and against home box office and time warner for failure to state a claim.steinbuch appealed,but his appeal of the dismissal of cutler was stayed after she filed a bankruptcy petition in new york we affirm except as to hyperion books.
robert steinbuch is currently a law professor at the university of arkansas in little rock.prior to assuming that position in the summer of he worked in washington.while serving as counsel to then senator mike dewine on the united states senate judiciary committee,steinbuch engaged in a sexual relationship with fellow staff member jessica cutler.unbeknownst to him,cutler was chronicling physical encounters with him and five other men in her internet weblog entitled the washingtonienne.the weblog,a graphic online diary which achieved particular notoriety in washington,when posted in may,describes intimate details of cutler relationship with steinbuch and her other lovers.steinbuch was not identified by name in the weblog he was generally referred to by his initials rs although cutler at least once called him rob.she also revealed some personal information,including his place of employment,religious affiliation,and physical attributes.rs looks just like george clooney when he takes off his glasses.steinbuch does not dispute that he had a brief liaison with cutler but denies particular statements she made in her weblog about some of his alleged sexual preferences and practices,including spanking and use of handcuffs.
approximately one year after her weblog posting,cutler authored a fictionalized book based on its content.like the weblog,her novel is entitled the washingtonienne and describes a young woman trysts with numerous men in washington,including a congressional committee staff lawyer.the novel concerns fictional characters and does not refer to steinbuch by name or by his initials.it was published in june by hyperion books hyperion,an imprint of buena vista books buena vista,which is a wholly owned subsidiary of disney publishing worldwide disney.the novel was distributed throughout the united states by time warner book group,now hachette book group,usa.time warner book group,was a subsidiary of time warner.
steinbuch filed his complaint in the federal district court for the eastern district of arkansas,alleging invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional tort of the book graphic description of his sexual relationship with cutler.in addition to cutler,he sued the publisher,its parent corporation disney,as well as home box office hbo and its parent time warner.hbo has secured an option to develop a television series based on the book.
none of the defendants reside,are incorporated,or have their principal place of business in arkansas.cutler,hyperion,and disney argued in the district court that they lacked the requisite minimum contacts with arkansas and were therefore entitled to dismissal pursuant to fed.civ.proc.b.time warner and hbo filed a fed.civ.proc.b motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.in response to these motions,steinbuch petitioned the district court for a three month extension to file a reply.defendants asked the court to stay discovery pending its ruling on their dismissal motions because they wanted to avoid potentially broad discovery requests and the risk of waiving their jurisdictional claims before their motions were ruled on.steinbuch filed a motion opposing a stay of discovery the motion made no explicit request to conduct limited discovery tailored to the specific issue of personal jurisdiction.the district court allowed steinbuch an extension of about two months to file his reply,but granted the defense motion to stay discovery until ruling on the motions.
the district court noted that all the corporate defendants sold their products or services in arkansas and analyzed whether it could exercise personal jurisdiction over them under either specific or general personal jurisdiction.it found that the washingtonienne and other books published by hyperion were being sold in arkansas bookstores.there was no evidence that hyperion had mounted a large advertising campaign,and the court observed that only about fifty copies had been sold to wholesale and retail accounts in arkansas.the district court concluded that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over hyperion would be unwarranted because its contacts with arkansas were too attenuated and the injury to steinbuch did not occur as a result of its activities directed at the forum state,especially since steinbuch had moved to arkansas only after publication of the novel.
the action against disney was also dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction because it is a separate corporate entity from hyperion and played no role in publishing the novel.since steinbuch had failed to rebut disney affidavits that it had no direct involvement in the novel publication,the district court concluded that he had not made a prima facie case that disney had engaged in conduct causing his injury or that it maintained the requisite contacts with arkansas to be subject to personal jurisdiction.
in concluding that no personal jurisdiction could be exercised over defendants,the district court noted arkansas relatively small interest in the dispute since the claims did not arise in the state and the alleged injuries occurred prior to steinbuch move to arkansas.the court also suggested that the district of columbia,where the novel events took place and where potential witnesses resided,would serve as a more appropriate forum.
the district court also granted the dismissal motions of hbo and its corporate parent time warner for failure to state a claim for relief under arkansas law,concluding that the complaint offered no indication that they had invaded steinbuch privacy,committed outrage,or had breached a duty toward him.
on appeal steinbuch asks us to reverse the district court dismissal of his claims against hyperion and disney for lack of personal jurisdiction and against hbo and time warner for failure to state a claim.he also appeals the district court stay of discovery pending its ruling on the motions to dismiss.
we review a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo,and the party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case.johnson woodcock,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,the plaintiff must state sufficient facts in the complaint to support a reasonable inference that defendants may be subjected to jurisdiction in the forum state.dever hentzen coatings,cir.the arkansas long arm statute confers jurisdiction to the fullest constitutional extent,limiting our inquiry to whether such an exercise of jurisdiction would comport with due process.id.at see also ann.b.
due process requires minimum contacts between a nonresident defendant and the forum state,such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.volkswagen woodson,d.the minimum contact inquiry focuses on whether the defendant purposely availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state and thereby invoked the benefits and protections of its laws.hanson denckla,d.
the supreme court has recognized two theories for evaluating personal jurisdiction general and specific jurisdiction.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.a state may exercise general jurisdiction if a defendant has carried on in the forum state a continuous and systematic,even if limited,part of its general business in such circumstances the alleged injury need not have any connection with the forum state.keeton hustler magazine,d.the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing,however,that the defendant contacts were not random,fortuitous,or attenuated.id.at.specific jurisdiction on the other hand is appropriate only if the injury giving rise to the lawsuit occurred within or had some connection to the forum state,meaning that the defendant purposely directed its activities at the forum state and the claim arose out of or relates to those activities.burger king rudzewicz,d.
to evaluate the sufficiency of a defendant contacts,we consider five factors,affording the first three primary importance the nature and quality of the defendant contacts with the forum state the quantity of such contacts the relation of the cause of action to the contacts the interests of the forum state in providing a forum for its residents and the convenience of the parties.burlington industries,maples industries,cir.the third relation of the cause of action to the only in the specific jurisdiction context and is immaterial in a general jurisdictional inquiry.see johnson,at.
hyperion contends that it maintained no contacts with arkansas which would justify the exercise of either theory of personal jurisdiction and asserts that no specific jurisdiction is warranted because this litigation did not result from injuries arising out of or relating to hyperion activities in arkansas.see burlington industries,at.steinbuch responds that specific jurisdiction exists over hyperion,suggesting that he suffered harm due to the publisher activities directed at arkansas which resulted in the purchase of cutler novel by state residents.to sustain his argument,steinbuch would have to show that hyperion knew that the brunt of the injury would be felt by him in the state in which he lives and works and intentionally targeted the forum state.see calder jones,d.this is an unlikely proposition,since the publication of the washingtonienne occurred around the same time as steinbuch move to arkansas.
while steinbuch claims that he became an arkansas resident just prior to the publication of the novel and produced an employment offer letter from the university of arkansas to begin his position on june,he failed to assert in his first and amended complaints that he resided in arkansas at the time and provided no affidavit to the district court declaring his date of residency in the state.hyperion refuted steinbuch residency claim by pointing to his failure to allege this fact in his complaints.steinbuch cause of action appears to have no direct connection with the forum state or to have arisen out of or relate to hyperion activities in arkansas.see burger king,at.none of the events described in the novel took place in arkansas,and steinbuch has failed to show that hyperion contacts with arkansas and the relationship between his cause of action and those contacts are sufficient to justify the exercise of specific jurisdiction.see burlington industries,at.
hyperion asserts that no general jurisdiction exists because it did not conduct business in the forum state as defined by arkansas statute in.ann a foreign corporation may not transact business in arkansas until it obtains a certificate of authority from the secretary of state.hyperion also argues that it is not responsible for the distribution of its books and that it lacks formalized ties to arkansas such as a bank account,a registered agent,a corporate office,or real estate.see,dever,at noting absence of these factors in finding a lack of general jurisdiction but see vandelune elevator components unlimited,cir absence of these factors,while significant,is not determinative on question of market presence.steinbuch counters that hyperion purposely availed itself of the protections of the forum state laws by continuously and deliberately exploiting the arkansas market.see keeton,at.in support of his argument,steinbuch produced a list of approximately thirty different hyperion book titles available in a particular arkansas bookstore,affidavits by several individuals who purchased cutler novel in arkansas,and an affidavit declaring that the washingtonienne is available at all major bookstores in arkansas,as well as through the state central public library system.
in finding a lack of general jurisdiction,the district court emphasized the relatively small number of sales of the washingtonienne in arkansas and the lack of a substantial advertising campaign for the book in the state.in a general jurisdiction inquiry,however,we must look not to the sales of that particular novel but to hyperion general presence in arkansas.see id.at.nonresident magazine publisher subject to general personal jurisdiction for alleged defamation because it carried out part of its general business in the forum state and benefitted from the magazine sales there.the percentage of a company sales in a given state is generally not relevant to the general jurisdiction analysis as the focus lies on whether the contacts are continuous and systematic.see lakin prudential securities,cir.since the affidavits by individuals who purchased the washingtonienne in arkansas imply that hyperion has profited from the sale of its books in the state,the inquiry centers on whether the publisher forum contacts are such that it purposely availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in the state and should therefore have reasonably anticipated being haled into court.see johnson,at.
while mere placement of a product into the stream of commerce,without more,is insufficient to constitute purposeful availment,dever,at,we have recognized a state exercise of jurisdiction over a seller who delivered its products to a regional distributor with an expectation that the distributor would penetrate the forum state.see vandelune,at.seeking to demonstrate that it exercised no influence over the distribution of its books,hyperion disclosed to the district court its agreement with distributor time warner book group.although the agreement granted the distributor the exclusive right and sole responsibility for distribution of the books throughout the united states and did not explicitly target specific states or regions,it did provide for written monthly sales reports to the publisher.the fact that it contracted to receive monthly sales reports,especially if these reports were to display sales on a state by state basis,would permit an inference that hyperion had reasonable expectations and knowledge that its products were going to be offered in the arkansas market.see barone rich.display fireworks,cir foreign fireworks producer alleged lack of knowledge of distribution defies reason and could aptly be labeled willful but see guinness import mark vii distributors,cir foreign beer manufacturer whose title over the beer passed to importer in jamaica and who exercised no control over selection of distributor in the united states not subject to jurisdiction in minnesota.
there is also evidence,as a result of hyperion disclosure of the distribution agreement,that the publisher was actively involved in marketing plans and promotions of books placed in stores.hyperion distribution agreement provides that publisher will consult with distributor with respect to establishing marketing plans,sales forecasting,determining appropriate print runs,and planning advertising and promotional campaigns for the books,and publisher will make and notify distributor of final decisions.see sondergard miles,cir noting that cold medicine manufacturer did not limit where its products may be purchased and was therefore subject to general jurisdiction.it thus appears that hyperion may have been involved in the promotion and marketing of its books and might have reasonably expected their distribution in arkansas.
although carrying less weight than the nature,quality,and quantity of hyperion contacts with the forum,other relevant factors are the interest of the state in protecting its residents and the need to ensure that a suit in the forum would not offend defendant due process rights.dever,at.although steinbuch is a relatively new resident,arkansas has an interest in protecting his privacy rights as it is the forum where he would appear to suffer the most direct effects of hyperion activities.lakin,at state has significant interest
