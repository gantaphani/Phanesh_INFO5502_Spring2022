this case involves constitutional challenges to a city ordinance requiring adult cabaret dancers to remain two feet away from patrons during performances.the district court rejected these challenges by dismissing some of the appellants claims on the pleadings and granting summary judgment as to other claims.we denied emergency motions for a stay of enforcement of the ordinance pending appeal and now affirm.
the city of la habra city municipal ordinance ordinance regulates adult businesses.the first section of the ordinance contains extensive findings that adult businesses generate crime,economic harm,and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.these findings are based on studies and police declarations from other jurisdictions,federal and state judicial opinions,and public health data from surrounding southern california counties.ordinance.other sections of the ordinance contain regulations purporting to address the secondary effects described in the first section,including a prohibition of physical contact between patrons and performers the rule and a requirement that adult cabaret dancers perform at least two feet away from their patrons the rule.ordinance.the appellants are bill badi gammoh,the owner of an adult establishment in the city,several dancers at gammoh club,and a dancer who has been offered employment at gammoh club but has not yet accepted it.gammoh establishment,which does not serve alcoholic beverages,features entertainment by dancers who perform nude on stage and then dress in minimal clothing before offering offstage dances the appellants do not challenge the provisions of the ordinance governing dancing and other aspects of the operation of an adult cabaret they challenge only the rule.
three weeks after the city council passed the ordinance,the appellants filed their constitutional challenge in the superior court of california for orange county.the case was subsequently removed to the united states district court for the central district of california.the appellants were unsuccessful before the district court.in addition to other rulings that the appellants do not challenge on appeal,the district court dismissed the appellants overbreadth argument and part of their vagueness challenge with prejudice,and entered summary judgment in favor of the city on their regulatory takings claim,a first amendment challenge,and the remaining vagueness argument.the appellants pursue their vagueness,overbreadth,takings,and free speech and expression claims on appeal.
the ordinance rule applies exclusively to adult cabaret dancers.the ordinance defines an adult cabaret dancer as 
any person who is an employee or independent contractor of an adult cabaret or adult business and who,with or without any compensation or other form of consideration,performs as a dancer,exotic dancer,stripper,dancer or similar dancer whose performance on a regular and substantial basis focuses on or emphasizes the adult cabaret dancer breasts,genitals,and or buttocks,but does not involve exposure of specified anatomical areas or depicting or engaging in specified sexual activities.adult cabaret dancer does not include a patron.
ordinance.the district court rejected the appellants assertion that this definition is vague and overbroad because it contains subjective terms.we review the district court ruling de novo.see united states rodriguez,cir united states linick,cir.
to survive a vagueness challenge,a regulation must define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson,d see also united states adams,cir,cert.denied,d.a greater degree of specificity and clarity is required when first amendment rights are at stake.kev,kitsap county,cir.
the appellants argue that the subjective language used to define an adult cabaret dancer makes the definition,and thus the ordinance,unconstitutionally vague.city of chicago morales,d holding a provision criminalizing loitering,which is defined as to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose,void for vagueness because the provision was inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene tucson woman clinic eden,cir holding a statute requiring physicians to treat patients with consideration,respect,and full recognition of the patient dignity and individuality void for vagueness because it subjected physicians to sanctions based not on their own objective behavior,but on the subjective viewpoint of others internal quotation and citation omitted free speech coalition reno,cir,aff sub nom.ashcroft free speech coalition,d holding a provision that criminalized sexually explicit images that appear to be a minor or convey the impression that a minor is depicted unconstitutionally vague because it was unclear whose perspective defines the appearance of a minor,or whose impression that a minor is involved leads to criminal prosecution.
several of the terms within the ordinance definition of adult cabaret dancer sexually oriented dancer,exotic dancer,similar dancer,regular basis,and focuses on or emphasizes are unarguably subjective.however,two main factors distinguish the ordinance from cases such as morales,tucson woman clinic,and free speech coalition,where the regulations were held to be too subjective to give notice to ordinary people or guidance to law enforcement the subjective terms in the ordinance are used in combination with other terms,and the subjective terms do not define prohibited conduct.
this circuit has previously recognized that otherwise imprecise terms may avoid vagueness problems when used in combination with terms that provide sufficient clarity.see kev,at holding that an ordinance prohibiting dancers from caressing and fondling patrons was not vague in the context of the other definitions provided in the ordinance at issue.in this case,the district court recognized that the rule applies only to adult cabaret dancers who meet the following five qualifications the individual must perform at an adult cabaret the performer must perform as a dancer,exotic dancer,stripper,or similar dancer the performance must focus on or emphasize the performer breasts,genitals,buttocks the performance must have this focus or emphasis on a regular basis and the performance must have this focus or emphasis on a substantial basis.thus,an adult cabaret dancer is defined by a combination of features,not by any one subjective term.the combined terms outline the performer,the place of the performance,and the type of performance.each of the five limitations provides context in which the other limitations may be clearly understood.the definition as a whole gives notice to performers and ample guidance to law enforcement officers as to who is and who is not an adult cabaret dancer.
furthermore,although the definition of an adult cabaret dancer contains subjective terms,the prohibited conduct is defined objectively.it is not illegal to be an adult cabaret dancer only to be an adult cabaret dancer performing within two feet of a patron.this distinction introduces additional objectivity into the ordinance because the act that is within two feet of a certainly not vague 
vagueness doctrine can not be understood in a manner that prohibits governments from addressing problems that are difficult to define in objective terms.see grayned city of rockford,d we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language.in this case,a combination of subjective and objective terms is used to give a clear picture of an adult cabaret dancer and the conduct prohibited of such a dancer is defined objectively.thus,the definition of adult cabaret dancer is sufficiently clear to give notice to performers and guidance to law enforcement.see cal.teachers ass state bd.of,cir perfect clarity is not required even when a law regulates protected speech.
the appellants claim that the definition of adult cabaret dancer is overbroad because it could apply to mainstream or performances as well as adult entertainment.the supreme court and this circuit have emphasized that where a statute regulates expressive conduct,the scope of the statute does not render it unconstitutional unless its overbreadth is not only real,but substantial as well,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.world wide video of washington,city of spokane,cir quoting osborne ohio,d internal quotations omitted.in this case,potentially overbroad applications of the ordinance are minimal because performances occurring outside of an adult cabaret are unaffected by the ordinance,and those occurring in an adult cabaret and containing the sexual emphasis that defines an adult cabaret dancer are within the ordinance legitimate sweep.
the appellants were unable to cite any example of a performance that would fall within the ordinance to which application of the ordinance restrictions would be overbroad.the examples a duet,a tango,and an elvis unpersuasive.a pas de deux,a ballroom dance,and an impersonation of the king each escapes the limitation unless performed in an establishment which features live performances by topless bottomless dancers,dancers,exotic dancers,strippers or similar entertainers characterized by an emphasis on specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas.see supra note quoting city of la habra code c.however,if they occur within an adult cabaret and the performer meets all five prongs of the definition of adult cabaret dancer,these performances fall within the statute legitimate sweep.
regardless of whether the dance is a tango or more typical adult entertainment,requiring a separation between dance partners in this sexual atmosphere may reasonably advance the city legitimate goal of reducing secondary effects of adult entertainment.the rule may,for example,provide a line of sight for enforcement of the no touch rule and prevent exchanges of money and drugs.when performed in an adult cabaret,these performances,even if done in an elvis costume,are thus within the statute legitimate reach.
even if the appellants were able to identify performances that fulfill all aspects of an adult cabaret dancer but are not tied to the secondary effects the statute is designed to address,the mere fact that one can conceive of some impermissible applications of a statute is not sufficient to render it susceptible to an overbreadth challenge.members of city council of city of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d.although we recognize that the first amendment needs breathing space,world wide video,at,in this situation there is no realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protections of parties not before the court.taxpayers for vincent,at.if an overbroad application of the ordinance exists,it is insubstantial when judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.see broadrick oklahoma,d.
the district court dismissed the appellants regulatory takings claim on summary judgment.we review this decision de novo.cal.first amend.coalition calderon,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.id.

the appellants argue that the ordinance violates the first amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and expression.the district court evaluated the ordinance under intermediate scrutiny and determined that the appellants first amendment rights had not been violated.we review the district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellants and looking for genuine issues of material fact.see calderon,at.
first,we must determine whether the ordinance is a complete ban on protected expression.see ctr.for fair pub.policy maricopa county,cir plurality opinion citing city of los angeles alameda books,d,and renton playtime theatres,d.we conclude that it is not.
the rule merely requires that dancers give their performances from a slight distance it does not prohibit them from giving their performances altogether.the rule limits the dancers freedom to convey their erotic message but does not prohibit them from performing erotic for patrons.see renton,at.because the dancers performances may continue,albeit from a slight distance,this case stands in sharp contrast to our recent decision in dream palace county of maricopa,where we applied strict scrutiny to an ordinance regulating adult businesses because even the county conceded that the ordinance was a complete ban on nude and dancing,cir.here,the ordinance prescribes where offstage dancing can occur at least two feet away from patrons but it does not ban any form of dance.
the appellants argue that close propinquity to patrons is a key element of the dancers expressive activity,and that the ordinance is therefore a complete ban on a form of expression proximate dancing.this argument has been made and rejected in this circuit.see colacurcio city of kent,cir rejecting the argument that because table dancing is a unique form of dancing requiring proximity,a separation requirement is a complete ban on this form of expression.it is true that if the dancers expressive activity is considered erotic dance within two feet of patrons and not merely erotic dance,this activity is completely banned.however,virtually no ordinance would survive this analysis the expression at issue could always be defined to include the contested restriction.see id.at rejecting the idea that the applicable forum for a table dance is the area within ten feet of the performer.protected expression is not so narrowly defined.see dream palace,at recognizing that the regulations in renton and its progeny did not proscribe absolutely certain types of adult entertainment and instead enacted regulations that avoid ed a total ban on protected expression.
while the dancer erotic message may be slightly less effective from two feet,the ability to engage in the protected expression is not significantly impaired.kev,at.we hold that the ordinance is not a complete ban on a protected form of expression.
next,we must determine what level of scrutiny properly applies.see ctr.for fair pub.policy,at.traditionally,the court has utilized a distinction between and regulations to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny.see,renton,at.time,place,and manner restrictions on adult businesses were considered.id.at.
recently,however,the supreme court has recognized that virtually all regulation of adult businesses is.see alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring see also ctr.for fair pub.policy,at recognizing justice kennedy opinion in alameda books as controlling because it is the narrowest opinion joining the plurality judgment.regulations are normally subject to strict scrutiny.see simon schuster,members of state crime victims,d describing the necessary to serve a compelling state interest strict scrutiny test.
however,designating regulation of adult establishments as does not end the inquiry as to the appropriate standard of review.regulations may be analyzed under intermediate scrutiny if two conditions are met the ordinance regulates speech that is sexual or pornographic in nature and the primary motivation behind the regulation is to prevent secondary effects.ctr.for fair pub.policy,at citing alameda books,at.
the appellants differ from plaintiffs in previous cases regarding the regulation of adult businesses in that they wear minimal clothing for their offstage performances although they perform nude on stage.the appellants argue that the dancers expressive acti
