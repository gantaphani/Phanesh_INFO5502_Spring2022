bmg columbia house bmg sells cds and dvds by mail.many bmg discs prove to be undeliverable.during the time in question,bmg arranged with the united states postal service usps to gather and discard undeliverable discs,as it was less costly for bmg to produce replacement discs than to pay for the return and restocking of undeliverable discs.james chalupnik,a janitorial supervisor at the downtown post office in fargo,north dakota,took several thousand undeliverable cds and dvds from the post office trash and sold them to used record stores.initially charged with felony mail theft,chalupnik pleaded guilty to misdemeanor copyright infringement in violation of a and b.the district court sentenced chalupnik to two years probation and ordered him to pay bmg restitution in an amount equal to his documented sales proceeds.chalupnik appeals the restitution award.we conclude that the government failed to prove the amount of loss to bmg proximately caused by chalupnik offense.accordingly,we vacate the restitution award and remand for resentencing.
chalupnik supervised disabled persons who provided janitorial services at the downtown post office in fargo.in october,he began removing undeliverable cds and dvds from the post office trash and selling the discs to used record stores.in june,usps began investigating the disappearance of undeliverable cds and dvds at the fargo post office.a surveillance camera revealed chalupnik hiding discs in a telephone closet,and cds and dvds were found in his possession.he admitted selling the discs to used record stores in moorhead and cloud,minnesota,and sioux falls,south dakota.store records reflected purchases of several thousand discs and payments to chalupnik totaling.the stores had no record of what cd and dvd titles they purchased from chalupnik,but one store owner told investigators that most if not all were bmg products.
chalupnik pleaded guilty to a charge that he willfully infringed numerous copyrighted sound recordings for private financial gain between october and july in violation of a and b.at the change of plea hearing,he admitted selling discs for without authority from the copyright owners.at sentencing,the government recommended a sentence of probation.the district court agreed and sentenced chalupnik to two years probation.
the presentence investigation report psr recommended that chalupnik be ordered to pay bmg mandatory restitution in the amount of because his offense conduct deprived bmg of the option of returning the cd to the market or destroying them.chalupnik submitted a sentencing memorandum opposing restitution.noting the absence of evidence that bmg owned any copyright interest in the discs,chalupnik argued that bmg was not a victim of his offense.he further argued that the government could not prove actual loss because bmg threw away or destroyed undeliverable discs,and because customers of used music stores will not buy new products by mail so bmg can not show it lost sales on account of his offense conduct.in response,the government submitted a letter from bmg senior counsel asserting that usps routinely returns dvds to bmg for restocking,that bmg accepts cds returned by customers and most likely returns a portion to inventory for resale,that bmg competes with used record stores in the larger music market,and that chalupnik offense conduct resulted in no royalty payments being made to the copyright owners.the government sentencing memorandum argued that bmg is a victim because it owns the discs,sells them with permission of the copyright owners,and controls the disposition of undeliverable discs that each time chalupnik sold an undeliverable disc,the artist lost a royalty and bmg lost a potential sale and that the amount of those losses is conservatively estimated by chalupnik gross revenues.
at sentencing,the government introduced no additional evidence relating to bmg actual loss.chalupnik testified that all undeliverable discs were discarded in the post office trash or,after a change in practice in march,were bagged and sent to a postal facility in the twin cities.agreeing with the government and the psr,the district court ordered chalupnik to pay in restitution to bmg.the court explained i do believe that there is in fact a lost opportunity to bmg,that the people that bought those cd would likely have bought new cd,and that that represents a real and substantial loss to bmg in the amount of.the court further noted that,in a civil lawsuit by bmg,chalupnik liability would include disgorgement of his profits from converting bmg property therefore,imposing a fine payable to the united states instead of restitution might well increase chalupnik total liability.
the mandatory victims restitution act mvra provides that a sentencing court shall order a defendant convicted of an offense against property under this title to pay restitution to a victim.a,c.the restitution award in this case raises two distinct issues whether bmg is a victim entitled to mandatory restitution under the mvra and,if so,what is the proper amount of restitution to be awarded.the first is primarily an issue of law that we review de novo.see united states wilcox,cir.in resolving the second issue,we review a finding as to the amount of loss for clear error and the district court decision to award restitution for abuse of discretion.see united states petruk,cir.the government has the burden of proof on both issues.
is bmg a victim 
in hughey united states,d,the supreme court held that the victim and witness protection act of vwpa was intended to compensate victims only for losses caused by the conduct underlying the offense of conviction.at.therefore,restitution may be awarded only to victims of the offense of conviction,and a victim may not be compensated for conduct unrelated to the offense of conviction,even if that unrelated conduct was the subject of criminal charges dropped by the government in exchange for the defendant guilty plea.id.at.congress responded by adding a definition of victim that retained the core limiting principle of hughey but clarified its application to certain offenses and to plea agreements.see a supp.iii.
when congress enacted the mvra in,it included a definition of victim that again incorporated the core principle of hughey 
for the purposes of this section,the term victim means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including,in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,any person directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern 
the court shall also order,if agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement,restitution to persons other than the victim of the offense.
a.consistent with hughey,the senate judiciary committee report explained that,unless a plea agreement provides otherwise,the mandatory restitution provisions apply only in those instances where a named,identifiable victim suffers a physical injury or pecuniary loss directly and proximately caused by the course of conduct under the count or counts for which the offender is convicted,at,reprinted in.congress also amended the vwpa so that the two statutes would contain identical definitions of the term victim and substantively identical plea agreement provisions.see a united states ramirez,cir.
chalupnik argues that the government failed to prove that bmg was a victim for purposes of the mvra because it presented no evidence that bmg,a retail seller of cds and dvds,had an interest in the infringed copyrights sufficient to make bmg a victim of his copyright infringement offense.this is a novel and intriguing contention.we agree with a number of its underlying premises.first,restitution is essentially a civil remedy created by congress and incorporated into criminal proceedings for reasons of economy and practicality.united states carruth,cir.therefore,restitution,at least in theory,tracks the recovery to which the victim would have been entitled in a civil suit against the criminal.united states behrman,cir quotation omitted.second,copyright
