in this appeal,lloyd arnold,a former harness operator at the california exposition cal expo seeks another spin around the track.he appeals from the denial of his petition for writ of mandate and from the denial of his motions for reconsideration and for attorney fees in his petition,arnold sought to have cal expo and the department of general services dgs vacate two operator extensions cal expo had granted capitol racing,llc capitol,and solicit competitive bids for the operation.after arnold filed his petition,cal expo concluded it had mistakenly provided the extensions,and vacated them.thereafter,cal expo and capitol entered into a new operating agreement.
on appeal,arnold contends a harness racing contract is a public services contract subject to competitive bidding cal expo and dgs violated legal duties by failing to evaluate the economic terms of the former contract with capitol and he is entitled to attorney fees under the private attorney general theory of code of civil procedure section.we disagree and affirm the judgment denying his petition.we conclude that a harness racing the form presented not a public services contract subject to competitive bidding.we also define cal expo and dgs legal duties to evaluate the economic terms of a harness racing contract and affirm the trial court order denying arnold request for attorney fees.
background 
first,we must address a question of mootness.capitol claims that the harness racing contract arnold has challenged has been replaced with a new and different contract,rendering arnold appeal moot.we disagree for the most part.
the following issues are not moot in this mandate proceeding whether a harness racing contract is a public services contract subject to competitive bidding whether cal expo and dgs have a legal duty to evaluate the economic terms of such contracts and whether arnold is entitled to attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.haywood superior court th,d,quoting green superior court cal d,fn,a petition for writ relief is not mooted by subsequent events when these events leave a material question affecting the parties unresolved,or the petition presents a matter of continuing public interest and the issue is likely to recur.
by contrast,the following issue is moot whether cal expo and dgs properly evaluated the economic terms of the former harness racing contract between cal expo and capitol,pursuant to a legal duty of evaluation.this issue is moot because no effective mandate relief has been requested or is now available to correct an improper economic evaluation of the former contract,a largely discretionary rather than ministerial act in any event.see taylor board of trustees cal d,generally,there are two requirements for a writ of mandate to issue a clear,present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the defendant and a clear,present and beneficial right in plaintiff to performance of that duty.as we shall also explain,even if arnold could show an improper economic evaluation,that would not help him on the issue of attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.
cal expo is a separate independent entity in state government that is governed by a board of directors.food.it was created to vitalize the california exposition and state fair and to work toward fiscal independence from the state general fund.food.
harness racing has been conducted at cal expo for many years.due to the economic instability of the harness racing industry from through,there was little or no known competition to operate harness racing at cal expo.the contracting process did not involve competitive bidding.cal expo negotiated directly with independent race operators and entered into agreements with them the operators would run the harness races while leasing the race facilities from cal expo.
in late,cal expo issued a request for proposal rfp a bid solicitation to secure a harness race operator beginning in late.all interested parties,including arnold and a colleague,christo bardis,were invited to participate.only capitol submitted a bid proposal.as a result,capitol and cal expo entered into a lease agreement contract.the term of the lease was from september through the end of additionally,there were two options,which could extend the term through the end of.
in,the harness racing industry was becoming a much better bet economically because of increasing revenue,due in part to legislative changes that spawned more wagering.as a result,there was increased interest in the cal expo harness racing contract and the two options between capitol and cal expo.
on october,after hearing from other interested harness race operators,cal expo agreed to exercise the two options under contract with capitol,and extended the term of the lease through july,the term went beyond the original end of to encompass additional race days.
to incorporate the exercise of these options and other changes to contract,cal expo director of racing events,david elliott,redrafted the contract.in doing so elliott mistakenly included two additional options,and other cal expo personnel assigned a new number to the contract contract.elliott was unaware of this mistake and so too was cal expo board.
on march,cal expo agreed to exercise the mistaken two options,and extended contract to july,by drafting an amendment to the contract.arnold had objected to this extension on economic grounds,arguing that the contract should be bid competitively and that he would pay cal expo nearly more over the period.on several occasions over a significant period,arnold informed cal expo,and dgs,that he was interested in undertaking the harness racing contract,noting that cal expo was not obtaining the revenue it could under the capitol contract.
in september of,arnold filed his petition for writ of mandate.he asked the trial court to vacate the two extensions of contract,and to require competitive bidding once the current harness racing contract expired in july.
in december,after hearing from arnold and capitol,cal expo rescinded the action it had taken on march,it vacated the extension of the term for contract and invalidated amendment.cal expo also aligned contract with the action it had taken on october,it set the term of the contract as december,through july.
these actions prompted capitol to sue cal expo in january for breach of contract.in july,these two parties settled that lawsuit pursuant to a new contract awarding cal expo additional revenue of annually.the trial court and this court have judicially noticed this settlement agreement and new contract.
discussion 
public services contract and competitive bidding 
arnold contends that a cal expo harness racing contract is governed by the competitive bidding requirements of the public contract code because it is a public services contract under public contract code section.see also pub.contract code,related sections governing competitive bidding.we disagree.
because this contention requires us to determine whether a statutory standard applies to a particular type of contract,it presents a question of law that we determine independently.harustak wilkins th,d harustak ranch north county of san diego th,d mcmillin.
public contract code section states,as pertinent,that t his article article,contracts for services shall apply to all contracts,including amendments,entered into by any state agency for services to be rendered to the state,whether or not the services involve the furnishing or use of equipment,materials,or supplies or are performed by an independent contractor.pub.contract code,subd.a,italics added.in a nutshell,arnold argues that a harness racing operator renders harness racing management services to the state pursuant to contract.concluding that the harness racing contract is a service contract,arnold maintains that competitive bidding is required.see pub.contract code.
the public contract code does not define a services contract.the structure of the harness racing contract at issue here certainly does not fit the typical profile of a contract for goods or services entered into between the state and a third party.in that context,california buys goods or services from a thir
