the primary question presented is whether a secured lender may foreclose on funds held by a payroll processing company and thereby defeat subsequent claims to those funds asserted by unsecured creditor employers who contend that the funds should have been used to meet the payroll processing company payroll obligations.the answer is yes when,as here,the funds paid by the unsecured creditor employers were not held in trust.thus,the trial court properly denied the summary adjudication motion filed by the appellants collectively the film clients as to whether goldentree asset management,lp and gtam special realty,llc collectively goldentree had a duty to refrain from foreclosing on funds held by axium international,and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively axium and the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of goldentree with respect to the film clients causes of action for unjust enrichment and conversion.consequently,the film clients attack on these rulings does not survive appellate scrutiny.
as a separate matter,the film clients argue that their fraud cause of action against goldentree should have survived demurrer.due to deficiencies in the pleading,which we elucidate below,this argument lacks merit.
we affirm the judgment.
in and early,the film clients except for hostage and simon cinema used axium to provide payroll processing,staffing and other services with respect to specified film projects.the parties signed written service agreements which provided that axium would serve as the joint employer of the cast and crew for each film the film clients would provide all relevant payroll details to axium axium would calculate,inter alia,wages and withholdings axium would invoice the film clients for the amounts due and once the film clients transferred the invoiced amounts,axium would issue payroll checks to cast and crew and pay withholdings to the appropriate entities.pursuant to an oral agreement,hostage hired axium to process residuals for a film that had been previously produced.
sordid paid axium a security deposit.
axium defaulted on a loan to goldentree.goldentree had a perfected security interest in axium general deposit accounts and foreclosed on them,resulting in a transfer of million.
the film clients sued goldentree to recover the funds they had paid to axium.following several rounds of pleading,the film clients filed their second amended complaint and alleged causes of action for fraudulent concealment,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment,conversion and violation of business and professions code section et.according to the general allegations,when axium defaulted on its loan,goldentree decided to improve its financial position by forcing axium to aggressively invoice and collect money from the film clients.those invoices amounted to affirmative misrepresentations by goldentree and axium that the funds would be used for no other purpose but paying wages,residuals and withholdings.only after the film clients paid the invoices did goldentree initiate foreclosure and seize the funds.goldentree demurred to the second amended complaint.the demurrer was overruled as to conversion and unjust enrichment but sustained without leave to amend as to the remaining claims.the film clients moved for summary adjudication as to whether goldentree had a duty to refrain from seizing the funds.the same day,goldentree moved for summary judgment or adjudication.the trial court denied the film clients motion and,concurrently,granted goldentree motion.judgment was entered in favor of goldentree.
this timely appeal followed.
standard of review 
if an appeal challenges an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the standard of review is well settled.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.and it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.citation.aubry tri city hospital dist.cal th,d.the legal sufficiency of the complaint is reviewed de novo.montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d.

discussion 
in dismissing the fraud cause of action,the trial court concluded that the film clients failed to sufficiently allege a misrepresentation by goldentree.the film clients assign error to this ruling because they alleged that goldentree made numerous affirmative misrepresentations of material facts by communicating through employees of axium.more specifically,the film clients point to their allegation that goldentree caused axium to continue sending invoices and billing statements to the film clients and e ach such invoice or billing statement that goldentree encouraged or caused axium to send to each of the film clients constituted an affirmative representation by goldentree and axium that the money requested to be transferred to axium would be used by axium only for the purpose of paying wages and compensation to the film clients employees and for paying associated federal and state taxes,benefit plan contributions,and residuals required by collective bargaining agreements.
in our view,the film clients failed to make a case for reversal.to allege fraud based on misrepresentation,a plaintiff must allege a misrepresentation,knowledge of its falsity,intent to defraud,justifiable reliance and resulting damages.roberts ball,hunt,hart,brown baerwitz d.the representation must ordinarily be an affirmation of fact.citations.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.sometimes it can be a misrepresentation of law or a false promise that contains an implied misrepresentation of intention to perform the promise.id.at.and it is true,as the film clients point out,that a misrepresentation can be made through a conduit.committee on children television,general foods cal d.but,simply put,the film clients did not allege an actionable misrepresentation of fact or intention to perform because they did not allege that axium invoices expressly stated or promised how the film clients funds would be used.when it is boiled down,they have essentially alleged a claim based on an implied false promise.to our knowledge,however,no such tort has been recognized by california law.
ii.duty,unjust enrichment and conversion.
according to the film clients,there are triable issues as to duty,unjust enrichment and conversion because the evidence demonstrates that the funds were held in express or resulting trust,they retained an interest in the funds,and goldentree was therefore not entitled to take them.the film clients contend that an express or resulting trust can be established by the written service agreements,axium receipt of the funds as a paying agent,and the course of dealing.we disagree.the film clients failed to establish rights superior to the rights of a secured lender.
contract interpretation part.
pursuant to the parol evidence rule,extrinsic evidence can not be used to contradict or supplement an agreement if it is intended to be a final expression of that agreement and a complete and exclusive statement of the terms.but extrinsic evidence is admissible to explain or interpret ambiguous language.code civ,subds.b g.whether the parol evidence rule applies depends upon whether there was an integration citation or a complete expression of the agreement of the parties citations.generally,finality may be determined from the writing itself.if on its face the writing purports to be a complete and final expression of the agreement,parol evidence is excluded.citations.pollyanna homes,berney cal d,pollyanna homes.
each service agreement provides this agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties,and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements,understandings,covenants and conditions relating to the subject matter hereof.this agreement may not be changed,amended,modified,or supplemented,except by a writing signed by both axium and the film clients.based on pollyanna homes,supra,cal d,we conclude that the foregoing integration clause establishes that the written service agreements are complete and final expressions of the parties terms.parol evidence,then,can only be used for purposes of interpretation.
contract interpretation part.
the film clients contend that the written service agreements required axium to use funds paid on invoices solely for payroll processing goldentree contends that axium use of the funds was unlimited.
when parties dispute the meaning of contractual language,the trial court must provisionally receive extrinsic evidence offered by the parties and determine whether it reveals an ambiguity,the language is reasonably susceptible to more than one possible meaning.if there is an ambiguity,the extrinsic evidence is admitted to aid the interpretative process.when there is no material conflict in the extrinsic evidence,the trial court interprets the contract as a matter of law.citations.if,however,there is a conflict in the extrinsic evidence,the factual conflict is to be resolved by the jury.citations.wolf walt disney pictures television th,d,fn.omitted.
the film clients maintain that they offered the following extrinsic evidence numerous examples of time cards,invoices and payments the deposition testimony of the individuals who entered into the service agreements confirming their understanding that axium was required to use the funds for payments designated by the invoices and the deposition testimony of jeff begun,a salesman for axium who stated that he understood that the film clients believed and expected that the funds would be used to make payments designated by the invoices.based on this evidence,the film clients argue that axium obligation to use the funds the film clients provided in payment of an invoice to make the payments designated and quantified in that invoice,if not explicit,is certainly implied by the process described in the service agreements.at the very least,the service agreements are reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that such an obligation existed.
underlying this argument is an insurmountable problem.the film clients make no attempt to dissect specific language of the service agreements.in other words,they do not quote a particular section,paragraph,sentence,phrase or word and tell us whether it is ambiguous.after reviewing the written service agreements on our own,we conclude that they do not impose any express limits on axium use of the funds.moreover,the contractual language is not reasonably susceptible to the film clients interpretation.regarding the contention that the written service agreements implied a restriction,the law offers no aid.a court may find an implied contract provision only if the implication either arises from the contract express language or is indispensable to effectuating the parties intentions it appears that the implied term was so clearly within the parties contemplation when they drafted the contract that they did not feel the need to express it legal necessity justifies the implication the implication would have been expressed if the need to do so had been called to the parties attention and the contract does not already address completely the subject of the implication.citations.in re marriage of corona th,d.without spending undue time on the matter,suffice it to say that the implied term urged by the film clients is not justified by legal necessity.there was no legal reason why the funds could not be paid to axium for its general use when the service agreements obligated axium to make all payroll related payments.
the film clients contend that axium was their paying agent with respect to the funds but the service agreements provide in relevant part nothing contained herein shall constitute a partnership between,nor joint venture by,the parties hereto or make either party an agent of the other.to overcome this obstacle,the film clients contend undoubtedly,the parties disclaimed any intent to form a general agency relationship under the service agreements.but axium did not act as the film clients general agent it acted as a special agent citation making specific designated payments for the film clients and,accordingly,is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation advanced by the film clients that axium was their paying agent.the infirmity with this argument is threefold.first,the service agreements disclaim agency as opposed to general agency.second,the film clients offered no extrinsic evidence or analysis regarding ambiguity or the meaning of the language.third,the language is not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that axium was the film clients special agent.
even if the service agreements did not initially create an agency relationship,the film clients argue that the service agreements were modified by conduct.they rely on employers reinsurance superior court th,d employers reinsurance.the film clients reliance is misplaced.employers reinsurance stated that course of performance can be used to interpret an insurance contract and made a passing reference to california uniform commercial code section,subdivision f.employers reinsurance,supra,at,d.that statute provides subject to section,a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance,subd.f.according to uniform commercial code section,subdivision,a signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing can not be otherwise modified or rescinded.employers reinsurance did not apply uniform commercial code section,subdivision f or section,subdivision.here,assuming that the uniform commercial code applies,that latter statute is triggered because the service agreements could only be modified in writing conduct,therefore,does not factor into our analysis.
in their reply brief,the film clients tacitly suggest that the parol evidence rule does not apply to disclaimers of agency.they cite wolf superior court th,d wolf and city of hope national medical center genentech,cal th,d,city of hope.in each case,the court held that no fiduciary duty existed.in doing so,they reviewed allegations wolf and evidence city of hope rather than relying on contractual disclaimers which,while broad,did not expressly disclaim the existence of a fiduciary duty.based on these cases,the film clients suggest that we must ignore the disclaimer of agency and examine the extrinsic evidence.but neither case discussed the parol evidence rule or,for that matter,the uniform commercial code.a decision is not authority for a proposition not considered.amwest surety ins.wilson cal th,d.
express trust.
the applicable law.
the probate code provides that an express trust can be created by a transfer of property by the owner to another person as trustee,subd.b witkin,summary of cal.law ed.trusts.but only if the settlor properly manifests an intention to create a trust.california trust law is essentially derived from the restatement second of trusts.over a number of years,the restatement second of trusts has been superseded by the restatement third of trusts.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.trusts.as a result,we may look to the restatement third of trusts for guidance.
when one person transfers funds to another,it depends on the manifested intention of the parties whether the relationship created is that of trust or debt.if the intention is that the money shall be kept or used as a separate fund for the benefit of the payor or one or more third persons,a trust is created.if it is intended,however,that the person receiving the money shall have the unrestricted use of it,being liable to pay a similar amount to the payor or a third person,whether with or without interest,a debt is created.the intention of the parties is ascertained by considering their words and conduct in light of all the terms and circumstances of the transaction.rest d trusts,com.k,see also abrams crocker citizens bank d.citing the same text in the restatement second of torts and noting that t he view expressed in the restatement has been generally adopted in california.in general,a settlor may manifest the intention to create a trust by written or spoken words,or by conduct.rest d trusts,com.b.the settlor is not required to use the words trust or trustee.ibid.in interpreting the settlor words and conduct,the circumstances surrounding the transfer may be considered unless they are excluded by the parol evidence rule.ibid.
nature of the relationship with axium excluding hostage.
the service agreements are not ambiguous,which means that extrinsic evidence can not be considered to explain the terms.thus,we are left with service agreements that imposed no limits on axium use of funds,but which also did not affirmatively state that the funds belong solely to axium.in our view,the service agreements therefore do not establish the existence of express trusts for the simple reason that the payroll parties did not properly manifest intention.our holding is consistent with the rule recognized by federal case law.in re black geddes,it is a firmly established principle that if a recipient of funds is not prohibited from using them as his own and commingling them with his own monies,a,not a trust relationship exists.in the absence of a trust,axium and the film clients had no more than a relationship.
in arguing that there are triable issues,the film clients advert to the following rules in the restatement third of trusts.it is immaterial whether or not the settlor knows that the intended relationship is called a trust,and whether or not the settlor knows the precise characteristics of a trust relationship.the manifestation of intention requires an external expression of intention as distinguished from undisclosed intention.citation.there may,however,be a sufficient manifestation of the intention to create a trust without communication of that intention to the beneficiary or to the trustee or any third person.citations.on the other hand,no trust is created unless the settlor manifests an intention to impose enforceable duties.rest d trusts,com.a,marsh home fed.sav.loan d.marsh an express trust may arise even though the parties in their own minds did not intend to create a trust.as in the case of the making of a contract,so in the case of a trust,an objective rather than a subjective test is applied.it is the manifestation of intention which controls and not the actual intention where that differs from the manifestation of intention.inferably,the film clients suggest that even if they did not intend to create an express trust,they did so unintentionally.but they run into the same wall as before.they did not properly manifest intention to create an express trust and the parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence from showing otherwise.
we now turn to a case cited by the film clients,chang redding bank of commerce th,d chang.there,a property owner chang hired a general contractor named paragon to construct a hotel.the contract provided that paragon shall promptly pay each subcontractor,upon receipt of payment from chang,out of the amount paid to paragon on account of such subcontractor work,the amount to which said subcontractor is entitled chang,supra,at,d.chang made the required payments and paragon deposited the money into its business checking account.it then issued checks to the subcontractors.the bank recorded the checks tendered by the subcontractors as paid,then reversed the transactions and seized the money as a setoff because paragon had defaulted on a loan.chang sued the bank for unjust enrichment and to impose a constructive trust.the bank obtained summary judgment,and the court of appeal reversed.it concluded that progress payments received by a general contractor pursuant to a contract which requires that they be paid to subcontractors are held by the contractor in trust for the benefit of the subcontractors.a bank that has knowledge sufficient to require inquiry whether funds deposited by a general contractor to its account with the bank are trust funds can not,as against the subcontractors,set off the funds to pay an indebtedness owed the bank by the general contractor.ibid.any attempt by the film clients to analogize to chang can not succeed.simply put,chang is distinguishable because the service agreements did not state that axium was specifically required to pay the employees out of the amounts paid to axium by the film clients.
in re golden triangle capital,cir.bap golden triangle and marsh are also distinguishable.
in golden triangle,a check was made payable to brandt,the principal of a lender called golden mortgage fund fund.fund agreed to loan to a company called camino del norte partners ii camino.camino principal was findley.the parties contemplated that a loan servicing agent gtc would received the funds from fund and transfer them to camino.according to fund,the front of the check to brandt stated re findley.brandt endorsed the back of the check restrictively and wrote,pay to.golden triangle,supra,at.the check was given to gtc,which deposited the check.before gtc could transfer the funds to camino,the california department of real estate and the fbi seized the funds and turned them over to gtc receiver.after gtc went into bankruptcy,fund filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the bankruptcy court to determine entitlement to the.in turn,the chapter trustee filed a motion for summary judgment and prevailed.on appeal,the ruling was reversed.id.at.the reviewing court concluded that the parties intended to create an express trust,and that gtc was intended to be a mere conduit for the funds.id.at.according to the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit,the e ndorsement by the lender president on the cashier check,pay to supports this intent.ibid.
at issue in marsh was whether funds held by a lender in property tax impound accounts were held in express trust.the court answered that question in the affirmative.it stated the manifested intent expressed by the loan document language held by the beneficiary in trust in the general funds without interest,italics added,leads to the conclusion the parties intended the money shall be kept or used as a separate fund for the benefit of the payor or a third person citation.citation.the lender clearly considered the impounds as something other than an ordinary debt where it reported the funds in a separate account and even on the briefest of financial statements separated the impounds from other debts.in their execution of these documents and then making the impound payments under these provisions the manifested their intent to create a trust complete with subject,purpose and beneficiary citation.these manifestations were accompanied by the acts and words expressing its acceptance of the trust and its subject,purpose and beneficiary citation.the lender drafted the documents expressing its trustee status in the establishment and operation of a specially designated account made up of borrowers money and as the draftsman would suffer an interpretation most strongly against it citations.the lender stated its intent to be a trustee for the benefit of the homeowner borrowers.it was not a debtor of the homeowner borrowers with unrestricted use of the impounds.marsh,supra,d at.relying on repealed,the restatement second of trusts.
golden triangle and marsh were both based on evidence of properly manifested intention,so they provide the film clients no aid.a perusal of the service agreements proves the point.they did not,as in marsh,state that the funds would be held by axium in trust.also,t
