evidence supporting verdict 
abc radio and disney argue the evidence children presented regarding damages due to misappropriation of does not support the verdict.abc radio and disney contend the theories of jonathan putnam putnam,the damages expert witness for children,were unfounded and speculative putnam considered evidence outside in reaching his conclusions and putnam could not identify the proper acceleration intervals of abc radio and disney entry into the market.abc radio and disney contend they provided the only competent evidence regarding any acceleration interval.abc radio and disney argue children damages were improperly based upon projected profits rather than actual results.finally,abc radio and disney assert children did not show evidence of any actual use of.
putnam testimony 
we review under an abuse of discretion standard a district court ruling admitting expert witness testimony under rule.bonner isp,cir.where the district court errs in admitting evidence,we will only grant a new trial or set aside a verdict if there is a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion.lovett ex rel.lovett union pac,cir.
putnam offered a theory regarding abc radio and disney accelerated entry into children radio.the jury could have used all or some or none of putnam various acceleration intervals eleven months to two years as benchmarks to calculate the appropriate amount of damages,depending on the jury findings regarding the amount of acceleration resulting from abc radio and disney conduct.in calculating the various intervals,putnam considered evidence,including two abc radio documents,regarding the length of time it would take to launch a children radio network.putnam accepted children testimony that children took about years to acquire the information in.putnam relied on documents from abc radio and disney saying the research and development children had done,though not specifically referring to the information in,would avoid abc pumping to million into this business and taking or years of sizable losses.one of the same documents also noted children had built a brand and an asset in this area and it would take abc radio a while to build up such research and development on its own.
putnam provided dollar amounts to the jury of the increased value of abc radio and disney based on three acceleration months,twelve months,and which putnam assigned the values of million,million,and million.although putnam did not testify as to the exact length of the acceleration interval,he did state the length of the acceleration interval would be determined by the time needed to recreate the information.as to the time for recreating the information,jane steinberg,vice president of syndicated programming and internet sales for abc radio,testified she could recreate the information on in less than a week,but children marketing manager,rick smith,testified it took four years to develop radio aahs and having the information would save a competitor a significant amount of time.an abc radio senior management review in january estimated abc could get to the same stage of development,in a reasonably short period of time months.
the district court stated it was satisfied with putnam credentials for valuing trade secrets,and putnam used an accepted academic methodology.the court found putnam testimony relevant and reliable under kumho tire carmichael,d.the court concluded abc radio and disney objections to putnam opinion were better directed to the weight of the testimony rather than admissibility.finally,the district court found the defendants had a full opportunity to putnam and could have presented expert testimony to rebut putnam assertions.
in the prior appeal,our court upheld the causation finding based partly upon an expert opinion that abc radio and disney were able to accelerate their entry into the market by using information,particularly information about advertising and marketing,they obtained from children.children,at.as a general rule,the factual basis of an expert opinion goes to the credibility of the testimony,not the admissibility,and it is up to the opposing party to examine the factual basis for the opinion in.only if the expert opinion is so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury must such testimony be excluded.bonner,at quoting hose chicago transp,cir.abc radio and disney failed to show putnam opinion was so unsupported that his testimony could offer no assistance to the jury.we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting putnam testimony.
b.other evidence 
under minnesota law,damages for breach of contract must be proved to a reasonable certainty,and a party can not recover speculative,remote,or conjectural damages.children,at citing leoni bemis.instead,o nce the fact of loss has been shown,the difficulty of proving its amount will not preclude recovery so long as there is proof of a reasonable basis upon which to approximate the amount.id.quoting leoni,at.further,d amages for misappropriation of a trade secret can include both the actual loss caused by the misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss.id.quoting.a.the jury award does not have to match any particular figure in the evidence as long as the award is within the mathematical limitations established by the various witnesses and is otherwise reasonably supported by the evidence as a whole.id.at quoting carroll pratt.
smith testified children took four years to develop radio aahs,and the information in would save a competitor a significant amount of time in entering the children radio market.children chief operating officer,james gilbertson,said the information contained in was not available to competitors and would be useful to competitors.for example,disclosed children rates and what advertising particular clients were buying.
children also presented documents from abc radio showing the importance of moving quickly to launch radio disney,including a document entitled competitive response to radio aahs,demonstrating abc radio and disney knew the value of quick entry into the children radio market.another letter from abc radio scott mccarthy to lynn,disney director of strategic planning and development,also cites the importance of moving quickly,stating for competitive reasons,i think it is essential to complete these steps and make a decision on this business segment within the next days,and noting further there is probably only room for one radio network focused on kids radio.after radio disney was implemented,james pastor,vice president of sales and marketing for radio disney,testified radio disney had been successful.children introduced a letter from disney president michael eisner to shareholders reporting,b y any measure,radio disney is a success.another radio disney document projected advertising revenue in at approximately million.
evidence was presented that abc radio and disney accelerated their entry into the market by using information contained in.gilbertson testified abc radio specifically requested the information contained in.abc radio bob callahan explained in an memorandum to abc radio jim arcara that,if abc radio entered the kids radio market with disney,abc could use the agreement with children as paid education and exploit children affiliate base.abc executive vice president,bart catalane,noted in a fax to abc david kantor that the agreement with children could be used as p aid tuition abc gets paid to learn the business from the inside with zero risk and could allow abc to take control of how we enter or children exits the market.finally,in an april,disney business plan draft or deck planning radio disney,disney noted because there is advertising room for only one hour children radio format in a market,radio disney will have to overcome radio aahs lead in markets,representing roughly of households,and radio disney network spots will be priced aggressively versus radio aahs radio disney spot rates are not projected to reach radio aahs current spot rates until.information actually showed up in this disney april,deck.see surgidev eye,cir recognizing the minnesota law inference t he fact that defendants have exhibited an intention to use this information is circumstantial proof of its value.alteration in original see also shelden barre belt granite employer union pension fund,cir declaring i t is well settled that the existence of a plan to do a given act is relevant to show that thereafter the act was in fact done.
sufficiency of evidence 
disney and abc radio arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence largely focus on the testimony of putnam.that the jury did not return a verdict precisely equivalent to the amounts provided by putnam testimony is immaterial.see sch.dist.sverdrup parcel and,cir as we stated in the previous appeal,t he jury was entitled to sort through the evidence presented at trial and to arrive at what it considered to be the damages caused by the conduct it found to be wrongful.in short,there was evidence from which the jury could approximate the amount of damages sustained by children.children,at.at the second trial,the jury sorted through the evidence and arrived at a figure within the parameters established by the evidence.id.quoting fudally ching johnson builders.the district court did not err in denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law.
standard of review 
abc radio and disney contend the district court erred in denying their motion for a new trial,claiming the verdict was against the weight of the evidence,the district court erred in permitting putnam to testify,and the district court erred in refusing to give certain jury instructions.the denial of motion for a new trial under.a is reviewed with great deference to the district court ruling and will not be reversed in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.belk city of eldon,cir.when the basis of the motion for a new trial is that the jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence,the district court denial of the motion is virtually unassailable on appeal.jones swanson,cir internal quotations omitted.
evidence presented 
weight of evidence and putnam testimony 
we have already addressed abc radio and disney contentions the jury verdict was against the greater weight of the evidence and the district court erred in allowing putnam to testify.after a thorough review of the record,we are persuaded that abc radio and disney failed to make the strong showing of abuse of discretion that is required.barnes parker,cir.children presented ample evidence to support the jury verdict.putnam was qualified to testify as an expert on children trade secret damages,and the defendants had an opportunity to him,present evidence to rebut his testimony,and argue in summation all of the inadequacies of putnam qualifications,credibility,methodology,and opinions.even assuming the district court erroneously admitted certain evidence,the evidence was not so prejudicial that a new trial would necessarily produce a different result.see wheeler.hwy.transp.comm n,cir.we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding substantial evidence supported the jury award.
jury instructions 
next,abc radio and disney argue the district court erred in declining to include several jury instructions related to the materiality of the breach,the lack of fiduciary duties,the absence of fraud,and the purpose of the contract.abc radio and disney requested these instructions because,as they contend,these instructions were the established law of the case.the standard for reviewing alleged errors in jury instructions is whether the instructions,taken as a whole and viewed in light of the evidence and applicable law,fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.jones,at.the form and language of jury instructions are committed to the sound discretion of the district court so long as the jury is correctly instructed on the substantive issues in the case.id.this court will reverse on the basis of instructional error only if it finds the error affected the substantial rights of the parties.id.
instruction number informed the jury of the first jury findings and limited the scope of the second jury role to determining the amount of children damages instruction number cautioned the jury 
the november,contract between children and abc did not restrict abc and disney right to compete against children.the establishment of radio disney can not be considered wrongful conduc
