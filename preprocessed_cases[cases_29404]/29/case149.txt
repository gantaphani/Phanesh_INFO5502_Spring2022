this case involves a dispute over mario andretti right of publicity.mario andretti and car sound exhaust system,car sound entered into a contract in which andretti agreed to be car sound corporate spokesperson.during the contract period,defendant borla performance industries,borla advertised a statement andretti had made about borla product.andretti had no prior knowledge and did not give borla permission to use his name or quotation.andretti and,collectively,andretti sued borla,seeking a permanent injunction and damages for violating andretti right to publicity,tortiously interfering with a business relationship,violating the michigan consumer protection act,quantum meruit,violating the lanham act a and c,and unfair competition.the district court granted summary judgment to borla on all the damage claims,but issued the permanent injunction against borla sought by andretti.the court then awarded rule sanctions against andretti,ordered andretti to pay the costs incurred by borla after it made an unsuccessful rule offer of judgment,denied borla other requests for costs and fees,and denied andretti request for costs.we affirm the district court rulings on every issue.
the facts underlying this case are undisputed and uncomplicated.mario andretti was a successful and well known driver before he retired from automobile racing.andretti is now a corporate spokesman for companies that contract with andretti for the exclusive right to utilize his name,image,likeness,and personal services.on november,andretti and car sound,a manufacturer of exhaust systems and catalytic converters,entered into a contract that provided car sound with the exclusive right for four years to utilize andretti rights of publicity with regard to exhaust systems.borla,car sound largest direct competitor,began an advertisement campaign in the spring of that included a quote from andretti in which he praised a borla product.borla received permission to use the quotation from the publication in which the quote originally appeared,but it did not seek or receive andretti permission.
andretti filed a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction against borla in oakland county circuit court,michigan,on march.borla removed the complaint to federal court.to demonstrate that the amount in controversy exceeded the federal diversity jurisdiction requirement of,borla attorney attached his own declaration to the notice of removal stating that andretti demands to borla were about.the parties stipulated to a preliminary injunction order on april.in june,andretti filed an first amended complaint,which included claims for violation of his right to publicity,tortious interference with a business relationship,violation of the michigan consumer protection act,quantum meruit,violation of the lanham act a and c,and unfair competition.borla made an offer of judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure on december.borla offer included for costs,expenses,fees,and damages and a permanent injunction forever barring,enjoining,and restraining defendant from using or disseminating any advertisement or promotional material that contains the quotation given by plaintiff,mario andretti,on page of the summer edition of the registry.andretti rejected the rule offer of judgment.
borla then filed several motions for summary judgment,including a motion for summary judgment on count ii,tortious interference with a business relationship,and a motion for summary judgment on count viii,unfair competition.borla also moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims,arguing that since andretti could not show any damages,his claims were moot due to borla offer to enter a permanent injunction.andretti moved to strike this third motion on procedural grounds.the district court granted the motion on count ii on april,granted the motion on count viii on april,granted the motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims on may,and denied andretti motion to strike the may,order.also on may,the district court issued the order entering judgment and granting injunction the judgment.the judgment was in favor of andretti and,and enjoined borla from using andretti quotes or likeness or implying that andretti endorsed borla products.the permanent injunction was worded identically to the preliminary injunction.andretti appealed from the may order but not the judgment.
borla then moved for costs,sanctions,and attorney fees pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d federal rule of civil procedure a the lanham trademark act the copyright act and federal rule of civil procedure.on august,the district court ruled that andretti was a prevailing party and therefore that borla was not entitled to costs or attorney fees as provided in rule d and the lanham act.the court also determined that borla was not entitled to attorney fees under the copyright act because,even though borla had argued that several of plaintiffs claims were preempted by the copyright act,plaintiffs had not directly alleged any copyright act claims and the court had not ruled that any of plaintiffs claims were preempted the district court did award rule sanctions against plaintiffs because plaintiffs failed to voluntarily dismiss count viii of the amended complaint,and ordered plaintiffs to pay defendant the costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuing the motion for summary judgment on that claim.furthermore,the district court awarded borla its costs incurred after december,the date it made its rule offer of settlement,because the relief obtained by plaintiffs was not more favorable than the rule offer.the costs totaled.finally,the district court rejected plaintiffs requests for costs as the prevailing party under rule d because their judicially sanctioned victory was insignificant and the final disposition of this case amounted to a victory for defendant.the parties.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by denying its motion to strike borla motion for summary judgment,granting borla motion for summary judgment based on the lack of evidence of damages,awarding borla costs under rule,sanctioning plaintiffs under rule,and refusing to award andretti costs under rule d.defendant argues that we lack jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs appeal because they appealed just the order granting defendant motion for summary judgment but not the judgment itself.it also the district court august,order,arguing that the district court erred by determining that plaintiffs were the prevailing party,denying its motion for fees under,and denying additional sanctions against plaintiffs for their refusal to voluntarily dismiss count ii we turn first to the jurisdiction issue.
jurisdiction 
borla contests this court jurisdiction over andretti appeal of the may,order because andretti has not appealed the judgment,and if we were to reverse the district court ruling against andretti,borla contends the district court judgment predicated on mootness would somehow remain in place with a hypothetically live damages claim,which is inconsistent with the doctrine of mootness.borla had previously moved to dismiss andretti appeal,but another panel of this court rejected borla motion,stating simply the fact that the plaintiffs did not also appeal the injunctive relief granted in their favor does not render moot their appeal of the dismissal of the claims for damages.order of.we agree.
we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to because a final judgment has been entered.andretti was not required to appeal a judgment in his favor in order to bring his appeal of a contemporaneously issued order adverse to his interests.if we were to decide that the may,order was incorrect because there was an issue of fact as to andretti damages,the order would be vacated and remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with our opinion.the judgment would still be valid and its injunction still in place.it would no longer be a final judgment because the district court would be required to conduct further proceedings consistent with our hypothetical decision,but the judgment would not be wholly inconsistent with our decision regarding damages,as borla argues.in any event,we explain immediately below why the district court correctly decided that andretti failed to produce evidence of damages,and therefore the effect of a reversal is purely hypothetical.
plaintiffs motion to strike defendant motion for summary judgment 
the district court amended scheduling order set the discovery and dispositive motion deadlines as january,and february,respectively.borla filed a motion to compel discovery on february,and the district court granted borla motion at a hearing on february,and in a written order dated february.the order required plaintiffs to provide renewed discovery responses by february,and for andretti to reappear for a deposition by march.on march,borla filed its motion for summary judgment arguing that andretti lack of evidence of damages combined with borla rule offer rendered the litigation moot.borla did not seek leave of the court for permission to file the late motion.andretti filed a motion to strike borla motion because it was filed after the february,deadline for dispositive motions.
the district court correctly analyzed the late motion as a request to modify the scheduling order.a scheduling order shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause and by leave of the district judge fed.civ.b.the primary measure of rule good cause standard is the moving party diligence in attempting to meet the case management order requirements.inge rock fin,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a district court should also consider possible prejudice to the party opposing the modification.id.we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to amend its scheduling order to allow a late filing.leary daeschner,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,when it improperly applies the law,or when it employs an erroneous legal standard.united states cline,cir.
the district court found good cause for the late filing and no prejudice to plaintiffs and it accordingly denied plaintiffs motion to strike borla motion.the court correctly determined that defendant had good cause because andretti did not complete his compelled responses to borla discovery requests until after the scheduled dispositive motion deadline,the court had previously granted borla leave to file two dispositive motions after the deadline,and borla motion raised an issue of justiciability.moreover,andretti has not shown that he suffered any prejudice because the motion was filed two weeks late.his only claim of prejudice is that the district court considered the motion and then ruled against him on the merits.there is no indication of prejudice,however,because there is no indication that the outcome of the motion would have been different had borla filed it before the deadline.
borla motion for summary judgment 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.smith ameritech,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
the district court decided that andretti did not produce any evidence of damages and therefore,in light of borla offer to enter a permanent injunction,andretti claims were moot.andretti argues that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to his damages because he had submitted evidence of damages in his supplementation of document requests and in his interrogatory responses,because borla failed to elicit evidence concerning damages when it deposed andretti,and because borla attorney admitted the fact of andretti damages in his declaration supporting removal from state court to federal court andretti arguments are without merit for the reasons explained below.
andretti did not present evidence of damages to the district court 
andretti argues that he did provide evidence of his damages to the district court because his supplemental responses to borla document requests were submitted as evidence.the supplemental responses consisted of andretti identification of documents that responded to each document request.the documents were identified by bates stamp numbers.the actual documents were not presented as evidence by either party.according to plaintiffs representations in the briefs,some of the documents identified in the response were contracts between andretti and various corporations in which andretti agreed to be a corporate spokesperson for considerable compensation.one of the contracts was andretti agreement with car sound,which revealed that car sound paid andretti annually for the use of his rights of publicity.plaintiffs argue that the reference to certain bates stamp numbers that correlate with the contracts demonstrates there is a host of evidence as to both the nature and amount of andretti damages in this case.we disagree.even though plaintiffs had the documents when they responded to the motion,plaintiffs admit that neither they nor borla presented the documents to the district court.moreover,the supplemental response listed only bates stamp numbers,not a description of the documents that were provided.the district court could not consider the evidentiary value of documents of which it was not aware 
the response to interrogatory did not create genuine issue of damages 
andretti claims that one of his interrogatory responses provides sufficient evidence of damages.interrogatory asked please describe in detail how plaintiff alleges that his good will and reputation has been damaged by borla advertisement at issue in this litigation,including but not limited to specific examples of how borla advertisement has affected plaintiff good will and reputation.andretti replied 
andretti objects to this interrogatory as overly broad,unduly burdensome,requests confidential and proprietary information,and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.without waiving this objection,borla advertisement has damaged andretti goodwill and reputation in the sense that the automotive industry is well aware of andretti exclusive,engagement with car sound.andretti occupation,now that his racing career is over,is that of a corporate spokesperson.his rights of publicity are his largest and greatest asset.it would be very easy for folks in the highly competitive automotive industry,given borla actions,to consider andretti one who provides his services purely for the money and without any allegiance or loyalty to the relationships he has worked diligently to establish over the years.all of his hard work and dedication could be erased by the one selfish move of a competitor like borla.
this response merely states a category of damages that andretti might incur,but he does not claim that he has actually suffered any damages in this case.possible damage to his reputation as a corporate spokesperson is purely hypothetical and is far too speculative to create a genuine issue of damages.see,johnson jones,cir holding that a court should not award damages that are wholly speculative.
defendant failure to ask about damages is irrelevant 
according to andretti,borla should be estopped from arguing that there is no evidence of damages because borla either knew of andretti damages or failed to elicit evidence concerning damages during discovery.this line of reasoning is without merit because once the movant of a summary judgment motion satisfies its burden by demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,the nonmoving party must produce specific facts demonstrating a genuine issue of fact for trial if it is to withstand summary judgment.leadbetter gilley,cir citing anderson liberty lobby,d.it was not borla burden to discover or produce evidence of andretti damages,especially when the evidence was exclusively within andretti control.moreover,andretti implies that borla misled the district court because the contracts demonstrated andretti damages and borla was familiar with the contracts,but borla represented to the district court that no evidence of damages existed.the contracts standing alone did not provide evidence of andretti damages.they helped establish the value of corporate sponsorship contracts,but did not show that any current contract or future contract opportunity was impaired.therefore,borla did not mislead the court by arguing that andretti had no evidence of actual damages.
attorney declaration is not evidence of damages 
andretti contends that borla attorney declaration contains an admission that andretti incurred damages.borla attorney,melvin raznick,attached his own declaration to the notice of removal of andretti complaint to federal court based on diversity.raznick declared that andretti,through his attorney,demanded in monetary damages in addition to a retraction of borla advertisement and borla promise not to run the ad in the future.raznick also declared that 
based upon the plaintiff own claims of stated damages in the amount of,plus the additional costs that would clearly be incurred by borla if plaintiff received his requested relief it is my good faith belief that the amount in controversy in the present action at the time of this notice o f removal exceeds the jurisdictional limit required under federal diversity jurisdiction.
raznick recounting of andretti demand for is not the equivalent of declaring that he believed andretti had indeed incurred damages of.raznik declaration necessarily implied that the amount in controversy was if proven.andretti contention that the declaration creates a question of fact as to his damages is unavailing.
rule sanctions 
borla moved for sanctions against andretti pursuant to.and arising out of andretti refusal to voluntarily dismiss claims ii and viii from the amended complaint.the district court awarded sanctions against andretti for failing to voluntarily dismiss count viii,but refused to award sanctions for his refusal to dismiss count ii.borla and andretti both appealed.
rule states 
b representations to the court.by presenting to the court a pleading,written motion,or other paper,an attorney is certifying that to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,
it is not being presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation 
the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law 
the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or,if specifically so identified,are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
rule sanctions are warranted if the attorney conduct was unreasonable under the circumstances.ridder city of springfield,cir.additionally,provides any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the united states or any territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.
we review a district court grant or denial of rule sanctions for abuse of discretion.tahfs proctor,cir.a court necessarily abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.ridder,at.
borla had moved for summary judgment on count ii,a claim for tortious interference with a contract or business relationship,on january.borla sought andretti concurrence before filing its motion,but andretti refused to voluntarily dismiss the claim.andretti offered to voluntarily withdraw count ii after borla prepared and filed the motion.borla refused to accept the voluntary dismissal because andretti would not agree to pay borla attorney fees and costs incurred in filing the motion.andretti response to borla motion did not dispute the merits of the motion,but instead asked the court to award it costs and attorney fees expended in responding to the motion because borla refused to accept their voluntary dismissal.the district court granted borla motion for summary judgment on claim ii,and deferred any decision regarding the award of costs and fees until after the case concluded.the court also stated 
the court is perplexed and disappointed by counsel failure to stipulate to an appropriate order which would have eliminated the need for extensive briefing on this matter.the lawyers or quite possible parties failure to stipulate to the relief requested before and after the instant motion was filed is most troublesome because it not only wastes judicial resources,but also creates unnecessary and avoidable expenses for the parties,one an individual involved in business and two corporations 
although defendant might justifiably have concerns regarding plaintiffs refusal to voluntarily dismiss count ii before february,it still refused to agree to a voluntary dismissal without a condition that plaintiffs pay defendant costs and legal fees.pls.resp.ex,february letter from defendant counsel.the court recognizes that defendant might have agreed to permit plaintiffs to voluntarily dismiss count ii and withdraw its motion for summary judgment,but still seek to recover its costs and fees.
the district court eventually denied borla motion for rule sanctions after issuing the judgment because it decided that both parties were at fault for allowing the motion for summary judgment on count ii to reach a judicial determination.borla argues the district court should not have considered its role in forcing judicial resolution of an essentially undisputed motion,but borla does not cite any case prohibiting the court consideration of the rule movant conduct when deciding whether to award rule sanctions moreover,other courts have refused to award rule sanctions when both parties contributed to the waste of judicial resources.see kassner ashley plaza mall,jarre heidelberger druckmaschinen.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it considered borla failure to accept andretti offer of voluntary dismissal.borla refusal cost the court time and resources by forcing it to analyze the substance of the motion,culminating in a opinion.since both parties contributed to the unnecessary expenditure of judicial resources,the district court was justified in letting the costs rest where they originated.
count viii 
andretti argues that the district court erred when it awarded sanctions against him for pursuing count viii.count viii of the amended complaint was titled unfair competition.four of the six substantive paragraphs making up the claim reference michigan compiled laws of michigan trademark infringement statute.section a requires a plaintiff to have a registered mark under that act,which andretti did not.andretti admitted that he did not have a registered mark as required by the statute.instead of voluntarily dismissing the claim,andretti moved to amend it so that he alleged a claim for common law unfair competition instead of statutory trademark infringement.
the district court granted borla motion for summary judgment on the claim and denied andretti motion to amend for three reasons.first,andretti raised the motion to amend in his response to defendant motion for summary practice prohibited by the local rules.second,andretti failed to submit a proposed amended complaint as required by the local rules.third,andretti motion to amend was untimely.the court had entered a scheduling order pursuant to rule,which set october,as the deadline for any amendments.andretti filed its response and motion to amend on february.in leary daeschner,cir,we held that when a plaintiff moves to amend a complaint after the deadline for amendments in the scheduling order has passed,rule a instruction for leave to be freely given must be read in conjunction with rule requirement that amendment of a scheduling order must only be made upon a showing of good cause and leave of the court.the district court denied his
