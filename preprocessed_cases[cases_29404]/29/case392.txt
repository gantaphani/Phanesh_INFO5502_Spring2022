plaintiff and respondent lindsay albanese,a celebrity stylist and style expert,sued defendant and appellant maria menounos,a television personality,for defamation and other torts.menounos moved to strike the complaint under code of civil procedure section,the statute the trial court denied the motion on the ground the disputed statements did not involve a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.in this appeal from the order of denial,we reject menounos contentions and affirm.
background 
i.the complaint allegations 
albanese complaint alleged as follows albanese worked at nbc from september to december,as a stylist for menuonos on the access hollywood set.after albanese employment with nbc ended,she saw menounos at a june,event at the mtv gift suite at the w hotel in hollywood.at that event,menounos aggressively demanded to speak with albanese,who was standing next to greg dava,an employee of the producer of the event.in front of peers,colleagues,and prospective business clients,defendant menounos loudly accused albanese of stealing by claiming,dolce and gabbana wo lend to me anymore because they said you never returned anything.albanese replied that the accusation was a lie.a few days later,greg dava informed albanese that immediately after the scene at the w hotel,menounos told greg dava that plaintiff albanese had been stealing from menounos when albanase was performing services for menounos.
based on the above allegations,albanese sued menounos for defamation,tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the complaint alleged the defamatory statements were made with express malice,actual knowledge of their falsity,and specific intent to injure albanese reputation and employment.the complaint sought damages for the injuries to albanese personal,business and professional reputation,embarrassment,humiliation,severe emotional distress,shunning,anguish,fear,loss of employment,and employability,and economic loss in the form of lost wages and future earnings.
ii.the special motion to strike 
menounos moved to strike the complaint under the statute.she contended the complaint was subject to dismissal under the statute because it arises from conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
menounos argued the alleged remarks that albanese had stolen from her and that dolce and gabbana wo lend to me anymore because they said you never returned anything constituted speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest because albanese is in the public eye and any statement concerning a person in the public eye qualifies as speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
in order to show that albanese is in the public eye,menounos attorney vicki greco stated in her declaration that albanese refers to herself as a style expert and celebrity stylist in her website,blog,twitter account and facebook account a google search of albanese name revealed over entries and hundreds of articles,images,reports and advertisements about albanese and her career as a celebrity stylist albanese appeared on the national television show hair battle spectacular albanese worked with nationally known figures such as maria menounos,paula abdul,and lara flynn boyle albanese dressed the female cast members of glee and the contestants on bachelors and bachelorettes and albanese served as a celebrity stylist spokesperson for nationally recognized products such as seven for all mankind and famous footwear shoes.
the trial court denied the motion under the first prong of the statute,stating in relevant part defendant has failed to make the threshold showing that the causes of action arise from protected activity as defined under section e.defendant argument is overly simplified that solely because albanese is a celebrity stylist and style expert,defendant alleged statements are protected activity.however,plaintiff does not rise to the level of being in the public eye for purposes of the statute.the cases cited by defendant are not helpful in establishing that she is in the public eye.see sipple foundation for nat.progress th,nationally known political consultant who devised media strategy se e lig infinity broadcasting th former participant of a reality type television show who refused to appear on a local radio show and subjected herself to inevitable public scrutiny and potential ridicule by the public and media.none of the other factors apply.the alleged statement that plaintiff stole from defendant does not involve conduct that could affect large numbers of people beyond the direct participants.further,the alleged statement does not involve a topic of widespread public interest.simply put,defendant alleged statements are not of public concern.
menounos timely appealed from the order denying her special motion to strike,subd.i,subd.a.
discussion 
section provides an expedited procedure for dismissing lawsuits that are filed primarily to inhibit the valid exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of speech or petition,subd.a digerati holdings,llc young money entertainment,llc th.the purpose of the statute is to encourage participation in matters of public significance and prevent meritless litigation designed to chill the exercise of first amendment rights,subd.a.the legislature has declared that the statute must be construed broadly to that end.ibid.digerati,supra,at.
a special motion to strike a complaint under section involves two steps.first,the moving party has the initial burden of making a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from a protected activity,subd.b.in order to meet this burden,the moving party must show the act underlying the challenged cause of action fits one of the categories described in section,subdivision e.cabral martins th.
once the moving party has made the threshold showing,the burden in step two shifts to the opposing party.under step two of the statutory analysis,the opposing party must demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b.a cause of action is subject to dismissal under the statute only if both steps of the analysis are met.
in an appeal from an order granting or denying a motion to strike under section,the standard of review is de novo.soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,fn.in considering the pleadings and supporting and opposing declarations,we do not make credibility determinations or compare the weight of the evidence.instead,we accept the opposing party evidence as true and evaluate the moving party evidence only to determine if it has defeated the opposing party evidence as a matter of law.ibid.
i.the public interest requirement of section,subdivision e 
where,as here,the disputed statements were not made in connection with an official proceeding,the moving party must show the statements were made in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subds.e,e.however,the statute does not define what constitutes a public issue or an issue of public interest.ibid.the lack of definition might be attributable to an assumption that no standards are necessary because judges and attorneys will,or should,know a public concern when they see it.citations.th.the lack of definition might also be attributable to the fact that the precise boundaries of a public issue are difficult to define.rivero american federation of state,county and municipal employees,afl cio th,rivero.in any event,given the lack of definition,confusion and disagreement about what issues truly possess public significance inevitably will arise,thus delaying resolution of section motions and wasting precious judicial resources.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th.
before analyzing menounos disputed statements,we briefly review a few cases in which the public issue requirement was discussed.
cases in which the public issue requirement was met 
hall time warner,th hall involved an invasion of privacy action filed by marlon brando retired housekeeper,blanche hall,against the producers of the national television show celebrity justice.brando,who won two academy awards for best actor,was famous for his exploits on and off the screen and his at times tumultuous private life.id.at.upon his death in,brando obituary appeared on the first page of major newspapers,including the new york times,los angeles times,and international herald tribune.ibid.accordingly,his death was a matter of public interest and when his will was probated,the news media reported that brando had disinherited several heirs and named hall as a beneficiary in his will.id.at.this revelation led the producers of celebrity justice to obtain a taped interview of hall at her nursing home,which they broadcast on their show.
hall denied authorizing either the interview or its broadcast and sued the producers for trespass,intrusion of seclusion,and other torts.the producers moved to strike hall complaint under the statute.the trial court denied the motion under the first prong of the statute,citing the lack of any public interest in hall,who was neither a public figure nor a limited purpose public figure and did not become a public figure by virtue of her association with brando will.hall,supra,th at.
the appellate court in hall reversed the denial of the motion.it concluded that because brando was a well known public figure,hall had become involved in an issue of public interest when she was named as a beneficiary in his will.hall,supra,th at.the court explained the public fascination with brando and widespread public interest in his personal life made brando decisions concerning the distribution of his assets a public issue or an issue of public interest.although hall was a private person and may not have voluntarily sought publicity or to comment publicly on brando will,she nevertheless became involved in an issue of public interest by virtue of being named in brando will.defendants television broadcast contributed to the public discussion of the issue by identifying hall as a beneficiary and showing her on camera.we conclude that the acts from which the complaint arises constituted conduct in furtherance of the defendants right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.id.at.
nygard,uusi kerttula th nygard involved a magazine article concerning a finnish celebrity,peter nygard,the chairman and founder of an international company with over employees worldwide.after a finnish magazine published an article critical of nygard and his company,the company filed suit in california against the magazine and the former employee whose statements were quoted in the article.the company alleged a variety of tort and contract claims,including breach of employment contract and defamation the employee and the magazine moved to strike the company complaint under the statute.the trial court granted the motion,finding the disputed statements were made in connection with an issue of interest to the finnish public.it stated that both the company and its founder,nygard,are internationally known public figures who spend a great deal of money and effort to promote their business,success,wealth and lifetstyle.further,the company employ s over employees worldwide.thus,the court said,the statements made by timo and published by the magazine involved highly visible public figures and issues of public interest.id.at.
in affirming the trial court ruling in nygard,we relied upon seelig infinity broadcasting,supra,th seelig,which held that a radio station disparaging remarks about a contestant on the television program who wants to marry a multimillionaire were made in connection with an issue of public interest.we also relied upon sipple foundation for nat.progress,supra,th sipple,which held that a magazine revelation of domestic violence allegations against a well known political consultant,who had used domestic violence issues to his clients advantage,was connected with an issue of public interest.
we concluded in nygard that because the evidence had shown the finnish public was interested in the magazine article regarding nygard and his company,the public interest requirement of section,subdivision e had been met according to evidence introduced by defendants in support of their motions to strike,there is extensive interest in nygard a prominent businessman and celebrity of finnish extraction among the finnish public.further,defendants evidence suggests that there is particular interest among the magazine readership in information having to do with nygard famous bahamas residence which has been the subject of much publicity in finland.the june article was intended to satisfy that interest.nygard,supra,th at.
