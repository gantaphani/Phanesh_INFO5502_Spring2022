defendant allegedly performed poorly and dishonestly in various ways,and the management company terminated her.she then demanded that plaintiff fire the company and hire her as his personal manager.when plaintiff refused,defendant threatened that if she did not receive severance pay,she would tell the press or a rhode island grand jury that plaintiff and the head of the management company steinman were embezzling money from the victims fund.defendant proceeded to claim,falsely,that plaintiff and steinman were stealing money from the tour.she allegedly made such statements to the press,people in the music industry,and rolling stone magazine,and they were republished by cnn headline news.
the complaint alleged that defendant statements were false,defamatory on their face,and made with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity hereafter constitutional malice.as a result,plaintiff suffered damages personally,and several tour concerts were cancelled by their venues.plaintiff alleged malice and prayed punitive damages.the second cause of action reiterated the first,and alleged that defendant statements had placed plaintiff in a false light before the public.a third cause sought injunctive relief against further defamatory statements.
defendant moved to strike the complaint under section,subdivision b.she averred that her alleged statements came within the free speech and public interest protections of section,subdivision e,and that many of the complaint charges were themselves false.
in opposition to the motion,plaintiff submitted declarations by himself,steinman,a former member of the band lardie,and the victims fund president potvin.the latter two testified,respectively,that defendant had told them that plaintiff was stealing and embezzling from the fund.among other things,steinman recounted that defendant had shared all of the tour accounting records.he also stated that defendant had falsely told the fund and the press that he and plaintiff were stealing from the fund.plaintiff testified to defendant threat to claim theft unless she were paid severance.principally based on steinman declaration regarding defendant knowledge of the tour finances,plaintiff argued that defendant had made her false accusations with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity.
defendant,now in pro,filed extensive evidence in reply,including a declaration by a member of the fund board.plaintiff filed objections to much of this evidence,which included magazine and internet articles.
on march,the court rendered its order granting defendant motion to strike.the court ruled that the statements allegedly made to steinman and potvin were privileged under civil code section,subdivision c,which concerns communications between interested persons,without malice absence of such malice was established by reason of the court conclusion that plaintiff had not shown constitutional malice by clear and convincing evidence.the court ruled that the claim that defendant had made her statements because she had not been paid severance was insufficient to establish constitutional malice.the court stated the statement to lardie had not been believed,and therefore had not caused special damages.

defendant again filed voluminous opposition,to which plaintiff filed numerous objections.plaintiff then filed further declarations.the court held two hearings,the second being an evidentiary one concerning plaintiff claim that defendant had submitted a forged declaration by the band former tour manager.at these hearings,defendant was represented by new counsel,keith bray.
on june,the court filed its order denying the motion for reconsideration,on the basis the evidence plaintiff had tendered had been available for the original motion.see,subd.a.the court ruled for defendant on the forgery question.the order stated that defendant could file a new bill of costs,to account for her attorney fees and costs for the reconsideration motion.the order concluded,defendant is to submit a form of judgment within days.no such form was submitted.
on july,defendant attorney bray filed a memorandum of costs,claiming attorney fees of,witness fees of for a questioned documents examiner,and for a private investigator.
