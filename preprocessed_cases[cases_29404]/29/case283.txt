in these consolidated malicious prosecution cases william tucker and the estate of cynthia delores tucker the tuckers appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to all defendants in both cases.in tucker interscope,we affirm the district court ruling as to all defendants.in tucker kenner,we affirm the district court summary judgment as to defendant thomas however,as to defendant kenner we affirm the district court ruling in part and reverse in part,and remand for trial.we also affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to tucker loss of consortium claim in both cases.
in the early,cynthia delores tucker,whose history as an activist dates back to the civil rights movement of the and,became concerned with the increasing popularity of the style of music known as gangsta rap,particularly its appeal to youth.she enlisted the support of notable entertainers including dionne warwick and melba moore to engage in lobbying and media outreach,with the goal of limiting the sale of gangsta rap to young people.her efforts brought her with two of the genre most successful production and distribution labels death row records,and interscope records.after tucker and other members of her coalition approached suge knight,of death row,about entering into a distribution contract with the media behemoth time warner,death row and its distributor interscope filed separate federal court actions the underlying litigation against tucker,alleging intentional interference with their exclusive contractual relationship and other related claims.
after death row and interscope successfully moved for dismissal without prejudice,the tuckers filed separate lawsuits against the two entities and their lawyers in federal district court,invoking diversity jurisdiction and charging them with malicious prosecution.her husband william tucker sought damages for loss of consortium as a derivative claim.applying california law,the district court granted summary judgment in both cases based on its conclusion that the tuckers evidence did not create a genuine issue of fact as to whether any of the defendants had acted with malice,a necessary element of a malicious prosecution claim.the district court also dismissed tucker loss of consortium claim on the grounds that tucker failed to carry his burden of production and that without a viable claim for malicious prosecution,his derivative claim failed as a matter of law.
reviewing de novo the grants of summary judgment in both cases,we conclude that,on the evidentiary record before the district court,it correctly with regard to the claim for abuse of process included in the complaint filed by death row attorney david the tuckers did not present sufficient evidence to defeat the motions for summary judgment on the issue of malice.we therefore affirm the summary judgment in tucker interscope,and affirm in part and reverse in part the district court grant of summary judgment in tucker kenner.we remand for trial the tuckers malicious prosecution claim against kenner to the extent that it is predicated on the abuse of process claim that he included in death row tucker.as we explain below,as to that one claim the tuckers have raised a genuine triable issue of fact.
factual and procedural background 
to fully understand these consolidated appeals,it is necessary to set forth the history of the two cases in some detail.because the district court did not provide an extensive recitation of undisputed facts,we rely primarily on the parties briefs and the record for the following factual overview,noting factual disputes where they exist and construing any ambiguities in favor of the tuckers,as the parties.
a.the underlying dispute 
tucker was a prominent civil rights advocate who served as the first secretary of state of pennsylvania,the first chair of the national federation of democratic women,and the chair of the democratic national committee black caucus.she also cofounded and chaired the national political congress of black women,npc,a organization dedicated to promoting women education and political,economic,and cultural development.
during the early,tucker became troubled by the growing popularity of gangsta rap.of particular concern to tucker was the genre influence on youth,who she feared would adopt the music violent and sometimes misogynist perspectives.at the npc biennial meeting in,tucker enlisted the help of artists dionne warwick,melba moore,and terri rossi,along with lobbyist voncier alexander,to form an entertainment commission for the npc that would support entertainers,and particularly women.the entertainment commission adopted a mission to eliminate barriers facing artists and executives to mobilize entertainers to address important issues affecting communities and to reshap e and maintain positive images to preserve the dignity and heritage of our youth.from to,the entertainment commission worked with prominent individuals in entertainment and media,along with religious leaders and lobbyists,to put pressure on music producers and distributors to halt the sale of gangsta rap to minors.among tucker more efforts in pursuit of this goal were an appearance at a time warner shareholder meeting,where she offered time warner executives to read aloud gangsta rap lyrics from albums distributed under its name,and a protest against the sale of gangsta rap albums outside a tower records store,for which she was arrested.
death row is an independent record label founded in by suge knight and the rap artist dre.death row signed extremely popular gangsta rap stars including dre,tupac shakur tupac,snoop doggy dogg snoop,and danny boy,generating enormous profit,and notoriety,for the label throughout the.interscope is a general partnership that records and distributes popular music.like death row,it gained success and prominence during the through the distribution and sale of gangsta rap.from to,death row maintained an exclusive contractual relationship with interscope,whereby interscope was the sole distributor of death row music.
in,tucker and the entertainment commission began to direct their rap campaign at death row.knight,death row outside counsel david kenner,and omar bradley,who was then the mayor of compton,california,were invited to the npc biennial convention in july,where they attended a meeting with tucker and other members of the entertainment commission.some who initiated the in dispute,but it is uncontested that this meeting occurred.according to tucker deposition testimony,during the meeting she spoke with knight about the influence of gangsta rap on youth and asked him to change the violent and misogynist nature of the lyrics on the albums he produced.tucker testified that knight agreed to make changes and to come back to the entertainment commission with a sample.
at some point shortly before or after the npc convention,warwick held an informal meeting with knight,snoop,and danny boy at her home in los angeles.according to warwick,the group discussed removing several references to women as bitches and ho on dogg food,an album by tha dogg pound that death row would soon be releasing.warwick testified at her deposition that she relayed this information to tucker,alexander,and michael fuchs,of warner music group,an affiliate of time warner.
the summary judgment record contains a letter,dated august,printed on npc letterhead.the letter appears to be from knight,though it does not bear his signature.it is addressed to tucker in her capacity as chair of the npc.the letter commemorates the purported details of knight meeting with tucker at the npc convention and reads in part 
i knight hereby designate and authorize the npc to negotiate an acceptable contract relationship with time warner regarding the production and distribution of death row music products.i hereby understand that the above arrangement is based on the fact that my company will cease and desist from the production and distribution of misogynist,obscene and pornographic music this authorization is submitted to demonstrate my good faith in cooperating with the npc in every way possible to reverse the negative trends in music.
there is conflicting testimony as to the circumstances of the letter drafting,but according to tucker own testimony it was drafted in the npc office at her request.tucker also testified that she gave the final okay to it.
on august,another meeting took place at warwick house.in attendance were warwick,tucker,fuchs,and alexander.knight was invited but did not attend.kenner testified at his deposition that he spent that day with knight and that knight received several phone calls throughout the day from someone at the meeting.according to kenner,knight was offered million and two recording studios if he would agree to break death row contract with interscope and enter into a new contract with the warner music group.warwick and tucker each testified,when deposed,that no one at the meeting made such an offer to knight warwick also testified that knight called her that day at least four times to discuss problems he had with the august letter.
on august,kenner sent warwick a letter on knight behalf,indicating that knight has never conveyed the authorization for the npc to negotiate a contract with death row and time warner and to the extent that there is any misapprehension knight hereby specifically repudiates any such agreement fuchs sic offer,as conveyed to knight,of an advance and to provide him with two studios if he would agree to sign directly with is specifically rejected.
b.the underlying litigation 
on august,interscope filed a complaint interscope tucker in the united states district court for the central district of california,charging tucker with inducement to breach contract,interference with contractual relations and prospective business advantage,attempting to induce breach of fiduciary duty,and unfair business practices and unfair competition.interscope sought damages and an injunction enjoining tucker from attempting to induce death row to breach its contract,interfering with the death row contract,tortiously interfering with interscope prospective business advantage,and attempting to induce time warner atlantic records to breach their fiduciary duties to interscope the complaint listed charles ortner,geoffrey thomas,and belinda orem from the law firm of paul,hastings,janofsky walker,llp paul hastings as attorneys for interscope.
on august,death row filed a complaint death row tucker in the united states district court for the central district of california,naming as defendants tucker,the npc,time warner,warner music group,fuchs,and gerald levin,who was of time warner board of directors.the complaint charged all defendants with racketeering aiding and abetting racketeering under b and c conspiring to violate b and c conspiring to interfere with advantageous business relationships extortion unfair business practices and abuse of process.the complaint also sought to enjoin all defendants from engaging in extortion,interfering with death row first amendment rights,and any other unlawful act alleged in this complaint.kenner was listed as counsel for death row.
interscope tucker and death row tucker were assigned to the same district court judge.the district court granted tucker motion for judgment on the pleadings in interscope tucker as to the claim for inducement to breach a contract but denied the motion as to the remaining claims.activity continued until june,when interscope and death row each filed motions for voluntary dismissal on the grounds that tucker is essentially judgment proof and interscope and death row no longer had a contractual relationship for business reasons unrelated to this litigation.the district court granted the motions and dismissed both interscope tucker and death row tucker without prejudice,over tucker objection that the suits should be dismissed with prejudice.
c.the malicious prosecution litigation 
within a month of the dismissal,the tuckers filed their complaint in tucker interscope in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,invoking diversity jurisdiction.the complaint charged interscope,death row,ortner,and paul hastings interscope defendants with malicious use of civil proceedings,abuse of process,intentional infliction of emotional harm,common law civil conspiracy,and racketeering conspiracy in violation of d.upon defendants motion,the case was transferred to the central district of california.the tuckers later successfully moved to withdraw all but the malicious prosecution and loss of consortium claims.
the tuckers filed their complaint in tucker kenner in the united states district court for the central district of california,naming kenner and thomas as defendants kenner defendants,along with five other defendants who were subsequently dismissed,and again invoking diversity jurisdiction the kenner complaint similarly raised claims for malicious prosecution and loss of consortium,in addition to abuse of process,slander,and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court later dismissed all but the malicious prosecution and loss of consortium claims.
after discovery,the interscope and kenner defendants filed separate motions for summary judgment based on an affirmative defense of unclean hands lack of favorable termination existence of probable cause lack of malice insufficient evidence of damages and no loss of consortium.the district court granted the motion on the basis of insufficient evidence of damages and no loss of consortium but declined to address the other issues on the ground that they were moot.we reversed the summary judgment rulings in both cases in an unpublished memorandum disposition.see tucker kenner.cir unpublished we remanded with instructions to the district court to consider the remaining grounds for summary judgment unclean hands lack of favorable termination existence of probable cause and lack of malice.id.at.
on remand,the interscope and kenner defendants again filed for summary judgment asserting an unclean hands affirmative defense lack of favorable termination no loss of consortium and existence of probable cause for the underlying claims and lack of malice.
in tucker interscope,the district court concluded that genuine issues of fact existed as to favorable termination and defendants affirmative defense of unclean hands.it concluded,however,that all interscope defendants had probable cause to pursue claims for intentional interference with contractual relationship,intentional interference with prospective business advantage,and unfair business practices and unfair competition.however,regarding interscope,ortner,and paul hastings,the district court found that genuine issues of fact existed as to whether they had probable cause to pursue the claims for inducement to breach contract and inducement to breach fiduciary duty.regarding death row,the district court found that genuine issues of fact existed as to whether it had probable cause to pursue the claims for rico violations,state law extortion,and abuse of process.
in addition,the district court concluded that the tuckers failed to produce any evidence to show that the interscope defendants acted with malice in filing the underlying lawsuits and that tucker alleged injuries were insufficient to support a claim for loss of consortium.it therefore dismissed the malicious prosecution claim based on insufficient evidence of malice and dismissed the loss of consortium claim because it was alleged as a derivative claim and because tucker evidence was insufficient to establish a loss of consortium.the tuckers timely appealed the district court judgment,case 
in tucker kenner,the district court concluded that kenner and thomas had probable cause to pursue the claims for intentional interference with contractual relationship,intentional interference with prospective business advantage,and unfair business practices and unfair competition.it concluded that material issues of fact remained whether thomas had probable cause to pursue the claims for inducement to breach contract and inducement to breach fiduciary duty and whether kenner had probable cause to pursue the claim for abuse of process.the district court further concluded that material issues of fact remained as to favorable termination and defendants unclean hands affirmative defense.
as in tucker interscope,however,the district court concluded that the tuckers failed to produce any evidence to show that thomas acted with malice and therefore dismissed the malicious prosecution and loss of consortium claims against him.the court also dismissed the loss of consortium claim against kenner for lack of evidence but did not address whether the tuckers evidence could show that kenner acted with malice.in response to this ambiguity,kenner filed a second motion for summary judgment on the basis of lack of malice and for clarification of the court prior ruling.the district court subsequent ruling determined that the malicious prosecution claim against kenner should be dismissed because the evidence plaintiffs offer in addition to this finding is insufficient to show that kenner acted with malice.therefore,a reasonable jury could not return a verdict in the tuckers favor and summary judgment was warranted the tuckers timely appealed this judgment as well,case.

the malicious prosecution claims 
under california law,a malicious prosecution claim is disfavored and requires proof that the underlying litigation 
was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his,plaintiff,favor was brought without probable cause and was initiated with malice.
zamos stroud,cal th,d,internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.in addition,the plaintiff must demonstrate resulting damage by way of attorneys fees incurred in defense,mental distress,injury to reputation or social standing.harbor ins.cent.ins,d.because,with one exception,we conclude that the tuckers evidence did not establish a genuine issue of fact as to malice,we do not address the element of favorable termination for tucker we discuss the element of probable cause to the extent it relates to malice.
a.the elements of malice and probable cause 
the malice element of the malicious prosecution tort relates to the subjective intent or purpose with which the defendant acted in initiating the prior action sheldon appel albert oliker,cal d.in sierra club found.graham,th,d,the california court of appeal explained 
m alice is present when proceedings are instituted primarily for an improper purpose.suits with the hallmark of an improper purpose are those in which the person initiating them does not believe that his claim may be held valid the proceedings are begun primarily because of hostility or ill will the proceedings are initiated solely for the purpose of depriving the person against whom they are initiated of a beneficial use of his property the proceedings are initiated for the purpose of forcing a settlement which has no relation to the merits of the claim.
id.at internal quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted.malice is usually a question of fact for the jury to determine.see sheldon appel,at.summary judgment on the basis of lack of malice is nonetheless appropriate when there is no evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the defendant pursued the underlying action with malice.see ghebreselassie coleman sec,cir affirming summary judgment dismissal of malicious prosecution claim under california law when plaintiff could point to no evidence from which a could reasonably infer that the investigators or the employer lacked probable cause or that they acted with malice.
probable cause,in contrast,is a question of law that turns on whether the underlying claim was legally tenable,as determined on an objective basis.padres henderson,th,d.whereas the element of malice focuses on the defendant state of mind at the time he initiated the underlying litigation,probable cause 
is measured by the state of the defendant knowledge,not by his intent.t he standard applied to defendant consciousness is external to it.the question is not whether he thought the facts to constitute probable cause,but whether the court thinks they did.
sheldon appel,at quoting dir.kastenbaum.emphasis in sheldon appel.
the elements of malice and probable cause therefore require different showings.the probable cause inquiry is objective,asking whether a reasonable person would have thought that the claim was legally tenable without regard to her mental state.roberts sentry life,th,d.the only potential factual issue for purposes of probable cause is the state of the defendant knowledge at the time she initiated the underlying lawsuit.sheldon appel,at w hen the state of the defendant factual knowledge is resolved or undisputed,it is the court which decides whether such facts constitute probable cause or not.id,at 
malice,on the other hand,is shown through evidence of the subjective mental state of the defendant in instituting the prior action.downey venture lmi ins,th,d,internal quotation marks omitted.because the objective reasonableness of the underlying lawsuit is separate from a defendant subjective mental state in bringing it,
by itself,the conclusion that probable cause is absent logically tells the trier of fact nothing about the defendant subjective state of mind t he presence of malice must be established by other,additional evidence.t hat evidence must include proof of either actual hostility or ill will on the part of the defendant to deliberately misuse the legal system for personal gain or satisfaction at the expense of the wrongfully sued defendant.
id.at citations and footnote omitted emphasis added see also grindle lorbeer,d,i n a given case,unreasonable behavior which could lead to a determination that there was a lack of probable cause to file,might not provide a sufficient basis to infer malice.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
as recently as the california court of appeal has emphasized that where malice must be shown,only other,additional evidence apart from a lack of probable cause,is sufficient,goldstein,th,d citing downey venture,th at,d,disapproved on other grounds by zamos stroud.in,that additional evidence was the deposition testimony of defendant goldstein.in her testimony goldstein admitted as true facts that she had alleged were false in her complaint against.when her complaint was dismissed,brought suit for malicious prosecution.the court of appeal determined that the discord between goldstein two accounts,as well as her settlement tactics in the earlier litigation raised a material issue as to whether she knowingly brought an action without probable cause.id.confirms our understanding of california law that the two cause and not only distinct but that a lack of probable cause,standing alone,does not support an inference of malice.id 
for the reasons that follow,we conclude for the abuse of process claim filed by david tuckers evidence did not create a triable issue of fact whether the interscope or kenner defendants acted with malice in pursuing interscope tucker and death row tucker.although the tuckers have not attempted to differentiate their evidence of malice as it relates to interscope and death row as parties in the underlying litigation and to ortner,kenner,thomas,and paul hastings as attorneys for the parties,we note that a party malfeasance in initiating a lawsuit is not imputable to counsel.see zeavin lee,d.nor are claims related to continuing such a lawsuit interchangeable for parties and attorneys we therefore separately consider the two groups of defendants.
defendants death row and interscope 
the tuckers first assert that they could prove malice to a jury because they have contested factual allegations made in the complaints in death row tucker and interscope tucker.a bare assertion that defendants fabricated evidence does not show malice.sangster paetkau,th,d,see also.e the tuckers evidence comprises only tucker deposition testimony that the underlying cases were lies,and that the reason this malicious prosecution suit was filed,and similar statements by tucker.these unsubstantiated assertions do not create a triable issue of fact regarding the existence of malice.moreover,the fact there may be some disputed facts relevant to the merits of the underlying action does not by itself defeat a motion for summary judgment in a malicious prosecution action.sangster,d at.
the tuckers also argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of lack of malice when there were genuine issues of fact regarding the existence of probable cause for some claims brought in the underlying litigation.but the fact that the district court found triable issues of fact as to probable cause for some claims,without more,is insufficient to survive summary judgment based on lack of malice.see paulus bob lynch ford,th,d,malice can not be established simply by a showing of the absence of probable cause downey,d at holding that underlying claim lack of legal tenability without more,would not permit the inference of malice and requiring that the presence of malice be established by other,additional evidence.as explained above,malice requires proof of a defendant subjective state of mind a conclusion that probable cause as an objective inquiry is absent logically tells the trier of fact nothing about the defendant subjective state of mind.downey,d at.even if we were to agree with the dissent that probable cause was lacking for many of the claims alleged in death row tucker and interscope tucker,the evidence provided by the tuckers is simply not probative of the subjective intent in filing the underlying lawsuits.
in padres,the court of appeal concluded that the plaintiff established a prima facie case of malice because,in addition to the lack of probable cause,the defendant filed repeated actions against the plaintiff in order to interfere with derail the plaintiff business venture.d at.this evidence of subjective intent was in addition to the lack of probable cause and was sufficient to defeat summary judgment.see id.in hms capital,lawyers title,th,d,the court similarly found that the plaintiff had made a prima facie showing of malice sufficient to defeat the defendant motion when it produced evidence that the defendant knew the underlying suit lacked any factual basis,took no depositions,and offered to accept in exchange for dismissing the case.id.at.these facts could support a conclusion that defendant was simply trying to squeeze a settlement from plaintiff on a baseless case,and hence evidence of malice.id.at.
the tuckers argue that they,too,have produced evidence of malice with respect to death row and interscope.specifically,they rely on a advertisement taken out in the october issue of the source,a popular magazine,which they characterize as calling for tucker elimination,and derogatory references to tucker in the songs how do u want it and wonda why they call u bitch on tupac album all eyez on me the tuckers assert that a jury could infer from the ad and lyrics that death row and interscope harbored hostility toward tucker and that they brought the underlying lawsuits for the improper purpose of chilling her campaign.
we disagree because under california law malice is shown through evidence of the subjective mental state of the defendant in instituting the prior action.downey venture,d at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.this is not a case like padres,where repeated actions were filed,or hms capital were no depositions were taken and questionable settlement tactics were pursued.here,even assuming the tuckers produced sufficient evidence from which a jury could connect the ad in the source or tupac lyrics to either interscope or death row such conduct occurred months after the suits were initiated and is simply not probative of either party subjective intent in filing the underlying litigation.placing an ad to promote snoop dogg latest album,or calling out an individual in if done so in a shocking and degrading not present any of the hallmark s of a lawsuit brought for an improper purpose.see sierra club,supra,th at,d.nor does zamos address this question on this record,no california authority supports,nor could any reasonable finder of fact infer,that this conduct was probative of why the parties filed interscope tucker and death row tucker.
the tuckers next assert that a jury could infer improper purpose from the fact that death row and interscope prosecuted the underlying lawsuits for three years without seeking a hearing on their claims for injunctive relief and then voluntarily dismissed the suits.in light of the tuckers own discovery delays,for which they were sanctioned,the mere fact that the litigation never progressed to a hearing or trial on the merits is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact regarding malice.nor do the voluntary dismissals in death row tucker and interscope tucker suggest that death row and interscope initiated those lawsuits believing their claims to be meritless.sierra club,d at rejecting argument that settlement was relevant to the issue of defendant state of mind for purposes of the malicious prosecution.the tuckers produced no evidence to undermine defendants explanation that they dismissed death row tucker and interscope tucker upon the termination of their contractual relationship,at which point most of the underlying claims for injunctive relief became moot and the underlying claims for damages,given that the tuckers were,became futile.nor could a jury reasonably infer that the statements in the defendants motions that the tuckers were were somehow meant to disguise the absence of any fact supporting the outrageous claims asserted.dissent at.to the contrary,the california court of appeal has encouraged timely dismissals,noting that 
the law favors the early resolution of disputes,including voluntary dismissal of suits when the plaintiff becomes convinced he can not prevail or otherwise chooses to forego the action.this policy would be by a rule which would virtually compel the plaintiff to continue his litigation in order to place himself in the best posture for defense of a malicious prosecution action.
leonardini shell oil,d,citation omitted.
finally,the tuckers assert they can demonstrate malice on the ground that interscope named only tucker and atlantic ventures nominally as a defendant.given that the strongest evidence supporting interscope claims was the august letter bearing tucker name,the decision to name only tucker rather than other members of the npc and its entertainment commission reflects a prudent litigation decision and is not evidence that the parties knowingly brought an action without probable cause or that they harbored especial ill will towards tucker.
in sum,we agree with the district court legal conclusion that the tuckers did not produce sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that either death row or interscope pursued the underlying litigation out of malice.
ortner,thomas,kenner,and paul hastings 
to show that ortner,thomas,kenner,and the law firm of paul hastings acted with malice in pursuing the underlying litigation on behalf of their clients,the tuckers must do more than rely on the evidence relating to death row and interscope own purposes in initiating death row tucker and interscope tucker.see zeavin.at rejecting the argument of joint liability of attorney and client for the conduct of each other where both are joined as defendants in a malicious prosecution action and noting that the client is not the agent of his attorney see also morrison rudolph,th,d,usually,the client imparts information upon which the attorney relies in determining whether probable cause exists for initiating a proceeding.the rule is that the attorney may rely on those statements as a basis for exercising judgment and providing advice,unless the client representations are known to be false.quoting mallen smith,legal malpractice ed,emphasis added,disapproved of on other grounds by zamos,d,at.to ultimately prevail against any of the,the tuckers must show other,additional evidence that demonstrates the attorney own malice or knowing lack of probable cause,th at,d citing downey venture,th at,d see also ross kish,th,d,holding that because the evidence suggests the knew the claims for breach of contract and legal malpractice lacked factual and legal support,a trier of fact reasonably could infer the filed the action with malice.
kenner and the claim for abuse of process 
with respect to the abuse of process claim in death row tucker,the tuckers have raised a triable issue of fact under the above standard.a reasonable could infer from kenner drafting of the complaint that kenner knew the abuse of process claim lacked merit in drafting the complaint,kenner alleged that tucker wrongful use of the criminal and civil justice system was an abuse of process under california state law.the only fact in the complaint to support that allegation was that suge knight was specifically threatened that as a result of tucker power and influence that he would spend the rest of his life in jail.even if kenner sincerely relied on his client representations that such a threat was made by tucker,kenner use of that allegation to state an abuse of process claim provides a triable issue as to whether kenner did so with malice.
this is because under california law,the tort of abuse of process requires misuse of a judicial process.stolz wong commc ns,th,d.it is a process that is pursuant to authority of a court.meadows bakersfield sav.loan ass,d,see id.t he essence of the tort abuse of process lies in the misuse of the power of the court it is an act done in the name of the court and under its authority for the purpose of perpetrating an injustice.see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.to succeed in an action for abuse of process,a litigant must establish that the defendant contemplated an ulterior motive in using the judicial process,and committed a willful act in the use of th at process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceedings.oren royal oaks venture greenberg,bernhard,weiss karma,cal d.misuse of an administrative one that is not support a claim for abuse of process.stolz,th at,d noting that there is no authority that extends the tort to administrative proceedings.nor is there any citation to standing committee on discipline ross not threats made outside of the judicial process can form the basis for an abuse of process claim.see ross,cir threatening criminal charges to obtain an advantage in an ongoing civil action subjected lawyer to disciplinary proceedings.
here,in drafting the abuse of process claim,kenner relied on vague language about wrongful use of the criminal and civil justice system despite clearly established law that requires misuse of a court process moreover,he supported the claim with the mere factual assertion that tucker would use her influence to ensure that knight went to jail.these circumstances raise a genuine triable issue of fact as to kenner subjective mental state in instituting the claim.downey venture,d at.a could reasonably infer from kenner drafting of the complaint that he did not believe the claim was valid when filed,or that the claim was instituted for an improper purpose 
ortner,thomas,paul hastings and the remaining claims against kenner 
with respect to ortner,thomas,paul hastings,and the remaining claims against kenner,the tuckers fail to pinpoint how any of the evidence in the record suggests that any of the filed death row tucker and interscope tucker for a purpose other than honoring their clients wishes.the tuckers have not shown,with respect to these remaining claims,that the attorneys affirmatively knew that the factual bases for the underlying suits to be false at the time the suits were filed,morrison,d at.nor have the tuckers shown that any continued to prosecute any of the remaining claims after learning that they were not supported by probable cause.zamos,d,at.given this lack of evidence,the district court correctly concluded that no reasonable trier of fact could find that the,with the exception of kenner claim for abuse of process,acted with malice when they filed the underlying litigation on behalf of death row and interscope 
loss of consortium 
tucker claim for loss of consortium was derivative of his wife cause of action for malicious prosecution.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all the kenner and interscope defendants,in part,on the basis that tucker claim was tied to the malicious prosecution claims,which the court determined did not survive summary judgment.were this the only basis for the court disposition of this claim,reversal might well be warranted because we have concluded that the malicious prosecution claim must proceed as to kenner.see snyder michael stores,cal th,d,one spouse can not have a loss of consortium claim without a prior disabling injury to the other spouse.
however,the district court also reached the merits of tucker claim and concluded on the limited evidentiary record that,the harm is more akin to a loss of society and companionship than the type of longstanding and debilitating impairment to the relationship necessary to support a loss of consortium.we can affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on any basis supported by the record,and we agree.
to support a loss of consortium claim,marital spouses must allege that their partner suffered an injury that is sufficiently serious and disabling to raise the inference that the conjugal relationship is more than superficially or temporarily impaired.molien kaiser found,cal d,anderson northrop,d,same.the injury may be physical or psychological,but psychological injury must rise to the level of a neurosis,psychosis,chronic depression,or phobia to be sufficient to substantially disturb the marital relationship.anderson.at,quoting molien,at.
we agree with the district court that tucker testimony does not raise a triable issue as to psychological injury sufficiently serious or disabling as to raise an inference that his relationship with his wife was more than superficially impaired.therefore,the district court properly granted defendants motion for summary judgement as to tucker loss of consortium claims.
conclusion 
with the exception of the abuse of process claim where the tuckers raised a triable issue as to kenner malice,the tuckers did not produce evidence from which a jury could find malice,which is a necessary element of the malicious prosecution claim.although tucker estate may be entitled to recover damages for malicious prosecution,the district court appropriately granted summary judgment for the kenner and interscope defendants with respect to tucker cause of action for loss of consortium.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in tucker interscope,and affirm in part and reverse in part the district court grant of summary judgment in tucker kenner.
affirmed in part reversed in part remanded.
in,defendants shall recover their costs on appeal.
in,the parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
the legal question to be decided is whether tucker presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of material fact as to whether death row and kenner had sued her with malice when they began and continued a suit against her charging her with racketeering involving extortion,mail and wire fraud intentional interference with contract and abuse of process,and whether there was sufficient evidence of malice to go to a jury as to whether interscope,ortner,and paul,hastings had acted with malice when they began and continued a suit against tucker in which she was charged with conspiracy,disrupting a contract,depriving interscope of property and extortion.the standard of review is that all inferences are to be drawn in favor of tucker,the nonmoving party.it is evident,i believe,that tucker submitted sufficient evidence to defeat the summary judgments in favor of death row records,interscope,kenner,ortner and paul,hastings.a statement of the facts,followed by a statement of the law will show the basis for this contention.

david elliot kenner kenner was in a lawyer,a graduate of the law school of the university of southern california,engaged in the solo practice of law in encino,california.
charles ortner ortner was years old in,had graduated from brooklyn law school,and was an attorney with paul,hastings.
paul,hastings,janofsky walker paul,hastings is a large law firm headquartered in los angeles and has other offices around the world employing attorneys.
events.in,when tucker was the chair of the national political congress of black women the npc,she listened to the plea of warwick and melba moore,another african american performer,to do something about what going on in hollywood about our young people calling us whores and bitches and disrespecting and denigrating african american women.tucker followed up by checking on whether this stuff was sold to children.if it was,she was going to put my marching shoes back on that i marched with martin luther king hand in hand in selma.the stuff was sold to children.tucker began marching.
as president of the npc,tucker enlisted warwick,moore,voncier alexander,and terri rossi to form an entertainment commission,whose mission statement ran as follows 
the goals of the national political congress of black women,npcbw entertainment commission npcbw entertainment commission are threefold 
seek to eliminate internal blockage in the industry that currently and most obviously prevents african americans from the achievement of equal opportunities as artists and those positions of decision making.
mobilize african americans in the industry to join the struggle to resolve critical issues affecting african american communities,particularly in the areas of education and health,where so many serve as role models and spokespersons.
offer strategies and solutions of reshaping and maintaining positive images to preserve the dignity and heritage of our youth instead of continuously exposing our youth to negative media that distort their images of relationships,undermines the stability of our families,communities and nation by encouraging violence,abuse and sexism as acceptable behaviors,and perpetuates the cycle of low of african american youth.
tucker march had just started.she demonstrated outside a tower records store to protest its sale of albums of gangsta rap to minors.she gained support for her cause from a broad spectrum of national leaders,including william bennett,joe lieberman,tipper gore,bob dole,and sam nunn.she testified before the federal communications commission and before committees of congress on the harm done by gangsta rap.she attended a time warner stockholders meeting where she offered the corporation executives if they would read gangsta rap aloud to the meeting.in short,tucker using the skills and smarts of a woman knowledgeable about political endeavors and media responses,took advantage of the democratic processes available to aroused citizens,and made herself a terrific nuisance to a principal producer of gangsta rap,death row.
on july,the npc convened its biennial convention in seattle.suge knight and kenner as death row lawyer met with tucker and others.they discussed the formation of a distribution company owned by blacks that could distribute death row records if suge knight eliminated the gangsta rap.
on august,tucker and others drafted a letter for knight signature,memorializing the july meeting.in the letter,knight stated that death row will cease and desist from the production and distribution of misogynist,obscene and pornographic music,a preliminary condition for knight authorization of npc to negotiate an acceptable contract relationship with time warner regarding the production and distribution of our music products.this letter was unsigned and delivered to knight.the next day,august,warwick arranged a meeting attended by about ten persons,some of them npc members,not including tucker,and four persons from time warner.michael fuchs,an executive of warner music,wanted to know if knight had a contract with interscope to distribute his records.fuchs had flown from new york to meet knight and the purpose of the meeting was for fuchs to sort of grill suge knight on his involvement or his relationship with interscope.knight had been invited,but was there.he telephoned repeatedly from to to say he was on the way.knight spent the day with his lawyer,kenner,and james iovine,then the president of interscope records.
the following day,august,kenner drafted a letter signed by kenner and knight and addressed to dionne warwick.the letter rejected the draft letter sent to knight,affirmed his position to stand by his music and musicians,and stated that tucker had misunderstood him or was misrepresenting what he had said.the letter also rejected what it described as fuchs offer,as conveyed to knight,of an advance and to provide him with two studios if he would agree to sign directly with time warner.
kenner then conferred with ortner,counsel for interscope.on august,ortner filed a complaint on behalf of interscope against tucker in the central district of california.the complaint alleged that beginning in,for her own personal and financial gain,tucker together with others whose identities are unknown,engaged in a conspiracy to destroy interscope by committing extortion,threats,and other unlawful acts.interscope partner,the time warner affiliate,was also named but characterized as a nominal defendant.
the first claim of the complaint was that as a result of tucker actions,the contractual relationship between interscope and death row records has been disrupted.the second claim sought a preliminary and permanent injunction against these acts.the third claim was for such injunctions against tucker attempting to induce time warner and its affiliate atlantic ventures to breach their fiduciary duty to interscope.the fourth claim sought similar injunctions against tucker engaging in unfair business practices and unfair competition,by reason of which interscope has incurred irreparable harm and has been deprived of its property rights.compensatory,exemplary,and punitive damages were sought on each claim,along with reasonable attorneys fees.the complaint carried the name of three lawyers and the firm name of paul,hastings.it was signed in ortner name.
two days later,on august,kenner on behalf of death row also filed in the central district a complaint against tucker the npc time warner the warner music group michael fuchs and gerald levin for multiple violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act rico,as well as various other violations of federal and state laws.the allegations against tucker were stated to be against her as an individual and as a representative or officer of the npc.fuchs was identified as chairman of warner music and levin as chairman of time warner.the defendants were alleged to be in a conspiracy to enrich the defendants themselves.the defendants were said to have engaged in their unlawful scheme f or the past months,that is,since july.their acts began with a smear campaign.this campaign,primarily directed toward defendant time warner,was and is an apparent attempt to induce action through political pressure.tucker did not disclose her ulterior motive to replace and supplement interscope records as the distributer of the recorded output of death row records.this commercial goal was hidden and obscured by defendant tucker.among the acts charged against tucker personally was her picketing of a time warner stockholders meeting,her denouncing time warner for their support of music containing explicit lyrics,and its alleged denigration of women.tucker recruitment of william bennett and bob dole to her cause was also alleged against her.
the first cause of action set out was racketeering in violation of b and c.tucker,the npc and others unknown were said to have formed an enterprise to establish a record distribution company controlled by defendant tucker.the enterprise was attempting to secure its objective by a pattern of racketeering activity.the predicate criminal acts included extortion,that is,an attempt to obtain property from death row records by a wrongful use of force or fear against knight resulting in actual,although unknown,damages to death row.mail fraud in violation of was another part of the pattern,a crime carried out by the draft letter proposed for knight signature on august.wire fraud in violation of was also part of the pattern,the fraud consisting in unspecified uses of the wires,radio,or television communications with the result of actual,but unknown,damage to death row.the defendants were further charged with criminal interference with interstate commerce in violation of,a crime alleged to have been committed simply by transporting persons and things in interstate commerce in furtherance of their scheme.a final element of the unlawful pattern was the conspiracy of the defendants to achieve their unlawful end.
the second cause of action alleged conspiracy in violation of d and sought treble damages for unspecified harm.the third cause of action alleged a conspiracy to interfere with advantageous business relationships broadly said to be in violation of federal and state law.the fourth cause of action was for intentional interference with contract and prospective business advantage.the fifth cause of action made extortion its gravamen.the sixth cause of action was unfair business practices the seventh was abuse of process,by the defendants threatening to fabricate and pursue a course of conduct designed to cause criminal and civil liability to knight,a crime amounting to wrongful use of the criminal and civil justice system.
death row sought an injunction against all the defendants,treble damages for the first and for the second causes of action,and compensatory,exemplary,and punitive damages for all causes of action.
in october,two months after the litigation began,an ad appeared in the source,a magazine,listing twelve black freedom fighters such as martin luther king,and nelson mandela.to this list a thirteenth name had been added,that of tucker.a red line was drawn through this name.at the bottom of the ad were two quotes.the first was attributed to martin luther king,when we let freedom ring,we will be able to speed up that day when all of god children will be able to join hands and sing free at last free at last thank god almighty,we are free at last.a second quote followed under this first one.underneath this paragraph and parallel to it were these words whether it freedom for our people or freedom for our people to say what on their minds the fight lives on following this quotation,its author was identified as suge knight,ceo of death row records.
on october,kenner wrote counsel for tucker,stating death row,because of the actions of the parties,including your clients,has been damaged and death row records has every right to proceed to have their case heard without delay.death row and interscope made demand for the production of documents including without limitation,any communication,notes of conversations,correspondence,contracts,proposals,drafts memoranda that reflect,refer,or relate to interscope,death row rap music and a ll of your personal and business telephone records,logs,messages and related documents,for the period of january,to the present.in their capacity as plaintiffs,they also took tucker testimony for four days of depositions.a month later,they took another four days,so that the total testimony came to pages contained in eight volumes.in,approximately thirteen months later,they took another three days of depositions from tucker,adding three more volumes to the total.
in february,death row produced and interscope distributed an album sung by tupac shakur.one song,how do u want it asked 
now tell me is it cool to fuck 
did you think i came to talk 
the rapper went on in the course of his song to say 
delores tucker,yous a muthafucka,
instead of trying to help a nigga you 
destroy a brotha,worst than the others,
bill clinton,bob dole,you too old 
to understand the way the game told.
you lame soul,i got to hit you with the high facts.
when some release makin millions 
a second song on the album,wonda why they call u bitch,concluded 
dear delores tucker,you keep stressin me,

maybe this might help you understand.
it ai personal.
it strictly business,baby,strictly business.
so if u wonda why we call u bitch 
u wonda why we call u bitch 
if u wonda why we call u bitch,
u wonda why we call u bitch.
trial was finally set,for october.on june,death row filed a notice of motion to dismiss its entire action.the reasons given were that death row and interscope had severed their relationship and death row no longer needed injunctive relief to protect it and that investigation had shown that tucker and the npc lacked money to satisfy the damages to which death row was entitled.interscope also moved for dismissal of its action.on june,the motions were granted.
proceedings 
judge paez opinion accurately states the beginning and course of the two cases now consolidated for decision.tucker died at the age of in her husband,william tucker,is now her personal representative.death row is in bankruptcy,and its bankruptcy estate is being managed by a trustee.
the district court ruling in the kenner case was as follows 
while the court notes that kenner lacked probable cause to pursue a claim of abuse of process in the underlying litigation,the evidence plaintiffs offer in addition to this finding is insufficient to show that kenner acted with malice.plaintiffs have offered no evidence to support their allegation that kenner knew no threats were levied against his client.moreover,plaintiffs assertion is inconsistent with kenner deposition testimony as well as tucker admission that she did contact the justice department and the fbi regarding death row records.lastly,plaintiffs allegations about kenner conduct during the course of litigation amount to nothing more than mere speculation and fail to demonstrate actual hostility or ill will.a reasonable jury could not return a verdict in plaintiffs favor on this evidence.as such,summary judgment is warranted as to this issue.
the district court added 
defendant kenner also seeks clarification as to the court ruling regarding probable cause and favorable termination.the court advises defendant that genuine issues of fact existed as to both issues which precluded a finding as a matter of law in his favor.
in the interscope case,the court found that genuine issues of material fact remained as to interscope records probable cause for inducement to breach contract and inducement to breach fiduciary duty as well as death row probable cause to file claims for rico violations,extortion,and abuse of process.
in these diversity cases,it is uncontested that california law should govern.we consider them separately except to note that both suits brought by the defendants against tucker terminated in her favor.a necessary element of a case for malicious prosecution is judgment against the plaintiffs in the suits that they maliciously launched.under california law a voluntary dismissal accepted by the court constitutes such a judgment even though the phrase with prejudice is not added to the dismissal.fuentes berry,th,d.
tucker kenner.on the evidence presented by tucker,a jury could conclude that kenner lacked probable cause and filed and pursued death row action against tucker and the npc with malice.
first,as to the objective lack of probable cause the district court has already ruled that there are triable issues of fact as to probable cause.death row and kenner have not appealed that ruling.it may,therefore,seem to be a work of supererogation to review the counts of the death row complaint in terms of their lack of any foundation in fact.that,however,is not the case.lack of probable cause can be an element in the proof of malice.even more significantly,knowledge of the lack of probable cause is itself proof from which a jury may infer malice,goldstein,th,d.reasons exist,therefore,to review the lack of probable cause for many of the claims of the quondam plaintiffs and the likelihood that the claims were knowingly brought without cause.
first,after three years of investigation,discovery,and,kenner voluntarily withdrew death row action against tucker,including the claims that she had committed a variety of federal and state crimes.a jury could reasonably infer that the stated reason that tucker and the npc were was meant to disguise the absence of any fact supporting the outrageous claims asserted.second,a jury could make an inference from the difference between the interscope and death row complaints.although both companies and their lawyers were in communication in preparing their respective suits,and although both corporations had the same information about tucker and the same reasons to hate her,interscope did not charge tucker with racketeering.if there were any evidence of racketeering in possession of death row,a jury could infer that it would have been shared with interscope.the absence of racketeering charges in interscope complaint would permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that,more probably than not,death row and kenner knew no facts to support their racketeering claims.third,a jury could also infer from the extraordinary vagueness of several of death row criminal charges that kenner was merely using boiler plate without possession of any facts on which to act.a trier of fact could consider,for example,the failure to identify any actual harm caused by the conduct complained of the utterly unspecified reference to uses of the wires the strange charge of criminal interference in interstate commerce by the transport of persons and things.fourth,a jury could also infer that the racketeering charges against the npc were without any foundation and without any purpose except to make out tucker as a scheming and faithless fiduciary who would manipulate an educational group for her own private profit.
fifth,the district court has ruled as a matter of law that kenner lacked probable cause to bring the claim for abuse of process.this ruling has not been appealed and is the law of the case.a jury could infer that if kenner lacked probable cause so did death row.further,a jury could infer that kenner knew there was no probable cause for this claim.as a lawyer,kenner must have known that an abuse of process is an act done in the name of the court and under its authority for the purpose of perpetrating an injustice,and thus,the essence of an abuse of process claim lies in the misuse of the power of the court.meadows bakersfield sav.loan ass n,d.tucker had brought no suit against his client.a jury could well infer that the knowing assertion of this claim manifested malice.
similarly,an action for intentional interference with contract requires an actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship.quelimane stewart title guar,cal th,d.the absence of any evidence of an actual breach could allow a jury to infer that kenner knowingly brought and continued death row actions without probable cause.
finally,that the august,letter authorized the npc,and not tucker,to negotiate an acceptable contract relationship on behalf of death row suggests that tucker could not have harbored a ulterior motive of personal enrichment as alleged in death row complaint.a jury could infer from this letter that kenner had no probable cause and therefore harbored malice in attributing hidden motives to tucker where no such evidence existed.
as to evidence from which a rational trier of fact could infer malice,th at,d,shows that the knowing bringing of a baseless claim is sufficient for a jury to conclude that a case was brought maliciously.second,the charges against tucker evince hatred.a civic leader is charged with a spate of offenses that would be appropriate to an indictment of a mafioso.she is an extortionist and a racketeer.she has organized a racketeering enterprise to enrich herself.malice gleams from death row complaint.
third,the allegations in the complaint specifically set out the criminal conduct charged to tucker as beginning in.in their brief on appeal the defendants acknowledge that tucker had a perfect right under the first amendment to agitate against gangsta rap and to ask others to join in her cause.that is precisely what she was doing in.not even a shred of evidence exists to show that this veteran of the civil rights movement was acting for her personal profit on any occasion in.what tucker was doing,both in and in,a jury could find,was what bob dole,tipper gore and joe lieberman were time warner and its affiliate,get this stuff off the air.you should be deeply ashamed.you are maligning women.you are promoting lawlessness.you are denigrating an entire ethnic community.for heaven sake and for the sake of your own reputation,get out of it.warwick,a deeply respected singer,had taken the lead.yet tucker alone was charged with racketeering and a pattern of racketeering reaching back to the period of her acknowledged first amendment activity.her motive is alleged to have been hidden.a jury could conclude that a hidden motive was an imagined motive,a motive maliciously conjured up to bolster death row complaint.only malicious minds,a jury might decide,could so construe her and democratic strategy.
fourth,former education secretary william bennett is named as a recruit of tucker.his recruitment is an asserted part of the pattern of racketeering.the dogged determination to do in tucker is manifestly malicious when her wooing of a senior american political leader is asserted to constitute criminal behavior.
fifth,the complaint alleged that levin,the ceo of time warner,and fuchs,the ceo of warner music,were engaged in the racketeering conspiracy to enrich tucker.the sheer implausibility of this claim,unsupported by any specific allegations,could lead a jury to infer malice.malignancy,a jury could infer,had led to the fantastic supposition that a dollar corporation sought to enrich tucker by cooperating in her racketeering.
sixth,a jury could infer malice from the way death row and its counsel conducted the asserting a need for a prompt trial but at no point moving for a restraining order or preliminary injunction besieging tucker with an oppressive demand for discovery harassing tucker with days of,while taking very little deposition testimony from warwick,who participated in the august meeting and taking no depositions from fuchs and levin,alleged to be tucker partners in crime.
seventh,three publications outside of the death row complaint shed light on death row motives.the first is the ad in the source.tucker believed that the ad called for her death.she was deposed as to the pain it caused her and the precautions she felt obliged to take to prevent being killed.no direct evidence was submitted establishing that death row paid for the ad.a jury could take into account two facts the concluding quotation was ascribed to knight in his corporate capacity.this quotation is paired with the quotation of martin luther king,knight had reason to hate tucker.this full page ad improbably put knight on par with king,pointedly identified knight as death row ceo,and marked tucker,at least symbolically,for destruction.the inference could rationally be drawn that the ad was inserted in the source by death row and was significant evidence of its malice as it continued its suit against tucker.the two songs made by tupac under the death row record label during the litigation demonstrate the strongest antipathy to tucker,who is assailed in vile language.a jury could well conclude,if this evidence does not exhibit malice,what would 
kenner is not personally responsible for the ad or the lyrics.he is responsible for setting out the malicious imaginings of a client with such hate,or so a jury could conclude.kenner could be held responsible for the irresponsible assortment of criminal charges in the complaint against tucker that he drafted and filed.despite his extensive experience with the criminal law,knight does not appear to have had the education necessary to conceive of the rico charges and to express tucker alleged crimes in words fitted to the statutory provisions invoked.a jury could well conclude that the special malice of the racketeering allegations owed their origin and presentation to the knowledge and skills of kenner.an attorney can not escape liability by saying,i was only a hired gun.my client and its ceo may have been malicious,but i was not.kenner could be found to have begun and continued the suit sharing the malice of his client and to have expressed malice in the drafting of the complaint.
it is argued that the ad in the source and tupac lyrics are not evidence of malice at the start of the suit because they appeared after the suit was started.for two reasons,this argument is unconvincing.first,a jury could well infer that the hatred of tucker displayed in the ad and in the lyrics was not a sudden development arising out of the suit,but the overt demonstration of what had smouldered and been fueled by anger at tucker campaign against gangsta rap.second,it is good california law that malice in continuing a lawsuit is as actionable as malice in originating it.zamos stroud,cal th,d.the ad and the lyrics demonstrate malice in the prosecution of the suit.
it has been suggested that the ad can be read as the personal act of suge knight,not of death row.again that argument can not be sustained.first,knight corporate title was used to identify him.second,far as this record death row.when he appears in the record,he is bargaining,complaining,negotiating for death row without reference to its directors or to any corporate control.he is it,or so a jury could reasonably infer.
it has been suggested that death row is not responsible for tupac lyrics.the suggestion is one possible reading of the evidence.but a jury could reasonably infer that the extraordinarily pointed references to tucker did not arise out of any special animus against her on tupac part but were designed by death row and its ceo to bring their adversary into a public pillory.
tucker interscope,death row,ortner,and paul,hastings.tucker sued interscope,death row,ortner and paul,hastings on five grounds that have been winnowed in the course of its action and an appeal consists in a single claim of malicious prosecution.again,it is desirable to examine the elements of the claim that consist in the lack of probable cause as well as the presence of malice.a jury could infer death row malice and lack of probable cause from the same evidence showing kenner malice and lack of probable cause,as discussed earlier.what of the acts of interscope taken by itself and of the lawyers representing interscope in the litigation against tucker 
interscope complaint alleged that tucker was a conspirator engaged in extortion and other unlawful acts for her own profit.the few facts stated in the complaint focused on hazy and inconclusive accounts of the july meeting and on accounts of the august meeting held by warwick from which knight,kenner,and tucker were all absent.a jury could infer that not only was probable cause lacking for these baseless charges,but that interscope and its lawyers,ortner and his firm,knew that the charges were baseless.
second,a theory of both complaints was that tucker was using her leverage with time warner,no doubt sensitive to adverse publicity,to break interscope contract with death row.in fact,however,in september,less than two months after the complaints were filed,time warner terminated the only investment it had in the joint venture with interscope.despite the absence now of any channel by which tucker could affect death row relation to interscope,the suit continued for three years without a foundational fact.
third,the plaintiffs lined up against tucker were death row and interscope.yet she was alleged to be disrupting their relation.the improbability of the two plaintiffs being set against each other by tucker would permit a jury to infer that the suits were continued after they had lost even a smidgen of probability.
fourth,the claim that the row relationship had been disrupted was palpably untrue.the contract between them had not been breached.their counsel,ortner and kenner,worked hand and glove together,or so the jury might infer from the coordination of the complaints.the allegation that interscope had incurred irreparable harm and had been deprived of its property rights was unsupported and inferably known by the interscope attorneys to be untrue.
conclusion.the evidence in this record,interpreted as it must be,in favor of the nonmoving party is sufficient to require the reversal of summary judgment for kenner,death row,interscope,ortner,and paul,hastings.as a matter of law,their cases against her ended with prejudice.the law of this case is that there are triable issues as to probable cause.tucker evidence affords multiple instances where a jury could infer,from what death row,kenner,interscope,and ortner said and did,that the suits brought and m
