plaintiff it my party,imp contends that defendant live nation,ln has violated the sherman antitrust act by engaging in monopolization,tying arrangements,and exclusive dealing in the music concert industry.the district court granted summary judgment to defendant ln.because plaintiff has failed to define the relevant markets or to demonstrate any anticompetitive conduct,we affirm.
imp and ln are competitors in the live music industry.both promote concert tours and operate concert venues,but they differ in geographic reach.plaintiff imp is a regional player that promotes concerts and works with venues in the washington,dc and baltimore,md area.defendant ln is a national promoter that provides services to artists throughout the country.it owns,leases,or holds exclusive booking rights at venues across the united states.ln has expanded over time by acquiring other concert promoters as well as ticketmaster,a major ticket sales and distribution company.
in addition to promoting concerts,imp and ln both operate outdoor amphitheaters.imp manages and operates merriweather post pavilion in columbia,maryland,and ln owns nissan pavilion now called jiffy lube live in bristow,virginia.merriweather has a seating capacity of roughly with fixed seats,while nissan has a capacity for with fixed seats.concert venues range in size from small clubs with a capacity of about to sports stadiums seating over.
artists select venues based on their capacity,revenue potential,and the option of playing outdoors.the washington baltimore area has a number of concert venues other than merriweather and nissan.among the other venues are the filene center at wolf trap person amphitheater,the first mariner arena person arena,the patriot center person arena,the pier six pavilion person amphitheater,and the verizon center person arena.notwithstanding the abundance of options,merriweather has more than held its own.between and,it hosted an impressive of prominent artists,including bob dylan,john legend,maroon,nickelback,nine inch nails,sheryl crow,taylor swift,the black eyed peas,and the fray.
the basics of the music concert industry are easily described.imp and ln compete for the business of artists,vying to promote their concerts and showcase them in their venues.promoters,in negotiation with artists,work on financing concerts,arranging dates and locations,securing venues,and advertising.in terms of compensation,the artist typically receives either a minimum guaranteed payment or an percentage of the gross ticket sales.
artists have two main options for organizing the individual concerts that make up their tours.one approach is to use a different local promoter for each location and secure venues through the promoters.alternatively,an artist can work with a national promoter such as ln for most or all of the tour.the two options frequently offer different modes of compensation.artists who contract with one or a few national promoters to organize their tours often receive a guaranteed payment from the promoter based on the number of shows organized by that promoter.artists who contract locally and book with several promoters in various parts of the country will often receive instead a percentage of the gross ticket sales from each concert.it my party,live nat,d.
imp was dissatisfied with the workings of the industry as described above.plaintiff brought suit on march,alleging that ln had violated and of the sherman act and parallel maryland antitrust law through monopolization,tying arrangements,and exclusive dealing.the result of ln conduct,claims imp,was the foreclosure of competition in the concert promotion and venue markets.the district court denied ln motion to dismiss in july and an initial motion for summary judgment without prejudice in august.following briefing and argument,the court granted summary judgment in ln favor in february.
in a careful opinion,the district court declined to adopt imp definition of the promotion market and excluded the portion of its expert analysis defining the venue market.it my party,d at.the trial court also found insufficient evidence that ln had engaged in monopolization,tying,or any other anticompetitive behavior.plaintiff state law claims were deemed to fall in tandem with its federal ones.imp now appeals.
our standard of review is well settled.summary judgment is justified if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in reviewing a motion for summary judgment,the court must draw any permissible inference from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.sylvia dev.calvert county,cir quoting tuck henkel,cir citation omitted.
plaintiff faces here the initial challenge of identifying exactly what market defendant is accused of monopolizing.spectrum sports,mcquillan,discussing the definition of a relevant market as a threshold issue for monopolization claims under eastman kodak image tech,treating appreciable economic power in the tying market as a necessary feature of an illegal tying arrangement.in the absence of a plausible market definition,courts are hard pressed to discern the nature or extent of any anticompetitive injury that plaintiff and other similarly situated parties may be suffering.
this case involves two separate but related markets the market for concert promotion and the market for concert venues.in both,the relevant consumers are performing artists,who contract with promoters and venues to put on concerts.in its market definition analysis,imp characterized the promotion market as national rather than local and restricted the venue market to major amphitheaters to the exclusion of other venues.as the district court recognized,these definitions were plainly designed to bolster imp monopolization and tying claims by artificially exaggerating ln market power and shrinking the scope of artists choices.
to support its claims that ln was monopolizing the concert promotion market and tying promotion services to its venues,imp had to first define the promotion market and demonstrate ln market power therein.according to imp,promoters compete nationally for contracts to promote performances anywhere in the country.by defining the market as national,imp could more easily construe ln nationwide network of promoters and venues as evidence of market power.in contrast,imp could portray itself as a modest regional outfit whose resources pale in comparison.if instead the market were defined locally and narrowed to just the washington baltimore area,then imp would appear more evenly matched against ln regional capacity.unfortunately for plaintiff,its market definitions are blind to the basic economics of concert promotion.
the relevant geographic market in antitrust cases is defined by the area within which the defendant customers can practicably turn to alternative supplies if the defendant were to raise its prices.du pont de nemours kolon,cir.applied to this case,that inquiry focuses on the area within which artists can find alternative promoters if any one promoter were to increase its prices.the goal of concert promotion is of course to boost ticket sales.therefore,artists demand for promotion services is derivative of the public demand for concert performances.concertgoers will typically not travel out of their region to attend a concert in response to higher ticket prices in their area.heerwagen clear channel commc ns,cir.because the demand for concerts is local,promoters need to target their advertising to the area surrounding a particular venue.as the district court found in reviewing the record,promoting shows is highly localized,and most promoters promote in specific locations.it my party,d at.for example,live nation books the majority of its television advertising locally,with only about five percent spent on national advertising.id.at.
these market dynamics favor promoters familiar with local media outlets and the local audience.an artist is unlikely to switch to a promoter based in miami simply because a baltimore promoter demands a bigger cut of the ticket sale proceeds.imp sidesteps this point by focusing on the feasibility of promoting concerts from anywhere using modern technology.that technological capacity is useless,however,without the relevant local knowledge and local contacts.indeed,imp itself must be aware of that reality since it does not attempt to promote beyond its washington baltimore base.even a national promoter like ln is almost exclusively focused on local advertising and operates its promotion services through regional offices rather than a central hub.the ability of national promoters to coordinate tours does not change the fact that they provide services and compete for business on a local basis.heerwagen,at.in short then,the market for concert promotion is local,and the relevant competition in this case is between imp and ln for the washington baltimore area.the battle,in other words,is on imp own turf.
imp definition of the venue market is similarly defective.it first confined the market to major amphitheaters,large outdoor spaces suitable only for popular artists,while excluding clubs,arenas,stadiums,and other venues.not content with that narrow definition of the venue market,imp further specified that the amphitheaters must have a capacity of or more,actually sell or more tickets,and be in use only from may to september.only two venues in the entire washington baltimore area meet imp specifications the very two venues featured in this case,merriweather and nissan.imp approach is akin to defining a market to include tennis players who have won more than three olympic gold medals and finding that only venus and serena williams fit the bill.
this exercise in precise suits the needs of plaintiffs,as the district court observed.it my party,d at.ln market power appears magnified when the relevant market contains only two competitors,and any business taken away from merriweather seems to flow directly to nissan.but in its haste to stage this showdown,imp again casts sound economics aside.
whether a product,in this case amphitheaters,commands a distinct market depends on whether it is reasonably interchangeable,united states du pont de nemours,with other products or the extent to which consumers will change their consumption of one product in response to a price change in another,the of demand.eastman kodak,at citations omitted quoting du pont de nemours,at.here,imp has not pointed to any record evidence demonstrating that artists are so likely to stick to amphitheaters in the event of a price increase that amphitheaters comprise their own market.artists who prefer amphitheaters may nonetheless turn to a substitute,which,after all,allows the show to go on.there is therefore an insufficient basis for excluding reasonably interchangeable venues such as similarly sized arenas or stadiums from the market definition.
plaintiff has simply not carried its burden of showing that amphitheaters are the only place certain artists are willing to perform,irrespective of the monetary or logistical advantages of other concert locations.as the district court noted,artists regularly perform at both amphitheaters and,and any artist dissatisfied with live nation conditioning of amphitheaters could simply perform at another venue.it my party,d at.imp key evidence supporting its venue market definition a statistical analysis that purportedly shows that some artists prefer either amphitheaters or arenas fails to adequately consider of demand between the two types of venues.imp reliance on this evidence is akin to claiming that pepsi and coke are in different markets because consumers generally prefer one or the other.mere consumer preference does not indicate what pepsi enthusiasts would do in response to an increase in its price.similarly,a particular artist preference for amphitheaters or arenas does not reveal what the artist would do if the cost of performing in an amphitheater began to rise.
in defending its market definition,imp chides the district court for rigorously challenging its expert analysis.but that court was not required to accept uncritically two market definitions a sweeping national promotion market and a cramped venue market that coincidentally fit plaintiff precise circumstances.no party can expect to gerrymander its way to an antitrust victory without due regard for market realities.see du pont de nemours,at.
lacking sound market definitions,imp monopolization and tying claims are left in a weakened state.even assuming the plausibility of those definitions,however,plaintiff allegations of anticompetitive conduct fail of their own accord.the bulk of imp case hinges on two closely related tying claims.first,plaintiff argues that artists who hire ln for its promotion services are compelled to perform at its nissan venue.second,ln allegedly will give artists access to its amphitheaters in other locations only if they choose nissan for their washington baltimore date.in these two claims,the tying products used to lure artists are promotion services and amphitheaters in other areas,whereas the tied product forced upon artists in both instances is nissan.we will address the and tying claims in that order.
a tying arrangement is defined as an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different or tied product.pac.ry.united states.tying suppresses competition in two ways first,the buyer is prevented from seeking alternative sources of supply for the tied product second,competing suppliers of the tied product are foreclosed from that part of the market which is subject to the tying arrangement.advance bus.supply scm,cir.
what causes these anticompetitive harms and distinguishes tying from ordinary market behavior is not the mere bundling of two products together but rather the coercion of the consumer.as the supreme court put it,the crux of tying lies in the seller exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all,or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms.jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,abrogated on other grounds by.tool works indep.ink,emphasis added accord phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law an analysis of antitrust principles and their applications ed deducing from longstanding case law that no tie exists unless the customer was coerced into taking both products.if instead the buyer is free to decline the tied product or to purchase the two products separately,then by definition there is no unlawful tying.see times picayune pub.united states,stressing the importance of a forced purchase stephen jay photography,olan mills,cir same.that is precisely the case here.
while paying lip service to the tying case law,imp proceeds to strip the doctrine of its core element of coercion.by its proffered definition,imp argues that tying occurs any time a seller who has market power over product a offers it for sale together with product b.but merely offering two products in a single package,allowing each to enhance the appeal of the other,is not itself coercive.otherwise,the seller would be guilty of anticompetitive conduct even if buyers in fact preferred and freely chose to buy product a and product b together and competitors were not foreclosed from selling alternatives to product without the element of coercion,imp version of tying targets none of the anticompetitive harms animating the doctrine.advanced bus.supply,at outlining the harms to competitors and consumers.without coercion,without requiring the customer to buy product b when buying product a selling products a and b as a unit is simply one strategy for gaining an edge in a free marketplace.to allow tying doctrine to swell to the point of prohibiting such legitimate means of competition would make antitrust law its own worst enemy.
a review of the facts in this case reveals imp reason for excising coercion from tying doctrine plaintiff has no prospect of satisfying that element here.the record contains little basis for concluding that artists were coerced into taking the tied product,performances at nissan,with the tying product,ln promotion services.imp excerpts of ln communications,mostly internal emails,that discuss its negotiations with artists over concert tours and the nissan venue.in no instance,however,did ln convey that an artist could not receive its promotion services unless it appeared at nissan.in fact,several agents specifically denied being forced to put their artists in ln venues as part of their agreements with ln.in response,imp conjectures that the agents shaded their testimony for an entity who dictates whether their clients work.appellant br.at.but if pure speculation by a competitor were enough to prove the opposite of what consumers describe is happening in the market,then antitrust defendants should surrender every time a rival files a complaint.
there is,moreover,ample evidence suggesting the exact opposite of what imp seeks to prove,namely the absence of coercion and tying.plaintiff own analysis reveals that the tying product was sometimes sold without the tied product.artists on national tours,the very artists who were supposedly into performing at nissan,in fact chose merriweather fourteen percent of the time.ten percent has been cited as the minimum benchmark for separate sales sufficient to rebut any inference of tying.areeda hovenkamp,supra,at.without adopting that particular figure as the definitive baseline,we note that sales in this case exceed it sufficiently to cast doubt on any allegation of tying.
even without direct evidence,a plaintiff could still prove coercion circumstantially.see serv.training,data,cir.here,imp relies on a regression analysis purporting to show that artists on national tours promoted by ln disproportionately perform at nissan rather than merriweather.from that analysis,imp infers that ln must be tying nissan to its promotion services.for plaintiff,there could be no other reason for the artists choice to pair an ln venue with ln promotion.
but that supposition likewise falls short.to prove an antitrust violation,a plaintiff must present evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent conduct consistent with competition.matsushita indus.zenith radio,quoting monsanto spray rite serv.a successful tying claim in particular needs to rule out alternative explanations for why the consumer might prefer to purchase the tied product along with the tying product.see serv.training,at.in this case,imp ignores a host of independent reasons that could have led artists on ln tours to freely choose nissan.
one obvious explanation is that ln simply outcompeted imp and gave artists better compensation to appear in ln venues.in one case,two artists declined merriweather only after ln offered of the gross ticket sales minus expenses to perform at nissan and another ln amphitheater.in another instance,ln enticed a band to play at nissan by adding to the guaranteed payment for a slate of performances around the country.these differences in artist compensation offered by imp and ln,clearly signs of competitive negotiations,were curiously missing from imp regression analysis.
plaintiff also ignores the simple fact that it could have been more efficient for artists already on ln tours to work with the same concert promoter and venue operator for their washington baltimore date.the artist may have dealt with ln on other occasions and come to appreciate the working relationship.more broadly,the national promoter holds distinct advantages over its regional competitor it can offer tour packages combining a series of venues with promotion services in multiple locations.by contrast,imp is limited to the washington baltimore area,most likely a single stop on any given tour.accepting a comprehensive and package that happens to include nissan is not tying it is simply a good deal for the consumer.
the final and perhaps most salient factor is that nissan may be a superior venue to merriweather.imp scoffs at this idea,boasting that merriweather is an iconic amphitheater in a bucolic setting,whereas nissan is a concrete shell with horrific parking problems.appellant br.at.setting aside imp potential bias for its own venue,nissan possesses at least some advantages.it carries the prestige and name recognition of being affiliated with a concert promoter.nissan also holds over more seats than merriweather,nearly all of which are fixed seats that command a higher ticket price than open lawn space,giving nissan significantly greater earning potential.as the supreme court reminds us,intrinsic superiority of the tied product would convince freely choosing buyers to select it over others without any coercion from the seller.times picayune,at accord serv.training,at.yet imp fails to account for nissan or ln inherent advantages,or indeed any explanation of artists preference for that venue other than an illicit tying arrangement.
not only did artists have various reasons to choose nissan of their own accord,but they were also equally free to turn down that venue or ln entire package deal of venues and tour promotion.artists have always had two options for structuring their tours.instead of contracting with a single national promoter for all concert dates,performers can work with local promoters on a basis and pick any venue they want for a specific date.if at any point ln tried to tie nissan to its promotion services,the artist could book its tour locally,use another promoter for the washington baltimore area,and opt for merriweather instead.when promotion and venues may be purchased separately in a competitive market,one seller decision to sell the two in a single package imposes no unreasonable restraint on either market.jefferson parish,at.in other words,ln combined but offer of promotion and venues would not foreclose artists from choosing merriweather over nissan or other venue operators like imp from competing for that business.if,however,ln happened to imp with better package deals,better compensation,and a better venue,then an antitrust lawsuit would not be the answer to plaintiff troubles.
imp tying claim is largely a repetition of its claim of tying.the key difference is the tying product.plaintiff argues that ln leveraged its market power in areas where it controlled the only amphitheater to force artists to perform at nissan.again,imp presents no direct evidence that ln withheld access to amphitheaters in areas unless artists chose nissan over merriweather.nor does its circumstantial evidence manage to rebut the myriad reasons discussed above for why artists would independently make that choice of venue.the mere fact that artists sometimes took a package deal of multiple ln venues for a given tour does not prove tying.at the same time,the record shows a proportion of sales that far exceeds the benchmark percent of artists who performed at an ln amphitheater in a locality where it owned the only such venue ended up choosing merriweather,not nissan,for its washington baltimore show.with one in four consumers buying the tying product without the tied product,it becomes hard to accept a story of ln strapping nissan to its other venues and forcing artists to perform there.
the change in the tying product thus makes no difference to plaintiff case.imp still fails to prove anything more than,as the district court found,vigorous competition by merriweather and nissan in negotiating with artists to perform at their respective venues.it my party,d at.in a world of robust market competition where artists were free to take a package deal of promotion and venues,free to purchase those products separately,free to turn down both,and where they in fact exercised all those options to their advantage,the strands of imp reasoning begin to resemble the invisible ropes allegedly tying ln products together.
quite beyond the specifics of market definitions and product tying,imp levies a more general attack.its brief stresses ln market position as the largest promoter in the world,larger than all other promoters combined.appellant br.at.size and scope,in imp eyes,are cause for suspicion.ln nationwide reach,artist relationships,and exclusive access to venues are apparently so dominant that the network itself deters entry into the industry and unfairly disadvantages localized competitors like imp.id.at.according to plaintiff,a
