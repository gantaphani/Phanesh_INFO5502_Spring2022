does a prosecutor consulting with the makers of a major motion picture that is based on a criminal defendant story create a conflict sufficient to require recusal of the prosecutor when the defendant is finally brought to trial here,the lead prosecutor,bent on tracking down the fugitive defendant in this capital case,gave his case files to a screenwriter director to make a movie based on the defendant alleged life and crimes and consulted with the filmmakers during its subsequent production.the defendant,jesse james hollywood,was ultimately captured in brazil and extradited to the united states.he moved to recuse the prosecutor,arguing that the prosecutor involvement with hollywood,the film industry,precluded his prosecution of hollywood,the capital defendant.the trial court found no conflict warranting recusal,but the court of appeal independently reviewed the record and granted hollywood petition for a writ of mandate,with one justice explaining the prosecutor had permitted show business to cast an unseemly shadow over this case.
in this case and its companion,haraguchi superior court may,cal th,d,wl we consider the extent to which prosecutorial involvement in cinematic and literary endeavors may give rise to conflicts requiring recusal,as well as the standard for reviewing whether the trial court erred in finding the existence or absence of a disqualifying conflict.we reject the court of appeal conclusion that capital cases are sufficiently different from ordinary criminal cases that application of a higher standard of appellate scrutiny to recusal motions is required.furthermore,as in haraguchi,we reverse the court of appeal based on its failure to grant appropriate deference to the trial court ruling and based on the presence in the record of evidence sufficient to support the trial court conclusion that no disqualifying conflict existed and no unlikelihood of a fair trial had been proven.
factual and procedural background 
this case arises from the kidnapping and murder of nicholas nick markowitz.as did the court of appeal,we draw our description of the crime from the people opposition to hollywood petition for a writ of mandate.four people have been convicted or pleaded guilty in connection with the nick markowitz murder,but hollywood,of course,has not thus,our recitation of his involvement is based on pretrial allegations.
according to the people,hollywood was a drug dealer in the san fernando valley and nick markowitz older half brother ben one of his distributors.ben and hollywood had a falling out over money ben owed hollywood.ben broke out the windows of hollywood residence.on their way to retaliate,hollywood,jesse rugge,and william skidmore spotted nick on the street and kidnapped him,perhaps with the idea of extorting repayment from ben.
nick was held hostage for three days.at some point he was released from any physical restraints but did not flee.hollywood eventually gave another confederate,ryan hoyt,a gun and orders to kill nick.hoyt and graham pressley dug a shallow grave in the foothills outside santa barbara.hoyt and others then drove nick into the foothills and marched him to the gravesite.hoyt hit him over the head with a shovel,then shot him.the confederates buried nick and returned to santa barbara.
within days,nick markowitz body had been found,and hoyt,rugge,pressley,and skidmore had been captured.hollywood,however,became a fugitive.
in october,the district attorney of santa barbara county filed a indictment against hollywood,hoyt,skidmore,rugge,and pressley.count charged them with the murder of nick markowitz,subd.a.it alleged as a special circumstance that defendants had committed the murder during the commission of a kidnapping in violation of section,subd.a b.count charged defendants with kidnapping nick markowitz for the purpose of ransom or to commit extortion in violation of section,subdivision a.santa barbara county deputy district attorney ronald zonen prosecuted hoyt,skidmore,rugge,and pressley and obtained convictions or guilty pleas for each 
in the spring of,zonen was contacted by nick cassavetes,a film director and screenwriter who wanted to make a film,alpha dog,based on the markowitz murder.cassavetes asked zonen if he could provide any assistance or materials to help create a screenplay,including trial transcripts,witness contacts,according to zonen,he decided to turn over materials to cassavetes and act as a consultant in cassavetes preparation of alpha dog in the hope that the publicity would result in hollywood apprehension.
in march,hollywood was captured in brazil and extradited to the united states to be tried for kidnapping and special circumstance murder.hollywood defense learned of zonen cooperation with the alpha dog filmmakers and filed a motion to recuse both zonen and the entire santa barbara county district attorney office.hollywood alleged zonen cooperation in the making of alpha dog created a conflict because zonen had acted illegally and unethically by disclosing confidential documents,including criminal records,police reports,and probation reports,to the filmmakers and by cooperating in the making of a movie that presented a distorted view of hollywood,zonen sought to burnish his own legacy were he to later obtain hollywood conviction and impaired hollywood opportunity to receive a fair trial.
the trial court held two lengthy hearings to examine these contentions.at the first,it announced its tentative conclusions that zonen had no financial conflict,as he had received no consideration for his cooperation zonen disclosure of confidential information,whether or not a legal or ethical breach,did not rise to the level of a conflict warranting recusal and zonen asserted interest in burnishing his legacy by raising the profile of the case did not amount to an impermissible conflict.moreover,even assuming one were to take the view there was a conflict,the trial court could conceive of no likelihood that it would prevent hollywood from receiving a fair trial.however,the trial court continued the matter for an evidentiary hearing into whether zonen might have acted improperly by ordering michael mehas,an associate producer who had interviewed numerous percipient witnesses while researching the film,not to cooperate with the defense.
at the evidentiary hearing,the trial court allowed the defense to examine mehas extensively and also posed its own questions to determine what,if anything,zonen might have done to interfere with the defense.at the close of the hearing,it concluded mehas had elected to cease cooperation with the defense of his own accord,zonen had not acted improperly,and the defense had failed to establish any conflict warranting recusal.
hollywood filed a petition for writ of mandate with the court of appeal,which summarily denied relief.we granted review and transferred the case back to the court of appeal with directions to issue an order to show cause.after further briefing and argument,the court of appeal issued an opinion the same day as the companion case haraguchi superior court.emphasizing the unusual and distinctive facts of these cases,the court of appeal exercised its independent judgment and concluded in this first impression death penalty case we should not give our imprimatur to zonen conduct or embolden other prosecutors to assist the media in the public vilification of a defendant in a case which is yet to be tried.perhaps without intending to do so,zonen has potentially infected the jury pool with his views on the strength of the people case.prosecutors should try their cases in courtrooms,not in the newspapers,television,or in the movies to say that zonen went too far in his attempt to apprehend hollywood is an understatement.on that basis,the court of appeal held justice would not be served if zonen remains as the trial prosecutor,but it denied recusal of the rest of the district attorney office.
we granted review in this case and in haraguchi to consider both the standard of review and its application to prosecutorial recusal motions based on literary or cinematic endeavors.
discussion 
standards for a motion to recuse 
as we explained in haraguchi superior court,supra,cal th at page,d,wl at section sets out the standard governing motions to recuse a prosecutor such a motion may not be granted unless the evidence shows that a conflict of interest exists that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial,subd.a.the statute articulates a test i is there a conflict of interest and ii is the conflict so severe as to disqualify the district attorney from acting hambarian superior court cal th,d,quoting people eubanks cal th,d.in haraguchi,we also reaffirmed the general rule that motions to recuse a prosecutor are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.haraguchi superior court,cal th pp,d,wl at.
the court of appeal in this case gave no deference to the trial court findings of fact or its application of the law to those facts.having rejected in haraguchi two arguments the court of appeal offered there in support of independent cases of first impression warrant heightened scrutiny,and appellate courts have an independent interest in policing error consider here an additional argument for more stringent review offered by the court of appeal potential capital cases like this one should be treated differently.
the court of appeal noted the united states supreme court aphorism,d eath is different.gregg georgia,d lead opn.of stewart,accord,ring arizona,d harmelin michigan,d ford wainwright,d gardner florida,d plur.opn.of stevens.we do not disagree.but the conclusion the court of appeal this difference compels a different standard of review for such incorrect.
we have consistently reviewed trial court rulings on recusal motions under the abuse of discretion standard even in automatic appeals from death sentences,albeit without expressly considering whether the punishment imposed might on some theory warrant more stringent review.see,people griffin cal th,d,people millwee cal th,d,people zapien cal th,d,people breaux cal th,d,people hamilton cal d.today,we expressly hold the abuse of discretion standard is the proper one for prosecutorial recusal motions,even in capital cases.
our criminal justice system strives in each case to afford defendants procedurally fair trials while arriving at empirically correct outcomes,convicting the guilty and absolving the innocent.see people superior court greer cal d,the prosecutor is the servant of the law,the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer quoting berger united states.the punishment at issue in capital cases makes it all the more important to ensure fairness and arrive at accurate outcomes.but nothing in the court of appeal proposed de novo standard of review promotes those twin goals.for recusal motions in noncapital cases,we give trial courts primacy in fact finding and in assessing whether and how great a conflict exists not because the stakes are less and errors more conscionable,but because our trial courts are genuinely in the best position to assess witness credibility,make findings of fact,and evaluate the consequences of a potential conflict in light of the entirety of a case,a case they inevitably will be more familiar with than the appellate courts that may subsequently encounter the case in the context of a few briefs,a few minutes of oral argument,and a cold and often limited record.haraguchi superior court,supra,cal th at,d,wl at.nothing about these circumstances suggests to us that de novo review of recusal motions in capital cases would increase either the accuracy or the fairness of these proceedings.the same point answers the court of appeal concern about reducing the likelihood of belated reversal later on in the lengthy capital appeal process we have no basis on which to conclude independent review would reduce the risk of error.we therefore conclude that in capital cases,as in all others,the trial courts rulings should be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion 
ii.application 
we further consider whether the trial court erred in finding no conflict or whether the court of appeal erred in reversing based on its independent view that in fact the lead prosecutor should have been recused.here,we have the reverse of the haraguchi circumstances a fictional account that was intimately tied to and directly based on the prosecution at issue,but in which the challenged prosecutor had no financial interest.
in the trial court and on appeal,hollywood has identified as a source of conflict zonen actions in disclosing confidential information,his cooperation in the distribution of an allegedly inflammatory portrayal of hollywood,incidental future benefits to zonen arising from the distribution of alpha dog,and the totality of the circumstances.we consider each in turn.
disclosure of prosecutorial documents 
zonen concedes that in the course of assisting the alpha dog filmmakers,he gave them materials from his hollywood case file and from the case files of the four completed prosecutions.filmmaker cassavetes described the materials turned over as voluminous.the trial court assumed for purposes of its ruling that everything in the case files for the completed prosecutions was made available.
crediting zonen statements,the trial court concluded that if zonen disclosed any confidential documents,such disclosures were inadvertent and at most negligent,not intentional.the trial court was entitled to credit zonen,and his statements constitute substantial evidence.the trial court declined to make findings on the further question whether zonen disclosure of documents in fact involved any penal code violations 
violations of the law regarding dissemination of confidential records are sanctionable and may result in criminal prosecution and punishment.see,regulating dissemination of criminal records and making unlawful dissemination a misdemeanor,regulating dissemination of probation reports.recusal is also an available sanction.hollywood argues that if zeal within legal limits does not amount to a recusable conflict,as we have said hambarian superior court,supra,cal th at,d,then zeal that exceeds legal limits perforce must amount to a conflict requiring recusal.
we disagree.while recusal may be available in cases where there has been an illegal disclosure of confidential documents,it is not mandatory.rather,recusal is appropriate if and only if,as we have framed the test,the disclosure gives rise to a conflict so grave as to render it unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment.people vasquez cal th,d.thus,it is for the trial court in the first instance to consider whether the fact of disclosure and its collateral effects such as,for instance,a fear of being personally prosecuted are likely to affect the challenged prosecutor ability to exercise discretionary functions in an evenhanded fashion and render a fair trial unlikely.
the trial court focused on that precise question,repeatedly asking hollywood counsel to explain how,if indeed zonen had committed legal breaches,they might create a conflict for him and deprive hollywood of a fair trial in the end,the trial court was not persuaded that the disclosures did create any conflict.reviewing for an abuse of discretion,we agree.while in the abstract it is conceivable a fear of criminal sanctions might alter how zonen handled this case,the trial court found zonen credible and concluded the possibility that confidential documents might have been disclosed inadvertently would not prevent zonen from acting fairly toward hollywood.that conclusion does not appear arbitrary or capricious and is supported by substantial evidence.
in adopting the contrary view,the court of appeal neither explained how the disclosure of documents created a conflict nor how such a conflict might deprive hollywood of a fair trial.instead,it appears to have reasoned that zonen committed misconduct and for that reason alone should have been removed as prosecutor.putting aside for the moment the absence of any trial court finding that zonen committed misconduct,we emphasize that recusal motions are not disciplinary proceedings against the prosecutor.the ultimate focus of the section inquiry is on protection of the defendant rights,not whether recusal may be just or unjust for
