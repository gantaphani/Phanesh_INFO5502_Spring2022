who owns bratz 
barbie was the unrivaled queen of the market throughout the latter half of the century.but saw the introduction of bratz,the girls with a passion for fashion unlike the relatively demure barbie,the urban,and trendy bratz dolls have attitude.this spunk struck a chord,and bratz became an overnight success.mattel,which produces barbie,did relish the competition.and it was particularly unhappy when it learned that the man behind bratz was its own former employee,carter bryant.
bryant worked in the barbie collectibles department,where he designed fashion and hair styles for barbie dolls intended more for accumulation than for play.in august,while he was still employed by mattel,bryant pitched his idea for the bratz line of dolls to two employees of mga entertainment,one of mattel competitors.bryant was soon called back to see isaac larian,the ceo of mga.bryant brought some preliminary sketches,as well as a crude dummy constructed out of a doll head from a mattel bin,a barbie body and ken barbie ex boots.the zoe,lupe,hallidae and jade dolls in bryant drawings eventually made it to market as cloe,yasmin,sasha and jade,the first generation of bratz dolls.
bryant signed a consulting agreement with mga on october,though it was dated september.bryant gave mattel two weeks notice on october and continued working there until october.during this period,bryant was also working with mga to develop bratz,even creating a preliminary bratz sculpt a sculpt is a plastic doll body without skin coloring,face paint,hair or clothing.
mga kept bryant involvement with the bratz project secret,but mattel eventually found out.this led to a flurry of lawsuits,which were consolidated in federal district court.proceedings below were divided into two phases.phase dealt with claims relating to the ownership of bratz phase is pending and will deal with the remaining claims.this is an interlocutory appeal from the equitable orders entered at the conclusion of phase.
during phase,mattel argued that bryant violated his employment agreement by going to mga with his bratz idea instead of disclosing and assigning it to mattel.mattel claimed it was the rightful owner of bryant preliminary sketches and sculpt,which it argued mga subsequent bratz dolls infringed.and it asserted that mga wrongfully acquired the ideas for the names bratz and jade,so the bratz trademarks should be transferred from mga to mattel.
mattel won virtually every point below.the jury found that bryant thought of the bratz and jade names,and created the preliminary sketches and sculpt,while he was employed by mattel.it found that mga committed three violations relating to bryant involvement with bratz.and it issued a general verdict finding mga liable for infringing mattel copyrights in bryant preliminary bratz works.mattel sought more than billion in copyright damages but the jury awarded mattel only million,or about of that amount,perhaps because it found only a small portion of the bratz dolls infringing.see infra.
the district court entered equitable relief based on the jury findings.as to the violations,the district court imposed a constructive trust over all trademarks including the terms bratz and jade,essentially transferring the bratz trademark portfolio to mattel the transfer prohibited mga from marketing any product,such as bratz dolls bratz,bratz boyz,lil bratz,bratz lil angelz,bratz petz,bratz babyz,itsy bitsy bratz,doll accessories bratz world house,bratz cowgirlz stable,bratz spring break pool,bratz babyz ponyz buggy blitz,video games bratz girlz really rock,bratz forever diamondz,bratz rock angelz,and bratz the movie.
as to the copyright claim,the district court issued an injunction prohibiting mga from producing or marketing virtually every bratz female fashion doll,as well as any future dolls substantially similar to mattel copyrighted bratz works.the injunction covered not just the original four dolls,but also subsequent generations,bratz slumber party sasha and bratz girlfriendz nite out cloe and other doll characters,bratz play sportz lilee and bratz twins phoebe and roxxi.
in effect,barbie captured the bratz.the bratz appeal.
a constructive trust is an equitable remedy that compels the transfer of wrongfully held property to its rightful owner.communist party of valencia,d,see also cal.one who wrongfully detains a thing is an involuntary trustee thereof,for the benefit of the owner.a plaintiff seeking imposition of a constructive trust must show the existence of a res property or some interest in property the right to that res and the wrongful acquisition or detention of the res by another party who is not entitled to it.communist party,d at.
prior to trial,the district court held that bryant employment agreement assigned his ideas to mattel,and so instructed the jury.what was left for the jury to decide was which ideas bryant came up with during his time with mattel.it found that bryant thought of the names bratz and jade while he was employed by mattel,and that mga committed several violations by interfering with bryant agreement as well as aiding and abetting its breach.after trial,the district court imposed a constructive trust over all trademarks.we review that decision for abuse of discretion.see ghk assocs.mayer group.
a constructive trust would be appropriate only if bryant assigned his ideas for bratz and jade to mattel in the first place.whether he did turns on the interpretation of bryant employment agreement,which provides i agree to communicate to the company as promptly and fully as practicable all inventions as defined below conceived or reduced to practice by me alone or jointly by others at any time during my employment by the company.i hereby assign to the company all my right,title and interest in such inventions,and all my right,title and interest in any patents,copyrights,patent applications or copyright applications based thereon.emphasis added.the contract specifies that the term inventions includes,but is not limited to,all discoveries,improvements,processes,developments,designs,data computer programs and formulae,whether patentable or unpatentable.the district court held that the agreement assigned bryant ideas to mattel,even though ideas were included on that list or mentioned anywhere else in the contract we review the district court construction of the agreement de novo.see comstock united eng rs constructors,cir.
mattel points out that the list of examples of what constitutes an invention is illustrative rather than exclusive.ideas,however,are markedly different from most of the listed examples.people ex rel.lungren superior,cal courts avoid constructions that would make a particular item in a series markedly dissimilar to other items on the same list.designs,processes,computer programs and formulae are concrete,unlike ideas,which are ephemeral and often reflect bursts of inspiration that exist only in the mind.on the other hand,the agreement also lists less tangible inventions such as and discoveries.and bryant may have conveyed rights in innovations that were not embodied in a tangible form by assigning inventions he conceived as well as those he reduced to practice.
we conclude that the agreement could be interpreted to cover ideas,but the text does compel that reading.the district court thus erred in holding that the agreement,by its terms,clearly covered ideas.had the district court recognized the ambiguity,it might have evaluated whether it could be resolved by extrinsic evidence.see wolf superior court,d.at various stages of litigation,the parties introduced such evidence supporting their respective interpretations of inventions.contracts mattel drafted for other employees,for example,expressly assigned their ideas as well as their inventions.this tends to show that the term inventions alone does include ideas.on the other hand,a mattel executive claimed during her deposition that it was common knowledge in the design industry that terms like invention and design did include employee ideas.because the district court concluded that the language of the contract was clear,it did consider the extrinsic evidence the parties presented.even if it had,it may not have been able to resolve the meaning of inventions.if the meaning turns in part on the credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence,a properly instructed jury should have decided the issue.see morey vannucci,d.because we must vacate the constructive trust in any event,for reasons explained below,this is a matter the district court can take up on remand.
the very broad constructive trust the district court imposed must be vacated regardless of whether bryant employment agreement assigned his ideas to mattel.even assuming that it did,and that mga therefore misappropriated the names bratz and jade,the value of the trademarks the company eventually acquired for the entire bratz line was significantly greater because of mga own development efforts,marketing and investment.the district court nonetheless transferred mga entire bratz trademark portfolio to mattel on the ground that the enhancement of value of the property held in trust is given to the beneficiary of the constructive trust.as a result,mattel acquired the fruit of mga hard work,and not just the appreciation in value of the ideas mattel claims it owns.
in general,t he beneficiary of the constructive trust is entitled to enhancement in value of the trust property.haskel eng g supply hartford accident indem.this is so not because the beneficiary has a substantive right to the enhancement but rather to prevent unjust enrichment of the trustee.id.thus,a person who fraudulently acquired a house worth in that appreciates to by because of a strong real estate market ca complain when the rightful owner takes the benefit of the increase.i t is simple equity that a wrongdoer should disgorge his fraudulent enrichment.janigan taylor,cir.
this principle has the greatest force where the appreciation of the property is due to external factors rather than the efforts of the wrongful acquisitor.id.at.when the defendant profits from the wrong,it is necessary to identify the profits and to recapture them without capturing the fruits of the defendant own labors or legitimate efforts.dan dobbs,dobbs law of remedies ed.this is because the aim of restitution has been to avoid taking the defendant blood along with the pound of flesh.id.a constructive trust is therefore not appropriate to every case because it can overdo the job.id.
when the value of the property held in trust increases significantly because of a defendant efforts,a constructive trust that passes on the profit of the defendant labor to the plaintiff usually goes too far.for example,i f an artist acquired paints by fraud and used them in producing a valuable portrait we would not suggest that the defrauded party would be entitled to the portrait,or to the proceeds of its sale.janigan,at.even assuming that mga took some ideas wrongfully,it added tremendous value by turning the ideas into products and,eventually,a popular and highly profitable brand.the value added by mga hard work and creativity dwarfs the value of the original ideas bryant brought with him,even recognizing the significance of those ideas.we infer that the jury made much the same judgment when it awarded mattel only a small fraction of the more than billion in profit mga made from the brand.
from the ideas for the names bratz and jade,mga created not only the first generation of bratz dolls cloe,yasmin,sasha and jade,but also many other bratz characters ciara,dana,diona,felicia,fianna and so on,as well as subsequent generations of the original four dolls bratz flower girlz cloe,bratz on ice doll yasmin.mga also generated other doll lines,such as the bratz boyz,bratz petz and bratz babyz.and it made a variety of bratz doll accessories,along with several bratz video games and a movie.these efforts significantly raised the profile of the bratz brand and increased the value of the bratz trademarks.
it is not equitable to transfer this billion dollar value of which is overwhelmingly the result of mga legitimate it may have started with two misappropriated names.the district court imposition of a constructive trust forcing mga to hand over its sweat equity was an abuse of discretion and must be vacated.
mattel also claimed ownership of bryant preliminary bratz drawings and sculpt under bryant employment agreement,and that mga subsequent bratz dolls infringed its copyrights in those works.the drawings and sculpt clearly were inventions as that term is defined in bryant employment agreement with mattel.however,mga argued that the employment agreement did assign the items because bryant created them outside the scope of his employment at mattel,on his own time.at summary judgment,the district court held that the agreement assigned inventions even if they were not made during working hours,so long as they were created during the time period bryant was employed by mattel.so instructed,the jury found that bryant made the drawings and sculpt while he was employed by mattel,and the agreement therefore assigned them to mattel the jury was not asked to find whether bryant made the drawings and sculpt during mattel work hours,and it unclear whether the record contained any evidence on this point.
once mattel established ownership of bryant preliminary sketches and sculpt,it pursued a copyright claim against mga.the district court instructed the jury that any substantially similar bratz doll infringed mattel copyrights in the sketches and sculpt.during deliberations,the jury sent the judge a note asking if it could find infringement as to the first generation of bratz dolls and no others.the judge said it could.the jury returned a general verdict finding mga liable for copyright infringement,but awarded mattel only million in damages,a tiny fraction of the more than billion to which mattel claimed it was entitled.the district court thought it unclear which bratz dolls,or how many dolls,the jury thought infringing,so it made its own infringement findings in determining whether mattel was entitled to equitable relief.the district court found the vast majority of bratz dolls infringing and enjoined mga from producing them or any other substantially similar dolls.
bryant employment agreement assigns to mattel inventions created at any time during my employment by the company.mga argues that at any time during my employment covers only works created within the scope of bryant employment,not those created on his own time and outside of his duties at mattel.bryant was tasked with creating new doll lines there he designed fashions and hair styles for barbie collectibles.mga thus argues that bryant created the bratz designs and came up with the names bratz and jade outside the scope of his employment,and that he therefore owns the work 
the district court disagreed,holding at summary judgment that the agreement assigned to mattel any doll or doll fashions bryant designed during the period of his employment with mattel.it was therefore irrelevant whether bryant worked on bratz on his own time or during his working hours at mattel.we again review the district court construction of the contract de novo.see comstock,at.
the phrase at any time during my employment is ambiguous.it could easily refer to the entire calendar period bryant worked for mattel,including nights and weekends.
but it can also be read more narrowly to encompass only those inventions created during work hours during my employment,possibly including lunch and coffee breaks at any time extrinsic evidence does resolve the ambiguity.for example,an employee testified that it was common knowledge that a lot of people were moonlighting and doing other work,which was a problem so long as it was done on their own time,and at their own house.she agreed when asked,was it your understanding that if you designed dolls when you were at home at night that you owned them however,another employee testified,everything i did for mattel belonged to mattel.actually,everything i did while i was working for mattel belonged to mattel.
because the agreement language is ambiguous and some extrinsic evidence supports each party reading,the district court erred by granting summary judgment to mattel on this issue and holding that the agreement clearly assigned works made outside the scope of bryant employment.see city of hope med,at.the issue should have been submitted to the jury,which could then have been instructed to determine whether bryant agreement assigned works created outside the scope of his employment at mattel,and whether bryant creation of the bratz sketches and sculpt was outside the scope of his employment.
the district court error in construing the employment agreement is sufficient to vacate the copyright injunction.on remand,mattel might well convince a properly instructed jury that the agreement assigns works created outside the scope of employment,or that bryant preliminary bratz sketches and sculpt were created within the scope of his employment at mattel.the district court would then once again have to decide whether to grant a copyright injunction.we therefore believe it prudent to address mga appeal of the district court copyright rulings.
mattel argued that mga bratz dolls infringed its copyrights in the sketches and sculpt.to win its copyright claim,mattel had to establish three things.first,mattel had to prove that it owned copyrights in the sketches and sculpt it did.second,it had to show that mga had access to the sketches and sculpt obviously.third,it had to establish that mga dolls infringe the sketches and sculpt the kicker.see aliotti dakin,cir.
assuming that mattel owns bryant preliminary drawings and sculpt,its copyrights in the works would cover only its particular expression of the idea,not the idea itself.see herbert rosenthal jewelry kalpakian,cir.otherwise,the first person to express any idea would have a monopoly over it.degas ca prohibit other artists from painting ballerinas,and charlaine harris ca stop stephenie meyer from publishing twilight just because sookie came first.similarly,mga was free to look at bryant sketches and say,good idea we want to create bratty dolls too.
mattel,of course,argues that mga went beyond this by copying bryant unique expression of bratty dolls,not just the idea.to distinguish between permissible lifting of ideas and impermissible copying of expression,we have developed a test.see apple computer,microsoft,cir.at the initial extrinsic stage,we examine the similarities between the copyrighted and challenged works and then determine whether the similar elements are protectable or unprotectable.see id.at.for example,ideas,scenes a faire standard features and unoriginal components are protectable.id.at.when the unprotectable elements are filtered out,what left is an author particular expression of an idea,which most definitely is protectable.id.
given that others may freely copy a work ideas and other unprotectable elements,we start by determining the breadth of the possible expression of those ideas.if there a wide range of expression for example,there are gazillions of ways to make an movie,then copyright protection is broad and a work will infringe if it substantially similar to the copyrighted work.see id.at.if there only a narrow range of expression for example,there are only so many ways to paint a red bouncy ball on blank canvas,then copyright protection is thin and a work must be virtually identical to infringe.see satava lowry,cir jellyfish sculpture only entitled to thin protection against virtually identical copying due to the narrow range of expression.
the standard for similar or virtually at the extrinsic stage is applied at the intrinsic stage.see apple computer,at.there we ask,most often of juries,whether an ordinary reasonable observer would consider the copyrighted and challenged works substantially similar or virtually identical.see id.at.if the answer is yes,then the challenged work is infringing.
the district court conducted an extrinsic analysis and determined that the following elements of bryant sketches and sculpt were 
the resemblance or similarity to human form and human physiology.
the mere presence of hair,heads,two eyes,eyebrows,lips,nose,chin,mouth,and other features that track human anatomy and physiology.
human clothes,shoes,and accessories.
age,race,ethnicity,and urban or rural appearances.
common or standard anatomical features relative to others doll nose and relatively thin,small bodies.
scenes a faire,or common or standard treatments of the subject matter.
it found that the following elements were protectable 
particularized,synergistic compilation and expression of the human form and anatomy that expresses a unique style and conveys a distinct look or attitude.
particularized expression of the doll head,lips,eyes,eyebrows,eye features,nose,chin,hair style and breasts,including the accentuation or exaggeration of certain anatomical features relative to others doll lips,eyes,eyebrows,and eye features and of certain anatomical features relative to others doll nose and thin,small doll bodies.
particularized,doll clothes,doll shoes,and doll accessories that express aggressive,contemporary,youthful style.
based on this determination,the district court decided that substantial similarity is the appropriate test for infringement.and,in determining whether mattel was entitled to equitable relief,it found that the two bratz sculpts and the overwhelming majority of the bratz female fashion dolls were substantially similar to mattel copyrighted works.the district court therefore entered an injunction prohibiting mga from producing the infringing dolls or any future substantially similar dolls.we review de novo the district court determination as to the scope of copyright protection.see skyy spirits,cir.
doll sculpt.the district court enjoined mga from marketing or producing any doll that incorporates the core bratz fashion doll production sculpt or the bratz movie sculpt because it held they were substantially similar to bryant preliminary sculpt by adopting the substantially similar standard,the district court afforded bryant sculpt broad copyright protection.see supra.mga argues that the district court should have given bryant preliminary sculpt only thin protection against virtually identical works.
in order to determine the scope of protection for the sculpt,we must first filter out any unprotectable elements.producing small plastic dolls that resemble young females is a staple of the fashion doll market.to this basic concept,the bratz dolls add exaggerated features,such as an oversized head and feet.but many fashion dolls have exaggerated the oversized heads of the blythe dolls and my scene barbies as examples.moreover,women have often been depicted with exaggerated proportions similar to those of the bratz betty boop to characters in japanese anime and steve madden ads.the concept of depicting a young,female with exaggerated features,including an oversized head and feet,is therefore unoriginal as well as an unprotectable idea.herbert rosenthal,at we think the production of jeweled bee pins is a larger private preserve than congress intended to be set aside a jeweled bee pin is therefore an idea that defendants were free to copy.
mattel argues that the sculpt was entitled to broad protection because there are many ways one can depict an exaggerated human figure.it true that there a broad range of expression for bodies with exaggerated features one could make a fashion doll with a large nose instead of a small one,or a potbelly instead of a narrow waist.but there not a big market for fashion dolls that look like patty and selma bouvier.little girls buy fashion dolls with idealized means slightly larger heads,eyes and lips slightly smaller noses and waists and slightly longer limbs than those that appear routinely in nature.but these features can be exaggerated only so much make the head too large or the waist too small and the doll becomes freakish,not idealized.
the expression of an attractive young,female fashion doll with exaggerated proportions is thus highly constrained.data east usa,epyx,cir because of these constraints,karate is not susceptible of a wholly fanciful presentation.because of the narrow range of expression,the preliminary sculpt is entitled to only thin copyright protection against virtually identical copying.skyy spirits,cir photo of vodka bottle meri
