software,software appeals the decision of the united states patent and trademark office pto trademark trial and appeal board,dismissing its opposition to communications,communications registration of communications for interactive multimedia containing information on the fields of health,pharmacy,and medicine.software,commc ns,opposition,wl ttab july,board opinion.because the board did not err in finding no likelihood of confusion,we affirm.
background 
communications provides educational and promotional goods and services for companies within the pharmaceutical and medical industries.its products fit within three broad categories live media,assistance with symposia presentations traditional media,educational videos for patients and printed newsletters and new media,interactive with symposia proceedings,patient educational materials on,and website development.approximately percent of its clients are pharmaceutical companies,and the remaining clients are biotechnology companies and medical associations.board opinion at.
the board found that communications used its mark in commerce no earlier than,and neither party challenges that determination.on december,communications applied to register the mark communications standard character form for goods identified as 
interactive multimedia containing educational information in the fields of pharmaceutical and medical product information,therapies and strategies,and medical,pharmaceutical,and healthcare issues in class.
serial emphasis added.given the restriction emphasized above,the board found that communications mark is limited to use on goods in the pharmaceutical and medical fields.board opinion at.on september,software filed an opposition to the application.
software provides goods and services exclusively to the music and entertainment industries.see id.at.in so far as the record establishes,all of its clients are in those fields,and it does not market or sell any of its products to consumers in the pharmaceutical or medical fields.accordingly,the board concluded that any overlap between the parties prospective purchasers or channels of trade is de minimis.id.at.it further found that software first used its mark in commerce prior to,thereby establishing priority both as to the trademark in question and for the purposes of establishing rights derived from its trade name and service marks.id.at.
software holds the registration for the mark standard character form for goods described as 
computer software featuring business management applications for the film and music industries and interactive multimedia applications for entertainment,education and information,in the nature of artists performances and biographical information from the film and music industries and instructions and information for playing musical instruments.
registration emphasis added.based on the restriction in software registration limiting the use of its marks to goods in the film and music industries,and the restriction in communications application limiting use of its mark to goods in the pharmaceutical and medical industries,the board found that communications goods were not explicitly encompassed by the scope of goods identified in software registration.board opinion at.moreover,it found that the parties goods were not related.id.at.it reasoned that while both parties sell goods in the same media format,interactive,that fact alone renders them neither identical nor related.see id.at.instead,paramount to this case is the focus of the parties claimed goods.both the registration and the application identify subsets of,defined by industry,not generally.the board concluded that because the claimed industries are distinct and separate,the software prepared for them,notwithstanding similarities in media platform,are different goods.id.
with respect to the similarity of the marks,the board found them to be very similar.id.at.communications disclaimed the term communications,and the board,following our precedent,compared the marks as a whole,including the disclaimed term,to determine the level of similarity between them.on that basis,while recognizing the limited import of communications in altering the appearance,sound,meaning,and commercial impression of the challenged mark,the board declined to find the marks identical.given that finding,because of the unrelated nature of the parties goods,no demonstrated overlap of purchasers or channels of trade,and an absence of other factors suggesting a likelihood of confusion,the board found that confusion is not likely,and dismissed software opposition.id.at.software appeals,and we have jurisdiction under a b.
discussion 
under the lanham act,d,the pto may refuse to register a trademark that is so similar to a registered mark as to be likely,when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant,to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.likelihood of confusion is a question of law,based on findings of relevant underlying facts,namely findings under the dupont factors.see palm bay,veuve clicquot ponsardin.we review the board legal conclusions de novo,and its findings of fact for substantial evidence.shen ritz hotel,citations omitted.neither we nor the board,however,are required to consider every dupont factor.id.at.rather,we need to consider only the factors that are relevant and of record.see id.moreover,any one factor may control a particular case.in re dixie,citing dupont,at.
bearing these principles in mind,we turn to software challenge.it contests the board ultimate conclusion that confusion is not likely,and its findings as related to five dupont factors the similarity of the goods in question intersecting channels of trade and purchasers the similarity of the marks the strength of its mark and communications intent in registering its mark.we address each of the challenged determinations in turn,find them to be appropriately supported,and conclude that the board correctly determined that there is no likelihood of confusion.
the board placed the greatest weight on its findings that the goods in question were not related and that the channels of trade and purchasers are different.because of the dominant role these factors play in this case,we find no error in the weight the board accorded them.
beginning with the relatedness of the goods,the board determination that the parties goods were not related is supported by substantial evidence.when reviewing its conclusion,we consider the applicant goods as set forth in its application,and the opposer goods as set forth in its registration.see bose qsc audio,citing dupont,at.the board found,and software does not challenge,that communications goods are limited to interactive multimedia in the fields of pharmacy and medicine.any incidental music or entertainment features contained in communications goods do not bring them within the music or entertainment fields,or alter the fact that they are produced for,and are,therefore,products within the pharmaceutical and medical fields.
by comparison,software registration,in relevant part,describes its goods as computer software featuring business management applications for the film and music industries and interactive multimedia applications for entertainment,education and information,in the nature of artists performances and biographical information from the film and music industries.registration emphasis added.accordingly,the board correctly found the scope of software registration to be limited to the film and music industries.software argues,however,that because its registration relates to interactive multimedia applications for entertainment,education and information,the board erred in declining to read the scope of its registration more broadly,as encompassing interactive multimedia software in any field.we disagree.such a reading would require us to improperly ignore scope limiting language within the clause it cites,language plainly limiting its registration to goods in the music and entertainment fields.therefore,the board properly found that communications goods do not come within the actual scope of software registration.this finding,however,does not end the inqu
