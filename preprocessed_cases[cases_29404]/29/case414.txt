appellants hollywood screentest of america,hst and james pascucci pascucci collectively appellants appeal an order granting summary judgment against them and in favor of respondents nbc universal,and nbc studios,collectively nbc.appellants also appeal an order sustaining respondent jeffrey zucker zucker demurrer without leave to amend and a judgment of dismissal in favor of zucker we affirm the order granting summary judgment as to all causes of action,and therefore find it unnecessary to address the demurrer.
contentions 
appellants contend that nbc motion for summary judgment was improperly granted because the trial court failed to adhere to the directions of a writ of mandate issued by this court and issues of material fact existed which should have been submitted to a trier of fact.appellants further contend that zucker demurrer was improperly granted because zucker,who was a top executive at nbc,may be held personally liable for appellants cause of action for breach of confidence.
factual background 
the parties initial communications regarding hollywood screentest 
pascucci is the president of hst.hst is a corporate entity formed by pascucci to develop and promote a television show also known as hollywood screentest,a reality show which would give ordinary people from all walks of life the chance to break into the hollywood entertainment community.respondents point out that the hollywood screentest idea is similar to a television show of the same name that aired for many years in the and.it was also similar to another show entitled don adams screen test,which aired in the.respondents also point out that in this decade,there have been many reality shows of the same genre,in which average people compete for the opportunity to become the next great pop star american idol,making the band,and pop stars,the next great wrestler tough enough,the next great model america next top model,the next great comedian last comic standing,and the next great sports announcer dream job.
pascucci contacted zucker about hollywood screentest in january by sending an to zucker,who had just been named president of nbc entertainment on january,zucker wrote back,indicating that he would like to see the power point presentation which pascucci had offered to to him.two days later,pascucci faxed a letter to zucker,along with a confidentiality agreement,indicating that he would send the power point presentation if zucker signed the confidentiality agreement.the confidentiality agreement provides,in part as an express condition to the hollywood screen test permitting nbc access to information nbc hereby agree s that all such information be deemed confidential and exclusively proprietary to the hollywood screen test the agreement excludes any information that is or becomes generally available to the public.pascucci sent the power point presentation,which promised a network of micro studios kiosks soon to be located in various mcdonald restaurants also,the presentation directed nbc to the hollywood screentest public website for visual samples for the concept behind the television series.
the parties communicated further over the next several months.zucker asked pascucci to contact john miller,who dealt with advertising and promotion for nbc,so that miller could evaluate the advertising opportunity provided by the kiosks pascucci had described.pascucci communications with miller began on february,when pascucci asked miller for a letter of intent.miller provided a letter expressing nbc interest in the kiosks to expose our programming to the people who would experience the hollywood screen test kiosks.in april,pascucci informed nbc that the kiosks would no longer be at mcdonald but at burger king.after an additional request that nbc agree to sell advertising on the kiosks,miller wrote pascucci indicating that it was not in the cards.pascucci contends that during this time frame,he provided nbc with several written treatments and described subsequent changes and developments in the concept.he also copyrighted those materials and registered them with the writers guild of america.
the revised concepts for hollywood screentest 
during the summer of,pascucci stopped nbc.however,the resumed in september of with a communication to zucker regarding a revised and improved hollywood screentest marketing plan and new internet game.zucker again referred pascucci to john miller.pascucci miller later that day with a revised concept involving partnerships with clear channel.three weeks later,pascucci miller with another revised concept involving an america funniest home show.miller responded by directing pascucci to jeff gaspin,head of reality television for nbc.on november,gaspin rejected pascucci proposal,stating unfortunately we are not looking for this type of program right now.
on december,pascucci wrote zucker and miller about another change in format involving the inclusion of short clips from classic movies.he two more times regarding this revised concept,and mentioned yet another possible partner,the amc channel.miller was uninterested,telling pascucci that he did not see any promotional advantage to nbc.
between january and september,pascucci wrote zucker again times.in a letter dated august,pascucci referred to himself as pain in the ass.his communications to zucker during this time included descriptions of revised versions of the show and queries as to how to get it on the air.
according to pascucci deposition testimony,zucker telephoned him in june and provided some encouragement for pascucci to continue his efforts.specifically,pascucci claimed,zucker stated that he like the idea for hollywood screentest and instructed pascucci to secure financing for the movie component of the project and to contact him when that was accomplished.
respondents present a different version of the communications during this time period.they state that between june,and september,zucker responded to pascucci messages only twice.in an august,communication,pascucci asked zucker,can you get me a letter of interest on hollywood screen test zucker responded,indicating that he was going to pass and telling pascucci to move on.on september,in response to an from pascucci stating,i wo bug you anymore after your final response,zucker responded,still going to pass thank you.
similarities between hollywood screentest and the nbc television show next action star 
on september,nbc issued a press release,which announced that nbc and silver pictures would be teaming up to present a new competitive reality series in which the winners would star in a action movie.
according to pascucci,after reading a september,article regarding the next action star project in variety,he noted numerous elements that he thought were derived from hollywood screentest.specifically,pascucci pointed out 
the whole multimedia aspect of hollywood screen test utilizing the internet,utilizing movie screens,utilizing the tv show to promote the film component of the show in order to garner greater ratings not only for this particular tv show the next action star but also other nbc shows.
pascucci also noted one of the elements that i gave zucker was having an acting coach on the set interacting with the contestants to assist them in their various challenges and u sing celebrities to act within a particular scene during various challenges.pascucci summed up his complaints as follows the acting coach.the different challenges.the different categories.the grand prize.the multimedia aspects.utilizing the movie as not only the grand prize but also utilizing it as part of the television show.going behind the scenes,what going behind the scenes in these actors minds before and after the challenge.the process of elimination during the challenges to where you end up with one male and one female winner.pascucci stated that he did not believe that nbc had any of those ideas before he gave them to nbc.
the creation of next action star 
nbc position is that it did not use any of pascucci ideas for hollywood screentest.in support of this position,nbc presented evidence that next action star was independently created by individuals and entities completely unrelated to nbc.that evidence,set forth below,documents the process by which next action star was created and developed by individuals at three different companies brass ring productions,grb entertainment,and silver pictures.the evidence shows that the development of next action star by these three companies occurred over the course of a year before the show creators presented it to nbc.
rick telles of brass ring productions provided a declaration in support of nbc summary judgment motion which explained that,during the summer of,he collaborated with his colleague cris abrego and two producers from grb entertainment to develop a program for usa networks called hollywood stunt school.the show was also known as usa next action hero.contestants would be eliminated each week with the winner appearing as a stunt person in a movie.usa networks ultimately decided not to move forward with the project.
according to telles declaration,sara chazen of united talent agency suggested that he meet with the production company silver pictures.at the meeting,the group discussed a reality show involving stunts,and greg noveck of silver pictures suggested that the show be attached to a movie and that the winners of the competition star in the movie,rather than merely appear in stunts.around this time telles and his colleagues began to refer to the show as next action star.
michael branton of grb entertainment was also a producer of next action star.branton declaration authenticated seven documents,including the proposal written for usa networks which was ultimately never developed,notes from meetings among the producers of the show,and various documents describing the state of the project at various times throughout.
gary benz is the president and ceo of grb entertainment and was an executive producer of next action star.benz declaration stated that next action star was created by a team of independent producers including benz and michael branton of grb,cris abrego and rick telles of brass ring,and greg noveck and dana shelbourne of silver pictures.benz never spoke with anyone at nbc regarding next action star until the show was pitched to nbc in august.
sara chazen of united talent agency also provided testimony regarding the development of next action star.she represented grb and brass ring in connection with the next action star project.chazen arranged a meeting in late at which grb and brass ring pitched an idea to silver pictures for the parties jointly to produce a reality competition show where the winners would appear in a movie.chazen testimony confirmed that at that meeting,greg noveck suggested that the program be tied to a movie which would star the winners of the show.chazen testified that she later arranged a pitch meeting at nbc where the independent producers presented next action star as a competition elimination show where men and women are going to get a chance to star in a movie.she explained that next action star would have one male and one female winner.
the declaration of nbc employee michael katz documents the scheduling and content of the meeting at which the next action star producers pitched the program to nbc.the testimony of fellow nbc executive jamila hunter corroborated katz account.jeffrey gaspin also provided testimony as to nbc interest in the project,and confirmed that nbc had no involvement with next action star prior to the initial meeting in august.
appellants have provided no evidence calling into question the statements provided by the witnesses from brass ring productions,grb entertainment,united talent agency,or any of the individuals present at the initial next action star pitch meeting.
procedural history 
the complaints and zucker demurrer 
appellants second amended complaint against respondents,the operative complaint against nbc,was filed on november.it included causes of action for breach of written contract,breach of implied in fact contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of confidence,unjust meruit,accounting,misappropriation of intangible property interests,and unfair competition.
zucker was named as a defendant in the second amended complaint as to the breach of confidence cause of action only.zucker filed a demurrer on december,which the trial court,the honorable alan buckner presiding,sustained with leave to amend on february.the third amended complaint,which named zucker in its fourth cause of action for fraud and in its fifth cause of action for breach of confidence,was filed on march.zucker demurred again,and on april,judge buckner sustained zucker demurrer without leave to amend.a judgment of dismissal in favor of zucker was entered on october.
nbc summary judgment motion and the first hearing 
on june,nbc filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.nbc argued,inter alia,that all of appellants claims were barred because there was no disputed issue of fact that next action star was independently created and that nbc used nothing submitted by appellants.under teich general mills,d,nbc argued that it was entitled to summary judgment.
appellants opposed the motion.they argued that zucker had signed a confidentiality agreement and encouraged appellants with favorable remarks about hollywood screentest.both parties filed objections to the evidence submitted by the opposing party,including objections to declarations.
judge buckner held a hearing on nbc summary judgment motion on august.upon considering the parties objections to evidence,he ruled that several of the opinions stated in the declarations of appellants expert witnesses harris tulchin and greg victoroff be stricken.after the hearing,he indicated that he would grant nbc motion for summary adjudication as to the fifth cause of action for unjust meruit but deny nbc motion in all other respects.
judge buckner asked appellants to provide a proposed order.the first two orders that appellants provided were rejected by judge buckner.the third proposed order and nbc objections thereto,had not been acted upon when judge buckner died in.
on friday,january,judge ricardo torres,who was appointed to replace judge buckner,signed and filed appellants third proposed order without notice and without conducting a hearing.
the writ petition and alternative writ 
nbc filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court on january,requesting that judge torres order be vacated and summary judgment be granted in nbc favor on march,this court issued an alternative writ of mandate which gave the superior court two options 
a vacate your order of january,denying petitioners summary judgment and granting them summary adjudication of petitioners fifth cause of action,and assign a new judge who will hold a hearing,decide the case on the record of the motion for summary judgment that has been previously submitted and on argument at that hearing,and issue an order that comports with code of civil procedure section,subdivision g or 
b in the alternative,show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate ordering you to do so should not issue.
on march,the superior court assigned the matter to the honorable rolf treu.by minute order dated march,judge treu accepted option a of the alternative writ and scheduled a new summary judgment hearing.in keeping with the instructions set forth in the writ,judge treu ordered that no further filings on this motion will be considered without permission having been previously granted by the court.
judge treu rulings 
prior to holding a new summary judgment hearing,judge treu issued tentative rulings on the parties evidentiary objections and invited additional briefing on those issues.nbc submitted a brief arguing in support of the admissibility of two of its declarations.appellants also submitted a brief which,according to judge treu minute order,mainly summarized rulings and argument before the late judge buckner and went well beyond the evidentiary issues at hand.appellants also submitted a wholly unsolicited declaration of counsel presumably to correct the objections made.
in a minute order dated july,judge treu ruled 
in view of the mandate by the court of appeal that the superior court was to analyze the motion de novo,the court is not going to consider plaintiff supplemental brief other than those portions dealing with the evidentiary issues 
the court will not consider the supplemental declaration of appellants attorney since that filing violates not only the order of this court but also the briefing sequence of code of civil procedure.
counsel are admonished at the hearing on this motion,that there is to be no reference made to any prior rulings by any other judicial officer.the motion is being analyzed by the court,and will be argued by counsel,de novo.
the summary judgment hearing by judge treu was held on august.before the hearing,judge treu gave three questions to the parties 
what admissible evidence is there before the court that the contents of the pitch of next action sta r to nbc in were not an independent creation 
what admissible evidence is there before the court that gaspin revealed,contributed or otherwise disclosed any content of the hollywood screentest pitch that was later used by nbc for next action star 
if the court finds for moving party on the issue of independent creation,what causes of action,if any,remain viable 
at the hearing,judge treu informed the parties of several evidentiary rulings.he sustained nbc objections to documentary evidence attached to a declaration of appellants counsel on the grounds of lack of authentication.in addition,he sustained nbc objections to the declarations of appellants experts harris tulchin and greg victoroff,striking the two declarations in their entirety.he also informed the parties that he did not read over pages of unmarked deposition pages attached to a second declaration of counsel filed with appellants opposition brief on the grounds that it was not in compliance with former rule of the california rules of court which requires that a party mark its deposition pages to indicate what testimony is pertinent.
after giving the parties the opportunity to respond to the questions that he had presented to them,judge treu granted nbc summary judgment motion and ordered nbc to prepare the order and judgment.the order was filed on september.judgment in favor of nbc was entered on september.
on november,appellants filed a notice of appeal from the september,judgment in favor of the nbc entities and from the october,judgment in favor of jeffrey zucker.
discussion 
compliance with this court writ of mandate 
appellants first argument is that the trial court failed to comply with the alternative writ of mandate issued by this court on march.the writ specified that the superior court should decide the case on the record of the motion for summary judgment that has been previously submitted.appellants argue that this directive was violated by judge treu when he made evidentiary rulings sustaining nbc objections to the documentary evidence attached to appellants counsel declaration and striking the declarations of appellants experts,harris tulchin and greg victoroff.appellants further contend that this directive was violated by judge treu failure to read the deposition excerpts which were filed in violation of former rule of the california rules of court.
a.the trial court properly considered and ruled upon the parties evidentiary objections 
compliance with this court alternative writ is reviewed de novo.hampton superior court cal d.the alternative writ issued by this court ordered the superior court to reconsider nbc motion for summary judgment on the record previously submitted by the parties.that record included evidentiary objections filed by both parties.there is no language in the order forbidding the superior court from considering these evidentiary objections or in any way preventing the superior court from exercising its ordinary powers in connection with its analysis of the summary judgment record.
the parties evidentiary objections were integral to the superior court evaluation of the summary judgment motion.under code of civil procedure section,the court is required to determine whether there are any triable issues of material fact.in order to make that determination,the court must necessarily first decide what admissible evidence it has before it part of the judicial function in assessing the merits of a summary judgment or adjudication motion involves a determination as to what evidence is admissible and that which is not.city of long beach farmers merchants bank th,d.
further,this court alternative writ specifically ordered that the superior court vacate its order of january.the superior court complied.that order contained a ruling on the summary judgment motion itself as well as rulings on the parties evidentiary objections.because the court of appeal ordered that judge buckner evidentiary rulings be vacated,a writ commanding the superior court to evaluate the record without reconsidering the evidentiary objections would essentially be an order overruling all such objections.that was not the intention of this court,as initial evidentiary rulings are within the domain of the trial court.see sambrano city of san diego th,d trial courts have a duty to rule on evidentiary objections,and it is not the function of an appellate court to make evidentiary rulings in the first instance.
the alternative writ ordered the superior court to appoint a new judge to examine the entire summary judgment record de novo.we find that judge treu correctly interpreted the writ by understanding it to allow him to make evidentiary rulings within his sound discretion.
appellants argue in the alternative that,if judge treu had the authority to make evidentiary rulings,he abused his discretion in refusing to consider a supplemental declaration filed by appellants attorney the supplemental declaration,filed on june,provided further authentication of documents attached to the previously filed declaration and according to judge treu was filed presumably to correct objections made.judge treu refused to consider the supplemental declaration for two reasons it was filed in violation of the court order specifying that no further filings would be considered without prior permission of the court and it was filed in violation the briefing sequence set forth in code of civil procedure section section.
both of judge treu reasons were sound.the alternative writ specifically directed the superior court to decide the case on the record that had previously been submitted.thus,the trial court was to consider only those documents that were before judge buckner.while judge treu had invited further briefing on the parties evidentiary objections,he had not given permission for a supplemental declaration to be filed.his refusal to accept such a filing was well within the court discretion.
in addition,section specifies the briefing sequence for a summary judgment motion.it provides for the submission of an opening brief with evidence,an opposition brief with evidence,and a reply brief,subds.a b.it does not allow for the submission of additional evidence by the opposing party after the moving party reply.judge treu refusal to accept the declaration on these grounds was also well within the discretion of the court.
b.the trial court acted within its discretion in failing to read the deposition testimony filed in violation of the california rules of court 
appellants claim that judge treu violated the writ directive to decide the case on the record of the motion for summary judgment that has been previously submitted because he failed to read over pages of deposition testimony attached to appellants attorney declaration that were filed in violation of rule of the california rules of court appellants argue that we should review this issue de novo,as it involves a question of whether the trial court properly followed this court writ of mandate.however,as we have discussed above,the writ did not divest the trial court of its inherent discretionary powers,which include making evidentiary determinations and taking appropriate action for noncompliance with organizational and formatting requirements.parkview villas,state farm fire casualty th,d parkview collins hertz th,d.we therefore review the court decision not to read through much of the testimony attached to appellants attorney declaration for abuse of discretion.
appellants rely on parkview to support their position.in parkview,the court of appeal,second appellate district,division,reversed a grant of summary judgment which was based on a lack of admissible evidence in opposition to the motion stemming from the plaintiff inadequate statement of undisputed material facts.parkview,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff separate statement required the court to comb the pages of declarations and hundreds of pages of attached documents to unearth evidence supporting plaintiff position.id.at,d.the trial court indicated that if it was not set forth in the separate statement,it did not exist because it is not set forth in the separate statement no triable issue of material fact exists.ibid.
the court of appeal determined that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the defendant motion for summary judgment without providing the plaintiff an opportunity to correct the deficiencies in its separate statement.parkview,supra,th at,d.in reversing the trial court judgment,the court of appeal stated the trial court dissatisfaction with parkview villa failure to file a proper separate statement is understandable appropriate,limited sanctions for that procedural error are proper terminating sanctions are not the respondent should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to file a proper statement.id.at,d.
the present case is distinguishable.first,judge treu did not disregard appellants entire separate statement.he did not exclude the deposition testimony or prevent appellants from relying on it in support of their opposition to nbc summary judgment motion.he simply admitted that he had not read through the scores of pages given the voluminous and unorganized form in which it was submitted to him.thus,appellants comparison of judge treu action as tantamount to terminating sanctions is not well taken.
appellants further argue that,under parkview,judge treu should have accepted appellants counsel offer to correct any of those errors.however,as noted above,judge treu action in failing to read what nbc counsel described as context provided in case someone wanted to look at what was between the pages was of far lesser consequence than the sanctions imposed by the parkview trial court in addition,judge treu was working under different procedural circumstances than those present in parkview.he had been specifically ordered by this court to decide the motion on the record that was previously submitted to judge buckner.he therefore made an appropriate ruling enforcing a mandate from a higher court which prevented additional submissions without prior approval.as judge treu stated at the hearing in response to appellants attorney request that he accept a corrected declaration 
the mandate of the court was to review the documents,review the motion,decide the motion based on the filed papers t hat exactly what the court did and has done.
judge treu decision to disallow a corrected declaration,offered at the end of the hearing on the summary judgment motion,was not an abuse of given this court mandate that he decide the case on the record before him.
ii.the summary judgment ruling 
appellants argue that the trial court grant of summary judgment should be reversed.because appellants believe that judge treu erroneously altered the record,appellants arguments regarding reversal of the summary judgment motion as to each cause of action rely on the record as it existed when nbc submitted its writ petition to this court.we have determined above that judge treu evidentiary rulings were in keeping with this court writ of mandate and were not an abuse of the trial court discretion.we therefore review the summary judgment on the record as it existed after judge treu evidentiary rulings.lopez baca th,d appellate court must consider all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion for summary judgment except that which the trial court properly excluded.our review is de novo.guz bechtel national,cal th,d.
independent creation 
the parties dispute heavily whether the legal doctrine of independent creation negates all of appellants causes of action against nbc.we therefore preliminarily address this doctrine and the cases cited by the parties.
the independent creation doctrine is set forth in teich general mills,d,teich.in teich,the plaintiff had developed an idea for a children item and submitted the idea to general mills with the thought that it might be used as a cereal box prize.in the summer of he met with an advertising and sales promotion manager at a division of general mills,who encouraged him to develop the idea.teich subsequent efforts to contact this manager were unsuccessful,but the following january he noticed a promotion for a similar item on a general mills cereal box and,upon purchasing and opening the box,found inside the box an item markedly similar to the one he had presented to the company.id.at.he sued general mills,claiming that the company had used his idea and that he was therefore entitled to compensation.he won before the jury but the trial court granted general mills motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.id.at.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the court explained that the defendant receipt of plaintiff idea for the product,and the similarity between plaintiff idea and defendant product,created an inference that the defendant used plaintiff idea.teich,supra,d at.however,the court found that this inference of use could be dispelled as a matter of law by direct evidence of independent creation.such evidence existed in teich.it consisted of the testimony of three witnesses and documentary evidence.id.at.the court held that this evidence dispelled the inference of use as a matter of law and explained it follows from the absence of copying that plaintiff has no cause of action.id.at,see also mann columbia pictures,d.evidence of the author independent creation of the screenplay shampoo rebutted plaintiff inference of access to and use of her work.nbc contends that the inference of use in this case is similarly rebutted by uncontradicted evidence that grb entertainment,brass ring productions,and silver pictures independently created the concept for next action star without any input from nbc.
appellants disagree,citing desny wilder cal d,desny for the proposition that it is not essential to recovery that plaintiff story or synopsis possess the elements of copyright protectibility if the fact of consensual contract be found.citation.in desny,the plaintiff had submitted to a producer at paramount pictures corporation a story idea based on a true story.plaintiff conceded for the purposes of argument that the synopsis was not sufficiently unique or original to be the basis for recovery under the law of plagiarism or infringement.id.at.despite plaintiff use of a story that was in the public domain,the court concluded that a factual issue,rather than one of law,was presented as to whether defendants used plaintiff synopsis or developed their production independently thereof.citations.id.at.thus,summary judgment was reversed for a determination of whether defendants appropriated plaintiff composition and used it or any part of it in the production of their photoplay without compensating the plaintiff for the value of his story.id.at.
desny is distinguishable.in desny,the defendants had presented no evidence of independent creation,nor had they produced any evidence denying their use.desny,supra,cal d at.here,in contrast,defendants have produced extensive evidence documenting the development and creation of next action star by entities entirely independent from nbc 
appellants repeated protests that they need not show originality in order to receive protection are unavailing.in fact,the originality of appellants ideas is irrelevant to the question of whether the independent creation of next action star precludes appellants causes of action.the key issue is not whether appellants ideas were original,but whether respondents used app
