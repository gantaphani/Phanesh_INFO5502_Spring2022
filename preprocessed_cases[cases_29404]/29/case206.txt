mckeown,circuit judge 
a picture is worth a thousand words.a photograph,especially when coupled with text,can convey a powerful message in this case,a potentially defamatory one.leah manzari,famous under her professional name,danni ashe,for her groundbreaking work in monetizing online pornography,claims that the daily mail online,an online news outlet,used a photograph of her to convey the defamatory impression that she had tested positive for hiv.
defamation claims,which arise out of state law,are significantly cabined by the first amendment,especially when the plaintiff is a public figure,like manzari.in order to prevail,manzari must show that the daily mail acted with actual malice.defamation by implication claims pose an additional hurdle manzari must first show that the article is reasonably understood to imply the defamatory statement,and she must then show that the daily mail published the article with knowledge of the false implication or reckless disregard for the truth of what the article implied.this case comes to us as an interlocutory appeal under california statute.cal.civ.proc.code.we agree with the district court that,at this stage in the litigation,manzari has presented sufficient evidence to move forward with her claim that the daily mail online employees acted with actual malice when they published the article implying that manzari was an sex worker.
background 
as we explain below,we state the facts,from the pleadings and evidence presented,taken favorably to the plaintiff.manzari is a pioneer in the online adult entertainment industry.her website,which she designed and launched in,began generating multimillion dollar revenues in the early.during this time,danni ashe was one of the most and popular porn actresses in the world,as well as a highly successful entrepreneur,with one of the most visited websites on the web.she retired from the adult entertainment industry in and sold,but the website remains active under that name.
associated news publishes the daily mail,a popular united tabloid newspaper,which also has an online version known as the daily mail online collectively the daily mail.in,the daily mail online ran an article covering the shutdown of the los porn industry caused by a female performer testing positive for hiv.the headline read porn industry shuts down with immediate effect after female performer tests positive for hiv.after a few lines of text,the article contained a picture of manzari lying suggestively across a bed with in bed with danni written in neon lights behind her.under her photograph was the caption moratorium the porn industry in california was shocked on wednesday by the announcement that a performer had tested hiv positive.the article stated that the actress was new to the industry and that the performer was not immediately identified.later in the article were two other photographs,but not of manzari.one photograph appears to show a naked woman,whose face is not visible,leaning against a stripper pole.the other picture shows an unidentified couple being photographed while lying on a couch.
the beginning of the article appeared as follows we have redacted manzari face 
tabular or graphical material not displayable at this time.
immediately after the story was published,manzari attorney sent the daily mail online a cease and desist letter insisting that it remove manzari photograph from the article.the daily mail complied.according to manzari,by then the damage was done the article had been syndicated and quickly spread across the globe via the internet and within minutes,could be seen as far as east africa and india.manzari provided examples of google searches and other search results revealing thumbnails that show only the headline coupled with her photograph,without any explanatory text.
manzari brought a libel and false light suit against the daily mail under california law,which she filed in federal court under diversity jurisdiction.a.the complaint sought three million dollars in damages to manzari business and reputation.manzari contends that the juxtaposition of her image with the explosive headline and caption conveyed the impression that she is the performer who tested positive for hiv.manzari claim that she does not and has never had hiv is not contested.instead,the daily mail responds that the article made no such implication and that,in any event,it did not intend to convey the impression that the article was about manzari,but instead simply chose a stock photo to illustrate the article.
the article author,daily mail online journalist james nye,claims that the name of the performer who tested positive for hiv was unknown.to illustrate the article,nye asked the daily mail online photo desk to supply him with some pictures representative of the pornographic film industry that contained no nudity.he selected three stock photographs,including the one of manzari,that clearly conveyed the concept of the pornographic film industry,showing a camera near a woman on a bed in lingerie.jack forbes,the assistant photo editor who initially selected the photographs from the corbis images database,stated that he included the photograph of manzari because it was a good,photograph to illustrate an article about the pornographic film industry.according to manzari,the corbis database included the following information with the photograph soft porn actress danni ashe,founder of,poses in front of a video camera connected to the internet in one of her studios in los angeles in,although this information was not included in the article.
the daily mail moved to strike manzari complaint under the california lawsuit against public participation statute,cal.civ.proc.code,on the ground that the defamation suit targeted the news outlet protected exercise of free speech and that manzari could not show a probability of prevailing on the merits of her claim.the california statute was passed to combat a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.id.a see also id.b a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
the daily mail argued that,as a public figure,manzari would be unable to prove that the news outlet had acted with actual malice when it published the article.the district court denied the motion to strike,concluding that even if manzari were a public figure,having considered the totality of the choices and admissions made by the mail online staff,a jury could reasonably conclude that those who created the article intended to convey the impression known by them to be false that plaintiff tested positive for hiv.
this case arises from an interlocutory appeal of the district court denial of the daily mail motion to strike.denials of california motions are appealable orders because the statute operates as an immunity from suit,rather than as a defense.dc comics pac.pictures,cir.through the lense of california statute,we review de novo manzari defamation claim.see makaeff trump,llc,cir.

to prevail on an motion,the moving defendant must make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff suit arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant constitutional right to free speech.the burden then shifts to the plaintiff,to establish a reasonable probability that it will prevail on its claim in order for that claim to survive dismissal.cal.civ.proc.code b under this standard,the claim should be dismissed if the plaintiff presents an insufficient legal basis for it,or if,on the basis of the facts shown by the plaintiff,no reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff.metabolife int l,wornick,cir.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.

having published an article on a topic of public interest the public health aspects and safety of a large california industry,the daily mail easily satisfied its initial burden.there is no serious dispute that the libel and false light suit targeted speech protected by the statute.cal.civ.proc.code e including any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest.
the burden thus shifts to manzari to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits reasonable probability in the statute has a specialized meaning.the statute requires only a minimum level of legal sufficiency and triability.indeed,the second step of the inquiry is often called the minimal merit prong.mindys cosmetics,dakar,cir.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.see metabolife int l,at a defendant motion should be granted when a plaintiff presents an insufficient legal basis for the claims or when no evidence of sufficient substantiality exists to support a judgment for the plaintiff.citations omitted.
california courts have repeatedly emphasized that o nly a cause of action that lacks even minimal merit constitutes a slapp,gradient analytics,cal.rptr.app.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a plaintiff is not required to prove the specified claim to the trial court rather,so as to not deprive the plaintiff of a jury trial,the appropriate inquiry is whether the plaintiff has stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.mann quality old time,cal.rptr.app.citations omitted emphasis in original.to determine whether a plaintiff has substantiated a legally sufficient claim,courts look to the pleadings and affidavits presented by both parties,but courts do not weigh credibility,nor do they evaluate the weight of the evidence.instead,courts accept as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant evidence only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff submission as a matter of law,cal.rptr.at.
ii.public figure 
the threshold question that frames our defamation analysis is a legal one.whether an individual is a public figure is a question of law that must be assessed through a totality of the circumstances.see reader digest ass superior court,cal.as the supreme court articulated in gertz robert welch,i n some instances an individual may achieve such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts.more commonly,an individual voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues.even before the supreme court public figure analysis,we observed that public figures for defamation purposes include,artists,athletes,business people,dilettantes,anyone who is famous or infamous because of who he is or what he has done.cepeda cowles magazines,cir.
in earlier cases we have attributed public figure status to individuals of comparable or even less fame than manzari.see solano,at television actor on a popular show was a public figure leidholdt inc,cir.leader in the movement,who had participated in numerous news article and public debates on the topic of pornography,was a public figure carafano,supp,cal.aff on other grounds,cir.television actress with a popular fan website was a general purpose public figure.
manzari celebrity in the porn world might mean that she is less of a household name than stars in other sectors of the entertainment industry,but that does not make her fame any less pervasive.the daily mail presented extensive support for its position that manzari is a public figure,including interviews with manzari in her persona as danni ashe and news coverage related to her considerable success performing in and marketing online porn.among many other new sources reporting on manzari business and career,the boston globe called danni ashe a poster girl for the flourishing online pornography industry,the observer called her the first cyberporn millionairess,and the san francisco chronicle noted that by danni hard drive had more than paying subscribers.in an interview manzari gave to the wall street journal,she stated that her website was originally created as an extension of her fan club and,as she told,p eople are interested in adult entertainment.they always have and they always will be.
the complaint itself states that danni ashe is considered the most downloaded woman on the internet and that her image has graced the cover of the wall street journal.in the late,manzari competed against actress cindy margolis to win the guinness world record for most downloaded woman on the internet and,according to both abc news and a press release from her own website,manzari attained the record with,downloads.in an independent study conducted in,manzari was found to have the most popular site run by and featuring women on the web,far surpassing the amount of internet traffic for websites of such ubiquitous celebrities as martha stewart and oprah winfrey.she has starred in dozens of adult films,and,in addition to giving numerous interviews,manzari also testified before congress during the passage of the child online protection act in.with millions of internet downloads,extensive publicity,and broad public exposure,manzari undoubtedly qualifies as a public figure.
iii.reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits 
to prevail,manzari will eventually need to present clear and convincing evidence that the daily mail article contained a defamatory implication and that the daily mail acted with actual malice when it published the article with her photograph.see kaelin globe comm,cir.a public figure in a defamation case can not recover unless he proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant published the defamatory statement with actual malice,with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.internal quotation marks and citations omitted however,at the stage,a public figure who sues for defamation must establish a probability that he or she can produce such clear and convincing evidence,cal.rptr.at emphasis added see also burrill nair,cal.rptr.app.w e must determine at the stage whether the plaintiff has made a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain her burden of demonstrating a high probability that the defendant published the defamatory statements with knowledge of their falsity or while entertaining serious doubts as to their truth.
at this juncture in the proceedings,manzari is not required to to prove the specified claim,mann,cal.rptr.at internal quotation marks omitted.she need only convince us that her claim has minimal merit,and she has done so,cal.rptr.at.we agree that manzari has presented sufficient evidence both as to the article defamatory implication and the daily mail actual malice to survive the motion to strike.
defamatory implication 
the daily mail did not affirmatively state that manzari was the performer with hiv,but the implication and the conclusion were ne
