factual and procedural history 
songwriters david spradley,garry shider,and george clinton created atomic dog in a recording studio in january,working without a written score.as a result,the composition of atomic dog is embedded in the sound recording testimony at trial indicated that the song was composed recorded the initial tracks in the studio and recalled that when george arrived he had been partying pretty heavily so he was,you know,feeling pretty good,and was unsteady at the microphone.spradley and garry shider got on either side of him.we just kind of kept him in front of the microphone while clinton recorded the vocal tracks that same night.atomic dog was released in on the computer games album issued by capitol records,which retained the copyright to the album.spradley,shider,and clinton later transferred their interest in the composition of atomic dog to bridgeport.
according to expert testimony at trial,atomic dog is an anthem of the funk era,one of the most famous pieces from that whole era one of the most famous songs of the whole repertoire of funk and r in addition to the song continuing popularity on its own,atomic dog and other works by clinton and are said to have influenced many contemporary rap and hip hop artists,with the most notable being the style of rap popularized by west coast rappers such as dre,ice cube,snoop dogg,and coolio.see charles hughes,clinton,george,in african american national biography,henry louis gates evelyn brooks higginbotham.testimony at trial confirmed that atomic dog and other works by clinton are among the most popular works sampled by rap and hip hop artists.according to an expert musicologist,the bow wow refrain is one of the most memorable parts of the song and is often licensed by itself.

ii.discussion 
reduced to its essentials,this appeal challenges the propriety of the jury instructions in three respects substantial similarity,fair use,and willfulness.on appeal,we review jury instructions as a whole to determine whether they adequately inform the jury of the relevant considerations and provide a basis in law for aiding the jury in reaching its decision.williams paint valley local sch,cir citation omitted.the legal correctness of the instructions is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.see id.the refusal of a district court to give a particular instruction,however,is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see id.at.reversal of a jury verdict based on incorrect jury instructions is warranted only when the instructions,viewed as a whole,are confusing,misleading,and prejudicial.romanski detroit entm t,llc,cir citing barnes fiberglas,cir.as a result,we will not set aside a jury verdict on the basis of a technically faulty jury instruction when the error is harmless.see barnes,at.
substantial similarity 
there are two essential questions at the heart of any copyright infringement action whether the plaintiff owned the copyrighted work and whether the defendant copied it.see kohus mariol,cir.the federal constitution requires,moreover,that to be actionable the copying must be of elements of the copyrighted work that are original.see feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.to be original,an element must both be an independent creation of its author and involve at least minimal creativity.see id.at.to establish that it has been copied,a plaintiff must either introduce direct evidence of the defendant copying or prove it indirectly by showing that the defendant had access to the plaintiff work and that there is a substantial similarity between it and the defendant work,thus giving rise to an inference of copying.see ellis diffie,cir.even if access can not be proven,a plaintiff may prevail by showing a high degree of similarity between the two works.see id.at.
the sixth circuit has condensed the inquiry into a test first,the court must identify which aspects of the artist work,if any,are protectible by copyright and,second,determin e whether the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to the protectible elements of the artist work.kohus,at quoting sturdza united arab emirates,internal quotation marks deleted.put another way,copying is an essential element of infringement and substantial similarity between the plaintiff and defendant works is an essential element of copying.wickham knoxville int l energy exposition,cir.to complete the first step,the court must filter out elements of the work that are not original to the author.murray hill publ ns,twentieth century fox film,cir noting that the standard for originality is quite low and that the vast majority of works make the grade quite easily quoting feist,at.scènes à faire the indispensable or standard aspects of a work,or those that follow directly from unprotectable ideas should be filtered out as well.id.at.
once the unprotectable elements have been filtered out,the two works can be compared to determine whether they are substantially similar,a question of fact.we have previously held that the question for the jury in cases is whether a lay observer would consider the works as a whole substantially similar to one another.murray hill twentieth century fox,at quoting williams crichton,cir.however,as have several of our sister circuits,we have also noted that it is appropriate to modify this inquiry for situations in which a smaller fragment of a work has been copied literally,but not the overall theme or approach referred to in the literature as fragmented literal similarity.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a ed.see also bridgeport,dimension films,cir recognizing the fragmented literal similarity standard but declining to apply it in cases of digital sampling positive black talk cash money records,cir noting support for this approach in other circuits.in such situations,even a small degree of copying may support a finding of substantial similarity,depending on the context.see murray hill publ ns,abc,cir to constitute infringement,a single line taken from a protected work would have to be an integral part of that work rather than merely an incidental part of the background and,by analogy,as readily recognizable in terms of its relationship as phone home is to its movie source.thus,the copying of a relatively small but qualitatively important or crucial element can be an appropriate basis upon which to find substantial similarity.see baxter mca,cir citing heim universal pictures,cir for the proposition that a single brief phrase so idiosyncratic as to preclude coincidence might suffice to show copying.however,random similarities scattered throughout the works are not a proper basis for a finding of substantial similarity.murray hill twentieth century fox,at quoting litchfield spielberg,cir.
in this case,umg asserts on appeal that the jury was improperly instructed on filtering and substantial similarity and that a properly instructed jury could not have concluded that the two works in question were substantially similar.specifically,the defendant contends that the jury should not have been able to consider either the word dog used as musical punctuation or the rhythmic panting in in me as infringment because those elements are not original and,thus,should have been filtered out.umg also argues that the jury should have been instructed to consider the two songs as a whole when determining substantial similarity and,so instructed,would not have found substantial similarity due to the different mood and theme of the two songs and the limited usage of elements from atomic dog in in me.we disagree,based on our conclusions,first,that the jury instructions were not erroneous as a matter of law and,second,that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give the instructions requested by the defendant.
as noted previously,the standard for originality is a low one,and the vast majority of works make the grade quite easily.feist,at.in this case,expert testimony presented at trial was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that clinton use of the three disputed elements in atomic dog met this minimal standard.additionally,there was expert testimony that these elements were not just the mere abstract idea of a dog or of the activity of panting because,in clinton composition,the word dog constituted a melody of one word used as musical punctuation at intervals on the tonic note of the song and because the sound of panting followed the rhythm of the song.testimony by david spradley,a of atomic dog,also demonstrated that clinton exercised some degree of creative control over the panting by instructing the performers to create a certain rhythm.
umg also argues that the jury should not have been permitted to consider the use of the word dog and the panting because,as umg alleges,they were not a part of the composition copyright of atomic dog but,instead,were elements of the sound recording,in which bridgeport has no interest.cited as support for this proposition is the sheet music to atomic dog,which includes the bow wow refrain but not the musical punctuation of dog or the panting.the sheet music,however,was created long after the song was composed.uncontroverted testimony at trial established that the song was composed and recorded in the studio simultaneously and,therefore,that the composition was embedded in the sound recording.
umg further argues that the district court erred in failing to inform the jury,in connection with the instruction on substantial similarity,that they should consider the similarity of the works as a whole.given that the two songs differed in theme,tempo,and style,umg argues,no reasonable jury could have found substantial similarity.but,instead of instructing the jury to consider the works as a whole,the district court utilized the fragmented literal similarity standard.we conclude that in the circumstances of this case,there was no error.
although there does not appear to be a reported sixth circuit opinion explicitly adopting this approach,we have recognized its viability.see murray hill publ ns abc,at w hen a single line of a larger copyrighted work is appropriated by an alleged infringer,the test is whether the work is recognizable by an ordinary observer as having been taken from the copyrighted source.quoting universal pictures harold lloyd,cir internal quotation marks omitted and citing whitney ross jungnickel,here,only two lines are claimed to have been appropriated from plaintiffs lyric this would not prevent recovery if the lines claimed to have been appropriated constitute an important and vital part of the two compositions rather than being merely incidental or trivial.but,fragmented literal similarity has been applied by district courts in our circuit and,as noted above,by our sister circuits.see,neal publ ns f w publ ns,d,tree publ warner.records.
here,bridgeport alleged in its complaint that umg had copied specific elements of atomic dog and that these elements were copied literally.thus,the overall concept or tone of the work was not relevant to the jury task.instead,the jury heard testimony that described the copied elements of atomic dog as unique to the song and the bow wow refrain,in particular,as the most aspect of the terms of iconology,perhaps the functional equivalent of,phone home.thus,the jury did not act unreasonably in concluding that there was substantial similarity,given evidence that the copied elements had such great qualitative importance to the song.it follows that the district court did not commit reversible error in basing its instructions on fragmented literal similarity.
on appeal,umg also contends that the district court failed to give the jury an adequate instruction on fair use,an affirmative defense that it raised at trial.the doctrine of fair use operates to prevent the mechanistic enforcement of copyright law in a way that would work to repress creativity.see princeton.press.doc,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.it constitutes an affirmative defense that may be raised when there is substantial similarity between two works and evidence of copying.see castle rock entm t,carol publ g group,cir quoting nimmer on copyright a.under the federal copyright statute,fair use covers purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching,scholarship,or research.in determining applicability of the doctrine of fair use,courts consider these statutory factors 
the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 
the nature of the copyrighted work 
the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and 
the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
the supreme court has held that these statutory factors must be considered in light of the purposes of copyright.campbell music,d.for instance,the first purpose and character of the use takes into account whether the work is transformative,that is,whether it would further the purpose of copyright to advance scientific and artistic endeavor.see id.at.similarly,the second fa
