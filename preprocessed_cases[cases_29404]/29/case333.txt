upon sua sponte reconsideration of this appeal,we vacate our prior opinion,published at cir,and substitute the following opinion in its place.
orrin monroe corwin,appeals a november order disposing of several evidentiary issues and granting summary judgment in favor of,walt disney world company worldco or disney for its precursor a april order denying corwin motion for clarification and reconsideration and a may order adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge awarding taxable costs to worldco.
because we find that corwin failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to either worldco access to mark water rendering of a theme park concept entitled miniature worlds or as to striking similarity between that rendering and epcot experimental prototype city of tomorrow,we affirm as to summary judgment and the motion to reconsider.in addition,because corwin objection to the district court costs order was untimely,and because corwin failed to show excusable neglect for his untimeliness,the district court acted properly in refusing to address the merits of that objection.accordingly,we affirm the district court costs order.
background 
this appeal arises out of a copyright infringement suit filed by corwin against worldco corwin is the former neighbor of mark waters ii and the sole heir to his estate.corwin asserts that waters,while living in hawaii in the,painted a rendering of a concept for an international theme park in miniature miniature worlds painting or painting.waters allegedly did so at the request of robert jaffray,who had conceived of the idea after viewing miniature villages elsewhere,particularly in britain.jaffray concept entailed cities,villages,and landscapes representing nineteen nations from six continents.it included animals,buildings,landscaping,and human figures carved from wood.for each nation represented,the model would include representations of places of particular historical or geographical interest including recognizable structures such as the roman coliseum or london big ben.everything was to be in miniature.shortly after the painting was complete,the jaffrays left hawaii.jaffray did not keep in touch with waters.
corwin asserts that jaffray attempted to take his theme park concept to walt disney in the,and that he took the painting and a presentation of the concept to a meeting with a disney representative in or,but later received a rejection letter.worldco denies such a meeting occurred.
corwin alleges that epcot,which was opened by worldco in,was copied from waters illustration of jaffray concept.he particularly points to a similarity between the painting and a rendering of epcot.waters allegedly painted the miniature worlds painting as a freelance artist and retained his ownership of the copyright interest.corwin,who only recently found out about his inherited interest in the painting and the claim,registered the copyright in and sued worldco for copyright infringement shortly thereafter.specifically,he alleges that worldco infringed upon his exclusive rights to reproduce the painting,to prepare derivative works of the painting,to distribute copies of the painting,to display the painting,and to attribution of the painting pursuant to,and,a a,and.
access evidence 
in support of his assertions regarding disney access to the painting,corwin has produced the testimony of waters former wife,jaffray widow,and jaffray daughters.he has also produced two letters and two notes.
waters former wife,ellen pauline waters,denied any knowledge of the miniature worlds painting in particular prior to having seen a story about it in a toledo,ohio newspaper in.at.she said that waters had not discussed the jaffrays in detail but that he had told her he was doing work for jaffray.id.at.she also reported that waters had talked to her about the miniature worlds project which she understood was to be located outside washington,id.at.
marian jaffray,jaffray widow,testified that she believed jaffray had met with a representative of walt disney in or.at.she also testified that jaffray ultimately received a rejection letter.id.at.marian jaffray was not at the alleged meeting and conceded that she did not know what jaffray took with him to that meeting,but just assumed he took the total picture of his plans.id.at.she was unable to produce the rejection letter.id.at.
jaffray daughter,patricia jaffray jones,testified that she remembered picking her father up at a train station after an alleged meeting with disney.at.she speculated that disney did not return the materials jaffray had used in his presentation at the alleged meeting until a couple of months thereafter.id.at.however,she could not personally confirm the presence of the painting among these materials,nor did she attend the alleged meeting herself.id.at.jones also testified that when her father viewed a depiction of epcot sent to him by mail in,she heard him say,oh,my god,they built it i left everything with them they must have photographed and copied everything.no wonder they kept it for a month.at.jones testified that in connection with this statement,jaffray specifically mentioned blueprints,his site map,and the drawings.id.
as for the documentary evidence,the first letter,dated may,is from jaffray to joseph reddy,director of public relations at disney.in the letter,which apparently renews an already rebuffed offer to bring his idea to disney,jaffray expresses his understanding that walt disney has his hands completely full and can not consider new projects at this time,exh.a may note from reddy to william cottrell,one of disney upper level executives,inquires is there anything we can do on this,exh.it is unclear from the record,however,to what the note refers.finally,a letter dated june from reddy to jaffray states that disney is only designing the exhibits for the world fair and that ford and general electric let the contracts for manufacturing the miniatures and the actual buildings,exh.reddy informed jaffray that the new projects for disneyland are already in work for the next few years and concluded the letter by expressing regret that he could be of no more help to jaffray.id.the final note comes from the period of time during which worldco was developing epcot.martin sklar,one of the leaders of the epcot design team,apparently during a meeting,drew an arrow on a piece of paper.the arrow runs from left to right and to the left of it is written miniature world and micro miniature world,exh.to the right of the arrow is written cat route to the future.id.at the top of the same page are another set of notes referring again to the cat as well as to our town narrator and rabbit.id.sklar testified that he does not remember what he was thinking about when he made these notes,exh.at.
expert witnesses 
as the litigation progressed,the district court set a final discovery in april,with expert witness disclosures due from corwin in june.corwin timely disclosed the reports of four experts thomas colbert,robert rydell,peter alexander,and frank constantino.
the expert report of thomas colbert introduces itself as a comparison of basic concepts,program,and design between the waters proposal for miniature worlds and epcot as it was finally built,exh.at.colbert proceeds by listing similarities in programmatic design elements,site design elements,and building design elements.he asserts that basic functional relationships between major elements of both projects are described by the exact same bubble diagram.id.at.he concludes that epcot as finally built bears a striking similarity to the graphic expression of miniature worlds as prepared by waters.id.at.he notes specifically that 
a t every level,from the basic concept and basic organization,to the way nationally themed pavilions are arranged around a vast lake while being visually and functionally separated by landscaped,wooded areas with plantings indigenous to the nations under consideration to the way the artistic renderings are composed with landscaped access to parking on the lower left hand side and festive lake on the upper righthand side these two projects are the same.
id.finally,although he concedes that there are dissimilarities between the projects,he asserts that the core idea is in fact the same.id.emphasis added.colbert asserts that the exact combination and arrangement of elements which waters proposed was unique and had never before been proposed.id.at.he similarly concludes that mark waters design for miniature worlds was the source of the fundamental conception behind epcot in its final built form and that the waters painting is highly original.id.
the report of robert rydell also compares the waters painting and epcot,but in light of scholarly literature on the history of world fairs,theme parks,and amusement parks.the report lists common elements such as globes,ampitheatres,landforms,railroads and boats,national representations,a united states pavilion,horticulture,landscaping and overall plan,globalization,and lakes,exh.at unnumbered.the report next observes that most of these elements were commonly seen at world fairs prior to the development of either the painting or epcot.id.at unnumbered.the report catalogs some similarities in placement of elements between the painting and epcot but generally does not describe the placement of such elements in world fairs.the report also includes a long section on the development and history of world fairs and theme parks.finally,it concludes that 
t he arrangement of individual elements at epcot was neither coincidental nor happenstance.while individual elements in the epcot design may have been inspired by world f airs,the arrangement of these modules into a thematic whole appears to have been strongly influenced by mark waters miniature worlds p ainting.
id.at unnumbered.the report does not describe any specific expression or expressive effect of the arrangement of elements.
the expert report of peter alexander,who was director of project management support at walt disney productions during the epcot project,begins with an exposition on the organizational principles underlying various categories of theme parks,exh.at unnumbered.the report then offers a lengthy discussion of the development of epcot based upon a book on the topic written by steve mannheim and also upon alexander own experience at disney.id.at unnumbered.the findings of the study section lists a series of common ideas contained in the painting and epcot.on this basis,alexander concludes that there is a striking similarity between mar k waters painting of jaffray miniature world and disney epcot.id.at unnumbered.
in his report,alexander also asserts that there is no transition or development from one idea to the next in the epcot project and that the document production in the case has failed to uncover any intermediate steps that would explain the evolution of design or form.accordingly,he concludes that epcot,as it has been built,did not evolve from walt disney original vision of a city of tomorrow.id.at unnumbered.
constantino 
finally,the report of frank constantino is much briefer and includes several disclaimers clarifying that the report was not made in light of any assessment of any elements depicted in both drawings which may be in the public domain,exh.at.this report also includes a list of common elements,but,apart from noting the placement of the globe and the entry pavilion structure,it does not describe or discuss how each element is used in either the painting or the park.the report concludes that d espite the documented span of nearly twenty years between the original drawing and possible replicate illustration s during that period,the two images do indeed bear a substantially similar appearance to each other.id.at.
independent creation 
worldco has produced evidence of the independent creation of epcot in the form of the affidavit and other testimony of martin sklar currently vice chairman and principal creative executive at walt disney imagineering,one of the two men responsible for overseeing its design,planning,and construction.according to sklar,disney idea for an attraction arose from a concept called international street,a cluster of buildings,including restaurants and shops,designed to feature other countries and cultures,exh.sklar explained that dick irvine and bill cottrell,both disney executives,drafted memos outlining this concept in,long before the alleged meeting between jaffray and disney.id.after disney participation in the world fair,the concept then expanded into an international park with architectural pavilions,water,and pedestrian and boat access.eventually,this concept merged with the evolved version of walt disney original vision of a city of tomorrow.id.disney city of tomorrow concept had been intended to showcase emerging technology and was originally to feature a centerpiece hotel with shops,covered streets,residential developments,and office buildings radiating out from it,exh.at,exh.at.sklar also pointed out that many of the design elements incorporated into epcot had been featured at various world fairs held between and the use of a globe as a major icon,exh.
summary judgment and other motions activity 
worldco filed a motion to exclude portions of corwin experts reports,then filed a motion for summary judgment.in response to the motion for summary judgment,corwin submitted,among other things,new affidavits from his four experts.corwin claims that these affidavits merely redacted the portions of the original reports no longer applicable after dismissal of the trade secret claims.worldco filed a motion to strike certain of corwin evidence filed in opposition to the motion for summary the new affidavits and certain of the testimony concerning disney access to the painting.
on november,the district court granted the daubert motion to strike portions of corwin four initial expert reports on the grounds that those portions utilized improper methodology,impermissibly comparing ideas in the painting and epcot rendering and failing to compare expressive or protectable elements and the reports contained lists of similarities that are inherently subjective and unreliable the court granted the motion to strike the new affidavits on the ground that they were untimely filed.it also refused to admit the testimony of either marian jaffray or patricia jaffray jones regarding jaffray alleged meeting with disney or what he might have taken to such a meeting on the grounds that it was not based on personal knowledge and,thus,constituted inadmissible hearsay.the court also specifically found that jones report of her father exclamation upon receiving notice of epcot was not protected by the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule because corwin cited no case law to support his proposition that reading a letter and newspaper article constitutes a startling occasion for the purposes of this exception and failed to produce any admissible evidence demonstrating that jaffray had first hand knowledge that the miniature worlds painting was left with disney.at.
in the same order,the court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of worldco.the court first found that waters copyright interest in the painting was valid,giving corwin standing to sue,and that corwin had at least raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether waters selection as to how the castles and villages were arranged in the painting,the colors associated with the elements,and the overall structure and arrangement of the underlying ideas was original enough to be afforded protection against infringement.id.at.
the court then reasoned,however,that because it found corwin had failed to produce any admissible evidence demonstrating access or even an inference of access corwin would have to show striking similarity in order to prevail on his infringement claims.the court found,in comparing the miniature worlds painting with the rendering of epcot a t the level of protectable expression,that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the two works are strikingly similar id.at.the court also observed that even if there had been such a genuine issue of material fact,overwhelming,uncontroverted evidence that worldco independently created the epcot rendering supports summary judgment in favor of worldco.id.at.
motion for reconsideration 
corwin filed motions for reconsideration and clarification,which were considered as a single motion for reconsideration.in a order,addressing each of corwin arguments in light of separate exhibits that were not previously part of the record,the court denied the motions for reconsideration and clarification on the grounds that corwin had not pointed to new evidence or case law that create d a triable issue of fact on any matter before the court and b ecause there was no clear error or manifest injustice.at.
on december,worldco filed both a bill of costs and an application for attorneys fees and costs.on december,the clerk taxed costs in favor of worldco in the full requested amount of.the application for fees and costs was referred to a magistrate judge.in january,after issuing a report and recommendation as to this application,the initial magistrate judge recused herself and the motion was transferred to a second magistrate judge.the second magistrate judge issued an on january denying the application for costs as moot because it was duplicative of the costs already taxed by the clerk,and denying the application for attorneys fees without prejudice to refiling at the completion of the appellate process.at.worldco objected to the recommendation that attorneys fees be denied.although corwin responded to this with a reply brief in support of the recommendation to deny attorneys fees,he never filed any objection or otherwise addressed the portion of the report dealing with costs.the district court adopted the report and recommendation in full on may.on may,corwin filed a motion for leave to object to the bill of costs and an objection to the taxation of costs.the motion for leave was denied on august on the grounds that it was untimely and lacked any showing of excusable neglect.
on appeal,corwin argues that the district court wrongfully excluded testimony of waters former wife and jaffray widow and daughter,weigh ing the evidence in the guise of excluding virtually all of appellant evidence,thus creating the appearance of an absence of triable facts,appellant br.at the district court wrongfully excluded the reports of his experts in failing to conduct a daubert hearing and by employing the wrong standard for substantial similarity under copyright law,id.at due to the above and to the application of incorrect standards with regard to access,the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of worldco and corwin demonstrated excusable neglect for his failure timely to object to the taxation of costs,and even if he did not,the district court improper taxation ought to be reviewed on the merits.

testimony about access 
corwin complains that the district court improperly excluded his evidence prior to consideration of the summary judgment motion,when,taken all together,that evidence would have allowed inferences to be drawn that disney had access to the painting in the early.the court excluded the testimony of waters former wife on the ground that,based as it was upon conversations with waters,it constitute d hearsay and speculation.at.ellen waters has asserted no direct personal knowledge of the painting or the transaction between waters and jaffray.the court similarly found the testimony of both marian jaffray and patricia jaffray jones to be inadmissible because it was not based on personal knowledge and was therefore speculative.id.at.neither woman claims to have been at the alleged meeting between jaffray and any disney representative,and neither claims personal knowledge of what materials jaffray took with him to any such alleged meeting.because a court is not required to accept as true testimony that is not based on personal knowledge and because none of this excluded testimony was based on personal knowledge,the district court did not abuse its discretion in disregarding this testimony citizens concerned about our children,at.

there is no dispute that the four experts in question were qualified to testify competently regarding matters they intended to address.rather,the court excluded the expert reports on the grounds that they were based upon improper methodology and failed to assist the trier of fact.ideas,as opposed to expression of those ideas,are not protected by copyright law.herzog castle rock entm t,cir per curiam district court opinion affirmed and annexed to eleventh circuit ruling.thus,if an expert relies on uncopyrightable ideas rather than on expression of those ideas in analyzing alleged copyright infringement the report is excludable.see rice fox broad,cir.
