echostar satellite,a provider of satellite television service,petitions for review of two orders in which the federal communications commission adopted an improved version of its individual location illr model for predicting the strength of broadcast television signals.in response to congressional directives in of the satellite home viewer improvement act of both to adopt a reliabl e model and to ensure that the model takes into account loss of signal strength due to terrain,building structures,and other land cover variations,c,the commission altered its illr model for uhf stations but,as a practical matter,did not do so for vhf stations.echostar argues,among other things,the decision with respect to vhf stations violated c.six associations of broadcasters and the fox broadcasting company have intervened in support of the commission.for the reasons stated below,we deny echostar petitions in all respects.
background 
a network television broadcaster generally has exclusive rights,pursuant to the copyright act,to authorize the public display of its copyrighted content,including the retransmission of its broadcast signal.in the satellite home viewer act of shva,the congress,in order to make network programming available to households outside the broadcast range of a local network affiliate,gave satellite carriers a statutory license,that is,a compulsory license subject to payment of a prescribed royalty,to retransmit to unserved households the signals of no more than two distant network television stations.a a b.an unserved household is,with respect to a particular television network,one that is unable to receive by way of a conventional rooftop antenna a grade b signal,as defined by the commission,from one of that network affiliates.id.d a.
in the wake of the shva,the commission adopted the illr computer model to predict whether a household is likely to be able to receive a signal of the required strength and thereby minimiz e the need for testing.see satellite delivery of network signals to unserved households for purposes of the satellite home viewer act,report order,rcd,shva order.when it was adopted,echostar and others criticized the illr model because it did not account for loss of signal strength due to variations in land example,buildings and known as clutter loss.see id.the commission acknowledged that land cover affects signal intensity,but declined to include a clutter loss factor in the model because it was not aware of a standard means of including such information in the illr that has been accepted by the technical and scientific community.id.
in response,the congress enacted the satellite home viewer improvement act of shvia,directing the commission to take all actions necessary to develop and prescribe by rule a predictive model for reliably and presumptively determining the ability of individual locations to receive signals of grade b intensity.c.specifically,the commission was to rely on the illr model set forth in its shva order and ensure that such model takes into account terrain,building structures,and other land cover variations.id.the congress further directed the commission to establish procedures for the continued refinement in the application of the model by the use of additional data as it sic becomes available.id.finally,the shvia amended the copyright act to incorporate a statutory presumption in favor of the commission illr model.see a b ii i in copyright dispute between broadcaster and satellite carrier,court must rely upon illr model,as revised by the commission over time,to establish presumptively whether satellite subscriber is unserved.
pursuant to the shvia,the commission conducted the rulemaking here under review,proposing to adjust the illr model to incorporate the effects of both vegetation and buildings.see establishment of an improved model for predicting the broad.television field strength received at individual locations,notice of proposed rulemaking,rcd,illr notice.in particular,the commission proposed to subtract from each predicted signal strength a clutter loss value based upon one of ten different categories of land cover,using data from the land use and land cover lulc database published by the united states geological survey.id.loss of signal strength would be calculated using the figures in clutter losses and environmental noise characteristics associated with various lulc categories,ieee transactions on broadcasting,vol,by professor thomas rubinstein.id.recognizing certain limitations inherent in professor rubinstein figures,see id,the commission solicited comment on whether other data are available that would allow it to expand the application of clutter loss considerations,and whether there are other approaches that are scientifically supported and could be integrated into the illr model to take into account losses due to vegetation and structures.id.
various broadcasters,satellite carriers,and engineers commented upon the proposed rule.many criticized the methodology underlying the rubinstein data and one engineer,richard biby,submitted an alternative set of clutter loss figures.most significant,an empirical study jointly submitted by the national association of broadcasters and the association for maximum service television,compared approximately intensity measurements,taken during field testing in five geographic regions,with the signal strength predicted by the existing illr model and the model as adjusted for clutter loss based upon the rubinstein and the biby data.the study reported for each measurement whether the various models correctly predicted the presence of a grade b signal,predicted service at an unserved location,or predicted no service at a served location.the study concluded the proposed models were less accurate than the illr model already in use because they produced a lower percentage of correct predictions.finally,the associations argued that the shvia required the commission to leave its highly accurate model in place a bsent an method of improving the accuracy of the illr.the study was the only empirical study submitted by any commenter,and no commenter,including echostar,criticized the study prior to the commission initial decision.
relying upon the study,the commission concluded that for both vhf and uhf channels the illr model without clutter corrections prove d superior to the alternatives by making the correct prediction more often.establishment of an improved model for predicting the broad.television field strength received at individual locations,first report and order,rcd,illr report and order.with respect to vhf channels,the commission concluded that reducing predicted signal strength to take account of clutter loss would make the illr model less accurate because it already produces more than.id.accordingly,the commission set the clutter loss values for vhf channels to zero,id,thereby leaving the results generated by the model unchanged for those channels.with respect to uhf channels,however,the commission concluded an adjustment for clutter loss was appropriate because,by setting clutter loss figures at one third the levels proposed in the illr notice,it could produce a better balance between and without adversely affecting the overall percentage of correct predictions.id.
echostar petitioned for reconsideration,arguing the commission had abdicated its responsibility under the shvia to take into account clutter loss values in its predictive model for vhf channels.echostar also objected that the commission had relied upon the study without having made the supporting data available for comment.the two associations later filed those data with the commission,approximately one month before echostar reply was due.finally,echostar argued the commission had unlawfully refused to permit it to conduct signal strength tests at the premises of customers who claim to have been erroneously identified as served,rather than requiring those customers to pursue the waiver and testing process outlined in c,of which more later.
the commission denied echostar petition,explaining it had not ignore d clutter loss but rather had made a considered determination that the most accurate illr predictions for vhf stations under certain groundcover conditions,including buildings,are made by setting the corresponding loss values to zero.establishment of an improved model for predicting the broad.television field strength received at individual locations,memorandum opinion and order,rcd,reconsideration order.the commission also noted that the data underlying the study ha d been publicly available since well before it issued the illr notice,that the associations had filed the data in the record since issuance of the final rule,and that echostar had reviewed and utilized the raw data in its arguments.id.finally,the commission rejected echostar argument that the statute permits it,instead of following the waiver and testing procedures in c,to conduct its own testing for customers claiming to be unserved by signals from network affiliates.echostar now seeks review of the illr report and order and the reconsideration order.
ii.analysis 
echostar makes three arguments the commission by setting to zero the clutter loss term in the illr model for vhf stations,violated c by relying upon data not in the record,failed to comply with the notice and comment requirements of the administrative procedure act,b,c and by refusing to permit echostar and its customers to bypass the waiver and testing process outlined in c,violated what it identifies as a principle in the shva and the shvia that testing is the only way conclusively to determine whether a household is served or unserved.we review an agency interpretation of a statute it administers under the familiar process delineated in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.first,we must determine whether the intent of congress is clear.id.at.if so,then that is the end of the matter.id.if,on the other hand,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
land cover 
echostar first argues the commission failed to ensure that its predictive model takes into account terrain,building structures,and other land cover variations.c.according to echostar,the clear import of the statute is that the congress intended the illr predictive model to give dissimilar predictions based on dissimilarities in land cover the commission has discretion regarding how to incorporate land cover variations but not regarding whether to give them effect.therefore,argues echostar,the commission erred when it set the clutter loss factor to zero for vhf channels rather than incorporating in the model a term that would vary with land cover.
the commission makes two counterarguments,of which only the second is grounded in the decisions under review.first,it argues the illr model already takes into account land cover variation because the model was itself derived from empirical observations of signal intensity,and those observations would themselves have reflected some degree of clutter loss.because the statute directs the commission only to ensure the model takes into account variations in land not specifically to incorporate a variable for land commission argues it has complied with the statute by determining that the bias toward present in the existing illr model has the effect of accounting for land cover.though some broadcasters made this argument before the commission,the agency never adopted it.because we must rely only upon the reasons given by the agency,not counsel post hoc rationalizations for agency action,we disregard this ground for upholding the orders.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of state farm mut.auto.ins,d it is well established that an agency action must be upheld,if at all,on the basis articulated by the agency itself chamber of commerce of sec.
second,as it did in the rulemaking,the commission takes the position that any changes it makes to the model must comply with the statutory command that it craft a reliable predictive model.see c t he commission shall take all actions necessary to develop a predictive model for reliably and presumptively determining the ability of individual locations to receive signals of grade b intensity.according to the commission,echostar interpretation would read reliability out of the statute by requiring the commission to adopt one of the proposed adjustments even though it would reduce the accuracy of the model.instead,the commission says it conducted a thorough analysis of the adjustments proposed and made a considered determination that the most accurate illr predictions for vhf stations under certain groundcover conditions are made by setting the corresponding loss values to zero.reconsideration order,rcd.
we think the intent of congress is clear,chevron,at,and the commission reading of the statute clearly correct.the statutory directives in of the shvia,c,to ensure land cover is taken into account and to establish procedures for the continued refinement of the model are subordinate to the anterior and more fundamental mandate to design a model that reliably predicts signal strength.only in the context of prescribing such a model is the commission directed to ensure land cover is take n into account.id.moreover,of the shvia should be read in tandem with a of the same statute.see motion picture ass of,fcc,statutory provisions in pari materia normally are construed together to discern their meaning.the latter provision amended the copyright act,a b ii i,to require courts,in copyright disputes between broadcasters and satellite carriers,to rely upon the illr model as that model may be amended by the commission over time under section to increase the accuracy of that model.section a plainly contemplates any revision to the illr model adopted pursuant to will increase,not decrease,the accuracy of that model.therefore,when the commission determined,with respect to vhf stations,that the proposed adjustments would make the illr model less accurate,it lawfully set the clutter loss value to zero.illr report and order,rcd.
citing our decision in colorado united states department of the interior,echostar nonetheless argues the congress,not the commission,determined that the time was right to incorporate land cover variations into the illr model,and the commission had no power to that determination.in colorado we held unlawful a model adopted by the department of the interior doi to assess damages to natural resources from the release of oil or hazardous substances,as required by the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,et.colorado,at.although the statute expressly provided the doi regulations shall take into consideration factors including,but not limited to,replacement value,use value,and ability of the ecosystem or resource to recover,c b,the doi had promulgated a rule based only upon lost use value because adequate data were not available to create a standardized model based on average values for restoration costs.colorado,at quoting.we rejected this justification for the department failure to regulate as instructed,reasoning that data limitations can not justify doi decision to ignore the clear mandate of congress.id.here,too,argues echostar,the agency simply ignored an express direction of the congress because the data in echostar words seemed inadequate.
actually,this case is quite different from colorado.as we explained in the companion case of ohio united states department of the interior,our insistence there that the model incorporate a term for restoration cost was based not merely upon its inclusion in a list of factors the regulations were to take into consideration,but also upon the congress having expressed in other provisions of the cercla a clear preference for restoration as the basic measure of natural resources damages.id.at.we thought it would be odd indeed for a congress so insistent that all damages be spent on restoration to allow a lesser measure of damages than the cost of restoration in the majority of cases.id.at.absent these other provisions making clear the congress preference for restoration cost,we acknowledged,the doi the phrase take into consideration gave it discretio
