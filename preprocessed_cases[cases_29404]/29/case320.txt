facts and procedural history 
in,john kay,jerry edmonton,michael monarch and goldie mcjohn formed a musical band called steppenwolf.in,nicholas kassbaum,who is professionally known as nick nicholas,joined steppenwolf as a bass player.that year,the band members entered into a partnership agreement whereby the members became partners and owners in steppenwolf,and agreed to share equally the band expenses and income.also in,the band members signed a recording agreement with dunhill records both as partners and as steppenwolf band members.
from late until late april,steppenwolf,with kassbaum as its bass player,toured the world in concerts and recorded steppenwolf music.kassbaum appeared prominently on steppenwolf record album covers and authored steppenwolf compositions.in,john kay,who had asserted control over steppenwolf,excluded kassbaum from the band.
in,after kassbaum and michael monarch had been excluded,and john kay had stopped performing as steppenwolf,kassbaum and goldie mcjohn began to perform as the new steppenwolf.this began a series of legal disputes over the different band members use of the name steppenwolf.
in,kassbaum filed a complaint against si and spi to obtain an order prohibiting spi from interfering with kassbaum performances as the new steppenwolf.in,kassbaum paid to john kay and spi in exchange for their agreement to grant goldie mcjohn and kassbaum the exclusive right to the use of the name steppenwolf for the purposes of live performances and recordings.
in,kassbaum entered into a second agreement whereby si and spi granted the new steppenwolf,the exclusive right to use the name steppenwolf until in connection with recording,production,manufacture,sale and distribution of records and tapes containing performances of a musical group.kassbaum performed as steppenwolf from through.
on may,kassbaum,the new steppenwolf,si and spi entered into a third contract the contract which states,in relevant part 
acknowledgement sic and waiver.
kassbaum,the new steppenwolf,and geoffrey emory hereby acknowledge and agree that si and spi own all right,title and interest in the name steppenwolf.kassbaum,the new steppenwolf,and geoffrey emory hereby acknowledge and agree that si and spi have the sole and exclusive right to use the name steppenwolf in connection with the production,manufacture and distribution of phonograph records,in live,performances of a musical group,and all other uses of the name steppenwolf in the entertainment industry.kassbaum,the new steppenwolf,and geoffrey emory now and forever,waive,relinquish and release any and all of their individual or collective rights in the name steppenwolf or any other word or phrase incorporating the name steppenwolf for any purpose whatsoever.kassbaum,the new steppenwolf,and geoffrey emory hereby agree to waive,relinquish and release any trademark,trade name,service mark,or service name rights any or all of them may have in the name steppenwolf.kassbaum,the new steppenwolf,and geoffrey emory further agree to transfer or assign all such trademark,trade name,service mark or service name rights they may have in the name steppenwolf to si and spi.notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing,nothing contained herein shall be deemed an acknowledgment on the part of si and spi that kassbaum,the new steppenwolf,geoffrey emory,ever acquired or held any such trademark,trade name,service mark or service name right in the name steppenwolf.
the contract also provided that,in exchange for this acknowledgment and waiver,si and spi agree to pay kassbaum,the new steppenwolf,and geoffrey emory the sum of three thousand dollars.
from,when the contract was executed,until,kassbaum performed as lone wolf.during that time,without objection from the parties to the contract,kassbaum referred to his historical association with steppenwolf,describing himself as a former member of or previous member of steppenwolf.
from until the present,kassbaum has performed in a group called world classic rockers.the group is comprised of former members of various musical groups well known to rock music fans including randy meiser,a former member of wings spencer davis,a former member of the spencer davis group bruce gary,a former member of knack and michael monarch and kassbaum,former members of steppenwolf.while performing as the world classic rockers,kassbaum and the other band members often identified themselves by referring to their former musical associations.for example,one advertisement identifies kassbaum as nick nicholas former member of steppenwolf.kassbaum also promoted himself as being a former original member of steppenwolf,original founding member of steppenwolf,and formerly of steppenwolf.
in response to these promotional claims,spi and si sent kassbaum cease and desist letters asserting that kassbaum historical references to steppenwolf violated federal trademark law and the contract.kassbaum then filed a complaint in federal district court seeking a declaration that he is entitled to refer to himself as formerly of steppenwolf,an original member of steppenwolf,and an original founding member of steppenwolf.spi answered and filed a counterclaim alleging trademark infringement,unfair competition and breach of contract thereafter,spi and si moved for summary judgment on kassbaum complaint for declaratory relief and spi counterclaim for breach of contract.spi and si also sought permanently to enjoin kassbaum and his agents from using the name steppenwolf.
the district court granted spi and si motion for summary judgment on kassbaum complaint for declaratory relief,granted spi counterclaim for breach of contract,dismissed kassbaum complaint for declaratory relief,and granted spi and si request for a permanent injunction forbidding kassbaum from using the designations formerly of steppenwolf,original member of steppenwolf and original founding member of steppenwolf,in promotional materials.
kassbaum appeals,contending that the district court erred.we agree,and we reverse and remand 
discussion 
judgment and dismissal of declaratory judgment complaint 
we must decide whether either the contract or the lanham act bars kassbaum from referring to himself as a former member of steppenwolf.
a.the contract 
as described above,the parties entered into the contract on may.we must decide whether,by the terms of the contract,kassbaum agreed that he would not identify himself,for promotional purposes or otherwise,with a true statement that he is a former member of the band steppenwolf.
we review decisions to grant or deny declaratory relief de novo.tashima admin.office of the courts,cir.contract interpretation is a question of law we review de novo.mendler winterland,cir.we also review grants of summary judgment de novo.robi reed,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the contract terms are clear and unambiguous,even if the parties disagree as to their meaning.united states king features entm t,cir.
under california law we interpret the contract by examining the contract language,the parties clear intentions as expressed in the contract and the circumstances under which the parties contracted.aiu ins.superior court,cal d,under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.internal citation omitted cal.a contract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made,and the matter to which it relates.
as kassbaum concedes,there is no doubt that the contract absolutely precludes kassbaum from performing,sponsoring,or endorsing a band entitled steppenwolf.the question is whether the contracting parties intended that broad language such as waive,relinquish and release any and all rights in the name steppenwolf or any other word or phrase incorporating the name steppenwolf for any purpose whatsoever would bar kassbaum from such things as truthfully answering a question about his past for example on a talk show,distributing a resume,or truthfully describing his past musical affiliations in promotional materials connected with the world classic rockers.
taken out of context,the language name steppenwolf and for any purposes whatsoever,might be read so broadly as to preclude kassbaum from writing steppenwolf on the sidewalk in chalk.while spi and si do not advocate a restriction that broad,they do appear to contend that the contract language prohibits virtually any reference by kassbaum to the name steppenwolf in the context of the entertainment industry.thus,spi and si contend that kassbaum contracted away his ability to refer to his past association with steppenwolf in a resume sent to a recording company,or in a music industry interview touching upon his background,or,at the center of this case,in his promotional references relating to his performance with world classic rockers.
we must read the words of the contract in context.cal.the whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other.id.particular clauses of a contract are subordinate to its general intent.we may not read the contract in a manner that leads to an absurd result.id.courts must look at contract language to discern parties intent so long as the result does not involve an absurdity id.rather,when we encounter broad language such as for any purposes whatsoever,we must extend the meaning of such language to cover only those things which it appears the parties intended to contract.id.however broad may be the terms of a contract,it extends only to those things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to contract.when broad language is at issue,we must look to the circumstances under which the parties contracted to determine their intentions at the time of contracting.id.
here,those circumstances are a continuing dispute between the parties about ownership and control over the trade name steppenwolf.over the years,such ownership and control was transferred from party to party through a series of contracts.first,all of the original band members owned the trade name steppenwolf.then,in,after kassbaum was asked to leave steppenwolf and began to perform as the new steppenwolf,the parties resolved a dispute over the right to the trade name steppenwolf by having kassbaum pay to spi in exchange for the exclusive right to perform as steppenwolf for the purpose of live performances and recordings.the parties entered into a second agreement in,whereby si and spi granted kassbaum and the new steppenwolf,the exclusive right to use the name steppenwolf in connection with recording,production,manufacture,sale and distribution of records and tapes embodying performance of a musical group until.at the time the parties entered into the contract,kassbaum owned the trade name steppenwolf to the extent specified by the contract,and had been performing as the new steppenwolf.the contract effected the transfer of the trade name steppenwolf from kassbaum and the new steppenwolf to spi and si.thereafter,kassbaum discontinued his performances as the new steppenwolf,and began to perform as lone wolf and later as a part of the world classic rockers.
under these circumstances,it is clear that the contract broad language for any purposes whatsoever,and all other uses of the name steppenwolf in the entertainment industry refers to use of the trade name steppenwolf,and not to the simple use of the name to provide accurate historical information that would not lead reasonable people to think kassbaum new band was steppenwolf.the terms of the contract do not bar kassbaum from referring to his former membership in steppenwolf in the entertainment industry or otherwise.we therefore hold that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to spi and si on the contract counterclaim and by dismissing kassbaum complaint for declaratory relief on contract grounds.
b.the lanham act 
kassbaum complaint requests,inter alia,a declaratory judgment that section a of the lanham act,a,does not bar him from stating,particularly in promotional materials,that he was formerly of steppenwolf,an original member of steppenwolf,or an original founding member of steppenwolf.the district court dismissed kassbaum complaint and granted spi and si motion for summary judgment.we reverse.
the lanham act provides,in pertinent part

the purpose of a trademark is to allow customers to identify the manufacturer or sponsor of a good or the provider of a service.new kids on the block news.am,cir.actual consumer confusion is not required for profit recovery it is sufficient to show a likelihood of confusion combined with willful infringement.gracie gracie,cir.for the reasons that follow,we believe that kassbaum references to himself in promotional materials as formerly of steppenwolf,an original member of steppenwolf,and an original founding member of steppenwolf,do not cause a likelihood of confusion 
first,we believe the phrases formerly of,original member of and original founding member of,immediately preceding the name steppenwolf in the promotional materials for world classic rockers greatly reduce the likelihood of confusion about the source of the band music.
additionally,the context of the historical references to kassbaum affiliation with steppenwolf in world classic rockers promotional materials further reduces any likelihood of confusion between these two bands.in all promotional materials presented to the district court,references to world classic rockers are more prominent than are references to steppenwolf.the materials display the title world classic rockers on the top or at the center of the page,while references to the band members former groups,including steppenwolf,are displayed on the bottom or around the edges of the page.also,the title world classic rockers appears in large and bold lettering,while smaller and plainer lettering is used for the titles of the former groups,including steppenwolf.finally,while the materials mention multiple former groups,the materials promote only world classic rockers,not steppenwolf,or any other former band 
our holding is supported by cases in similar contexts.for example,in kingsmen international,the district court distinguished the likelihood of confusion that exists when a former member of a band a song under the name of the original band from the likelihood of confusion that exists when the former member a song under his own name with the designation formerly of the original ban
