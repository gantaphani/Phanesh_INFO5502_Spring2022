plaintiff was a comedy writers assistant who worked on the production of a popular television show called friends.the show revolved around a group of young,sexually active adults,featured sexual humor,and typically relied on sexual and anatomical language,innuendo,wordplay,and physical gestures to convey its humor.before plaintiff was hired,she had been forewarned that the show dealt with sexual matters and that,as an assistant to the comedy writers,she would be listening to their sexual jokes and discussions about sex and transcribing the jokes and dialogue most likely to be used for scripts.after four months of employment,plaintiff was fired because of problems with her typing and transcription.she then filed this action against three of the male comedy writers and others,asserting among other things that the writers use of sexually coarse and vulgar language and conduct,including the recounting of their own sexual experiences,constituted harassment based on sex within the meaning of the fair employment and housing act the feha,et all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.
the court of appeal reversed the trial court order granting summary judgment on plaintiff sexual harassment action.we granted review to address whether the use of sexually coarse and vulgar language in the workplace can constitute harassment based on sex within the meaning of the feha,and if so,whether the imposition of liability under the feha for such speech would infringe on defendants federal and state constitutional rights of free speech.
here,the record discloses that most of the sexually coarse and vulgar language at issue did not involve and was not aimed at plaintiff or other women in the workplace.based on the totality of the undisputed circumstances,particularly the fact the friends production was a creative workplace focused on generating scripts for an comedy show featuring sexual themes,we find no reasonable trier of fact could conclude such language constituted harassment directed at plaintiff because of her sex within the meaning of the feha.furthermore,to the extent triable issues of fact exist as to whether certain offensive comments were made about women other than plaintiff because of their sex,we find no reasonable trier of fact could conclude these particular comments were severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to create a work environment that was hostile or abusive to plaintiff in violation of the feha.accordingly,we remand the matter with directions to affirm the summary judgment order insofar as it pertains to plaintiff sexual harassment action,without addressing the potential of infringement on defendants constitutional rights of free speech.
factual and procedural background 
after receiving a right to sue letter from the department of fair employment and housing,plaintiff amaani lyle filed this action against organizations and individuals involved in the production and writing of the popular friends television show,including warner.television production wbtv,nbc studios nbc,bright,kauffman,crane productions bkc,and adam chase,gregory malins,and andrew reich.her first amended complaint alleged causes of action under the feha for race and gender discrimination,racial and sexual harassment,and retaliation for opposing race discrimination against in the casting of friends episodes.the complaint also alleged common law causes of action for wrongful termination in violation of the public policies against race and gender discrimination and retaliation for complaining about race discrimination in violation of the feha.
after engaging in discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment and summary adjudication.the trial court granted the motion,ruling nbc and bkc were not plaintiff employers and therefore were not liable on any feha cause of action plaintiff feha harassment claims were plaintiff could not,in any event,factually establish her feha claims of race and gender discrimination,retaliation,or harassment as to any defendant and plaintiff could not establish her common law causes of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.the court entered judgment for all defendants and awarded them in costs.in a postjudgment order,the court awarded defendants in attorney fees on grounds that plaintiff feha causes of action were frivolous,unreasonable and without foundation.
the court of appeal affirmed the judgment in part and reversed it in part.among other things,the court found defendants entitled to summary adjudication on plaintiff feha and common law causes of action for termination based on race,gender,and retaliation,but concluded triable issues of fact existed as to her feha causes of action for sexual and racial harassment against defendants wbtv,bkc,chase,malins,and reich.accordingly,the court reversed the attorney fees award and vacated the award of costs for recalculation by the trial court to reflect the partial reversal of the judgment.
both sides petitioned for review.we denied plaintiff petition,but granted defendants petition and ordered briefing and argument limited to the following issues can the use of sexually coarse and vulgar language in the workplace constitute harassment based on sex within the meaning of the feha and does the imposition of liability under the feha for sexual harassment based on such speech infringe on defendants rights of free speech under the first amendment to the federal constitution or the state constitution 
discussion 
sexually coarse and vulgar language 
there is no dispute that sexually coarse and vulgar language was used regularly in the friends writers room.but the use of sexually coarse and vulgar language in the workplace is not actionable per se.rather,we must look to the specific facts and circumstances presented to determine whether the language at issue constituted harassment based on sex within the meaning of feha and whether such language was severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to create a work environment that was hostile or abusive to plaintiff because of her sex.
the facts presented in the summary judgment proceeding 
our first task is to determine whether the facts presented in the summary judgment proceeding were sufficient to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment under the appropriate legal standards.we begin by reviewing the rules governing the summary judgment procedure 
a trial court properly grants a motion for summary judgment only if no issues of triable fact appear and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c see also,subd.f summary adjudication of issues.the moving party bears the burden of showing the court that the plaintiff has not established,and can not reasonably expect to establish,a prima facie case citation.miller department of corrections cal th,d,miller.o nce a moving defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue to meet that burden,the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action citations.merrill navegar,cal th,d.
on appeal from the granting of a motion for summary judgment,we examine the record de novo,liberally construing the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolving doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.citation.miller,supra,cal th at,d.
defendants summary judgment motion relied on declarations from defendants chase,malins,reich,and others,and other facts developed during discovery.these declarations and the deposition testimony of the parties and others disclosed that chase,malins,and reich worked for defendant wbtv and were writers on the sixth production season of friends.in june,malins and chase,who also served as executive producers on the production,interviewed plaintiff,an woman,for the position of writers assistant for the friends production.during the interview,they told plaintiff the show dealt with sexual matters and,as a result,the writers told sexual jokes and engaged in discussions about sex.plaintiff responded that sexual discussions and jokes did not make her uncomfortable,and she subsequently was hired as a writers assistant.
in her deposition,plaintiff testified she had no recollection of any employee on the friends production ever saying anything sexually offensive about her directly to her.no one on the production ever asked her out on a date or sexually propositioned her.likewise,no one ever demanded sexual favors of her or physically threatened her.
plaintiff testified,however,that a number of offensive discussions and actions occurred in the writers meetings she was required to attend.the writers regularly discussed their preferences in women and sex in general.chase spoke of his preferences for blonde women,a certain bra cup size,get ting right to sex and not mess ing around with too much foreplay.malins had a love of young girls and cheerleaders.some of the discussions occurred outside the writers room,that is,in the breakroom and in the hallways.
also during the writers meetings,malins constantly spoke of his oral sex experiences and told the group that when he and his wife fought,he would get naked and then they would never finish the argument.malins had a coloring book depicting female cheerleaders with their legs spread open he would draw breasts and vaginas on the cheerleaders during the writers meetings.the book was left on his desk or sometimes on writers assistants desks.malins frequently used a pencil to alter portions of the name friends on scripts so it would read penis.malins also spoke of his fantasy about an episode of the show in which the friends character joey enters the bathroom while the character rachel is showering and has his way with her.and,during each of the four months plaintiff worked on the friends production,some writers made masturbatory gestures.
in addition,plaintiff heard the writers talk about what they would like to do sexually to different female cast members on friends.malins remarked to chase that chase could have fucked one of the actresses on the show a couple of years before,and the two constantly bantered about the topic and how chase had missed his chance to do so.chase,malins,and reich spoke demeaningly about another actress on the show,making jokes about whether she was competent in sexually servicing her boyfriend.they also referred to her infertility once and joked she had dried twigs or dried branches in her vagina.
in their depositions,chase,malins,and reich gave testimony that corroborated portions of plaintiff allegations.chase acknowledged he had discussed,while in the writers room,his personal sexual experiences.chase also confirmed that he and other writers discussed anal sex,and that he had gestured on occasion as if he were masturbating,but could not recall having done so when plaintiff was present.malins and reich admitted blowjob stories were told in the writers room.reich said he had pantomimed masturbation in the writers room,sometimes as a way of indicating something was a waste of time.in the writers room and sometimes elsewhere,reich and other writers discussed oral sex and anal sex,and writers discussed their personal sexual conduct.reich also acknowledged he and others altered inspirational sayings on a calendar,changing,for example,the word persistence to pert tits and happiness to penis.
these writers and others also testified that,both before and after plaintiff was hired,sexually coarse and vulgar language was used in the writers room in group sessions with both male and female participants present,and both male and female writers discussed their own sexual experiences to generate material for the show.episodes of the show often featured sexual and anatomical language,innuendo,wordplay,and physical gestures to convey humor concerning sex,including oral sex,anal sex,heterosexual sex,gay sex,talking dirty during sex,premature ejaculation,pornography,pedophiles,and threesomes.
in opposing defendants summary judgment motion,plaintiff likewise relied on the parties deposition testimony.she also submitted two of her own declarations,in which she reiterated and more particularly described the graphic nature of the writers alleged comments and conduct her declarations also referred to incidents she did not mention in her deposition.most significantly,she claimed for the first time that chase,malins,and reich referred to women using epithets 
in this court,defendants argue the facts shown in the summary judgment proceeding do not establish actionable harassment under the feha because use of sexual speech,standing alone,does not violate the feha prohibition against harassment because of sex and the conduct did not amount to severe or pervasive conduct that altered the terms or conditions of plaintiff employment.
the feha and its prohibitions 
we now turn to a review of the feha and its prohibitions.
with certain exceptions not implicated here,the feha makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer,because of the sex of any person,to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,subd.a.likewise,it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer,because of sex,to harass an employee,subd.j.under the statutory scheme,harassment because of sex includes sexual harassment and gender harassment,subd.j c.these prohibitions represent a fundamental public policy decision regarding the need to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek and hold employment free from discrimination.brown superior court cal d,see also mogilefsky superior court th,d.
as we recently explained,the prohibition against sexual harassment includes protection from a broad range of conduct,ranging from expressly or impliedly conditioning employment benefits on submission to or tolerance of unwelcome sexual advances,to the creation of a work environment that is hostile or abusive on the basis of sex.miller,supra,cal th at,d.here,plaintiff does not contend defendants subjected her to unwelcome sexual advances as a condition of employment rather,she alleges defendants created a hostile or abusive work environment.for this type of claim,plaintiff need not show evidence of unwanted sexual advances.id.at,d.
according to regulations interpreting and implementing the feha,the prohibition against discrimination in employment because of sex is intended to guarantee that members of both sexes will enjoy equal employment benefits,tit,subd.b.for purposes of the feha,an employment benefit specifically includes provision of a workplace,subd.f,which in turn is defined as provision of a workplace free of harassment,subd.f.
like the feha,title vii of the federal civil rights act of title vii et prohibits sexual harassment,making it an unlawful employment practice for an employer,among other things,to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a.because the workplace environment is one of the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,a plaintiff may establish a violation of title vii by showing that discrimination because of sex has created a hostile or abusive work environment.see meritor savings bank vinson,d meritor.thus,while the wording of title vii and the feha differs in some particulars,both statutory schemes regard the prohibition against sexual harassment as part and parcel of the proscription against sexual discrimination,and the antidiscriminatory objectives and overriding public policy purposes of the two acts are identical.beyda city of los angeles th,d.
in light of these similarities,california courts frequently seek guidance from title vii decisions when interpreting the feha and its prohibitions against sexual harassment.miller,supra,cal th at,d.for instance,we agree with the united states supreme court that,to prevail,an employee claiming harassment based upon a hostile work environment must demonstrate that the conduct complained of was severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create a work environment that qualifies as hostile or abusive to employees because of their sex.see aguilar avis rent a car system,cal th,d,aguilar,relying upon harris forklift systems,d harris.miller,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.as the high court explained,a workplace may give rise to liability when it is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,citation,that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.harris,supra,at.
under title vii,a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim requires a plaintiff employee to show she was subjected to sexual advances,conduct,or comments that were unwelcome see meritor,supra,at.because of sex oncale sundowner offshore services,d oncale and sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive work environment id.at.meritor,supra,at.in addition,she must establish the offending conduct was imputable to her employer.meritor,supra,at.california courts have adopted the same standard for hostile work environment sexual harassment claims under the feha.see,fisher san pedro peninsula hospital d.fisher.
defendants argue the evidence shown in the summary judgment proceeding,even when liberally construed in plaintiff favor,was insufficient to establish either that the alleged offending conduct was undertaken because of plaintiff sex,or that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment.we address these two elements,and the sufficiency of the related facts,below.
harassment because of sex 
in oncale,supra,d,the united states supreme court explained that title vii does not prohibit all verbal or physical harassment in the workplace it is directed only at discriminat ion because of sex.oncale,supra,at.consequently,the high court stated,workplace harassment,even harassment between men and women,is not automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations.ibid.rather,t he critical issue is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed,quoting harris,supra,at.conc.opn.of ginsburg.this means a plaintiff in a sexual harassment suit must show the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations,but actually constituted discrimina tion because of sex.oncale,supra,at.
for feha claims,the discrimination requirement has been phrased similarly to plead a cause of action for hostile work environment sexual harassment,it is only necessary to show that gender is a substantial factor in the discrimination,and that if the plaintiff had been a man she would not have been treated in the same manner.citation.accardi superior court th,d accardi see birschtein new united motor manufacturing,th,d quoting accardi.accordingly,it is the disparate treatment of an employee on the basis of the mere discussion of sex or use of vulgar is the essence of a sexual harassment claim.
the fair employment and housing commission fehc is the agency charged with administering the feha.consistent with the feha public policy objective to safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to employment without discrimination or abridgement on account of sex,the fehc declares employment practices should treat all individuals equally,evaluating each on the basis of individual skills,knowledge and abilities and not on the basis of characteristics generally attributed to protected groups,tit.according to the fehc,t he purpose of the law against discrimination in employment because of sex is to eliminate the means by which individuals of the female sex have historically been relegated to inferior jobs and to guarantee that in the future both sexes will enjoy equal employment benefits,tit,subd.b.
in the context of sex discrimination,prohibited harassment includes verbal,physical,and visual harassment,as well as unwanted sexual advances,tit,subd.f.in this regard,verbal harassment may include epithets,derogatory comments,or slurs on the basis of sex physical harassment may include assault,impeding or blocking movement,or any physical interference with normal work or movement,when directed at an individual on the basis of sex and visual harassment may include derogatory posters,cartoons,or drawings on the basis of sex,tit,subd.b a,b c see miller,supra,cal th at,d.decisions interpreting title vii are in accord 
both feha and title vii cases recognize that evidence of hostile,sexist statements is relevant to show discrimination on the basis of sex.see accardi,supra,th at,d accord,oncale,supra,at.actionable hostile work environment may include harassment in such and derogatory terms as to make it clear that the harasser is motivated by general hostility to the presence of women in the workplace heyne caruso cir,conduct tending to demonstrate hostility towards a certain group is relevant to show discrimination against an employee who is a member of that group.however,while the use of vulgar or sexually disparaging language may be relevant to show such discrimination,it is not necessarily sufficient,by itself,to establish actionable conduct.
the fehc concluded in a precedential decision that a feha hostile work environment sexual harassment claim may be established where,among other things,a male employee constantly referred to a female employee using demeaning,terms.fair empl.hous.nulton,fehc.wl,recognizing the male employee repeated use of fucking bitch and use of cunt were severe,within the meaning of the feha,given these terms inherently degrading and demeaning nature.a number of title vii decisions have reached similar conclusions,steiner showboat operating cir,dumb fucking broads and fucking cunts burns mcgregor electronic industries,cir,such vulgar and offensive epithets are widely recognized as not only improper,but as intensely degrading andrews city of philadelphia,supra,at pervasive use of derogatory and insulting terms relating to women generally and addressed to female employees personally may serve as evidence of a hostile environment.in these cases,there was no suggestion that male coworkers had been subjected to comparable epithets and sexist insults.see steiner showboat operating,supra,at while supervisor was indeed abusive to men,his abuse of women was different,relying on sexual epithets,offensive,explicit references to women bodies and sexual conduct see also oncale,supra,at.discrimination may be shown by direct comparative evidence of alleged harasser disparate treatment of sexes in a workplace.
on the other hand,a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim is not established where a supervisor or coworker simply uses crude or inappropriate language in front of employees or draws a vulgar picture,without directing sexual innuendos or language toward a plaintiff or toward women in general,brown henderson cir,coworkers steady stream of obscene conversation and vile talk,posting of sexual pictures,and drawing of a vulgar picture,did not constitute harassment because of sex moore grove north america,male supervisor repeated use of offensive word to and in front of the plaintiff did not create a hostile work environment,where he also swore at her male counterparts and did not make sexual innuendos or use language toward the plaintiff or women in general.in this connection,it has been cautioned the term bitch is not so and derogatory that its mere use necessarily constitutes harassment because of sex.galloway general motors service parts operations cir,rejected on other grounds in national railroad passenger corporation morgan,fn,d see hocevar purdue frederick cir,opn.of beam,mere use of the word bitch,without other evidence of sex discrimination,is not particularly probative of a general misogynist attitude.
moreover,comments that have the sexual charge of an abbott and costello movie and that could easily be repeated on primetime television are not the type that trigger title vii liability.citation.jackson racine county,wl,supervisor comment that employee was a good girl who earned her discipline might be mean or unkind,but was not comparable to the type of demeaning slurs giving rise to actionable claims.
conduct sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a sexually hostile work environment 
as the united states supreme court has recognized,t he prohibition of harassment on the basis of sex requires neither asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace it forbids only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create a hostile or abusive work environment.oncale,supra,at.w hether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.harris forklift systems,supra,at.miller,supra,cal th at,d.therefore,to establish liability in a feha hostile work environment sexual harassment case,a plaintiff employee must show she was subjected to sexual advances,conduct,or comments that were severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create a hostile or abusive work environment.miller,supra,cal th at,d,fisher,supra,d at.accord,oncale,supra,at.meritor,supra,at.although annoying or merely offensive comments in the workplace are not actionable,conduct that is severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment is unlawful,even if it does not cause psychological injury to the plaintiff.harris,supra,at.
in determining the severity of harassment,t he united states supreme court has warned that the evidence in a hostile environment sexual harassment case should not be viewed too narrowly t he objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,considering all the circumstances.citation.t hat inquiry requires careful consideration of the social context in which particular behavior occurs and is experienced by its target the real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances,expectations,and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.common sense,and an appropriate sensibility to social context,will enable courts and juries to distinguish between simple teasing or roughhousing and conduct which a reasonable person in the plaintiff position would find severely hostile or abusive.oncale sundowner offshore services,d see also beyda city of los angeles th,d.miller,supra,cal th at,d.
with respect to the pervasiveness of harassment,courts have held an employee generally can not recover for harassment that is occasional,isolated,sporadic,or trivial rather,the employee must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated,routine,or a generalized nature.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,relying on fisher,supra,d at.accord,smith northwest financial acceptance,cir,isolated incidents of harassment,while inappropriate and boorish,do not constitute pervasive conduct.that is,when the harassing conduct is not severe in the extreme,more than a few isolated incidents must have occurred to prove a claim based on working conditions.see herberg california institute of the arts th,d liability for sexual harassment may not be imposed based on a single incident that does not involve egregious conduct akin to a physical assault or the threat thereof walker ford motor cir,involving racial harassment consisting of racial slurs and racially offensive comments minority police officers ass of south bend city of south bend,same.moreover,when a plaintiff can not point to a loss of tangible job benefits,she must make a commensurately higher showing that the sexually harassing conduct was pervasive and destructive of the working environment.fisher,supra,d at,quoting jones flagship intern.cir.
to be actionable,a sexually objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive,one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive,and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so.faragher boca raton,d see harris,supra,at.beyda city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.that means a plaintiff who subjectively perceives the workplace as hostile or abusive will not prevail under the feha,if a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,considering all the circumstances,would not share the same perception.likewise,a plaintiff who does not perceive the workplace as hostile or abusive will not prevail,even if it objectively is so.
one issue of particular relevance to this case concerns the parties disagreement over whether or not plaintiff was a victim of the defendant writers harassing conduct.as set forth below,a plaintiff may be a victim of sexually harassing conduct,even though it is not directed at her and instead is aimed at other women in the workplace,but the absence of direct harassment affects the showing she is required to make.
to state that an employee must be the direct victim of the sexually harassing conduct is somewhat misleading as an employee who is subjected to a hostile work environment is a victim of sexual harassment even though no offensive remarks or touchings are directed to or perpetrated upon that employee.fisher,supra,d at,fn.generally,however,sexual conduct that involves or is aimed at persons other than the plaintiff is considered less offensive and severe than conduct that is directed at the plaintiff.see gleason mesirow financial cir,the impact of harassment is obviously not as great as the impact of harassment directed at the plaintiff black zaring homes,cir,fact that most comments were not directed at the plaintiff weakened her harassment claim jackson racine county wl,comments made to the plaintiffs about the appearance of other female employees bear less weight than the comments directed toward the plaintiffs themselves.a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim by a plaintiff who was not personally subjected to offensive remarks and touchings requires an even higher showing than a claim by one who had been sexually harassed without suffering tangible job detriment such a plaintiff must establish that the sexually harassing conduct permeated her direct work environment.fisher,supra,d at.
to meet this burden,the plaintiff generally must show that the harassment directed at others was in her immediate work environment,and that she personally witnessed it.fisher,supra,d at.the reason for this is obvious if the plaintiff does not witness the incidents involving others,those incidents can not affect her perception of the hostility of the work environment.beyda city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.
in fisher,supra,d,a case decided in the context of a demurrer,a plaintiff surgical nurse alleged a defendant physician had created a hostile work environment for her by his sexual harassment of other women employees in her presence.although her allegations described in general terms what acts occurred and their location the court of appeal found them insufficient to establish a cause of action for environmental sexual harassment because they were most conclusionary regarding what conduct the plaintiff actually observed.fisher,at.as a matter of fairness given the ease with which these claims can be made despite their serious nature,the court concluded,a plaintiff should be required to plead sufficient facts to establish a nexus between the alleged sexual harassment of others,her observation of that conduct and the work context in which it occurred.ibid.in explaining why it found the complaint deficient,the court observed the allegations gave no indication of the frequency,intensity,or timeliness with which the alleged acts occurred,did each alleged act occur once in four years or on a daily or weekly basis what alleged incidents occurred within the feha statute of limitations,and pled only a legal conclusion regarding the alleged lewd remarks.fisher,at.in sum,the court concluded,the plaintiff did not sufficiently plead she was subjected to a pattern of pervasive sexual harassment.id.at.in so holding,the court nonetheless deemed it prudent to allow the plaintiff to amend her complaint because the law it announced concerned a matter of first impression.id.at.
sufficiency of plaintiff factual showing 
we now apply the governing legal principles to the record before us.
as indicated,a defendant moving for summary judgment meets its burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit by establishing that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established.code civ,subds.a,o.
here,defendants met that burden in their moving papers.first,they pointed to plaintiff concessions that none of the three male writers offensive conduct involved or was aimed at her.second,considering the totality of the circumstances,especially the nature of the writers work,the facts largely forming the basis of plaintiff sexual harassment action the writers sexual antics,including their pantomiming of masturbation,their drawing in the cheerleader coloring book,their altering words on scripts and calendars to spell out male and female body parts,their graphic discussions about their personal sexual experiences,sexual preferences,and preferences in women,and their bragging about their personal sexual exploits with girlfriends and not present a triable issue whether the writers engaged in harassment because of sex,subd.j.
there is no dispute friends was a situation comedy that featured young sexually active adults and sexual humor geared primarily toward adults.aired episodes of the show often used sexual and anatomical language,innuendo,wordplay,and physical gestures to create humor concerning sex,including oral sex,anal sex,heterosexual sex,gay sex,talking dirty during sex,premature ejaculation,pornography,pedophiles,and threesomes.the circumstance that this was a creative workplace focused on generating scripts for an comedy show featuring sexual themes is significant in assessing the existence of triable issues of facts regarding whether the writers sexual antics and coarse sexual talk were aimed at plaintiff or at women in general,whether plaintiff and other women were singled out to see and hear what happened,and whether the conduct was otherwise motivated by plaintiff gender.
here,the record shows that the instances of sexual antics and sexual discussions identified above did not involve and were not aimed at plaintiff or any other female employee.it further confirms that such nondirected conduct was undertaken in group sessions with both male and female participants present,and that women writers on the friends production also discussed their own sexual experiences to generate material for the show.that the writers commonly engaged in discussions of personal sexual experiences and preferences and used physical gesturing while brainstorming and generating script ideas for this particular show was neither surprising nor unreasonable from a creative standpoint.indeed,plaintiff testified that,when told during her interview for the friends position that the humor could get a little lowbrow in the writers room,she responded she would have no problem because previously she had worked around writers and knew what to expect.although plaintiff contends the writers sorely understated the actual climate of the writers room in her interview,these types of sexual discussions and jokes especially those relating to the writers personal experiences did in fact provide material for actual scripts the fact that certain discussions did not lead to specific jokes or dialogue airing on the show merely reflected the creative process at work and did not serve to convert such nondirected conduct into harassment because of sex 
moreover,although plaintiff contended in her deposition that much of the three writers vulgar discussions and conduct wasted her time,there was no indication the conduct affected the work hours or duties of plaintiff and her male counterparts in a disparate manner.accordingly,while the conduct certainly was tinged with sexual content and sexual connotations,a reasonable trier of fact could not find,based on the facts presented here,that members of one sex were exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex were not exposed oncale,supra,at,or that if plaintiff had been a man she would not have been treated in the same manner accardi,supra,th at,d.
the circumstances surrounding the nondirected sexual antics and sexual talk are plainly distinguishable from the circumstances concerning somewhat similar conduct found actionable in ocheltree scollon productions,cir.in ocheltree,a case involving employees working at a costume production shop,the record showed that the plaintiff male coworkers engaged in a daily stream of sexually explicit discussions and conduct they spoke in crude terms of their sexual exploits with their wives and girlfriends they used a mannequin to demonstrate sexual techniques one sang a vulgar song to the plaintiff and another showed the plaintiff a magazine with graphic photographs of men with pierced genitalia to get her reaction.id.at.in that case,the appellate court affirmed an award of compensatory damages to the plaintiff because a reasonable jury could find that much of the and sexist talk and conduct in the production shop was aimed at the plaintiff because of,that the men behaved as they did to make her uncomfortable and as the only woman in the workplace.id.at see id.at.
unlike the situation presented in ocheltree,the record here reflects a workplace where comedy writers were paid to create scripts highlighting sexual humor and jokes,and where members of both sexes contributed and were exposed to the creative process spawning such humor and jokes.in this context,the defendant writers nondirected sexual antics and sexual talk did not contribute to an environment in which women and men were treated disparately.moreover,there was nothing to suggest the defendants engaged in this particular behavior to make plaintiff uncomfortable or,or to intimidate,ridicule,or insult her,as was the case in ocheltree.
during the discovery process,plaintiff testified her feha claim additionally was predicated on what the writers said they would like to do sexually to the different female cast members on friends,and jokes that defendant chase had missed a sexual opportunity with one of the actresses.the writers also made demeaning comments about another of the actresses,asking whether she was competent in sexually servicing her boyfriend and remarking she probably had dried twigs or dried branches in her vagina.
unlike the writers nondirected conduct,these particular comments support at least an inference that certain women working on the production of friends were targeted for personal insult and derogation because of their sex,while the men working there were not.the question remains,however,whether the comments were sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a sexually hostile work environment.
the evidence in the summary judgment proceeding showed that plaintiff named the two actresses as the only women on the production about whom the writers specifically made these offensive comments.as far as the two actresses were concerned,the conduct was not severe or pervasive no sexual assault,threat of assault,sexual propositioning,or unwelcome physical contact occurred nor did the conduct amount to verbal abuse or harassment,inasmuch as the actresses were not even present to hear the writers offensive remarks and,apparently,had no awareness of what had been said.
because the derogatory comments did not involve plaintiff,she was obligated to set forth specific facts from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the conduct permeated her direct workplace environment and was pervasive and destructive.fisher,supra,d at.in this connection,plaintiff points to her deposition testimony that she was too appalled,mortified,and offended by these comments and the other conduct complained of to speak,and to her later declaration that the conduct caused her severe distress.other parts of her testimony,however,revealed she viewed the writers and their conduct as puerile and annoying,rather than extreme or destructive she testified the writers room was like being in a junior high locker room and described the writers as teenagers and silly little boys who engaged in very juvenile,counterproductive behavior when they spen t their time doing drawings in the cheerleader coloring book and discussing lewd things.but even where seemingly contradictory testimony like this is offered regarding a plaintiff subjective perceptions,courts will not hesitate to find in favor of a defendant where the record does not establish an objectively hostile work environment,black zaring homes,supra,at reversing a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff where fact that most of the offensive comments at issue were not directed at her contributed to court conclusion that the conduct was not sufficiently severe.
plaintiff acknowledged the writers made references to the one actress fertility and the dried branches in her vagina on only one occasion.plaintiff did not,however,offer specific facts regarding how often or on how many occasions the writers engaged in the graphic sexual jokes and talk about the other actress.although plaintiff testified that,in the four months she worked on friends,malins and chase constantly bantered about chase missed sexual opportunity with that actress,her declarations indicated that some of more graphic comments were made only once or at least twice.see ante,fn.without more,a reasonable trier of fact could not conclude that these reported comments concerning the two actresses permeated plaintiff direct work environment,or that they were pervasive and destructive of that environment,so as to allow recovery despite the fact plaintiff was not personally subjected to offensive remarks or touchings and did not suffer a tangible job detriment.fisher,supra,d at.
in opposing defendants summary judgment motion,plaintiff offered additional evidence of offensive language.specifically,she submitted two declarations in which she claimed to have heard defendants chase,malins,and reich refer to women who displeased them or made them mad as cunts and bitches.see steiner showboat operating,supra,at burns mcgregor electronic industries,supra,at andrews city of philadelphia,supra,at.but plaintiff made no claim the writers ever referred to her by those terms,either to her face or to others,and she gave no indication whether the writers used epithets with reference to men in comparable situations 
even when we consider this belated presentation of epithets in the workplace,we find it insufficient to warrant reversal of the summary judgment order.plaintiff made only three brief references to the topic in her declarations and those references failed to set forth specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the objective severity or pervasiveness of the incidents.code civ,subd.p.although plaintiff was reasonably specific in describing the one telephone reference to marta kauffman,she otherwise was not,merely indicating the writers used the epithets when they were displeased or mad.the missing context is especially significant here,because one of the reported epithets bitch was not a term that was necessarily misogynistic see hocevar purdue frederick,supra,at opn.of beam,or even unsuitable for broadcast television see jackson racine county,supra,wl.indeed,in one friends episode,the character chandler addressed the character monica by that term.additionally,plaintiff asserted the three writers used epithets regularly when they were displeased or mad,but she did not specify the number of times or the frequency with which this happened.her vagueness about this point and the circumstances surrounding the incidents did not aid in showing that use of epithets contributed to an objectively abusive or hostile work environment.
plaintiff showing regarding her subjective perceptions of the epithet incidents also appeared deficient.specifically,she acknowledged the writers refrained from using the word cunt around one woman,kauffman,who expressly disapproved its use.although kauffman was an executive producer who wielded authority plaintiff did not have,plaintiff offered no facts showing that plaintiff or others ever complained about the epithets,or that she felt she could not complain even to kauffman,or that any complaint she made was ignored.walker ford motor,supra,at,fn.fact that many of the racial epithets were not directed at the plaintiff was not determinative where such offensive language often was used in the plaintiff presence after he had voiced objections.moreover,plaintiff made no mention of the epithets in her deposition when asked at that time to identify all instances of the writers conduct she claimed was harassing or offensive.her declarations provided no explanation whatsoever for their belated disclosure in the summary judgment proceeding.
considering the totality of the circumstances,whether we view the epithet evidence by itself,or in conjunction with the evidence of the comments,we are unable to conclude a reasonable trier of fact could,on the meager facts shown,find the conduct of the three male writers was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment.see kortan california youth authority cir,plaintiff could not show her supervisor conduct was frequent,severe,or abusive enough to interfere unreasonably with her employment where he occasionally directed sexual insults at other female employees in her presence and where his offensive conduct toward her was concentrated on one occasion following a work dispute.
in urging affirmance of the court of appeal judgment,plaintiff contends there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether the writers offensive conduct was part of the creative process leading to scripts and a necessary part of their work,or whether it was undertaken purely for their own personal sexual gratification.in support of this point,she cites the evidence that defendants engaged in vulgar behavior outside of the writers room,for example,in the hallways or near her desk.additionally,some of the derogatory comments concerning the actresses occurred in the writers room in this regard,the court of appeal concluded to the extent defendants can establish the recounting of sexual exploits,real and imagined,the making of lewd gestures and the displaying of crude pictures denigrating women was within the scope of necessary job performance and not engaged in for purely personal gratification or out of meanness or bigotry or other personal motives,defendants may be able to show their conduct should not be viewed as harassment.
we agree with this passage insofar as it suggests the circumstances pertaining to an employer type of work and to the job duties and responsibilities of a plaintiff and her alleged harassers are properly considered in determining whether the harassers said or did things because of the plaintiff sex and whether the subject conduct altered the terms or conditions of employment.but summary judgment was proper here because,as demonstrated above,none of the offensive conduct complained of meets both the because of sex and severe or pervasive requirements for establishing a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim.see oncale,supra,at.in emphasizing the importance of social context in which particular behavior occurs and is experienced,the high court remarked in dictum that a professional football player working environment is not severely or pervasively abusive if the coach engages in the unnecessary act of smack ing him on the buttocks as he heads onto the field.that is,while the record conceivably reflects a triable issue of fact as to whether some of defendants offensive comments were directed at women because of their sex and hence unnecessary to the work,the reported epithets and the comments involving the actresses,the facts plaintiff offered simply are insufficient to establish that any such conduct was severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to be actionable.moreover,assuming arguendo the incidents taking place in the hallways somehow could be deemed unnecessary to the work generated inside the writers room,there is no indication these other incidents involved or were aimed at plaintiff or any other female employee,or that they appeared materially different from the type of sexual joking and discussions occurring in the writers room that actually led to material for scripts.
in reaching a contrary conclusion,the court of appeal relied on a number of authorities for the proposition that evidence of misogynistic,demeaning,offensive,obscene,sexually explicit,and degrading words and conduct in the workplace is relevant to prove environmental sexual harassment,kotcher rosa and sullivan appliance center,cir lipsett university of puerto rico,supra,robinson jacksonville shipyards.see also ways city of lincoln cir.we have no quarrel with that proposition,but those authorities do not support reversal of the summary judgment granted in this case.to the extent the courts in those cases found evidence sufficient to sustain a claim of a hostile work environment sexual harassment,such evidence included incidents that were directed at the plaintiff and circumstances that were discernibly more severe or pervasive than those at issue here.
kotcher rosa and sullivan appliance center,supra,for example,involved evidence that a male supervisor commented on one plaintiff bodily equipment,and made numerous comments about the breasts of another plaintiff and left bruises on her arm on one occasion when he grabbed her.he often also pretended to masturbate and ejaculate at the two plaintiffs behind their backs to express his anger with them,often in front of others at the workplace.id.at.
lipsett university of puerto rico,supra,found the plaintiff established a prima facie case of hostile work environment by presenting,inter alia,evidence of a barrage of commentary by male residents that women in general,and that the plaintiff in particular,should not be surgeons repeated and unwelcome sexual advances made to the plaintiff by two doctors the plastering of degrading playboy centerfolds,a sexually explicit drawing of the plaintiff body,and a list of sexually charged nicknames of female the walls of the male residents rest facility and the sexually demeaning nickname given to the plaintiff.id.at relying on title vii law in action alleging violations of,inter alia,title ix of the education amendments of.
in robinson jacksonville shipyards,supra,the plaintiff,a shipyard worker,presented evidence that she suffered nonsexual harassing behavior,including verbal abuse and shunning,because she was a female incidents of directed sexual behavior both before and after she lodged complaints about the posting of numerous sexually oriented and pornographic pictures of nude and partially nude women in various work areas and visual assault from the posting of the pictures themselves,which were disproportionately offensive or demeaning to women and sexualized the work environment to the detriment of all female employees.id.at.
finally,ways city of lincoln,supra,affirmed a finding of a racially hostile work environment where a plaintiff police officer offered a nonexhaustive list of examples of specific racially offensive slurs,jokes,comments,and cartoons directed either to him or to blacks and american indians in general in his years at a police department.id.at.
a case plaintiff relies on,white new hampshire of corrections cir,is of the same ilk.white expressly observed that t he plaintiff pointed to numerous comments made by other employees either to or about her which were sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment,including sexual remarks and innuendos accusing her of having a sexual affair with an inmate,as well as daily sexual conversations and jokes that involved and were directed to her.white,at,italics added.
nor does fisher,supra,d,support reversal of the summary judgment.as indicated,the court of appeal in that case held the plaintiff allegations insufficient to state a feha cause of action for environmental sexual harassment,but allowed the plaintiff to amend her complaint because the requirements it announced concerned a matter of first impression.fisher,at.plaintiff lack of specificity in the summary judgment proceeding here does not warrant similar leniency.the standards governing the because of sex and severe or pervasive requirements for this type of action were not uncertain at the time of defendants motion.miller,supra,cal th at,d,and cases cited.likewise,there was no confusion regarding the plaintiff burden in opposing a summary judgment motion to set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to her cause of action.code civ,subd.p.
constitutional rights of free speech 
in affirming the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants,we have concluded plaintiff factual showing of the writers sexually coarse and vulgar language does not establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment sexual harassment.in light of that conclusion,we have no occasion to determine whether liability for such language might infringe on defendants rights of free speech under the first amendment to the federal constitution or the state constitution.accord,deangelis el paso mun.police officers ass cir.
conclusion and disposition 
when we apply the legal principles governing sexual harassment claims,and give plaintiff the benefit of the rules governing review of summary judgment orders,we conclude defendants have shown that plaintiff has not established,and can not reasonably expect to establish,a prima facie case of hostile workplace environment sexual harassment.
in reaching this conclusion,we do not suggest the use of sexually coarse and vulgar language in the workplace can never constitute harassment because of sex indeed,language similar to that at issue here might well establish actionable harassment depending on the circumstances.nor do we imply that employees generally should be free,without employer restriction,to engage in sexually coarse and vulgar language or conduct at the workplace.we simply recognize that,like title vii,the feha is not a civility code and is not designed to rid the workplace of vulgarity.sheffield los angeles county of social services th,d accord,oncale,supra,at.while the feha prohibits harassing conduct that creates a work environment that is hostile or abusive on the basis of sex,it does not outlaw sexually coarse and vulgar language or conduct that merely offends.
we remand the matter to the court of appeal with directions to affirm the summary judgment insofar as it pertains to plaintiff sexual harassment cause of action and for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.in this regard,we observe the court of appeal concluded defendants challenges to plaintiff racial harassment cause of action were lacking in merit at least partly for the reasons it concluded their sexual harassment contentions were lacking in merit.we direct the court of appeal to reconsider and decide all issues in a manner consistent with the instant opinion,including those related to the racial harassment cause of action and those respecting the attorney fees award.
i agree that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants under the relevant statutes.i write separately to explain that any other result would violate free speech rights under the first amendment of the united states constitution and its california counterpart,article i,section of the california constitution hereafter collectively the first amendment.
this case has very little to do with sexual harassment and very much to do with core first amendment free speech rights.the writers of the television show,friends,were engaged in a creative adult the alleged harassing conduct occurred.the first amendment protects creativity.winter dc comics cal th,d.friends was entertainment,but entertainment is fully entitled to first amendment protection.there is no doubt that entertainment,as well as news,enjoys first amendment protection.zacchini broadcasting,d see also joseph burstyn,wilson.first amendment protects motion pictures.t he constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression apply with equal force to the publication whether it be a news report or an entertainment feature.gates discovery communications,cal th,d.scripts of the friends show are no less protected because they provide humorous rather than serious commentary.comedy iii productions,gary saderup,cal th,d.
we have found that the first amendment protects even threatening speech that does not rise to a criminal threat.in re george cal th,d,dark poetry in school.similarly,we should protect the creative speech here.i do not suggest that the first amendment protects all sexually harassing speech.just as the first amendment does not protect criminal threats in re george,supra,cal th at,d,people toledo cal th,d,so too may the state proscribe sexual harassment.but the proscription must be carefully tailored to avoid infringing on first amendment free speech rights in the creative process.
balancing the compelling need to protect employees from sexual harassment with free speech rights can,in some contexts,present very difficult questions.for example,a potential,and sometimes real,tension between free speech and antiharassment laws exists even in the ordinary workplace.see,aguilar avis rent a car system,cal th,fn,fn,d,aguilar see also id.at,d,conc.opn.of werdegar,id.at,d,dis.opn.of mosk,id.at,d,dis.opn.of kennard,id.at,d,dis.opn.of brown.debating these issues has kept academia occupied.see,volokh,freedom of speech and workplace harassment volokh generally defending free speech against harassment laws unless the hostile speech is directed towards the plaintiff sangree,title vii prohibitions against hostile environment sexual harassment and the first amendment no collision in sight rutgers.generally defending antiharassment laws against first amendment attack and disagreeing with much of professor volokh argument volokh,how harassment law restricts free speech rutgers.professor volokh response to professor sangree mcgowan,certain illusions about speech why the critique of hostile work environment harassment is wrong const.comment.mcgowan generally defending antiharassment laws against first amendment attack see also aguilar,supra,at,fn,d.
but the issue here is quite different.in aguilar,supra,cal th,d,the workplace was a car rental company.creative expression was not the company product.here,by contrast,the product,a comedy show,was itself expression.questions regarding free speech rights in the ordinary speech is not an integral part of the be difficult,as the five separate opinions in aguilar attest.i need not,and do not,go into these questions here,because this case presents an entirely different and,to my mind,rather straightforward constitutional question.when,as here,the workplace product is the creative expression itself,free speech rights are paramount.the friends writers were not renting cars and talking about sex on the side.they were writing adult comedy sexual repartee was an integral part of the process.
lawsuits like this one,directed at restricting the creative process in a workplace whose very business is speech related,present a clear and present danger to fundamental free speech rights.even academics who generally defend antiharassment law against first amendment attack recognize the importance of defending the first amendment in a context like this,mcgowan,supra,const.comment.at,concluding,on,in expressive workplaces that foster,support,and encourage debate,discussion,and plural opinions,the first amendment insulates much more.
for example,professor mcgowan contrasts two workplace situations involving the display of playboy magazine centerfolds at a shipyard where only one woman is employed as a welder,and in a museum where centerfolds were displayed to document changes in american visions of female beauty.mcgowan,supra,const.comment.at.mcgowan argues that free speech rights must yield to antiharassment law in the first case.but she agrees that the museum is an expressive workplace and,as such,is entitled to first amendment protection.this case is like the second situation,not the first.as professor volokh explains,the free speech problem is especially serious if the speech that creates the hostile work environment is an inherent part of the employer business.volokh,supra.at.it seems clear that,say,a female employee of an art a female employee of an adult claim that sexually explicit materials in the workplace are creating a hostile work environment.id.at.
the writers here did at times go to extremes in the creative process.they pushed the.some of what they did might be incomprehensible to people unfamiliar with the creative process.but that is what creative people sometimes have to do.as explained in an amicus curiae brief representing the writers guild of america,west,the directors guild of america the screen actors guild and named individuals representing a who who of television and motion picture writers and directors hereafter the writers guild brief,the process creators go through to capture the necessary magic is inexact,counterintuitive,nonlinear,often above all,delicate.and the problem is even more complicated for group writing.group writing,the brief explains,requires an atmosphere of complete trust.writers must feel not only that it all right to fail,but also that they can share their most private and darkest thoughts without concern for ridicule or embarrassment or legal accountability.the brief quotes steven bochco,cocreator of hill street blues,law,and nypd blue,and one of the individuals the brief represents,as explaining that a certain level of intimacy is required to do the work at its best,and so there is an implicit contract among the writers what is said in the room,stays in the room.the brief further explains that with adult audiences in particular,the characters,dialogue,and stories must ring true.that means on shows like law and order,er,or the sopranos,writers must tap into places in their experience or psyches that most of us are far too polite or to bring up.
the creative process must be unfettered,especially because it can often take strange turns,as many bizarre and potentially offensive ideas are suggested,tried,and,in the end,either discarded or used.as the writers guild brief notes,all in the family pushed the limits in its day,but with race rather than sex.the brief quotes norman lear,all in the family creator,and another of the individuals on whose behalf the brief was filed,as saying,we were dealing with racism and constantly on dangerous ground we cleaned up a lot of what was said in the room,and some people still found it offensive.it is hard to imagine all in the family having been successfully written if the writers and others involved in the creative process had to fear lawsuits by employees who claimed to be offended by the process of discovering what worked and did not work,what was funny and what was not funny,that led to the racial and ethnic humor actually used in the show.
s peech may not be prohibited because it concerns subjects offending our sensibilities.ashcroft free speech coalition,d.we must not permit juries to dissect the creative process in order to determine what was necessary to achieve the final product and what was not,and to impose liability for sexual harassment for that portion deemed unnecessary.creativity is,by its nature,creative.it is unpredictable.much that is not obvious can be necessary to the creative process.accordingly,courts may not constitutionally ask whether challenged speech was necessary for its intended purpose.shulman group productions,cal th,d.the courts do not,and constitutionally could not,sit as superior editors of the press.ibid.
for this reason,it is meaningless to argue,as plaintiff does,that much of what occurred in this process did not make its way into the actual shows.the first amendment also protects attempts at creativity that end in failure.that which ends up on the cutting room floor is also part of the creative process.an amicus curiae brief representing,among others,the american booksellers foundation for free expression explains to require the participants to justify after the fact the necessity of minor segments of the creative process represents a misunderstan
