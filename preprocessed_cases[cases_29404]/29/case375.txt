plaintiff michael flatley,a entertainer,sued defendant dean mauro,an attorney,for civil extortion,intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful interference with economic advantage.flatley action was based on a demand letter mauro sent to flatley on behalf of tyna marie robertson,a woman who claimed that flatley had raped her,and on subsequent telephone calls mauro made to flatley attorneys,demanding a payment to settle robertson claims.mauro filed a motion to strike flatley complaint under the statute code civ.he argued that the letter was a prelitigation settlement offer and therefore flatley complaint arose from mauro exercise of his constitutionally protected right of petition.the trial court denied the motion.the court of appeal held that,because mauro letter and subsequent telephone calls constituted criminal extortion as a matter of law,and extortionate speech is not constitutionally protected,the statute did not apply.therefore,it affirmed denial of mauro motion to strike.we granted mauro petition for review.
we conclude that,consistent with the legislative intent underlying the statute as revealed by the statutory language,and consistent with our existing jurisprudence,a defendant whose assertedly protected speech or petitioning activity was illegal as a matter of law,and therefore unprotected by constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition,can not use the statute to strike the plaintiff complaint.applying this principle in the specific circumstances of the case before us,we agree with the court of appeal conclusion.mauro communications constituted criminal extortion as a matter of law and,as such,were unprotected by constitutional guarantees of free speech or petition.therefore,the statute does not apply.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the court of appeal.
facts and procedural history 
michael flatley is a performer and dance impresario who owns the stock of corporations that present live performances by irish dance troupes throughout the world.on march,tyna marie robertson sued flatley in illinois for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress based on allegations that flatley had raped her in his hotel suite in las vegas on the night of october.robertson was represented by dean mauro,an illinois attorney.robertson and mauro then appeared on television,where robertson described the alleged rape in extremely lurid detail.
on march,flatley filed his complaint in the present action in california against mauro,robertson and doe defendants in a second amended complaint,flatley alleged five causes of action for civil extortion,defamation,fraud,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and wrongful interference with prospective economic advantage.the civil extortion,intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful interference causes of action were alleged against all defendants the defamation and fraud causes of action were alleged against robertson alone.
mauro answered with a general denial and asserted various affirmative defenses including that flatley claims were barred by section,the statute.on august,mauro filed a motion to strike flatley complaint under that statute.
flatley opposition to the motion argued that mauro communications constituted criminal extortion and were therefore not protected by the statute.he argued further that he could demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits.in support of his opposition,flatley filed several declarations,including his own and those of his personal secretary,thomas trautmann,and his attorneys,john brandon,bertram fields,and richard cestero 
the declarations submitted by flatley set forth the following scenario 
flatley met robertson in las vegas sometime before october.robertson was very friendly and flatley gave her the telephone number of his personal secretary,thomas trautmann trautmann in the event she wanted to reach flatley.
in october,robertson called trautmann to arrange a rendezvous with flatley.on october,robertson arrived at flatley suite in the venetian hotel in las vegas.she was told that one room was for flatley and the other was for trautmann.robertson put her belongings in flatley bedroom.she did not request alternate accommodations or protest the accommodations offered.
that evening,flatley and robertson had dinner together.upon returning to flatley hotel room,robertson excused herself to the bathroom.flatley disrobed and got into bed.robertson reappeared,nude,and entered flatley bed,where she remained for the night.according to flatley,everything that transpired between him and robertson that night was consensual.at no time did trautmann,who was in the next room with the door open,hear any cry or complaint of any kind.
the next morning,robertson entered the common area of the suite,and kissed flatley in trautmann presence.her demeanor was relaxed and happy.she ate breakfast with flatley,speaking affectionately to him and cordially to trautmann.upon leaving,she kissed flatley again and said she hoped to see him again.
on january,mauro sent a letter addressed to flatley that was received by flatley attorney,john brandon.the letter emphasized certain text,using various font sizes,boldface type,capital letters,underlining,and italics in small print,it stated this communication is governed by all applicable common law decisions of the state of illinois and rule of the federal rules of evidence.all information contained herein is for settlement purposes only.the subject line stated in,boldface,underlined type lawsuit against michael flatley,individually,and unicorn entertainment,and the venetion sic venture group.mauro identified his client as jane doe and referred to a report on file with the las vegas police department.the next line stated date of assault october.
the letter was addressed dear flatley,et.sic please be advised that we represent a women sic with whom you engaged in forcible sexual assault on or about october,sic.please consider this our first,and only,attempt to amicably resolve this claim against all defendants named in the complaint at law enclosed herein.
on the second page,a large caption announced notice of claim attorney lien.the letter continued please consider this as notice of our attorneys sic liens.we hereby make a claim and lien in the amount of of the total recovery of all funds obtained through trial or settlement,plus all costs of suit,and attorney fees leveled against you.after urging flatley to contact his insurance carrier,the letter states tell them to contact me directly.it warns that flatley failure to do so will result in the filing of a lawsuit and that all judgment proceeds will be sought directly from your personal assets.the letter then states you are granted until january,sic to resolve this matter.the amounts claimed in the lawsuit are naturally negotiable prior to suit.the letter warns,however,that if flatley fails to meet the january deadline all offers to compromise,settle and amicably resolve this case will be automatically withdrawn.the letter then goes on to advise flatley that mauro has retained several forensic expert witnesses whose opinions shall be disclosed in detail in the public filed court documents in this litigation.mauro also advises flatley that he has worked at lloyd of london,and is familiar with international law.these causes of action allow for punitive damages.punitive damages are in bankruptcy,and are recognized under british law.we can therefore execute and collect any award against michael flatley personally in the,or the next,mauro refers to his expert economist frank maguire who will testify as to the amount of punitive damages which the law recognizes to justify sending a message or what constitutes a deterrent.
the first paragraph of the third page of mauro letter refers flatley to a settlement of awarded as punitive damages in an unidentified case.the second full paragraph then states that an investigation into flatley assets for purposes of determining an appropriate award of punitive damages,will require an investigation and that any information would then become a matter of public record,as it must be filed with the court,as it will be part of the bases of several of our expert sic testimony.the third paragraph states in its entirety any and all information,including immigration,social security issuances and use,and irs and various state tax levies and information will be exposed.we are positive the media worldwide will enjoy what they find.after a paragraph describing the potential testimony of two other experts,john lombardi and david hirshey,apparently with respect to the failure of the las vegas hotel in which the alleged rape occurred to provide requisite safeguards for our client,the fifth paragraph again warns that all pertinent information and documentation,if in violation of any federal,immigration,state,local,commonwealth,or international laws,shall immediately be turned over to any and all appropriate authorities.the final paragraph warns that once the lawsuit is filed additional causes of action shall arise including defamatory comments,civil conspiracy,reckless supervision which are just the beginning and that ample evidence exists to prove each and every element for all these additional causes of action.again,these actions allow for punitive damages.
at the top of the final page of the letter is the caption first final settlement demand.beneath it a paragraph warns that there shall be no continuances nor any delays.if we do not hear from you,then we shall know you are not interested in amicably resolving this claim and we shall immediately file suit.at the bottom of the page,beneath mauro signature,a final paragraph warns flatley that,along with the filing of suit,press releases will be disseminated to various media sources,including but not limited to fox news chicago,fox news indiana,fox news wisconsin,and the national fox news network wgn national television all local las vegas television,radio stations and newspapers the chicago tribune,the chicago southern economist,the news sun,the beacon news,the daily herald,the new york times,the washington post all national television networks of nbc,abc and cbs as well as internet postings worldwide,including the british broadcasting company,and the germany national news network stations.
attached to the letter were pages of material,including a draft of robertson complaint against flatley,robertson medical records pertaining to treatment for the alleged rape,certificates of achievement awarded to mauro,newspaper articles chronicling mauro cases and settlements,and the curricula vitae of mauro experts.
among the attachments was a letter robertson wrote to the las vegas police department on november.the letter refers to a telephone call she had made to the police department on november in which she reported the rape.she asked that the letter,which described the rape,be added to the earlier report because she did not get an adequate opportunity to explain.she added,however,that she had no interest in seeing the initial incident complaint form,because she was a private person,and this is not something about which i can openly or freely explain to people.she also wrote that she could not at that time go into more specific,or graphic details because she was not in any condition to relive this.
the record does not show that robertson provided any additional information to the police,or that the police took any action regarding her allegation.according to flatley and trautmann declarations,no one in the las vegas police department contacted either flatley or his representatives about the allegation and flatley remained unaware of the allegation until brandon received mauro letter.
upon receipt of mauro letter,brandon immediately called mauro.mauro gave brandon a deadline of january,to offer sufficient payment.on january,mauro telephoned brandon to complain that he had not heard from flatley or flatley representatives.brandon explained that he was not handling the matter but offered to pass along any message.mauro told him that he would not extend the january,deadline.he added i know the tour dates i am not kidding about this it will be publicized every place he flatley goes for the rest of his life.he added that dissemination of the story would be immediate to any place where he flatley and the troupes are performing everywhere in the world.
on january,mauro again called brandon,who was in a meeting,and left a message with brandon secretary.the message read dean mauro needs a call back in hour,otherwise they are going public.when brandon returned mauro call,mauro complained that people were investigating the matter before contacting him and were doing so in an intimidating manner.he said that if he did not receive a call by central standard time,he would go public and the january deadline is gone.he said,i already have the news media lined up and would hit him flatley at every single place he tours.brandon read this back to mauro to confirm its accuracy.when brandon asked mauro why he was concerned about flatley attorneys investigating robertson claim before making an offer,mauro stated that this case is like an insurance claim where the adjuster would call the lawyer to acknowledge the attorney lien.brandon asked mauro if acknowledging the lien was a problem.mauro said never mind about that,just pass on the message.brandon conveyed the message to bertram fields,the attorney handling the matter for flatley.
fields called mauro later that day.mauro told fields he knew how to play hardball and that if flatley did not pay an acceptable amount,he and robertson would go public.mauro said he would ensure that the story would follow flatley wherever he or his troupes performed and would ruin him.fields asked mauro how much he was demanding and mauro replied it would take seven figures.
fields reported mauro conduct to the fbi and arranged for flatley to give the fbi a voluntary interview without the presence of counsel.hoping to allow the fbi more time to investigate,fields wrote mauro asking him to extend the deadline.mauro extended the deadline by one day in a letter that complained that fields had failed to return mauro numerous messages.you have my personal cell phone number,on hours daily,and we still have received no substantive conversation of any kind for nearly a month.
flatley did not pay robertson and mauro.
mauro reply to flatley opposition to the motion to strike argued that his january,letter was a prelitigation settlement offer in furtherance of his constitutional right of petition and,therefore,protected by section,subdivision e and.he argued further that flatley had failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on any of his causes of action.
on september,the trial court denied mauro motion to strike.it found that mauro had not satisfied his initial burden to show that his communication was protected by section.mauro appealed,subd.a,and the court of appeal affirmed,holding that,as a matter of law,mauro communications constituted criminal extortion and therefore were not protected under section.the court of appeal did not address whether flatley had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits.we granted mauro petition for review 
ii.discussion 
a.the statute does not apply to speech and petitioning activity that is illegal as a matter of law and,therefore,not constitutionally protected.general principles regarding section 
the statute,section,allows a court to strike any cause of action that arises from the defendant exercise of his or her constitutionally protected rights of free speech or petition for redress of grievances,subd.b.we described the purpose of the statute,and the process by which a motion to strike is determined,in the companion case,soukup hafif july,cal th,d,wl,where we said the legislature enacted section to prevent and deter lawsuits referred to as slapp brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a.because these meritless lawsuits seek to deplete the defendant energy and drain his or her resources citation,the legislature sought to prevent slapps by ending them early and without great cost to the slapp target.citation.section therefore establishes a procedure where the trial court evaluates the merits of the lawsuit using a procedure at an early stage of the litigation.varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d,jarrow formulas,lamarche,supra,cal th at d,section is a procedural device for screening out meritless claims.the legislature purpose in enacting the statute is set forth in its findings and declarations.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process,subd.a.furthermore,to accomplish this purpose the legislature has directed that the statute be broadly construed.ibid.to this end,when construing the statute,w here possible we follow the legislature intent,as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law citation.jarrow formulas,lamarche,supra,cal th at d,quoting california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.id.at,d at,at.
our concern for effectuating the legislative intent as demonstrated by the plain language of the statute has led us to reject attempts to read into section requirements not explicitly contained in that language.see,jarrow formulas,lamarche,supra,cal th,d,no categorical exemption for malicious prosecution actions under section where the legislature had not created such an exemption city of cotati cashman cal th,d,declining to read into section a requirement that a defendant demonstrate that the plaintiff action actually intended to chill the defendant exercise of his or her protected rights briggs eden council,supra,cal th at,d,section,subdivision e and does not require that statements made before,or in connection with an issue pending before an official proceeding,also involve an issue of public significance absent statutory language to that effect.in short,our jurisprudence has attempted to effectuate the central purpose of the statute by carefully examining the actual words of the statute and giving them their plain meaning.
as noted,the purpose of section is to prevent the chilling of the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances by the abuse of the judicial process,subd.a.as a necessary corollary to this statement,because not all speech or petition activity is constitutionally protected,not all speech or petition activity is protected by section.see,lam ngo th,d violence and other criminal acts are not protected by the first amendment even if committed out of political motives at a political demonstration nor would doe defendants who engaged in such activity be protected by the statute.the scope of section is not without limits,as demonstrated in cases finding lawsuits were not within its protection.citations.paul friedman th,d.the case most often cited in support of this proposition is paul for council hanyecz th,d paul,disapproved on other grounds in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,footnote,d.flatley argues,and the court of appeal agreed,that paul is dispositive of the issues raised in this case,so we examine it in some detail.
in paul,the plaintiff was a city council member seeking reelection.following his defeat,he filed an action against several individuals,alleging that they interfered with plaintiff candidacy by influencing the election with illegal campaign contributions for one of his opponents.plaintiff alleged that defendants acts violated the political reform act of,et the political reform act.paul,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.the defendants moved to strike the complaint as a slapp but t heir moving papers show ed that they in fact did violate the political reform act when they laundered campaign contributions to persons running for local or state offices.ibid.nonetheless,the defendants argued that their money laundering was in furtherance of their constitutional rights of free speech and arose out of acts in furtherance of their constitutionally protected conduct.id.at,d.the plaintiff argued in his opposition that section did not apply in this case because defendants actions in laundering campaign money do not constitute constitutionally protected activity.id.at,d.
the court of appeal agreed with the plaintiff.after quoting the language of section,subdivision a on the purpose of the statute,the court discussed the respective burdens the statute places on the parties upon the filing of a motion to strike.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold prima facie showing that the defendant acts,of which the plaintiff complains,were ones taken in furtherance of the defendant constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.citation.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,then the plaintiff will be required to demonstrate that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.citations.the defendant has the burden on the first issue,the threshold issue the plaintiff has the burden on the second issue.paul,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
the court held that to meet its burden the defendant does not have to establish its actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law.if this were so the second clause of subdivision b of section would be superfluous because by definition the plaintiff could not prevail on its claim.citation.rather,the defendant must present a prima facie showing that the plaintiff causes of action arise from acts of the defendant taken to further the defendant rights of free speech or petition in connection with a public issue.citation.only if the defendant makes this prima facie showing does the trial court consider the second step of the section,subdivision b analysis at that point the burden shifts to the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of facts which,if proven at trial,would support a judgment in the plaintiff favor.paul,supra,th at,d.
applying the statutory procedure thus described to the case before it,the paul court held that we need not address the second step of section motion to strike process because we hold,as a matter of law,that defendants can not meet their burden on the first step t he activity of which plaintiff campaign money not a valid activity undertaken by defendants in furtherance of their constitutional right of free speech.this conclusion is established by the factual record before us and is not really disputed by the defendants.indeed,defendants argue that they are entitled to the benefit of section in spite of such illegality.paul,supra,th at,d.
paul acknowledged that the making of a political campaign contribution is a type of political speech.paul,supra,th at,d.nonetheless it rejected the defendants claim that,because their money laundering activity was taken in furtherance of their constitutional right of free speech,the activity fell within the ambit of the statute even though illegal.ibid.t he probability that the legislature intended to give defendants section protection from a lawsuit based on injuries they are alleged to have caused by their illegal campaign money laundering scheme is as unlikely as the probability that such protection would exist for them if they injured plaintiff while robbing a bank to obtain money for the campaign contributions or while hijacking a car to drive the campaign contributions to the post office for mailing thus,while it is technically true that laundering campaign contributions is an act in furtherance of the giving of such contributions,that is,is in furtherance of an act of free speech,we reject the notion that section exists to protect such illegal activity.id.at,d.
in support of its conclusion,paul cited wilcox superior court th,d,disapproved on other grounds in equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d,which distinguished between activity that would be protected under the statute and activity that would not.thus,if the defendant act was a lawsuit against a developer the defendant would have a prima facie first amendment defense.citation.but,if the defendant act was burning down the developer office as a political protest the defendant motion to strike could be summarily denied without putting the developer to the burden of establishing the probability of success on the merits in a tort suit against defendant.wilcox superior court,supra,th at,d.the paul court commented while laundering campaign money may not be as dramatic or physically dangerous as burning down a building,it is equally outside the scope of section protection.paul,supra,th at,d.
paul emphasized the narrow circumstance in which a defendant assertedly protected activity could be found to be illegal as a matter of law and therefore not within the purview of section.this case involves a factual context in which defendants have effectively conceded the illegal nature of their election campaign activities for which they claim constitutional protection.thus,there was no dispute on that point and we have concluded,as a matter of law,that such activities are not a valid exercise of constitutional rights as contemplated by section.however,had there been a factual dispute as to the legality of defendants actions,then we could not so easily have disposed of defendants motion.paul,supra,th at,d.the court explained that,if the plaintiff contested the validity of the defendant exercise of protected rights and unlike the case here,can not demonstrate as a matter of law that the defendant acts do not fall under section protection,then the claimed illegitimacy of the defendant acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiff burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiff case.ibid.
in paul,then,the court discerned that section,by its express terms,does not apply to any activity that can conceivably be characterized as being in furtherance of a defendant protected speech or petition rights if,as a matter of law,that activity was illegal and by reason of the illegality not constitutionally protected.paul,supra,th at,d.in such a narrow circumstance,where either the defendant concedes the illegality of its conduct or the illegality is conclusively shown by the evidence,the motion must be denied.the rationale is that the defendant can not make a threshold showing that the illegal conduct falls within the purview of the statute and promotes section purpose to prevent and deter lawsuits referred to as slapp brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a.varian medical systems,delfino,supra,cal th at,d.if,however,a factual dispute exists about the legitimacy of the defendant conduct,it can not be resolved within the first step but must be raised by the plaintiff in connection with the plaintiff burden to show a probability of prevailing on the merits.
paul interpretation of section has been unanimously accepted in the court of appeal.see,city of los angeles animal defense league th,d i f the defendant concedes the conduct complained of was illegal,the defendant will be unable to make a prima facie showing the action arises from protected activity within the meaning of section huntingdon life sciences stop huntingdon animal cruelty,th,d if a defendant concedes or the evidence conclusively establishes the conduct complained of was illegal,as a matter of law the defendant can not make a prima facie showing the action arises from protected activity within the meaning of section contacts,steinberg th,d noting paul explicitly recognized that the validity of defendant act comes into play in the second stage of the statutory analysis.citation.it held,however,that the defendants,having admitted engaging in illegal campaign contributions the subject of the suit,had established that their acts had not been in furtherance of their constitutional rights yu signet bank of virginia th,d,fn.it is not argued that the illegality of banks petitioning activity has been effectively conceded,or conclusively established by the evidence governor gray davis com.american taxpayers alliance th,d here,in contrast to paul,appellant neither has conceded nor does the evidence conclusively establish the illegality of its communication made during the course of debate on political issues chavez mendoza th,d a limited exception to the rule precluding a court from determining the validity of the asserted constitutional right in the first step of the analysis applies only where the defendant indisputably concedes the claim arose from illegal or constitutionally unprotected activity.
paul also finds support in our decision in the companion case of soukup hafif,which examines section.section exempts from the statute slappback s any cause of action for malicious prosecution or abuse of process arising from the filing or maintenance of a prior cause of action that has been dismissed pursuant to a special motion to strike under section,subd b if the underlying action was illegal as a matter of law,subd.h.by enacting section,the legislature signaled its agreement with the interpretation of the scope of section advanced by paul.in adding this proviso,the legislature appears to have had in mind decisions by the courts of appeal that have held that the statute is not available to a defendant who claims that the plaintiff cause of action arises from assertedly protected activity when that activity is illegal as a matter of law and,for that reason,not protected by the first amendment.see,paul,supra,th d,disapproved on other grounds in equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,fn.d.soukup hafif,supra,cal th at d at,at.
we agree with paul that section can not be invoked by a defendant whose assertedly protected activity is illegal as a matter of law and,for that reason,not protected by constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition.a contrary rule would be inconsistent with the purpose of the statute as revealed by its language.paul,supra,th at,d t he activity of which plaintiff complains was not a valid activity undertaken by defendants in furtherance of their constitutional right to free speech.moreover,it would eviscerate the first step of the inquiry set forth in the statute if the defendant mere assertion that his underlying activity was constitutionally protected sufficed to shift the burden to the plaintiff to establish a probability of prevailing where it could be conclusively shown that the defendant underlying activity was illegal and not constitutionally protected.while a defendant need only make a prima facie showing that the underlying activity falls within the ambit of the statute,clearly the statute envisions that the courts do more than simply rubber stamp such assertions before moving on to the second step.wilcox superior court,supra,th at,d i t is fundamentally fair that before putting the plaintiff to the burden of establishing probability of success on the merits the defendant be required to show imposing that burden is justified by the nature of the plaintiff complaint.furthermore,as the attorney general points out in his amicus curiae brief,i f the courts rule that a defendant who has engaged in indisputably illegal behavior has met the first step of the motion to strike,the defendant can then shift the burden to the plaintiff and force his victim to marshal and present evidence early in the litigation before the commencement of full discovery i f the plaintiff victim is unable to show a probability of prevailing,he will have to pay the defendant attorneys fees.see,subd.c.these are grossly unfair burdens to impose on a plaintiff who is himself the victim of the defendant criminal activity.
citing navellier sletten cal th,d,navellier,mauro argues that any claimed illegitimacy of the defendant assertion of protected rights in a motion to strike under section must be decided under the second step of the statutory inquiry,which requires plaintiffs to show their action has minimal merit.navellier,at,d.navellier,however,is not dispositive of the issue before us.
in navellier,the plaintiffs sued the defendant in federal court alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the defendant management of an investment company established by the plaintiffs.while the federal action was pending,the parties entered into an agreement that included a release of claims that the defendant signed.subsequently,however,when the plaintiffs amended their complaint in the federal action,the defendant filed counterclaims.the plaintiffs obtained dismissal of two of the counterclaims based on the release.ultimately,the federal action went to trial and resulted in a defense verdict.on appeal,the ninth circuit affirmed judgment for the defendant but also affirmed the dismissal of the defendant counterclaims on the grounds they were barred by the release of claims.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.
while the federal appeal was pending,the plaintiffs filed a state action alleging that the defendant had committed fraud in misrepresenting his intention to be bound by the release,so as to induce plaintiffs to incur various litigation costs in the federal action that they would not have incurred had they known the defendant true intentions.plaintiffs also alleged that the defendant had committed breach of contract by filing counterclaims in the federal action.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.the defendant filed a motion to strike the complaint as a slapp.the trial court denied the motion and the court of appeal affirmed.we reversed.
the principal issue in navellier was whether the plaintiffs causes of action for fraud and breach of contract arose from acts in furtherance of the defendant exercise of protected speech or petition rights.we concluded that they did.we observed that the fraud claim was based on the defendant negotiation,execution,and repudiation of the release which limited the types of claims that the defendant was allowed to file in the federal action,and that the plaintiffs relied on the release when they moved to dismiss the defendant counterclaims.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.thus,the defendant negotiation and execution of the release involved statement s or writing s made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,subd.e,the federal district court,and his arguments respecting the release validity were statement s or writing s made before a judicial proceeding,subd.e,the federal action.ibid.similarly,we concluded that the plaintiffs breach of contract cause of action involved activity protected by the statute because it was based on the defendant filing of his counterclaims in the federal action.a claim for relief filed in federal district court indisputably is a statement or writing made before a judicial proceeding.ibid.
only at the end of our analysis did we address the plaintiffs claim that the statute does not apply to this action because any petitioning activity on which it was based was not valid.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.the precise argument,as summarized in the dissent,was that t he breach of contract claim is not a slapp because the defendant had exchanged his right to sue through the release for consideration,and thus his petitioning was not a valid exercise of that right.id.at,d,dis.opn.of brown.the majority disagreed.that the legislature expressed a concern in the statute preamble with lawsuits that chill the valid exercise of first amendment rights does not mean that a court may read a separate requirement into the operative sections of the statute.citations.rather,any claimed illegitimacy of the defendant acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiff secondary burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiff case.paul,supra,th,d.id.at,d.we concluded that a defendant is not required to establish that its actions are constitutionally protected as a matter of law because such a requirement would render the second prong of the statute superfluous.id.at,d.
navellier did not consider whether or how the statute applies to a defendant whose assertedly protected activity is conclusively demonstrated to be illegal as a matter of law.navellier was concerned with the threshold showing a defendant is required to make to come within the ambit of the statute where a dispute exists about whether the defendant exercise of his or her constitutionally protected rights was valid.while we cited paul with approval for its holding that,ordinarily,any claimed illegitimacy of the defendant conduct must be resolved as part of a plaintiff secondary burden to show the action has minimal merit,navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d,we expressed no opinion regarding paul conclusion that the statute does not apply in those rare cases where the defendant assertedly protected speech or petitioning activity is conclusively demonstrated to have been illegal as a matter of law.
a decision,of course,does not stand for a proposition not considered by the court.nolan city of anaheim cal th,d.accordingly,navellier the statute does not require defendants who bring motions to strike under section to prove their asserted exercise of protected speech or petition rights was valid as a matter or not dispositive of the question presented here of whether a defendant whose underlying conduct is conclusively demonstrated to have been illegal as a matter of law,and thus unprotected by the federal and state constitutional speech and petition guarantees,is foreclosed from invoking the statute in the first instance.
we conclude,therefore,that where a defendant brings a motion to strike under section based on a claim that the plaintiff action arises from activity by the defendant in furtherance of the defendant exercise of protected speech or petition rights,but either the defendant concedes,or the evidence conclusively establishes,that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law,the defendant is precluded from using the statute to strike the plaintiff action.in reaching this conclusion,we emphasize that the question of whether the defendant underlying conduct was illegal as a matter of law is preliminary,and unrelated to the second prong question of whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing,and the showing required to establish conduct illegal as a matter of through defendant concession or by uncontroverted and conclusive not the same showing as the plaintiff second prong showing of probability of prevailing.with this understanding,we turn to mauro claim that even conduct illegal as a matter of law is protected by the statute if it is protected by the litigation privilege,subd.b.
the litigation privilege and section 
mauro argues all speech,lawful or not,is in furtherance of petition or free speech rights.thus,he argues,even assuming his letter was extortion,it is nonetheless protected by code of civil procedure section because it falls within subdivision e and in advancing this argument,he invokes the litigation privilege set forth in civil code section,subdivision b.he argues,first,that section protects litigation communication to the same degree that such communication is protected by the litigation privilege and then reasons from this premise that section must also protect unlawful communication because the litigation privilege does he claims paul is inapplicable to this case because it did not involve communications protected by section,subdivision e or but,rather,noncommunicative conduct protected by subdivision e we disagree.
the principal purpose of civil code section,subdivision b is to afford litigants and witnesses citation the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.silberg anderson cal d.additionally,the privilege promotes effective judicial proceedings by encouraging open channels of communication and the presentation of evidence without the external threat of liability ibid,and by encouraging attorneys to zealously protect their clients interests.id.at.finally,in immunizing participants from liability for torts arising from communications made during judicial proceedings,the law places upon litigants the burden of exposing during trial the bias of witnesses and the falsity of evidence,thereby enhancing the finality of judgments and avoiding an unending roundelay of litigation,an evil far worse than an occasional unfair result.ibid.
to accomplish these objectives,the privilege is an absolute privilege,and it bars all tort causes of action except a claim of malicious prosecution.hagberg california federal bank cal th,d.the litigation privilege has been applied in numerous cases involving fraudulent communication or perjured testimony.silberg anderson,supra,cal d at,see,home ins.zurich ins.th,d attorney misrepresentation of available insurance policy limits to induce the settlement of a lawsuit doctors.ins.services superior court d.subornation of perjury carden getzoff d.perjury steiner eikerling d.preparation of a forged will and presentation of it for probate cunningham d.attorney letter sent in the course of judicial proceedings allegedly defaming his client.the privilege has also been held to apply to statements made prior to the filing of a lawsuit.hagberg california federal bank,supra,cal th at,d.seizing upon these principles,mauro maintains that section similarly protects any communications even if that communication constitutes extortion assuming without deciding that the litigation privilege may apply to such threats,we conclude that they are nonetheless not protected under the statute because the litigation privilege and the statute are substantively different statutes that serve quite different purposes,and it is not consistent with the language or the purpose of the statute to protect such threats.
there is,of course,a relationship between the litigation privilege and the statute.past decisions of this court and the court of appeal have looked to the litigation privilege as an aid in construing the scope of subdivision e and with respect to the first step of the is,by examining the scope of the litigation privilege to determine whether a given communication falls within the ambit of subdivisions e and.
for example,in briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th,d,we declined to read into section,subdivision e and,which protect statements made before,or in connection with,an issue pending before an official proceeding,a further requirement that the statements concern an issue of public significance.in so holding,we observed that imposing a public issue requirement as a condition to protecting communications under the statute would produce an anomalous result.briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d.communications that did not involve a public issue would not be protected under the statute but would nonetheless be privileged under the litigation privilege,and protected by state and federal constitutional guarantees of the right of petition.ibid.thus,in briggs,we bolstered our interpretation of the scope of the protection afforded to communications under the statute by looking at whether our result was consistent with the scope of the protection afforded to such communications by the litigation privilege.nowhere in briggs,however,did we suggest,much less hold,that the scope of those protections are identical in every respect.
the litigation privilege is also relevant to the second step in the analysis in that it may present a substantive defense a plaintiff must overcome to demonstrate a probability of prevailing.see,kashian harriman th,d where plaintiff defamation action was barred by civil code section,subdivision b,plaintiff can not demonstrate a probability of prevailing under the statute dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d defendant prelitigation communication was privileged and trial court therefore did not err in granting motion to strike under the statute.
notwithstanding this relationship between the litigation privilege and the statute,as we have observed,the two statutes are not substantively the same.in jarrow formulas,lamarche,supra,cal th,d,we declined to create a categorical exemption from section for malicious prosecution actions even though such claims are exempt from the litigation privilege.we rejected the plaintiff attempted analogy between the litigation privilege and the statute as inapt,explaining the litigation privilege is an entirely different type of statute than section.the former enshrines a substantive rule of law that grants absolute immunity from tort liability for communications made in relation to judicial proceedings citation the latter is a procedural device for screening out meritless claims citation.jarrow formulas,at,d.
nor do the two statutes serve the same purposes.the litigation privilege embodied in civil code section,subdivision b serves broad goals of guaranteeing access to the judicial process,promoting the zealous representation by counsel of their clients,and reinforcing the traditional function of the trial as the engine for the determination of truth.applying the litigation privilege to some forms of unlawful activity may advance those broad goals notwithstanding the occasional unfair result in an individual case.silberg anderson,supra,cal d at,doctors.ins.services superior court,supra,d at.the litigation privilege applies to subornation of perjury because it is in the nature of a statutory privilege that it must deny a civil recovery for immediate even serious and troubling order to accomplish what the legislature perceives as a greater good.
section is not concerned with securing for litigants freedom of access to the judicial process.the purpose of section is to protect the valid exercise of constitutional rights of free speech and petition from the abuse of the judicial process,subd.a,by allowing a defendant to bring a motion to strike any action that arises from any activity by the defendant in furtherance of those rights,subd.b.by necessary implication,the statute does not protect activity that,because it is illegal,is not in furtherance of constitutionally protected speech or petition rights.wilcox superior court,supra,th at,d if the defendant act is not constitutionally protected how can doing the act be in furtherance of the defendant constitutional rights.thus,the rationale for applying the litigation privilege to some forms of illegal the occasional bad result is justified by the larger goal of access to the judicial process is simply not transferable to the statute because the latter statute does not promote the same goals as the former.moreover,by its very terms,section does not apply to activity that is not in furtherance of the constitutional rights of free speech or petition and this would necessarily include illegal activity that falls outside protected speech and petition rights.see,wilcox,at,d the statute would not apply to a defendant act of burning down a developer office as a political protest.
conversely,civil code section states a statutory privilege,not a constitutional protection.as we recognized in oren royal oaks venture greenberg,bernhard,weiss karma cal d,that statutory privilege is specific and limited in nature.in oren,we concluded that while civil code section prohibited an action based on a party statements made during settlement negotiations,it did not preclude the use of those statements as evidence of the party intent to establish an abuse of process claim.oren,supra,cal d at.we stated the privileges of civil code section,unlike evidentiary privileges which function by the exclusion of evidence citation,operate as limitations upon liability.italics added.indeed,on brief reflection,it is quite clear that section,subdivision b has never been thought to bar the evidentiary use of every statement or publication made in the course of a judicial proceeding oren,at.
by parity of reasoning,civil code section does not operate as a limitation on the scope of the statute.the fact that civil code section may limit the liability of a party that sends to an opposing party a letter proposing settlement of proposed litigation does not mean that the settlement letter is also a protected communication for purposes of section therefore,we reject mauro contention that,because some forms of illegal activity may be privileged under the litigation privilege,that activity is necessarily protected under the statute.
mauro assertedly protected conduct was criminal extortion as a matter of law and was undeserving of the protection of the statute.

extortion is the obtaining of property from another,with his consent induced by a wrongful use of force or fear.fear,for purposes of extortion may be induced by a threat,either.to accuse the individual threatened of any crime or.to expose,or impute to him any deformity,disgrace or crime.every person who,with intent to extort any money or other property from another,sends or delivers to any person any letter or other writing,whether subscribed or not,expressing or implying,or adapted to imply,any threat such as is specified in section,is punishable in the same manner as if such money or property were actually obtained by means of such threat.
extortion has been characterized as a paradoxical crime in that it criminalizes the making of threats that,in and of themselves,may not be illegal.i n many blackmail cases the threat is to do something in itself perfectly legal,but that threat nevertheless becomes illegal when coupled with a demand for money.philippine export foreign loan guarantee chuidian d.the extortion statutes all adopted at the same time and relating to the same subject matter,clearly indicate that the legislature in denouncing the wrongful use of fear as a means of obtaining property from another had in mind threats to do the acts specified in section,the making of which for the purpose stated is declared to be a wrongful use of fear induced thereby.people beggs cal.it is the means employed to obtain the property of another which the law denounces,and though the purpose may be to collect a just indebtedness arising from and created by the criminal act for which the threat is to prosecute the wrongdoer,it is nevertheless within the statutory inhibition.the law does not contemplate the use of criminal process as a means of collecting a debt.id.at,people tufunga cal th,in beggs we explained that because of the strong public policy militating against by force or fear,courts will not recognize a good faith defense to the satisfaction of a debt when accomplished by the use of force or fear lindenbaum state bar cal d,for purposes of extortion i t is immaterial that the money which petitioner sought to obtain through threats may have been justly due him gomez garcia cir,the law of california was established in that belief that the victim owes a debt is not a defense to the crime of extortion.
moreover,threats to do the acts that constitute extortion under penal code section are extortionate whether or not the victim committed the crime or indiscretion upon which the threat is based and whether or not the person making the threat could have reported the victim to the authorities or arrested the victim.people sanders cal,people goldstein d,people hesslink d.furthermore,the crime with which the extortionist threatens his or her victim need not be a specific crime.t he accusations need only be such as to put the intended victim of the extortion in fear of being accused of some crime.the more vague and general the terms of the accusation the better it would subserve the purpose of the accuser in magnifying the fears of his victim,and the better also it would serve to protect him in the event of the failure to accomplish his extortion and of a prosecution for his attempted crime.people sanders,supra,at,people massengale d.
attorneys are not exempt from these principles in their professional conduct.indeed,the rules of professional conduct specifically prohibit attorneys from threaten ing to present criminal,administration,or disciplinary charges to obtain an advantage in a civil dispute.cal.rules of conduct,rule a.
in libarian state bar cal d,we upheld disciplinary action against librarian who,after losing at trial,sent a letter to opposing counsel,accusing his opponent client of perjury and threatening to use the perjury charge as the basis of a new trial motion and a criminal complaint unless opposing counsel client paid librarian client.although no action was taken either by librarian or siegel to prosecute nadel,the record clearly shows conduct which is in violation of librarian oath and duties as an attorney.the threats contained in the letter indicate an attempt to commit extortion.the sending of a threatening letter with intent to extort money is punishable in the same manner as if such money were actually obtained,and the crime of extortion involves moral turpitude.id.at,barton state bar cal d,the conduct of an attorney who threatened an oil company with reporting adulteration of its gasoline to the prosecutor unless it paid his clients was not only grounds for disbarment but constituted an attempt to extort money as said crime is defined in sections,and of the penal code state harrington,attorney suggestion in letter demanding settlement in divorce case that he might advise his client to report husband to internal revenue service and united states custom service constituted veiled threats that exceeded the limits of respondent representation of his client in the divorce action and supported attorney extortion conviction.as these cases illustrate,a threat that constitutes criminal extortion is not cleansed of its illegality merely because it is laundered by transmission through the offices of an attorney.bearing these principles in mind,we turn to the instant case.
application 
extortion is not a constitutionally protected form of speech.city of paul,d conc.opn.of stevens,although the first amendment broadly protects speech,it does not protect the right to extort united states quinn cir,it may categorically be stated that extortionate speech has no more constitutional protection than that uttered by a robber while ordering his victim to hand over the money,which is no protection at all.the purpose of the statute,of course,is to protect the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a.flatley argues that the letter mauro sent on behalf of robertson,and his subsequent telephone calls to flatley attorneys,constituted extortion as a matter of law and,therefore,the trial court correctly dismissed mauro motion to strike flatley action as a slapp.paul,supra,th at,d.mauro maintains that his activity on behalf of robertson amounted to no more than the kind of permissible settlement negotiations that are attendant upon any legal dispute or,at minimum,that a question of fact exists regarding the legality of his conduct precluding a finding that it was illegal as a matter of law.we review the question de novo.soukup hafif,supra,cal th at,fn,d at,at,fn.
preliminarily,we note that,in the proceedings below,mauro did not deny that he sent the letter nor did he contest the version of the telephone calls set forth in brandon and field declarations in opposition to the motion to strike.we may therefore view this evidence as uncontroverted.see state harrington,supra,at the acts which he performed and the words that he wrote are established by direct and documentary evidence that is not contradicted.
at the core of mauro letter are threats to publicly accuse flatley of rape and to report and publicly accuse him of other unspecified violations of various laws unless he settled by paying a sum of money to robertson of which mauro would receive percent.in his phone calls,mauro named the price of his and robertson silence as seven figures or,at minimum,million.the key passage in mauro letter is at page where flatley is warned that,unless he settles,an investigation will be conducted into his personal assets to determine punitive damages and this information will then become a matter of public record,as it must be filed with the court any and all information,including immigration,social security issuances and use,and irs and various state tax levies and information will be exposed.we are positive the media worldwide will enjoy what they find.this warning is repeated in the fifth paragraph a ll pertinent information and documentation,if in violation of any federal,immigration,state,local,commonwealth,or international laws,shall immediately be turned over to any and all appropriate authorities.finally,flatley is warned that once the lawsuit is filed additional causes of action shall arise including defamatory comments,civil conspiracy,reckless supervision which are just the beginning and that ample evidence exists to prove each and every element for all these additional causes of action.again,these actions allow for punitive damages.
at the top of the final page of the letter is the caption first final settlement demand.beneath it a paragraph warns that there shall be no continuances nor any delays.at the bottom of the page,beneath mauro signature,a final paragraph warns flatley that,along with the filing of suit,press releases will be disseminated to numerous media sources and placed on the internet.
in his first telephone conversation with brandon,mauro gave flatley a deadline of the end of the month to offer sufficient payment,apparently without any further discussion of the particulars of robertson claim.in his call to brandon,one week after he sent the letter,mauro complained that he had not yet heard from flatley and told brandon he would not extend the deadline and i know the tour dates i am not kidding about this it will be publicized every place he flatley goes for the rest of his life,and that dissemination of the story would be immediate to any place where he and the troupes are performing everywhere in the world.the very next day,january,mauro called brandon again and,after leaving a message threatening to go public if brandon did not return his call within a,mauro complained that people were investigating the matter before contacting him and were doing so in an intimidating manner.he said that,if he did not receive a call by central standard time that night from a representative of flatley with authority,he would go public and the january deadline is gone.he said,i already have the news media lined up and would hit him flatley at every single place he tours.
later that day,when fields spoke to mauro,mauro told him he knew how to play hardball and that,if flatley did not pay an acceptable amount,they would go public,would see that their story would follow him wherever he or his groups performed and would ruin him.in response to fields query about how much money mauro wanted to avoid this,mauro said it would take seven figures.he repeated that the deadline to respond was january.
evaluating mauro conduct,we conclude that the letter and subsequent phone calls constitute criminal extortion as a matter of law.these communications threatened to accuse flatley of,or impute to him,crime s and disgrace,subds,unless flatley paid mauro a minimum of million of which mauro was to receive percent.that the threats were in legalese does not disguise their essential character as extortion.libarian state bar,supra cal d at,state harrington,supra,at.
mauro letter accuses flatley of rape and also imputes to him other,unspecified violations of various criminal offenses involving immigration and tax law as well as violations of the social security act.with respect to these latter threats,mauro letter goes on to threaten that w e are positive the media worldwide will enjoy what they find.thus,contrary to mauro claim that he did nothing more than suggest that,if evidence of other criminal conduct became public knowledge it would receive media attention,the letter implies that mauro is already in possession of information regarding such criminal activity and is prepared to disclose this information to the worldwide media.whether flatley in fact committed any violations of these various laws is irrelevant.people goldstein,supra,d at,for purposes of extortion,a false accusation of crime is often as harmful as one that is true.moreover,the threat to disclose criminal activity entirely unrelated to any alleged injury suffered by mauro client exceeded the limits of respondent representation of his client and is itself evidence of extortion.state harrington,supra,at attorney veiled threat to have his client in a divorce action inform on her husband to the internal revenue service and bureau of immigration and naturalization supports attorney conviction of extortion.that mauro did not specify these other criminal offenses is of no import the accusations need only be such as to put the intended victim of the extortion in fear of being accused of some crime.people sanders,supra,cal.at.indeed,the very vagueness of the accusation serves the dual purpose of magnifying the fear of his victim and protect ing the extortionist in the event of the failure to accomplish his extortion and prosecution.people massengale,supra,d at.
mauro also threatened to accuse flatley of raping robertson unless he paid for her silence.mauro argues that this threat can not be the basis of a finding of extortion because robertson had already reported the rape to the las vegas police department by the time the letter was sent.in the circumstances of this case,we reject his argument for the following reasons.we begin by examining the pleadings,subd.b.flatley complaint alleged that the purpose of robertson telephone call to the las vegas police department was not to file an actual crime report but simply to create a sham record of a police report that would make her threats more ominous s he wanted to prevent the police from taking any action that might make the matter public,since any public report of police action would necessarily spoil robertson scheme to extort a payment from flatley to avoid such publicity.
these allegations are supported by the declarations of mauro and trautmann that they were never contacted by the police in connection with the alleged rape before mauro sent his letter to flatley lawyers,and the absence of any evidence that the police ever took any action on the complaint.moreover,robertson letter to the las vegas police department and mauro statements to the media after he filed robertson she did not return to las vegas to pursue her complaint because she was too the conclusion that whatever complaint robertson made to the las vegas police was insufficient to trigger a police investigation.mauro declaration did not deny that he was aware that the las vegas police had not launched an investigation into robertson allegations when he sent the letter to flatley.yet,the letter was careful to include the number of a police report made to the las vegas police department as if to hold a police investigation over flatley head.thus,as flatley alleges,the incomplete police report appears to have existed only to make the threat of disclosure more ominous and the need to settle with robertson and mauro all the more urgent.under these circumstances,the fact that robertson may have made some report to the police did not render her threat to publicly accuse flatley of rape unless he paid her and mauro any less extortionate.people umana th,d although section,subdivision,speaks in terms of accusing the victim of a crime,there is no reasonable basis for drawing a distinction between the initial accusation of a crime and continued pursuit of a criminal charge.
moreover,in addition to the threats to accuse flatley publicly of rape and violations of other laws,mauro also alleged that he had in his possession ample evidence to support claims against flatley for defamation and civil conspiracy and that these were just the beginning.at minimum,these were threats that flatley would be exposed to various kinds of opprobrium and he would be disgraced thereby unless he met mauro demands,subd.threat to impute disgrace sufficient to establish extortion.
lastly,any doubt as to extortionate character of the letter is dispelled by the accounts from brandon and fields of mauro telephone calls to them within a week of having sent the letter.in his very first conversation with brandon,mauro did not discuss the particulars of the claim or express an interest in negotiations but simply stated a deadline for flatley to offer sufficient payment.in a phone call,he objected to flatley investigation of robertson allegation and threatened to withdraw the january deadline,thus further demonstrating that it was never his intention to engage in settlement negotiations.instead,the insistent theme of his conversations with flatley lawyers is the immediate and extensive threat of exposure if flatley failed to make a sufficient offer of money.this culminates in mauro threat to go public and ruin flatley if the january deadline was not met.we conclude that mauro conduct constituted criminal extortion as a matter of law in violation of penal code sections,and 
accordingly,because the activity forming the basis of mauro motion to strike flatley action was extortion as a matter of law and,therefore,not constitutionally protected activity for purposes of section,we further conclude that the trial court did not err when it denied mauro motion to strike.
iii.disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed.
i agree with the majority that defendant does not enjoy the protection of the statute.code civ.i therefore concur in the judgment affirming the court of appeal.in moving to strike this action,it was defendant initial burden to demonstrate the statute applicability by showing the lawsuit arises from protected speech or petitioning,subds.b,e zamos stroud cal th,d.this he failed to do.insofar as the gravamen of plaintiff claim is that defendant attempted to extort money from him by threatening,through various kinds of opprobrium,ante,d at,at,to ruin plaintiff reputation and encourage prosecutorial authorities to pursue plaintiff see especially id.at,at,the action does not arise from protected speech and petitioning.
the majority details plaintiff evidentiary submissions opposing defendant motion,ante,d at,at.these describe what the operative second amended complaint alleges a vicious and criminal scheme by defendant and others to extort money from plaintiff by asserting demonstrably false claims of sexual misconduct by plaintiff and threatening to publicize those false claims throughout the world,so as to ruin plaintiff,if he would not pay the money demanded.defendant,the complaint explicitly alleges,participated in seeking to extort money from plaintiff by this malicious,oppressive,and criminal scheme involving threats to ruin him with widespread and continuing publication of false claims of rape not only currently,but also whenever,in the future,he or his dance troupe would perform and threats to bring about plaintiff criminal prosecution for rape.as the majority points out,defendant scheme included threats that if plaintiff did not pay an acceptable amount,he would go public and would ensure that the story would follow plaintiff and would ruin him,ante,at,at.that plaintiff alleges the extortion scheme also included threats to sue id.at,at does not necessarily mean the action arises from defendant activities.kajima engineering construction,th,d mere presence of allegations in city that contractor extorted money,inter alia,by filing or threatening lawsuits did not render it a slapp.
moreover,for many of the reasons the majority cites in concluding defendant conduct was illegal as a matter of law,ante,d at,at,plaintiff plainly has demonstrated a probability that he will prevail on the claim,subd.b,bearing in mind,as we repeatedly have noted,that in order to make that demonstration he need only state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,see also rusheen cohen cal th,d,wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.accordingly,the trial court properly denied defendant motion.
as the foregoing disposes of the matter before us,i decline to join the majority in creating a judicial exception to the first,arising from prong of the statute for actions based on conduct courts determine was illegal as a matter of law.see,subd.b,ante,d at,at.although the legislature has embraced the concept of illegal as a matter of law as a limit on motions to strike slappback actions for malicious prosecution and abuse of process see,subd.h,it has not done so with respect to other motions and i am doubtful that our doing so is necessary or appropriate.
we previously have observed that the statute poses no obstacle to suits that possess minimal merit.navellier sletten cal th,d.accordingly,we have rejected,as contrary to the legislative design id.at,d,any suggestion that in order to invoke the special motion to strike,to satisfy the statute first prong,a defendant must first establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law id.at,d.i realize the majority new exception does not go that far.nevertheless,in adding to the burdens of defendants who seek protection the requirement that they first resist,on the merits,a plaintiff assertion that the conduct they are being sued for was illegal as a matter of law,ante,d at,at,the majority moves in that direction.since by definition all conduct sued upon is alleged to be illegal,the majority assurances that the narrow circumstance,ante,at,at see also id.at,at for plaintiffs invoking an defense to an motion will occur only in rare cases id.at,at are not convincing 
although the majority is at pains to emphasize that the question which arises under its new exception,whether the defendant underlying conduct was illegal as a matter of law,is preliminary,and unrelated to the second prong question of whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing,ante,d at,at,i suspect maintaining any such distinction in practice will prove difficult.the majority asserts the showing required to establish conduct illegal as a matter of through defendant concession or by uncontroverted and conclusive not the same showing as the plaintiff second prong showing of probability of prevailing.ibid.the standard the majority articulates for its new exception,however,is virtually indistinguishable from the standard we previously have articulated for satisfying the statute second prong the similarity may well sow doctrinal confusion among courts previously given to understand that any claimed illegitimacy of the defendant acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiff secondary burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiff case.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.
as the majority points out,o ur concern for effectuating the legislative intent as demonstrated by the plain language of the statute has led us to reject attempts to read into section requirements not explicitly contained in that language,ante,d at,at.for the reasons stated,i believe the majority departure from that course in the present case is unwise

flatley requests that we take judicial notice that robertson voluntarily dismissed this action and that a subsequent action robertson brought against flatley was also dismissed,subd.c.while it is true,as mauro maintains,that these dismissals were not before the trial court when it ruled on his motion to strike,nonetheless the documents are proper subjects for judicial notice and help complete the context of this case.therefore,we grant flatley request.both the attorney general and flatley have asked us to take judicial notice of portions of the legislative history of code of civil procedure section.flatley request is in support of his claim that the statute only protects the valid exercise of constitutionally protected speech and petition rights.the attorney general request is in connection with his response to an argument made by mauro that all communication is protected under the statute,even if illeg
