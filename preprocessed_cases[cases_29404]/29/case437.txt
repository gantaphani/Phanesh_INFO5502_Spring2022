in this fee dispute between plaintiff marathon entertainment,marathon,a personal manager,and defendant rosa blasi,an actress,we reverse the summary judgment for blasi and remand for consideration of whether the lawful portions of the parties personal management contract may be enforced under the doctrine of severability of contracts.
introduction 
labor code section of the talent agencies act,et the act requires that anyone who solicits or procures artistic employment or engagements for artists must be licensed as a talent agency in december,marathon and blasi entered into an oral contract for marathon to serve as blasi personal manager in exchange for a percentage of her entertainment employment income.blasi,who was represented by a licensed talent agent throughout the term of her personal management contract with marathon,terminated the management contract in the fall of.thereafter,blasi successfully invoked marathon alleged violation of the act licensing requirements as a defense to her obligation to pay marathon a commission on her earnings from the television series strong medicine,an engagement that blasi does not contend was procured by marathon in violation of the act.after being sued by marathon for the unpaid strong medicine commission,blasi moved for summary judgment of the complaint,contending that marathon unlicensed solicitations of other,unrelated employment opportunities on her behalf had so tainted with illegality the parties oral management contract that the entire contract must be invalidated as an illegal contract for unlicensed talent agency services.blasi produced no evidence in the trial court,however,linking the procurement of her strong medicine employment contract with any illegal activity or violation of the act by marathon.the trial court,without considering the applicability of the general rule of severability of contracts,granted the motion and entered summary judgment for blasi.
in this appeal from the summary judgment,marathon contends that under the law of severability of contracts,because its oral management contract had the lawful purpose of providing personal manager services that are not regulated by the act,the possibility exists that its commission on blasi strong medicine employment contract,which blasi does not argue was procured illegally,is severable from any unlawful parts of the agreement.the california supreme court decision in birbrower,montalbano,condon frank superior court cal th,d,birbrower,supports marathon position.in birbrower,the supreme court invalidated only that portion of an attorney fee agreement relating to services that a new york law firm had provided in violation of california attorney licensing statute.because of the possibility that,under the doctrine of severability of contracts,the firm might be able to recover the fees it had lawfully earned by providing services in new york,the supreme court reversed a summary adjudication order that had invalidated the entire attorney fee agreement.the supreme court explained in birbrower that under the general rule of severability of contracts,contracts containing both legal and illegal objects may be severed unless it is impossible to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful parts of the agreement such that the illegality taints the entire contract and the entire transaction is illegal and unenforceable.id.at,d.
in this case,we similarly conclude that the summary judgment for blasi must be reversed because of the possibility that under the doctrine of severability of contracts,marathon might be permitted to recover the strong medicine commission because not only did the complaint allege that marathon provided lawful personal manager services neither prohibited nor regulated by the act,but blasi produced no evidence in the trial court linking the procurement of her strong medicine employment contract to any illegal activity by marathon.
background 
in december,marathon and blasi entered into an oral contract the contract or personal management contract for marathon to serve as blasi personal manager in exchange for a percentage of blasi entertainment employment income.during the course of the personal management contract,blasi professional appearances included a television pilot,a film noriega god favorite,and a television series strong medicine.blasi allegedly reneged on her agreement to pay marathon a percent commission from her strong medicine employment contract,which allegedly blasi unilaterally reduced to percent before ceasing payment altogether.blasi eventually terminated the contract in the fall of,stating that her talent agent,michael kelly,who had served as her agent throughout the term of the management contract with marathon,was going to become her new personal manager.
on february,marathon filed the present action against blasi for breach of oral contract,quantum meruit,false promise,and unfair business practices,seeking to recover the unpaid strong medicine commission.marathon alleged that it had provided blasi with lawful personal manager services by providing the down payment on her home,paying the salary of her business manager,providing her with professional and personal advice,and paying her travel expenses.
after obtaining a stay of the action,blasi initiated a labor commission proceeding alleging that marathon had violated the act by soliciting and procuring employment for blasi without a talent agency license the commissioner found that marathon had violated the act and,without considering the possibility of severing the legal and illegal parts of the contract,invalidated the entire contract as an illegal contract for unlicensed talent agency services.
marathon appealed the commissioner ruling to the superior court for a trial de novo marathon also amended its complaint to include several declaratory relief claims challenging the constitutionality of the act the constitutional claims.marathon alleged that the sanction of invalidating the contracts of personal managers who solicit or procure employment for artists without a talent agency license,violates the managers rights to due process,equal protection,and free speech under the state and federal constitutions.
blasi moved for summary judgment and,alternatively,summary adjudication of the complaint based upon the theory that marathon licensing violation had invalidated the entire personal management contract.blasi submitted excerpts from the labor commission hearing transcript as evidence that marathon had violated the act by soliciting or procuring employment for blasi without a talent agency license blasi did not argue or produce evidence that marathon had illegally procured the strong medicine employment contract.
the superior court granted blasi motion for summary judgment and invalidated marathon personal management contract as an illegal contract for unlicensed talent agency services in violation of the act marathon appeals from the summary judgment and order denying its for summary adjudication of the constitutional claims.
discussion 
personal managers primarily advise,counsel,direct,and coordinate the development of the artist career.they advise in both business and personal matters,frequently lend money to young artists,and serve as spokespersons for the artists.citation.park deftones th,d.
only licensed talent agencies may procure or attempt to procure artistic employment or engagements for artists.unlike talent agencies,personal managers are not covered by the act or any other statutory licensing scheme.waisbren peppercorn productions,th,d waisbren.but if a personal manager even incidentally performs the occupation of a talent agency by soliciting or procuring artistic employment or engagements for an artist,the personal manager must comply with the act licensing requirement.id.at,d.
the fact that a personal manager must comply with the act licensing requirements before engaging in the regulated activities of a talent agency does not necessarily mean,however,that a contract for personal manager services must be completely invalidated if the personal manager commits even a single violation of the act.under the doctrine of severability of contracts,it is possible that marathon,despite allegedly having violated the act,may recover a commission on an artist employment contract that was legally procured.we therefore reverse because there are triable issues of material fact regarding the severability of the parties agreement 
contracts made in violation of a business licensing statute are not necessarily unenforceable 
no blanket prohibition exists against enforcing contracts made in violation of a business licensing statute.both equity and the law disfavor forfeiture.people far west ins.th,d.the supreme court has stated that in determining whether to enforce a contract made in violation of a business licensing statute,courts must consider whether the forfeiture resulting from unenforceability is disproportionately harsh considering the nature of the illegality.lewis queen ball sons cal d.the supreme court has also warned that courts must be wary of transforming a protective licensing scheme intended for the public safety into an unwarranted shield for the avoidance of a just obligation.gatti highland park builders,cal d.
the act does not expressly prohibit the enforcement of contracts made by unlicensed talent agencies.unlicensed contractors,real estate brokers,and insurance adjusters,on the other hand,are all expressly prohibited by statute from suing to recover on contracts made in violation of their respective business licensing statutes.bus.nevertheless,in gatti,the supreme court enforced a construction contract despite the plaintiffs technical violation of the contractor licensing statute because,even though the plaintiffs lacked a required additional partnership license,both plaintiffs were individually licensed and,during the course of the contract,were jointly licensed with a third person.
in wood krepps cal,the supreme court enforced a promissory note despite the plaintiff pawnbroker violation of a municipal business licensing statute that,like the act,did not expressly prohibit the enforcement of contracts made in violation of the statute.the supreme court stated that there is no law in this state making the business of loaning money on personal property illegal.it is a legitimate branch of commercial business which the state has only regulated to the extent of fixing the maximum rate of interest the ordinance does not pretend to prescribe or prohibit the business the ordinance does not declare that a contract made by any one in the conduct of the various businesses for which licenses are provided to be procured under the ordinances,shall,if a license is not obtained,be invalid nor is there any provision therein indicating in the slightest that this failure was intended to affect in any degree the right of contract.id.at.
b.the doctrine of severability of contracts 
consistent with the general rule in both equity and law that forfeiture is disfavored,the law of severability of contracts provides where a contract has several distinct objects,of which one at least is lawful,and one at least is unlawful,in whole or in part,the contract is void as to the latter and valid as to the rest.
in determining whether to apply the doctrine of severability of contracts,the courts must consider the main objective of the parties agreement.if the illegality is collateral to and severable from the main purpose of the contract,then severance is appropriate.abramson juniper networks,th,d.if,however,the taint of illegality so permeates the entire agreement that it can not be removed by severance or restriction but only by reformation or augmentation,the courts must invalidate the entire agreement.id.at,d.
the overarching consideration in determining whether to allow a severance of an agreement is whether the interests of justice would be furthered by severing the agreement.little auto stiegler,cal th,d.a severance is more likely to be granted if separating the legal and illegal parts of the agreement would conserve a contractual relationship without condoning an illegal scheme and prevent parties from gaining undeserved benefit or suffering undeserved detriment as a result of voiding the entire when there has been full or partial performance of the contract.citations.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d.
in general,contracts made in violation of business licensing statutes may be severed if it is appropriate to do so.as we mentioned earlier,the supreme court reversed a summary adjudication in birbrower,supra,cal th at,d,based on the possibility of severing an attorney fee contract of a new york law firm that had practiced law in california illegally without a license under business and professions code section.because california does not regulate legal services provided outside california and the firm had provided some services in new york,birbrower stated that notwithstanding an illegal consideration,courts may sever the illegal portion of the contract from the rest of the agreement.citation.birbrower,supra,cal th at,d.it is only i f the court is unable to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful parts of the agreement and the illegality taints the entire contract,that the entire transaction is illegal and unenforceable.citation.ibid.
similarly,in johnson mattox d,the appellate court upheld the severance of an unlicensed contractor construction contract made in violation of business and professions code section.that statute expressly prohibits the enforcement of construction contracts of unlicensed contractors.even though the unlicensed contractor in johnson could not recover its illegal construction fees,it was permitted under the doctrine of severability of contracts to recover for the lawful sale of goods that were not fixtures and were not related to the illegal construction activities.
even contracts that are made in violation of public policy may be severed if it is appropriate to do so.in whorton dillingham d,for example,the appellate court found that a possibility existed of severing the parties marvin agreement marvin marvin cal d,because although the agreement expressly relied upon some illegal consideration the couple sexual relationship,the agreement also relied upon other legal consideration independent of the sexual relationship being a chauffeur,bodyguard,secretary,and partner and counselor in real estate investments.
blasi summary judgment must be reversed because the possibility of severing the strong medicine commission exists in this case 
in this case,the parties entered into a lawful contract for personal manager services that are not regulated by the act.the complaint alleged that marathon lawfully provided personal manager services such as providing the down payment on blasi home,paying the salary of her business manager,providing professional and personal advice,and covering her travel expenses.accordingly,the parties contract had at least one distinct and lawful purpose,which was to provide personal manager services.
in moving for summary judgment based on the theory that,because of marathon unlicensed talent agency activities,the contract was completely illegal and unenforceable,blasi produced no evidence linking her strong medicine employment contract to any illegal activity by marathon.without such evidence,the possibility exists,as it did in birbrower,supra,cal th,d,that the legal and illegal portions of the contract might be severable.it is only i f the court is unable to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful parts of the agreement and the illegality taints the entire contract,that the entire transaction is illegal and unenforceable.citation.id.at,d.
blasi objects to any consideration on appeal of the doctrine of severability of contracts because it was not raised below.the general rule that precludes consideration of a new theory on appeal does not apply,however,where the issue before the appellate court is a question of law.california school of culinary arts lujan th,d.because whether the doctrine of severability of contracts potentially applies to the facts that were presented below is a question of law,the general rule precluding the consideration of a new theory on appeal does not apply.
d.the availability of severance will not
