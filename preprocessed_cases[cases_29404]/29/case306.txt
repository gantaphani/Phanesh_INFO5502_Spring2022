this appeal presents the question of whether distributors of computer networking software may be held contributorily or vicariously liable for copyright infringements by users.under the circumstances presented by this case,we conclude that the defendants are not liable for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement and affirm the district court partial grant of summary judgment.
background 
from the advent of the player piano,every new means of reproducing sound has struck a dissonant chord with musical copyright owners,often resulting in federal litigation.this appeal is the latest reprise of that recurring conflict,and one of a continuing series of lawsuits between the recording industry and distributors of computer software.
the plaintiffs in the consolidated cases copyright owners are songwriters,music publishers,and motion picture studios who,by their own description,own or control the vast majority of copyrighted motion pictures and sound recordings in the united states.defendants grokster and streamcast networks,software distributors are companies that freely distribute software that allows users to share computer files with each other,including digitized music and motion pictures.the copyright owners allege that over of the files exchanged through use of the software offered by the software distributors involves copyrighted material,of which is owned by the copyright owners.thus,the copyright owners argue,the software distributors are liable for vicarious and contributory copyright infringement pursuant to,for which the copyright owners are entitled to monetary and injunctive relief.the district court granted the software distributors partial summary judgment as to liability arising from present activities and certified the resolved questions for appeal pursuant to.b.studios,grokster,d grokster i.
to analyze the legal issues properly,a rudimentary of the software at issue is because file sharing differs from typical internet use.in a routine internet transaction,a user will connect via the internet with a website to obtain information or transact business.in computer terms,the personal computer used by the consumer is considered the client and the computer that hosts the web page is the server.the client is obtaining information from a centralized source,namely the server.
in a distribution network,the information available for access does not reside on a central server.no one computer contains all of the information that is available to all of the users.rather,each computer makes information available to every other computer in the network.in other words,in a network,each computer is both a server and a client.
because the information is decentralized in a network,the software must provide some method of cataloguing the available information so that users may access it.the software operates by connecting,via the internet,to other users of the same or similar software.at any given moment,the network consists of other users of similar or the same software online at that time.thus,an index of files available for sharing is a critical component of networks.
at present,there are three different methods of indexing a centralized indexing system,maintaining a list of available files on one or more centralized servers a completely decentralized indexing system,in which each computer maintains a list of files available on that computer only and a supernode system,in which a select number of computers act as indexing servers 
the first napster system employed a proprietary centralized indexing software architecture in which a collective index of available files was maintained on servers it owned and operated.a user who was seeking to obtain a digital copy of a recording would transmit a search request to the napster server,the software would conduct a text search of the centralized index for matching files,and the search results would be transmitted to the requesting user.if the results showed that another napster user was logged on to the napster server and offering to share the requested recording,the requesting user could then connect directly with the offering user and download the music file 
under a decentralized index model,each user maintains an index of only those files that the user wishes to make available to other network users.under this model,the software broadcasts a search request to all the computers on the network and a search of the individual index files is conducted,with the collective results routed back to the requesting computer.this model is employed by the gnutella software system and is the type of architecture now used by defendant streamcast.gnutella is software,meaning that the source code is either in the public domain or is copyrighted and distributed under an license that allows modification of the software,subject to some restrictions.
the third type of network at present is the supernode model,in which a number of select computers on the network are designated as indexing servers.the user initiating a file search connects with the most easily accessible supernode,which conducts the search of its index and supplies the user with the results.any computer on the network could function as a supernode if it met the technical requirements,such as processing speed.the supernode architecture was developed by kazaa bv,a dutch company,and licensed under the name of fasttrack technology 
both grokster and streamcast initially used the fasttrack technology.however,streamcast had a licensing dispute with kazaa,and now uses its own branded morpheus version of the gnutella code.streamcast users connect to other users of software both grokster and streamcast distribute their separate softwares free of charge.once downloaded onto a user computer,the software enables the user to participate in the respective networks over the internet 
users of the software share digital audio,video,picture,and text files.some of the files are copyrighted and shared without authorization,others are not copyrighted such as public domain works,and still others are copyrighted,but the copyright owners have authorized software users in networks to distribute their work.the copyright owners assert,without serious contest by the software distributors,that the vast majority of the files are exchanged illegally in violation of copyright law.
ii.analysis 
the question of direct copyright infringement is not at issue in this case.rather,the copyright owners contend that the software distributors are liable for the copyright infringement of the software users.the copyright owners rely on the two recognized theories of secondary copyright liability contributory copyright infringement and vicarious copyright infringement.ellison robertson,cir.we agree with the district court well reasoned analysis that the software distributors current activities do not give rise to liability under either theory.
contributory copyright infringement 
the three elements required to prove a defendant liable under the theory of contributory copyright infringement are direct infringement by a primary infringer,knowledge of the infringement,and material contribution to the infringement.id.the element of direct infringement is undisputed in this case.
any examination of contributory copyright infringement must be guided by the seminal case of sony of america universal city studios,d.in,the supreme court held that the sale of video tape recorders could not give rise to contributory copyright infringement liability even though the defendant knew the machines were being used to commit infringement.in analyzing the contours of contributory copyright infringement,the supreme court drew on the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law.id.at.under that doctrine,it would be sufficient to defeat a claim of contributory copyright infringement if the defendant showed that the product was capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.in applying this doctrine,the court found that because sony betamax video tape recorder was capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses,constructive knowledge of the infringing activity could not be imputed from the fact that sony knew the recorders,as a general matter,could be used for infringement.id.at.
in napster i,we construed to apply to the knowledge element of contributory copyright infringement.napster i held that if a defendant could show that its product was capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses,then constructive knowledge of the infringement could not be imputed.rather,if substantial noninfringing use was shown,the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files napster i,at see also a m records napster,cir napster ii 
thus,in order to analyze the required element of knowledge of infringement,we must first determine what level of knowledge to require.if the product at issue is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses,then the copyright owner need only show that the defendant had constructive knowledge of the infringement.on the other hand,if the product at issue is capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses,then the copyright owner must demonstrate that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files and failed to act on that knowledge to prevent infringement.see napster i,at.
in this case,the district court found it undisputed that the software distributed by each defendant was capable of substantial noninfringing uses.grokster i,d at.a careful examination of the record indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.indeed,the software distributors submitted numerous declarations by persons who permit their work to be distributed via the software,or who use the software to distribute public domain works.see id.one striking example provided by the software distributors is the popular band wilco,whose record company had declined to release one of its albums on the basis that it had no commercial potential.wilco repurchased the work from the record company and made the album available for free downloading,both from its own website and through the software user networks.the result sparked widespread interest and,as a result,wilco received another recording contract.other recording artists have debuted their works through the user networks.indeed,the record indicates that thousands of other musical groups have authorized free distribution of their music through the internet.in addition to music,the software has been used to share thousands of public domain literary works made available through project gutenberg as well as historic public domain films released by the prelinger archive.in short,from the evidence presented,the district court quite correctly concluded that the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses and,therefore,that the doctrine applied.
the copyright owners submitted no evidence that could contradict these declarations.rather,the copyright owners argue that the evidence establishes that the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement.this argument misapprehends the sony standard as construed in napster i,which emphasized that in order for limitations imposed by sony to apply,a product need only be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.napster i,at 
in this case,the software distributors have not only shown that their products are capable of substantial noninfringing uses but that the uses have commercial viability.thus,applying napster i,napster ii,and to the record,the district court correctly concluded that the software distributors had established that their products were capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.therefore,the district correctly reasoned,the software distributors could not be held liable for constructive knowledge of infringement,and the copyright owners were required to show that the software distributors had reasonable knowledge of specific infringement to satisfy the threshold knowledge requirement.
having determined that the reasonable knowledge of specific infringement requirement applies here,we must then decide whether the copyright owners have raised sufficient genuine issues of material fact to satisfy that higher standard.as the district court correctly concluded,the time at which such knowledge is obtained is significant.because contributory copyright infringement requires knowledge and material contribution,the copyright owners were required to establish that the software distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contribute d to the infringement,and fail ed to act upon that information.grokster i,d at citing napster i,at.as the district court correctly observed,and as we explain further in our discussion of material contribution,plaintiffs notices of infringing conduct are irrelevant,because they arrive when defendants do nothing to facilitate,and can not do anything to stop,the alleged infringement of specific copyrighted content.id.at.see napster ii,at p laintiffs bear the burden to provide notice to napster of copyrighted works and files containing such works available on the napster system before napster has the duty to disable access to the offending content.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.
in the context of this case,the software design is of great import.as we have discussed,the software at issue in napster i and napster ii employed a centralized set of servers that maintained an index of available files.in contrast,under both streamcast decentralized,network and grokster,supernode,network,no central index is maintained.indeed,at present,neither streamcast nor grokster maintains control over index files.as the district court observed,even if the software distributors closed their doors and deactivated all computers within their control,users of their products could continue sharing files with little or no interruption.grokster i,d at.
therefore,we agree with the district court that the software distributors were entitled to partial summary judgment on the element of knowledge.
material contribution 
we also agree with the district court that with respect to their current software distribution and related activities,defendants do not materially contribute to copyright infringement.
in napster i,we found material contribution after reciting the district court factual finding that napster is an integrated service.at.we agree d that napster provides the site and facilities for direct infringement.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we further cited the holding of netcom,which found substantial participation based on netcom failure to cancel a user infringing message and thereby stop an infringing copy from being distributed worldwide.id.quoting religious tech.ctr.netcom communication,alteration in original.we have also found material contribution where a defendant operated a swap meet at which infringing products were sold and provided utilities,parking,and advertising.fonovisa,cherry auction,cir.
as indicated by the record,the software distributors do not provide the site and facilities for infringement,and do not otherwise materially contribute to direct infringement.infringing messages or file indices do not reside on defendants computers,nor do defendants have the ability to suspend user accounts.grokster i,d at.
while material contribution can be established through provision of site and facilities for infringement,followed by a failure to stop specific instances of infringement once knowledge of those infringements is acquired,the software distributors have not provided the site and facilities for infringement in the first place.if the software distributors were true access providers,failure to disable that access after acquiring specific knowledge of a user infringement might be material contribution.netcom.at.or,if the software distributors stored files or indices,failure to delete the offending files or offending index listings might be material contribution.napster i,at.however,the software distributors here are not access providers,and they do not provide file storage and index maintenance.rather,it is the users of the software who,by connecti
