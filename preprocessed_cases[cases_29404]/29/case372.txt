background 
the present case concerns technology for the synchronization of television information with information from the internet.actv owns the,and,which disclose and claim various aspects of this technology.each of these patents issued from applications that depend,ultimately,from a common parent application.as such,the written descriptions of the patents are,with some modifications,substantially the same.
the patent specification discloses a system that combines the rich visual capabilities of television with the vast resources of the internet.patent,ll.as distinguished from a prior art system known as intercast,which embedded internet content within the video blanking interval vbi of an analog video signal,the system disclosed in the patent uses the vbi merely to transmit an identifier known as a uniform resource locator url,specifying the location of content on the internet.id.at,ll.the vbi is the short period of time when the electron beam of a television cathode ray tube is turned off and redirected back to the top left corner of the television screen in preparation for the display of the next image.because video information is not being sent during this interval,the television may receive other data,such as text.in the intercast system,the internet content transmitted during the vbi must be stripped down because the relatively short duration of the blanking interval limits the effective bandwidth limiting the amount of information that may be sent.id.at,ll.in addition,intercast requires special hardware both to embed the internet content in the vbi and to extract the content once it is received by the end user.id.at,ll.
in contrast,the system is a much more flexible,but less complex system.id.at,ll.the information sent by the system is not the information content itself,but rather a short text identifies and locates the content on the internet.thus,the system uses only a small amount of the vbi bandwidth and does not require specialized hardware to embed or extract the internet content.id.at,ll.at the desired time and using the received url,the system uses certain programs to retrieve the desired content from the internet.id.at,ll.in an alternative embodiment,as disclosed in the patent,the system does not place urls in the vbi,but instead,enables broadcasters to transmit to end users a link file containing a list of url internet addresses.patent,ll.in another embodiment,as disclosed in the patent,the urls are encoded within a digital video signal and received either by digital cable boxes or digital televisions.patent,ll,ll.
actv initiated an action against disney,asserting that disney enhanced tv etv system infringes claims of the patent claims,and of the patent and claims,and of the patent.claim of the patent is illustrative of the asserted claims and recites,with disputed terms underlined 
a system for presenting integrated television programming and corresponding related internet information segments obtained from web sites on the internet,the system comprising 
a means for receiving programming,wherein the programming contains a video signal,an audio signal and one or more uniform resource locators,wherein the uniform resource locators specify one or more internet addresses of the information segments which relate specifically to the content of the video and audio signals of the programming 
a means for decoding,connected to the receiving means,the uniform resource locators to determine the specified internet addresses 
a controller means,connected to the decoding means,for interpreting the uniform resource locators 
a web browser,connected to the decoding means and the controller means,for sending message requests to specific internet sites located at the internet addresses corresponding to the uniform resource locators and consequently receiving the one or more requested internet information segments residing at the determined internet addresses,the browser retrieves the requested internet information segments under the direction and control of the controller means and 
a display means,connected to the controller and receiving means,for presenting the video and audio signals concurrently with the internet information segments 
whereby the internet information segments are synchronized to the video signal and displayed at predetermined times during the program.
each of the claims asserted by actv includes at least a means for receiving a url and a means for decoding the url.each asserted claim,except for claim of the patent,also contains a means for interpreting the url.
on may,the district court issued a markman memorandum detailing its construction of thirteen disputed claim terms.actv,walt disney,d markman memorandum.the district court noted that all of the asserted claims are drafted with certain limitations in format as defined in.id.at.although the district court did not explicitly identify the functions associated with each of the claim limitations,it identified a general function of the claims as synchroniz ing video and tv programming with web pages in ways corresponding to the kinds of structures described in the specification.id.the district court construed the functional terms of two of the means the decoding and interpreting clauses.the district court construed decoding as the extraction or retrieval of data from any data necessarily a video or audio on a predetermined format or encoding stream.id.at.it construed interpreting as any kind of analyzing and translating utilized to enable the browser to effectively retrieve the relevant web page.id.at.
within the text of the decoding and interpreting as well as receiving clauses,the district court construed uniform resource locator,or url,as the complete address of a site on the internet specifying both a protocol type and a resource location.id.at.the district court determined that an address consisting of a protocol type such as http and a resource location such as is known as an absolute url.id.it also determined that,in contrast,a url consisting of less than a protocol type and resource locator is known as a relative url.id.the district court then concluded that the term url,as contemplated by the patent,includes only absolute urls.id.
relevant to the discussion that follows,the district court construed internet address to mean a particular host on the internet,specified by a uniform resource locator that is unique to that host,and internet information segments to mean parts into which information on the internet is commonly divided,such as a web page.id.at.
based on the district court construction of the term uniform resource locator in the functional statements of the claim limitations,disney moved for summary judgment,arguing that its etv system transmits only file names,not absolute urls.because absolute urls are not transmitted,the etv system necessarily does not receive,decode,or interpret urls as defined by the district court.in a very short memorandum order,the district court concluded that disney etv system does not perform the identical functions of the asserted claims,etv does not receive or decode absolute urls,and thus can not literally infringe.order,d at.in addition,the court foreclosed recourse to the doctrine of equivalents for these limitations because the presence of means to receive and to decode full internet addresses is a fundamental difference between the two systems.id.finding no infringement,either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents,the district court granted disney motion for summary judgment and dismissed actv complaint.id.actv appeals portions of the district court claim construction and its grant of summary judgment in favor of disney.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.

we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.kemco sales,control papers.we make an independent evaluation of whether the standards of summary judgment have been met.id.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c anderson liberty lobby,d.
in answering the question of infringement,a court conducts a analysis.generation ii orthotics,medical,gen ii.first,the claims are construed to determine their scope.id.second,a court determines whether the accused device falls within the scope of the claims as construed.id.claim construction,the first step,is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.cybor fas,en banc.the determination of the claimed function and corresponding structure of a claim limitation is a question of law,reviewed de novo.kemco sales,at.
in construing a limitation drafted in accordance with,the recited function within that limitation must first be identified.gen ii,at.then,the written description must be examined to determine the structure that corresponds to and performs that function.id.when identifying the claimed function,this court has noted that,does not permit limitation of a claim by adopting a function different from that explicitly recited in the claim.id.correctly identifying the claimed function is critical,because an error in identification of the function can improperly alter the identification of the structure corresponding to that function.id.
in the present case,neither party disputes that the receiving means,decoding means,and interpreting means claim limitations of the patents are written in form,as defined in.actv argues that the district court construed the term url too narrowly,as encompassing only absolute urls.it thus contends that the district court erroneously restricted the receiving,decoding,and interpreting functions of the claim limitations.actv asserts that the term url properly should be construed to encompass both absolute and relative urls.disney argues that the district court correctly considered the evidence and properly construed url as encompassing only absolute urls.if this court adopts actv broad interpretation of url,disney argues that summary judgment of is still proper on the alternative ground that the district court misconstrued the decoding and interpreting means claim limitations.
as described above,claim of the patent recites,inter alia,a means for receiving one or more uniform resource locators,wherein the uniform resource locators specify one or more internet addresses of the information segments which relate specifically to the content of the video and audio signals of the received programming.the decoding means limitation in this claim reads means for decoding the uniform resource locators to determine the specified internet addresses,and the interpreting means claim limitation recites a controller means for interpreting the uniform resource locators.although the term url appears in a slightly different context in the functional statement of each limitation,the district court determined that it had the same meaning throughout the asserted claims of all of the asserted patents.because of this,the district court disposed of the case wholly on its construction and analysis of the term url,concluding that this was a simple issue that resolves the case.order at.we begin our analysis with the construction of this critical term.
first and foremost,the analytical focus of claim construction must begin,and remain centered,on the language of the claims themselves.digital,telegenix,quoting interactive gift express,compuserve.because the claim language is chosen by the patentee to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of the invention,the claim terms chosen by the patentee carry a presumption that they mean what they say and have the ordinary meaning that would be attributed to those words by persons skilled in the relevant art.digital,at.in the absence of an express intent to impart a novel meaning to the claim terms,the words are presumed to take on the ordinary and customary meanings attributed to them by those of ordinary skill in the art.see,teleflex,ficosa am.the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term may be determined by reviewing a variety of sources,including the claims themselves,see process control hydreclaim,dictionaries and treatises.digital,at and the written description,the drawings,and the prosecution history,see,demarini sports,worth.while certain terms may be at the center of the claim construction debate,the context of the surrounding words of the claim also must be considered in determining the ordinary and customary meaning of those terms.see,llc intuitive surgical,converse.
actv,in arguing that the ordinary and customary meaning of the term url encompasses both relative and absolute urls,provides a document entitled request for comments rfc,from the world wide web consortium,an industry working group,as authoritative support for this position.rfc discusses both absolute and relative urls,noting that a relative url is a shortened form of that for an absolute url and that a relative url is a compact representation of the location of a resource.in response,disney offers an earlier document entitled request for comments rfc,from the same organization,in support of its argument that url encompasses only absolute urls.specifically,rfc indicates that a url has a typical syntax requiring both a protocol type and a resource locator.rfc also distinguishes between relative links,in which the expression of a related resource is described in the same place as this one except with the following relative path,and general url syntax,which provides an abstract identification of the resource location.
as this court has previously noted,
d ictionaries,encyclopedias and treatises,publicly available at the time the patent is issued,are objective resources that serve as reliable sources of information on the established meanings that would have been attributed to the terms of the claims by those of skill in the art.such references are unbiased reflections of common understanding not influenced by expert testimony or events subsequent to the fixing of the intrinsic record by the grant of the patent,not colored by the motives of the parties,and not inspired by litigation.indeed,these materials may be the most meaningful sources of information to aid judges in better understanding both the technology and the terminology used by those skilled in the art to describe the technology.

as a preliminary matter,we consider whether the rfcs presented by the parties rise to the level of unbiased,contemporaneous reflection of the common understanding of the technical terms in question as to be considered a reliable source of information on the meaning attributed to those terms by those skilled in the art.the purpose of the organization is to lead the world wide web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability.about the world wide web consortium,at last visited,website.to this end,members of including various industry groups,manufacturers,and others,each with their own conceivable interests in the agenda are involved in developing standards to describe the various building blocks of the internet.id.both rfc and rfc are working papers generated during standardization discussions by one subset,or working group,within.see,uniform resource locators rfc,at http et eds.this document specifies an internet standards track protocol.the purpose of the rfcs is thus to collect commentary and to select language to facilitate a common understanding,or to select a standard,from a variety of competing technologies and vocabularies and from a variety of potentially competing interests.indeed,the acronym rfc
