we are asked to decide whether defendant mark towle infringed dc comics exclusive rights under a copyright when he built and sold replicas of the batmobile,as it appeared in the television show batman and the film batman.holy copyright law,batman 
dc comics dc is the publisher and copyright owner of comic books featuring the story of the character,batman.since his first comic book appearance in,the caped crusader has protected gotham city from villains with the help of his sidekick robin the boy wonder,his utility belt,and of course,the batmobile.
originally introduced in the batman comic books in,the batmobile is a fictional,automobile that batman employs as his primary mode of transportation.the batmobile has varied in appearance over the years,but its name and key characteristics as batman personal vehicle have remained consistent.over the past eight decades,the comic books have continually depicted the batmobile as possessing external features,ready to leap into action to assist batman in his fight against gotham most dangerous villains,and equipped with futuristic weaponry and technology that is years ahead of anything else on wheels.
since its creation in the comic books,the batmobile has also been depicted in numerous television programs and motion pictures.two of these depictions are relevant to this case the television series batman,starring adam west,and the motion picture batman,starring michael keaton.
the batman television series was the product of a licensing agreement between dc predecessor,national periodical publications,national periodical and the american broadcasting company abc.in,national periodical entered into a licensing agreement with abc the abc agreement in which it granted abc an exclusive license to produce a series of television programs based upon the literary property consisting of the comic book and comic strip stories entitled batman including the characters therein.this exclusive right included the right to translate,adapt,or arrange the batman literary property to such extent as abc may desire in the making of the television programs,and the right to secure copyrights in the television programs produced.the agreement also provided that a ll rights in the property not specifically granted to abc are hereby reserved to and may be exercised by national at all times during the term of this agreement except as otherwise expressly stated in the agreement.national periodical reserved rights included a ll rights of publication,and the exclusive merchandising rights to all products manufactured or distributed under the name of any character in the batman comic books.
under this agreement,abc through a series of agreements produced the television show starring adam west as batman.in addition to batman,robin,and the use of visual onomatopoeia that flashed on screen during fight scenes pow boff thwack the television series featured the batmobile.the design of the batmobile did not directly copy any iterations of the batmobile as it appeared in the comic books.as in the comic books,however,the batmobile in the television show maintained a appearance and was equipped with weaponry and technology 
in,dc again licensed its rights in the batman literary property,this time to batman productions,bpi.in the agreement the bpi agreement,dc granted bpi the exclusive right to create a motion picture based on the property,which was defined to include t he names,titles,fictional locations and fictional conveyances as depicted and contained in the comic magazines published by dc,which are identifiable with or associated with the fictional character known as batman,such as that certain conveyance known as the batmobile.the bpi agreement also granted bpi the right to adapt,use,modify,or alter the property for the purpose of producing the motion picture.like the abc agreement,the bpi agreement provided that a ll rights in the property not specifically granted to bpi under the agreement are reserved to dc and may be exercised by dc at all times without any limitation or restriction whatsover except as specifically set forth herein.these reserved rights included a ll rights of publication in and to the property,as well as a ll merchandising rights in products manufactured or distributed under the name of or using a representation of batman or any other character or thing included in the property or under a name which incorporates any phrase,clause or expression used in dc comic strips or comic magazines 
bpi subsequently its rights to warner,who eventually through a number of additional agreements produced the motion picture batman,starring michael keaton as batman.like the television series,the motion picture featured a batmobile that was physically distinct from the batmobile portrayed in the comic books and the television series.nonetheless,the batmobile as portrayed in the motion picture retained a physical appearance and was again equipped with futuristic technology and weaponry 
defendant mark towle produces replicas of the batmobile as it appeared in both the television show and motion picture as part of his business at gotham garage,where he manufactures and sells replicas of automobiles featured in motion pictures or television programs.towle concedes that these replicas copy the designs of the batmobile as depicted on television and in the motion picture,though they do not copy every feature.towle then sells these vehicles for approximately to avid car collectors who know the entire history of the batmobile.towle also sells kits that allow customers to modify their cars to look like the batmobile,as it appeared in the television show and the motion picture.
before dc brought this lawsuit,towle advertised each replica as the batmobile,and used the domain name to market his business.he also advertised that the replicas included such features as custom bat insignias,wheel bats,and a bat steering wheel,and would attract attention due to the fame of the batmobile.by his own admission,towle is not authorized by dc to manufacture or sell any products bearing dc copyright or trademark.
in may,dc filed this action against towle,alleging,among other things,causes of action for copyright infringement,trademark infringement,and unfair competition arising from towle manufacture and sale of the batmobile replicas towle denied that he had infringed upon dc copyright.he claimed that the batmobile as it appeared in the television show and motion picture was not subject to copyright protection.alternatively,towle argued that dc did not own the copyright in the batmobile as it appeared in either production.towle also asserted the affirmative defense of laches.the parties subsequently filed cross motions for partial summary judgment as to dc trademark,copyright,and unfair competition claims,and as to towle laches defense.
in a published order,the district court granted in part and denied in part dc motion for summary judgment,and denied towle cross motion for summary judgment.dc comics towle,d.first,the district court held that the batmobile was a character entitled to copyright protection.in reaching this conclusion,the district court made a number of findings.among other things,it found that the batmobile is known by one consistent name that identifies it as batman personal vehicle,and,although some of its physical traits have changed over time,several have remained consistent,including its gadgets and weaponry,motifs,and its jet black color.additionally,the district court found that the batmobile is always depicted as being swift,cunning,strong and elusive,and is even portrayed as a superhero and batman sidekick,if not an extension of batman own persona.
second,the district court held that dc maintained a copyright in the batmobile as it appeared in both the television show and the motion picture based on its ownership of the merchandising rights.alternatively,the district court concluded that dc owns a copyright in the batmobile as it appeared in each production because the appearance of the batmobile in each production was derived from the batmobile depicted in dc comic books.finally,the district court concluded that towle infringed upon dc copyright because he copied the batmobile as it appeared in the and productions in his replicas.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment on the copyright infringement claim to dc.
the district court also granted summary judgment to dc on towle affirmative laches defense to the trademark infringement claim.the court found that towle admitted that he knew of the batman property and the various bat emblems and symbols,and did not dispute that he intentionally copied the designs of the batmobile as it appeared in the television show and motion picture,which included dc batman trademarks.he also intentionally referred to his replicas as batmobiles.therefore,the court concluded that towle acted in bad faith and intentionally copied dc trademarks so as to associate his products with the batman films and television show.
finally,the court denied dc summary judgment motion on towle laches defense to the copyright infringement claim because it determined that there was a genuine dispute of fact as to whether towle was aware that copying the batmobile as it appeared in the television show and motion picture constituted copyright infringement.
after the district court issued its decision,the parties entered into a joint stipulation in which they agreed that the district court would enter a judgment against towle on dc copyright infringement and other claims.they also agreed that,except as provided in the stipulation,all claims were to be dismissed with prejudice.the district court entered a judgment consistent with this stipulation on february,and towle timely appealed.
because the parties entered into a stipulation that finalized the district court order,we have jurisdiction over this appeal under.see dannenberg software toolworks,cir.
in order to prevail on its claim for copyright infringement,dc must prove that it owns a copyright in the batmobile as it appeared in the television series and movie,and that towle infringed that copyright by creating unauthorized replicas.see entm t research,genesis creative,cir.
to the batmobile 
we begin with the question whether the batmobile,as it appears in the comic books,television series,and motion picture,is entitled to copyright protection.see ets hokin skyy spirits,cir.in the context of copyright law,where,as here,the question requires us to consider legal concepts in the mix of fact and law and to exercise judgment about the values that animate legal principles,the question should be classified as one of law and reviewed de novo.harper house,thomas nelson,cir.
courts have recognized that copyright protection extends not only to an original work as a whole,but also to sufficiently distinctive elements,like comic book characters,contained within the work.halicki films,llc sanderson sales,cir.although comic book characters are not listed in the copyright act,we have long held that such characters are afforded copyright protection.see walt disney productions air pirates,cir.in air pirates,for instance,we considered a number of subversive comic books that portrayed disney characters as being active participants in a free thinking,promiscuous,drug ingesting counterculture.id.at.in holding that the disney characters were copyrightable and that disney copyright in those characters had been infringed,we distinguished a prior decision suggesting that literary characters ordinarily are not copyrightable,id.at citing warner.pictures,columbia broad,cir,on the grounds that a comic book character has physical as well as conceptual qualities and is more likely to contain some unique elements of expression than a purely literary character.id citing detective comics,bruns publications,cir holding that comic book characters are copyrightable fleischer studios freundlich,cir same king features syndicate fleischer,cir same.we subsequently held that characters in a television series or a motion picture may also be entitled to copyright protection.see olson national broadcasting,cir.
not every comic book,television,or motion picture character is entitled to copyright protection.we have held that copyright protection is available only for characters that are especially distinctive.halicki,at.to meet this standard,a character must be sufficiently delineated and display consistent,widely identifiable traits.rice fox broadcasting,cir citing toho,william morrow,d.cal godzilla.a masked magician dressed in standard magician garb whose role is limited to performing and revealing the magic tricks,for example,is not an especially distinct character differing from an ordinary magician in a manner that warrants copyright protection.id.further,characters that have been lightly sketched and lack descriptions may not merit copyright protection.olson,at.
we have previously determined that an automotive character can be copyrightable.see halicki,at.in halicki,we considered whether eleanor,a car that appeared in both the original and remake motion picture gone in seconds,could be entitled to copyright protection as a character.id.at.considering eleanor persistent attributes in both the original and remake of gone in seconds,we concluded that eleanor met some of the key factors necessary to qualify for copyright protection.id.at.we first noted that eleanor was more like a comic book character than a literary character given eleanor physical as well as conceptual qualities.id.we also stated that eleanor displays consistent,widely identifiable traits and is especially distinctive.id.alteration,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.we gave several examples of these traits.first,we noted that i n both films,the thefts of the other cars go largely as planned,but whenever the main human character tries to steal eleanor,circumstances invariably become complicated.id.second,we noted that in the original,the main character says i getting tired of stealing this eleanor car,and in the remake the main character refers to his history with eleanor.id.despite this evidence of distinctive traits,we were sensitive to the fact that the district court had implied that eleanor was deserving of copyright protection,but had not directly examined this issue.id.therefore,we remanded the issue to the district court to decide in the first instance.id.
as indicated in halicki,a character may be protectable if it has distinctive character traits and attributes,even if the character does not maintain the same physical appearance in every context.as the eighth circuit has recognized,the presence of distinctive qualities apart from visual appearance can diminish or even negate the need for consistent visual appearance.warner.entm t,x one x,cir.for example,in halicki,eleanor ability to consistently disrupt heists by her presence was more pertinent to our analysis of whether the car should qualify as a sufficiently distinctive character than eleanor make and model.at.indeed,halicki put no weight on the fact that eleanor was a customized yellow fastback ford mustang in one film,and a silver shelby gt in another.
similarly,district courts have determined that james bond,batman,and godzilla are characters protected by copyright,despite their changes in appearance.see metro goldwyn mayer,am.honda motor,james bond cited with approval in rice toho william morrow,d,godzilla cited with approval in rice sapon dc comics,civ.whp,wl,at,batman.in each instance,courts have deemed the persistence of a character traits and attributes to be key to determining whether the character qualifies for copyright protection.the character james bond qualifies for copyright protection because,no matter what the actor who portrays this character looks like,james bond always maintains his his overt sexuality his love of martinis shaken,not stirred his marksmanship his license to kill and use of guns his physical strength and his sophistication.metro goldwyn mayer.at.similarly,while the character godzilla may have a different appearance from time to time,it is entitled to copyright protection because it is always a,gigantic dinosaur alive and well in the modern world.toho,d at.in short,although james bond,godzilla,and batman costume and character have evolved over the years,they have retained unique,protectable characteristics and are therefore entitled to copyright protection as characters.sapon,wl,at.
we read these precedents as establishing a test for determining whether a character in a comic book,television program,or motion picture is entitled to copyright protection.first,the character must generally have physical as well as conceptual qualities.air pirates,at.second,the character must be sufficiently delineated to be recognizable as the same character whenever it appears.see rice,at.considering the character as it has appeared in different productions,it must display consistent,identifiable character traits and attributes,although the character need not have a consistent appearance.see halicki,at.third,the character must be especially distinctive and contain some unique elements of expression.halicki,at.it can not be a stock character such as a magician in standard magician garb.rice,at.even when a character lacks sentient attributes and does not speak like a car,it can be a protectable character if it meets this standard.halicki,at.
we now apply this framework to this case.because unlike in halicki the district court here addressed this question in detail,we consider its factual findings in analyzing this issue.halicki,at.first,because the batmobile has appeared graphically in comic books,and as a car in television series and motion pictures,it has physical as well as conceptual qualities,and is thus not a mere literary character.air pirates,at.
second,the batmobile is sufficiently delineated to be recognizable as the same character whenever it appears.see rice,at.as the district court determined,the batmobile has maintained distinct physical and conceptual qualities since its first appearance in the comic books in.in addition to its status as a vehicle,equipped with gadgets and weaponry used to aid batman in fighting crime,the batmobile is almost always in appearance,with a front end,bat wings extending from the top or back of the car,exaggerated fenders,a curved windshield,and bat emblems on the vehicle.this appearance has been a consistent theme throughout the comic books,television series,and motion picture,even though the precise nature of the characteristics have changed from time to time.
the batmobile also has consistent character traits and attributes.no matter its specific physical appearance,the batmobile is a car with sleek and powerful characteristics that allow batman to maneuver quickly while he fights villains.in the comic books,the batmobile is described as waiting l ike an impatient steed straining at the reins shiver ing as its motor throbs with energy before it tears after the fleeing hoodlums an instant later.elsewhere,the batmobile leaps away and tears up the street like a cyclone,and at one point twin jets of flame flash out with thunderclap force,and the miracle car of the dynamic duo literally flies through the air like its comic book counterpart,the batmobile depicted in both the television series and the motion picture possesses jet engine s and tubes that undoubtedly give the batmobile far more power than an ordinary car.furthermore,the batmobile has an ability to maneuver that far exceeds that of an ordinary car.in the television series,the batmobile can perform an emergency bat turn via reverse thrust rockets.likewise,in the motion picture,the batmobile can enter batmissile mode,in which the batmobile sheds all material outside the central fuselage and reconfigures its wheels and axles to fit through narrow openings.
equally important,the batmobile always contains the most weaponry and technology.at various points in the comic book,the batmobile contains a phone directly to commissioner gordon office maintained within the dashboard compartment,a special alarm that foils the joker attempt to steal the batmobile,and even a complete mobile crime lab within the vehicle.likewise,the batmobile in the television series possesses a bing bong warning bell,a mobile,a batscope,complete with a viewing screen on the dash,and a.similarly,the batmobile in the motion picture is equipped with a pair of browning machine guns,spherical bombs,shinbreakers,and disc launchers.
because the batmobile,as it appears in the comic books as well as in the television show and motion picture,displays consistent,identifiable character traits and attributes,the second prong of the character analysis is met here.
third,the batmobile is especially distinctive and contains unique elements of expression.in addition to its status as batman loyal sidekick complete with the character traits and physical characteristics described above,the batmobile also has its unique and highly recognizable name.it is not merely a stock character.
accordingly,applying our test,we conclude that the batmobile is a character that qualifies for copyright protection.
towle raises two arguments against this conclusion.first,he points out that the batmobile has at times appeared without its signature sleek features.he notes that in a comic book rendition,the batmobile appears as a heavily armored tank with large tires and a rocket launcher.the batmobile portrayed in the motion picture could also transform into a batmissile.as we have noted,however,a consistent appearance is not as significant in our analysis as consistent character traits and attributes.the changes in appearance cited by towle resemble costume changes that do not alter the batmobile innate characteristics,any more than james bond change from blue swimming trunks in casino royale to his classic tuxedo affects his iconic character.in context,the depictions of the batmobile as a tank or missile promote its character as batman super car that can adapt to new situations as may be necessary to help batman vanquish gotham city most notorious evildoers.see halicki,at.
second,towle argues that a jury should decide the question whether the batmobile displayed unique elements of expression and consistent,widely identifiable traits.we disagree.we have previously recognized that w hether a particular work is subject to copyright protection is a mixed question of fact and law subject to de novo review.societe civile succession guino renoir,cir.neither party disputes the relevant facts regarding the batmobile here.accordingly,we are to determine whether,as a matter of law,these undisputed facts establish that the batmobile is an especially distinctive character entitled to copyright protection.
having concluded that the batmobile is a copyrightable character,we next consider whether towle copies of the batmobile as it appeared in the and productions infringed on dc copyright.here,towle does not contest that his replicas copy the batmobile as it appeared in the and productions,even if they do not copy every feature.rather,towle main argument is that dc does not own any copyright interest in the and productions and therefore lacks standing to pursue its copyright infringement claim against towle.
to analyze towle argument,we begin with the applicable legal framework.under the copyright act,copyright ownership vests initially in the author or authors of the work,which is generally the creator of the copyrighted work.auto parts network,parts geek,llc,cir quoting a.the owner of a copyright has a number of exclusive rights,including the right to prepare derivative works based on its original work of authorship.a derivative work is a work based upon one or more preexisting works that recasts,transforms,or adapts the preexisting work,parts geek,at alterations omitted quoting,such as a motion picture that is based on a literary work,see,stewart abend,a costume based upon cartoon characters,see entm t research,at,or figurines based on cartoon characters,durham,tomy,cir.if an unauthorized third party prepares a derivative work,the copyright owner of the underlying work can sue for infringement.see silvers sony pictures entm t,cir en banc citing b see also,air pirates,at durham,at.
