this appeal raises the difficult and important issue of whether the incorporation of a short segment of a musical recording into a new musical recording,the practice of sampling,requires a license to use both the performance and the composition of the original recording.the particular sample in this case consists of a,segment of a performance of one of his own compositions by plaintiff,and accomplished jazz flutist,james newton.the defendants,the performers who did the sampling,are the members of the musical group beastie boys.they obtained a license to sample the sound recording of newton copyrighted performance,but they did not obtain a license to use newton underlying composition,which is also copyrighted.
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants.in a scholarly opinion,it held that no license to the underlying composition was required because,as a matter of law,the notes in,over a held c sufficient originality to merit copyright protection.newton diamond,d.the district court also held that even if the sampled segment of the composition were original,beastie boys use was de minimis and therefore not actionable.id.at.we affirm on the ground that the use was de minimis.
background and procedural history 
the plaintiff and appellant in this case,james newton,is an accomplished jazz flutist and composer.in,he composed the song choir,a piece for flute and voice intended to incorporate elements of gospel music,japanese ceremonial court music,traditional african music,and classical music,among others.according to newton,the song was inspired by his earliest memory of music,watching four women singing in a church in rural arkansas.in,newton performed and recorded choir and licensed all rights in the sound recording to ecm records for the license covered only the sound recording,and it is undisputed that newton retained all rights to the composition of choir.sound recordings and their underlying compositions are separate works with their own distinct copyrights.a.
the defendants and appellees include the members of the rap and group beastie boys,and their business associates.in,beastie boys obtained a license from ecm records to use portions of the sound recording of choir in various renditions of their song pass the mic in exchange for a fee of beastie boys did not obtain a license from newton to use the underlying composition.
the portion of the composition at issue consists of three notes,sung over a background c note played on the flute.when played on the sound recording licensed by beastie boys,the segment lasts for approximately six seconds.the score to choir also indicates that the entire song should be played in a tempo,meaning.apart from an instruction that the performer sing into the flute and finger simultaneously,the score is not further orchestrated.
the dispute between newton and beastie boys centers around the copyright implications of the practice of sampling,a practice now common to many types of popular music.sampling entails the incorporation of short segments of prior sound recordings into new recordings.the practice originated in jamaica in the,when disc jockeys djs used portable sound systems to mix segments of prior recordings into new mixes,which they would overlay with chanted or scatted vocals.see robert szymanski,audio pasitiche digital sampling,intermediate copying,fair use,ent,spring.sampling migrated to the united states and developed throughout the,using the analog technologies of the time.id.the digital sampling involved here developed in the early with the advent of digital synthesizers having midi musical instrument digital interface keyboard controls.these digital instruments allowed artists digitally to manipulate and combine sampled sounds,expanding the range of possibilities for the use of music.whereas analog devices limited artists to scratching vinyl records and cutting back and forth between different sound recordings,digital technology allowed artists to slow down,speed up,combine,and otherwise alter the samples.see id.
pursuant to their license from ecm records,beastie boys digitally sampled the opening six seconds of newton sound recording of choir.beastie boys repeated or looped this sample as a background element throughout pass the mic,so that it appears over forty times in various renditions of the song.in addition to the version of pass the mic released on their album,check your head,beastie boys included the choir sample in two remixes,dub the mic and pass the mic pt,skills to pay the bills.it is unclear whether the sample was altered or manipulated,though beastie boys sound engineer stated that alterations of tone,pitch,and rhythm are commonplace,and newton maintains that the pitch was lowered slightly.
newton filed the instant action in federal court on may,alleging violations of his copyright in the underlying composition,as well as lanham act violations for misappropriation and reverse passing off.the district court dismissed newton lanham act claims on september,and granted summary judgment in favor of beastie boys on the copyright claims on may.newton diamond,d.the district court held that the segment of the choir composition could not be copyrighted because,as a matter of law,it lacked the requisite originality.d at.the court also concluded that even if the segment were copyrightable,beastie boys use of the work was de minimis and therefore not actionable.id.at.newton appealed.
whether defendants use was de minimis 
we may affirm the grant of summary judgment on any basis supported by the record and need not reach each ground relied upon by the district court.see venetian casino resort local joint executive bd.of las vegas,cir,cert.denied,d.assuming that the sampled segment of the composition was sufficiently original to merit copyright protection,we nevertheless affirm on the ground that beastie boys use was de minimis and therefore not actionable.
for an unauthorized use of a copyrighted work to be actionable,there must be substantial similarity between the plaintiff and the defendants works.see ringgold black entm t television,cir ideal toy,cir.this means that even where the fact of copying is conceded,no legal consequences will follow from that fact unless the copying is substantial.see laureyssens idea group,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at.the principle that trivial copying does not constitute actionable infringement has long been a part of copyright law.indeed,as judge learned hand observed over years ago even where there is some copying,that fact is not conclusive of infringement.some copying is permitted.in addition to copying,it must be shown that this has been done to an unfair extent.west publ g edward thompson.this principle reflects the legal maxim,de minimis non curat lex often rendered as,the law does not concern itself with trifles.see ringgold,at.
the leading case on de minimis infringement in our circuit is fisher dees,cir,where we observed that a use is de minimis only if the average audience would not recognize the appropriation.see id.at a taking is considered de minimis only if it is so meager and fragmentary that the average audience would not recognize the appropriation.this observation reflects the relationship between the de minimis maxim and the general test for substantial similarity,which also looks to the response of the average audience,or ordinary observer,to determine whether a use is infringing.see,cavalier random house,cir castle rock entm t,carol publ g group,cir two works are substantially similar where the ordinary observer,unless he set out to detect the disparities,would be disposed to overlook them,and regard the aesthetic appeal of the two works as the same.quoting arica,palmer,cir quoting peter pan fabrics,martin weiner,cir hand.to say that a use is de minimis because no audience would recognize the appropriation is thus to say that the works are not substantially similar.
on the facts of fisher,this court rejected the de minimis defense because the copying was substantial the defendant had appropriated the main theme and lyrics of the plaintiff song,both of which were easily recognizable in the defendant parody.at.specifically,the defendant copied six of the bars to the standard,when sunny gets blue,to make the parody,when sonny sniffs glue,and paralleled the original lyrics with only minor variations.id.however,despite the works substantial similarities,we held that the use was nevertheless because,as a parody,it was fair use under.id.at.we explained that the defendant successful fair use defense precluded a finding that the use was insubstantial or unrecognizable because the parodist must appropriate a substantial enough portion of the original to evoke recognition.id.at.
this case involves not only use of a composition,as was the case in fisher,but also use of a sound recording of a performance of that composition.because the defendants licensed the sound recording,our inquiry is confined to whether the unauthorized use of the composition itself was substantial enough to sustain an infringement claim.therefore,we may consider only beastie boys appropriation of the song compositional elements and must remove from consideration all the elements unique to newton performance.stated another way,we must filter out the licensed elements of the sound recording to get down to the unlicensed elements of the composition,as the composition is the sole basis for newton infringement claim.see cavalier,at apple computer,microsoft,cir.
in filtering out the unique performance elements from consideration,and separating them from those found in the composition,we find substantial assistance in the testimony of newton own experts.his experts reveal the extent to which the sound recording of choir is the product of newton highly developed performance techniques,rather than the result of a generic rendition of the composition.as a general matter,according to newton expert christopher dobrian,t he contribution of the performer is often so great that in fact provides as much musical content as the composer.this is particularly true with works like choir,given the nature of jazz performance and the minimal scoring of the composition.indeed,as newton expert oliver wilson explained 
t he copyrighted score of choir,as is the custom in scores written in the jazz tradition,does not contain indications for all of the musical subtleties that it is assumed the of the work will make in the work performance.the function of the score is more mnemonic in intention than prescriptive.
and it is clear that newton goes beyond the score in his performance.for example,dobrian declared that newton blows and sings in such a way as to emphasize the upper partials of the flute complex harmonic tone,although such a modification of tone color is not explicitly requested in the score.more generally,wilson explained newton performance technique as follows 
t he newton technique produces a musical event in which the component sounds resulting from the simultaneous singing of one or more pitches and the interaction of this pitch or pitches with the various components of the multiphonic array of pitches produced on the flute create a relatively dense cluster of pitches and ambient sounds that sometimes change over time.
whatever copyright interest newton obtained in this dense cluster of pitches and ambient sounds,he licensed that interest to ecm records over twenty years ago,and ecm records in turn licensed that interest to beastie boys.thus,regardless of whether the average audience might recognize the newton technique at work in the sampled sound recording,those performance elements are beyond consideration in newton claim for infringement of his copyright in the underlying composition.having licensed away his interest in the recording of his performance,newton only claim is for a violation of his rights in the sequence transcribed in the composition.
once we have isolated the basis of newton infringement choir composition,devoid of the unique performance elements found only in the sound turn to the nub of our inquiry whether beastie boys unauthorized use of the composition,as opposed to their authorized use of the sound recording,was substantial enough to sustain an infringement action.in answering that question,we must distinguish between the degree and the substantiality of the works similarity.ringgold,at nimmer a,at.the practice of music sampling will often present cases where the degree of similarity is high.indeed,unless the sample has been altered or digitally manipulated,it will be identical to the original.yet as nimmer explains,if the similarity is only as to nonessential matters,then a finding of no substantial similarity should result.nimmer a,at warner am.broad,cir.this reflects the principle that the substantiality requirement applies throughout the law of copyright,including cases of music sampling,even where there is a high degree of similarity.
the high degree but limited scope of similarity between the works here place newton claim for infringement into the class of cases that allege what nimmer refers to as fragmented literal similarity.nimmer a,at.fragmented literal similarity exists where the defendant copies a portion of the plaintiff work exactly or nearly exactly,without appropriating the work overall essence or structure.id.because the degree of similarity is high in such cases,the dispositive question is whether the similarity goes to trivial or substantial elements.the substantiality of the similarity is measured by considering the qualitative and quantitative significance of the copied portion in relation to the plaintiff work as a whole.see,worth selchow righter,cir t he relevant inquiry is whether a substantial portion of the protectible material in the plaintiff work was whether a substantial portion of defendant work was derived from plaintiff work.jarvis v.a m records,nimmer a,at to.this focus on the sample relation to the plaintiff work as a whole embodies the fundamental question in any infringement action,as expressed more than years ago by justice story whether so much is taken that the value of the original is sensibly diminished,or the labors of the original author are substantially to an injurious extent appropriated by another.folsom marsh.courts also focus on the relationship to the plaintiff work because a contrary rule that measured the significance of the copied segment in the defendant work would allow an unscrupulous defendant to copy large or qualitatively significant portions of another work and escape liability by burying them beneath material in the defendant own work,even where the average audience might recognize the appropriation.sheldon pictures,cir i t is enough that substantial parts were lifted no plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work he did not pirate.thus,as the district court properly concluded,the fact that beastie boys looped the sample throughout pass the mic is irrelevant in weighing the sample qualitative and quantitative significance.see newton,d at.
when viewed in relation to newton composition as a whole,the sampled portion is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively significant.quantitatively,the sequence appears only once in newton composition.it is difficult to measure the precise relationship between this segment and the composition as a whole,because the score calls for between and seconds of improvisation.when played,however,the segment lasts six seconds and is roughly two percent of the choir sound recording licensed by beastie boys.qualitatively,this section of the composition is no more significant than any other section.indeed,with the exception of two notes,the entirety of the scored portions of choir consist of notes separated by whole and from their neighbors the remainder of the composition calls for sections of improvisation that range between and seconds in length.although the sampled section may be representative of the scored portions of the composition,newton has failed to offer any evidence as to this section particular significance in the composition as a whole.instead,his experts emphasize the significance of newton performance,the unique elements of which beastie boys properly licensed.
yet newton maintains that the testimony of his experts creates a genuine
