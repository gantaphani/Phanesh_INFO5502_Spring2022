background 
i.the course of employment 
difolco and msnbc entered into a employment agreement on december.the written agreement,signed on behalf of msnbc by kaplan,provided that the term would commence on january.difolco,designated in the agreement as artist,agreed to employment as an,commentator,correspondent,reporter analyst and in any other like capacity for msnbc.with regard to the period of employment,the agreement provided as follows 
the term hereof shall be divided into two consecutive cycles of weeks each.msnbc shall have the right to terminate this agreement effective at the end of the first cycle by giving artist written notice not less than sixty days prior to the end of such cycle.this agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of the second cycle without notice,unless the parties agree otherwise.
the agreement established difolco compensation during the two cycles as well as other terms and conditions of employment,including those contained in an attachment designated standard provisions.
difolco asserts that she was first hired to be the los correspondent for two new entertainment shows msnbc at the movies and msnbc entertainment hot list.as such,she was responsible for conducting interviews and covering entertainment events.during the course of her employment she filled in as host on the shows and appeared on other msnbc programs as well.difolco alleges in her complaint that she 
performed all of her professional obligations in an exemplary manner,attended every shoot for which she was scheduled,traveled between the two coasts for msnbc assignments at her own expense without reimbursement by the company,and always made herself available for and completed the work requested of her to the satisfaction of msnbc and her managers.
despite her close attention to the performance of her assigned duties,difolco alleges that she was subjected to repeated mistreatment and abuse that created intolerable working conditions.she asserts in effect that leon,her executive producer,and cassandra brownstein,her producer,conspired to make her life miserable that they began a concerted pattern of harassing difolco,including repeatedly cancelling difolco scheduled shoots without justification or notice to difolco,in order to further damage her reputation and career with the company.leon became especially irate after kaplan requested that she do some work on a prime time program despite the fact that there would have been no interference with the existing shows.according to difolco,leon went to far as to falsely report that she missed a shoot while testing for the prime time show.moreover,leon never responded to difolco email regarding her harassment by brownstein,including brownstein alleged misrepresentation regarding the timing of seven voiceovers.
ii.termination of allegations 
in an dated august,difolco requested a meeting with kaplan,proposing a date the following week when she would travel to new jersey for the meeting.the following allegations of the complaint pertain to the contents of that email and to the correspondence that followed 
while she expressed her hopes to have maintained a productive working relationship with the company and be a part of kaplan team for a long time to come,difolco realized the defendants leon and brownstein continued to cancel her shoots and force her off the air.as such,she indicated to defendant kaplan that they should discuss her exit from the shows.this was difolco way of expressing to kaplan her desire not to disrupt the shows on which she worked.
defendant kaplan agreed to meet with her as proposed to further discuss the matters raised in her email.
that same day,difolco informed defendant leon that she planned to meet with defendant kaplan on september.she also stated that she hoped to record the shows for early september out of new jersey since she had to be in new york to cover fashion week,noting that it would save the company time and money on airfare if she simply remained on the east coast for that entire time period.defendant leon agreed to this arrangement.
the next day,on august,defendant leon responded by abruptly informing her that they decided to change the direction of the fashion week coverage and planned to send the new york times style editor to cover the shows instead of difolco.
difolco immediately contacted defendant kaplan,forwarding defendant leon most recent example of his ongoing effort to force her off the air and asked to know why she was being taken off the scheduled shoots.she specifically inquired whether defendant kaplan had made defendant leon aware of her previous request for a meeting,fearing that defendant leon had canceled her participation in fashion week in retaliation for approaching his superior and that her email would be misinterpreted.
difolco clearly expressed that she did not resign yesterday and confirmed their agreed meeting scheduled for september.
defendant kaplan acknowledged that he made defendant leon aware of her previous email.his email stated,my complete impression is that you have resigned,and then continued,sooner is better since your obvious intent is to leave.
while difolco was in flight from california,defendant leon left her a voicemail message that her meeting with kaplan was canceled.at the same time,defendant msnbc sent difolco a proposed separation and release agreement through her agent,claiming that she had resigned.
difolco claims that the termination of her employment in the manner alleged constituted a material breach of her employment agreement,giving rise to her claim for the balance of the wages and other payments due to her and her corresponding claim brought under the new york labor law.
iii.defamation 
following the termination,according to the complaint,one or more of defendants began making defamatory statements about difolco on the internet and to various media outlets.these statements,which included claims that difolco had resigned,broken her contract deserted her,were allegedly made by,with the participation of under the authority and direction of one or more of defendants.three television industry websites were involved.an internet website known as inside cable stated that difolco had resigned from msnbc in the middle of her contract,and a website known as newsblues stated that l uscious claudia difolco has quit msnbc in the middle of her contract,leaving sharon tay as the sole host of entertainment hotlist and at the movies.difolco claimed that these statements could only have originated from msnbc officials given the confidential nature up to that point of her contract dispute.it is alleged that inside cable and newsblues reach over individuals.
difolco also claimed that defendants caused a defamatory message about her to be posted,under the alias jill journalist on the website tvspy,on or about september.difolco claims that tvspy reached over individuals affiliated with the television industry.the message stated that difolco believe d that cleavage,over time sic in the makeup chair and a huge desire to become a star is how to pay your dues.the message also stated that throughout her irrevelant career at msnbc,she constantly ignored directions from news producers during live shots,refused to do alternate takes for editing purposes,pouted like a spoiled child and never was a team player.
iv.proceedings in the district court 
the motion to dismiss the complaint was filed by defendants on june,following the removal of the case from new york state supreme court,new york county,by notice of removal filed on june.the complaint included a first cause of action for breach of contract a second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing a third cause of action for tortious interference with contractual prospective business relations a fourth cause of action for defamation slander per se and a fifth cause of action for violation of the new york labor law.following the removal of the action,difolco filed a motion to remand to the state court,which the district court denied.
following submissions by both sides,the district court,by memorandum and order dated march,addressed motions by all defendants to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim by defendants kaplan and brownstein to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction by defendant brownstein to have the claims against her dismissed for insufficient service of process and by difolco to transfer venue to the district of new jersey if the court found a lack of personal jurisdiction over the individual defendants.see difolco,wl,at.the district court dismissed the claims against brownstein for failure to serve her with process determined that the court had personal jurisdiction over kaplan and denied difolco motion to transfer venue to the district of new jersey as moot,since the court found that it had personal jurisdiction over all remaining defendants.see id.at.
as to the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,the district court concluded that difolco had repudiated her contract in an exchange of emails and,therefore,that msnbc had no financial obligations to difolco under the terms of her contract.in reaching that conclusion,the district court found that the contract was unambiguous in its requirement that difolco be at msnbc disposal for a period and that p laintiff email is equally unambiguous in expressing difolco intention to leave before the completion of said period.id.at.after referring to another email,dated august,the court determined that b oth of these emails from difolco constituted repudiation of the contract and relieved msnbc of future obligations.id.although the district court noted that difolco sought an unspecified amount of damages for extra work and travel expenses predating the repudiation,the court determined that the failure to pay these amounts did not add up to a material breach of the contract and therefore dismissed the breach of contract claim in all respects.id.at.
with respect to difolco claim of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,the district court took note of defendant argument that this claim was precluded by the breach of contract claim.the court acknowledged that new york law does not recognize a separate claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on the same facts as a claim for breach of contract,although the federal rules of civil procedure allow the claims to be pleaded in the alternative.in any event,the district court found that the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim was properly pleaded and denied dismissal of that claim with the following rationale in that the breach of contract claim is dismissed,the question of preclusion by that claim is now moot.id.at.
addressing the defamation claim,the district court observed that the postings on the first two websites inside cable and newsblues contained true information that difolco had resigned before the expiration of her contract.this observation rested on the court previous finding that difolco had indeed repudiated her contract.accordingly,the court concluded that the defamation claims founded on the first two postings were not actionable.id.at.the third posting jill journalist on tvspy,included statements relating to difolco lack of professionalism.the defamation claim based on this posting was dismissed on the basis of the following finding by the district court a reasonable reader would conclude from both the broader context and the immediate context that the third allegedly defamatory statement consists of opinions,not facts.id.at.
the district court next addressed difolco claim for tortious interference with prospective business relations and employed the following language in dismissing that claim 
in oral argument on march,counsel stated that plaintiff relied solely on defamation as the wrongful act predicating the claim of tortious interference.in that the defamation claim has been dismissed in its entirety,defendants motion to dismiss the claim of tortious interference with prospective business relations is granted.
by endorsement dated march,the district court further addressed the breach of the fair dealing covenant claim,holding that difolco may not pursue the money remaining under her contract under a breach of implied covenant of fair dealing claim but may only pursue damages and a claim arising out of facts different from those upon which her breach of contract claim was based.
in a notice and order of voluntary dismissal dated may,difolco agreed to dismissal of the following claims with prejudice breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing new york labor law claims relating to appearance fees and unreimbursed expenses claims for payment for additional program duties set forth in paragraphs and of the complaint and claims for unpaid travel expenses as set forth in paragraph of the complaint.by endorsement dated june,the district court directed the clerk to mark the action closed and to deny all pending motions as moot.this timely appeal followed.on appeal,difolco challenges the dismissal of her breach of contract and related new york labor law claims,and her defamation and tortious interference with business relations claims.
