this case stems from the termination of an employment relationship between appellant amigo broadcasting,lp amigo and appellees joaquin garza garza and raul bernal bernal,and garza and bernal decision to enter into a new employment relationship with appellee spanish broadcasting system,sbs.amigo seeks a reversal of the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of appellees.amigo contends that the district court erred in its ruling by finding that amigo failed to produce legally sufficient evidence that garza and bernal breached their employment agreements with amigo amigo failed to produce legally sufficient evidence that sbs tortiously interfered with amigo employment agreements with garza and bernal and amigo withdrew its lanham act and competition claims during the hearing on appellees motions for judgment as a matter of law.for the following reasons,we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
background 
in the early,garza created the radio show el chulo y la bola the show or the el chulo show.garza created and plays the character el chulo,and bernal plays a variety of other fictional characters.in april,amigo executed employment agreements the employment agreements with garza and bernal,whereby garza and bernal agreed to broadcast the show on amigo radio station,khhl,in austin,texas.amigo aggressively promoted the show,and,according to amigo,it soon became very successful and consistently achieved high revenues and ratings.
additionally,the show was very successful at stations where it was being syndicated.in order to increase syndication,amigo contracted with latin entertainment network len to syndicate the show for a period of three years.tony hernandez hernandez was the ceo of len.in may or june of,amigo terminated its relationship with len and hernandez,and it took over all syndication of the show.
meanwhile,according to sbs,hernandez was attempting to find a new radio group to do business with.between february and august,he sent numerous and letters to sbs,making various business proposals,including one to broadcast the show from los angeles.raul alarcon alarcon,president and chairman of the board of sbs,responded to hernandez in late november of.thereafter,on november,alarcon,hernandez,garza,and bernal met in sbs office in miami,florida the miami meeting.
on or before november,amigo chuck brooks brooks learned about the miami meeting.in response,jim anderson anderson,amigo ceo,sent sbs a letter on november asking sbs not to interfere with garza and bernal employment agreements with amigo.sbs did not respond to this letter.
on november,sbs attorney,james cueva cueva,began drafting standard employment agreements for garza and bernal.cueva also requested copies of garza and bernal employment agreements with amigo to see whether the agreements really existed and,if so,whether they prevented garza and bernal from leaving amigo to work for sbs.according to sbs,it concluded that garza and bernal could resign from amigo and that the clause would not prohibit them from going for sbs in los angeles or any other sbs market because sbs and amigo did not compete in the same markets.
on november,sbs sent employment agreements to garza and bernal the sbs employment agreements,offering them substantial increases in salaries and bonuses.garza and bernal did not perform the show for amigo on november and according to amigo,the day after garza and bernal failed to report to work,bernal informed amigo that he and garza had accepted positions with sbs and refused to perform the el chulo show.when brooks contacted garza,garza allegedly told brooks that they did not need him anymore,said fuck you,and hung up the phone.on december,amigo terminated garza and bernal effective november and,respectively,for job abandonment.on december,garza and bernal signed the sbs employment agreements and began broadcasting the show for sbs in los angeles.
based on the foregoing,amigo sued garza,bernal,sbs,len,and hernandez for breach of contract,competition,conversion,breach of fiduciary duty,constructive trust,invasion of privacy by misappropriation,violation of the lanham act,and tortious interference with a contract.len and hernandez ultimately settled with amigo.a jury trial began on may.at the close of amigo evidence,appellees filed motions for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court granted.amigo now appeals,asserting that the district court erred by dismissing amigo breach of contract claims against garza and bernal dismissing amigo tortious interference claim against sbs and finding that amigo withdrew its lanham act and competition claims.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.price marathon cheese,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate after a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.in evaluating such a motion,the court must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,drawing all factual inferences in favor of the party,and leaving credibility determinations,the weighing of evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts to the jury.price,at.although the court should review the record as a whole,it must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe that is,the court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached,at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.reeves sanderson plumbing,d internal quotations omitted.
iii.discussion 
amigo breach of contract claims 
amigo asserts that garza and bernal breached their employment agreements by resigning prior to the expiration of the initial term and allowing sbs to use garza and bernal names likenesses for business purposes without amigo consent.it is undisputed by the parties that texas law governs amigo breach of contract claims.under texas law,the court must submit amigo breach of contract claims to the jury if amigo presented legally sufficient evidence of the existence of a valid contract performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff breach of the contract by the defendant and damages to the plaintiff resulting from the breach.lewis bank of am.na,cir.it is undisputed for the purposes of this appeal that amigo presented sufficient evidence to establish elements one and two.
garza and bernal resignation 
sufficiency of the evidence of breach of contract 
amigo argues that the district court incorrectly interpreted the employment agreements to give garza and bernal the right to resign at any time without breach.under texas law,d etermining whether a contract is unambiguous and interpreting an unambiguous contract are questions of law.cedyco petroquest energy,llc,cir citing heritage,nationsbank.in interpreting a written contract,t he court primary concern is to enforce the parties intent as contractually expressed,and an unambiguous contract will be enforced as written.interstate contracting city of dallas,cir.to achieve this objective,courts should examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all of the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.coker coker.an ambiguity in a contract arises only after the application of established rules of construction leaves an agreement susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning.dewitt county,parks.
amigo contends that it produced sufficient evidence that garza and bernal breached their employment agreements by before the expiration of the initial term set forth in section under section,the initial term was subject to earlier termination in accordance with the provisions of section.section sets forth the ways in which the employment agreements can be terminated without breach because garza and bernal termination of employment did not fall under section,amigo contends that such termination constituted sufficient evidence of a breach of the employment agreements.
garza and bernal,on the other hand,the district court they did not breach the employment agreements by resigning because they were employees at will.garza and bernal argue that section a unambiguously acknowledges their right to resign.section a of the employment agreements states in part 
in the event employee employment hereunder is terminated pursuant to the provisions of section hereof due to the death,disability,for cause or the resignation of employee,employer shall have no further obligation to employee except to pay accrued but unpaid amounts due.
emphasis added.garza and bernal argue that the purported right to resign in section a is consistent with section because section does not limit the ability of the employee to resign,but rather only limits the employer right to terminate the agreement.
garza and bernal argument,however,is unpersuasive.under texas law,employment is at will,terminable at any time by either party,with or without cause,absent an express agreement to the contrary.fed.express dutschmann.for the reasons stated by amigo,the employment agreements constitute express agreement s to the contrary.
the plain,unambiguous language of section limits the ways in which garza and bernal employment may be terminated without any breach,and there is simply nothing to substantiate garza and bernal claim that section addresses only amigo right to terminate the agreements garza and bernal argument relies on the idea that the language may be terminated in section can only mean may be terminated by employer.it is clear,however,that the absence of the language by employer indicates that section applies to termination by both employer and employee black law dictionary ed defines terminate as t o put an end to to bring to an end and defines termination of employment as t he complete severance of an relationship.these definitions indicate that termination of employment can be effectuated by either an employer or an employee.furthermore,and most importantly,where the contract intended to refer to termination of employment by the employer,it unambiguously stated as such.section a states in a part not cited by garza and bernal in the event employee employment hereunder is terminated by employer emphasis added.if the concept of termination necessarily implied termination by the employer,the use of the language by employer in section a would have been wholly unnecessary.
furthermore,section a does not create or acknowledge a right for garza and bernal to resign from amigo without breaching the employment agreements rather,the purpose of section a is to determine what compensation amigo would owe garza and bernal upon termination of the employment relationship quite simply,reading section to create or acknowledge a right to resign without breach would contradict the plain language of section resigning or abandoning employment prior to the end of the initial term was an option for termination of employment without breach,such would have been set forth in section.
finally,the term of the agreement is only subject to earlier termination in accordance with the provisions of section hereof.if the term were subject to earlier termination because of employee resignation,section or would have undoubtedly stated as such.
thus,interpreting the employment agreements as limiting garza and bernal right to terminate the agreement at will best gives effect to the entire writing and best harmonizes all the provisions of the contract.coker,at.the district court,therefore,erred by interpreting the employment agreements to the contrary,and amigo produced sufficient evidence that garza and bernal breached their employment agreements.
sufficiency of the evidence of damages 
amigo asserts that it provided sufficient evidence that garza and bernal resignation proximately caused it substantial damages.specifically,amigo contends that it produced sufficient evidence of in lost profits and in lost investment that amigo spent to advertise the show garza and bernal,however,contend that amigo presented insufficient evidence of both the fact and amount of damages.
lost profits 
under texas law,the measure of damages is just compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained.stewart basey.a proper measure of damages in a breach of contract case is the loss of contractual profit.interceramic,orient.the ability to recover lost profits does not require that the loss be susceptible to exact calculation.szczepanik first trust,per curiam.the injured party must,however,establish the amount of the loss by competent evidence with reasonable certainty.id.quite simply,lost profit damages may not be based on evidence that is speculative,uncertain,contingent,or hypothetical.blase indus.anorad,cir.at a minimum,opinions or estimates of lost profits must be based on objective facts,figures,or data from which the amount of lost profits may be ascertained.szczepanik,at.however,w hile some uncertainty as to the amount of damages is permissible,uncertainty as to the fact of damages will defeat recovery.blase indus,at emphasis added.
having reviewed the record,we find that amigo presented sufficient evidence of the fact of damages.brooks,amigo,testified at trial the el chulo show was wildly successful in terms of ratings and revenues advertisers and sellers of advertising use arbitron ratings to determine the cost of advertising khhl received more advertising,charged higher advertising rates,and consequently generated more revenue as a result of the high arbitron ratings from the el chulo show the show amigo used to replace the el chulo show after its departure was not nearly as successful as the el chulo show until the end of the winter ratings of khhl for reflected the loss of the show and consequently dropped from around or a four to a and this drop in ratings caused revenues to drop like a rock.specifically,brooks testified that amigo syndicated advertising revenue decreased from around in to in and testified that this decrease was directly due to the loss of the show furthermore,amigo damages expert,robert rea,testified that ratings equal revenue and that a significant drop in as the one sustained by amigo after the loss of the inevitably create a very,very large decrease in revenue.
garza and bernal,however,assert that amigo did not produce sufficient evidence of the fact of damages because four months after the loss of the april and may had the two most profitable months in its history the decrease in revenue amigo attributes to the loss of the show did not actually begin until june months after the loss of the show and the decrease in revenue occurred around the same time that amigo got a new station manager,moved its tower,and announced it was going to sell its station.brooks testimony,however,explains why high profits in april and may and a decrease in revenue beginning in june are consistent with the loss of the show in late november.brooks testified that the high fall ratings were the result of the success of the el chulo show and were released in january the low winter ratings were the result of the loss of the show and were not released until april amigo used the high fall ratings to sell advertising through may before the winter ratings were released and had the show remained at khhl,the profits from april and may would have continued 
garza and bernal third argument regarding a new station manager,a tower move,and amigo announcement that it intended to sell khhl is also unpersuasive.first,garza and bernal fail to explain how any of these events negatively impacted revenues at khhl.second,with respect to the tower move,brooks testified that the tower move did not cause any loss of profit,and rea testified that the tower move was a neutral issue.finally,garza and bernal argument is essentially a claim that amigo did not produce sufficient evidence that the loss of the show caused the decrease in revenue beginning in june.to prove causation,amigo need not negative entirely the possibility that garza and bernal conduct was not a cause of the revenue loss rather,it is enough to introduce evidence from which reasonable persons may conclude that the loss of revenue was caused by garza and bernal departure.havner mart stores.viewed in the light most favorable to amigo,brooks testimony that the decrease in ratings after the departure of the el chulo show caused significant decrease in advertising revenues is certainly given that this causal claim is inherently plausible.see.computing mgt.sci,cir if a causal mechanism is inherently it comports with customary can make the inference that the mechanism in fact caused the harm on less evidence than if the mechanism is less plausible.
we also find that amigo produced sufficient evidence of the amount of damages.amigo damages expert,rea,testified that he arrived at an estimate of in lost profit damages by using the yardstick method the yardstick method was the most appropriate method for a growing business he considered the historical financial data for khhl and abs services which syndicated the el chulo show determined that percent was the appropriate growth rate for the revenue of these entities and calculated an estimate of lost profit based on these numbers and projections.such an estimate was not merely speculative or conjectural but was based on objective facts,figures,or data.szczepanik,at.
garza and bernal,however,contend that rea estimate was not reasonably certain because rea percent growth projection was purely speculative and rea estimate was based on the revenues of khhl and abs services as a whole,not the revenues of the el chulo show,and rea simply assumed that any loss in revenues for these entities would have been attributable to the loss of the show.first,with respect to rea percent projected growth estimate,rea testified that he considered the growth of the spanish broadcasting industry,the spanish radio industry,and public companies in the spanish radio industry.second,with respect to basing his estimates on the revenues of khhl and abs services,rea testified that this method was appropriate under the circumstances furthermore,garza and bernal argument constitutes a criticism of the bases and sources of rea opinion,rea testimony already withstood a daubert challenge,and garza and bernal renewed criticism merely affect s the weight to be assigned to that opinion and should be left for the jury consideration.viterbo dow chem,cir emphasis added.
finally,garza and bernal argue that amigo may not recover lost profit damages because khhl was a company that was less than months into its business plan,and,as a matter of texas law,p rofits which are largely speculative,as from an activity dependent on uncertain or changing market conditions,or on chancy business opportunities,or on entry into unknown or unviable markets,or on the success of a new and unproven enterprise,can not be recovered.instruments,teletron energy.however,w hen there are firm reasons to expect a business to yield a profit,the enterprise is not prohibited from recovering merely because it is new.id.at.given brooks and anderson statements about the success of khhl and the el chulo show,and given that amigo financial statements show that khhl consistently generated profits beginning in july,there were certainly firm reasons to expect khhl and the el chulo show to yield a profit.id.
ii.lost investment 
amigo also asserts that it produced sufficient evidence of its loss of,which constitutes the lost investment that amigo spent to advertise and promote the el chulo show.with respect to such investment,amigo is seeking reliance damages which reimburse one for expenditures made towards the execution of the contract in order to restore the status quo before the contract.hart moore.although not stated by amigo briefs,amigo evidence of lost investment presents an alternative theory of is,amigo can ultimately recover for its lost profits or its lost investment but not both.see restatement second of contracts as an alternative to expectation damages,the injured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest 
amigo presented sufficient evidence of its reliance damages.brooks testified that amigo spent approximately in advertising the el chulo show.further,brooks december,to garza stated that amigo investment in the show has been wasted since you garza elected,with no warning,to stop showing up for work.finally,anderson testified that building an audience for a radio show requires a significant investment,and this investment is lost if the show and its performers can simply leave at will this evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that amigo promotional investment in the show was approximately,was spent in reliance on garza and bernal performing the show for amigo during the term of their contractual agreements,and that promotional investment was in effect lost because of garza and bernal early departure.
garza and bernal,however,argue that amigo evidence was legally insufficient because amigo did not present evidence that it was unable to recoup its promotional investment.specifically,garza and bernal assert that the evidence shows that the el chulo show generated profits substantially in excess of,such that amigo recouped its advertising investment.first,as explained above,amigo introduced some somewhat the promotional investment was wasted or lost as a result of garza and bernal early departure.second,it is the burden of garza and bernal,not amigo,to show that amigo received a benefit from its expenditures that reduce or offset the amount of reliance damages to which amigo claims it is entitled.d damages recovery of reliance damages may be reduced to the extent that a breaching party can prove that a deduction is appropriate for any benefit that the claimant received for salvage or otherwise.emphasis added citing dpj.fdic,cir restatement second of contracts t he injured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest less any loss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would have suffered had the contract been performed.emphasis added.even if it is undisputed that the el chulo show generated profits greater than,there is no evidence regarding what portion of those profits are attributable to amigo promotional investment.thus,amigo produced sufficient evidence of its reliance damages,and garza and bernal can introduce evidence at trial establishing that amigo promotional investment in the el chulo show generated substantial profits that reduce or completely offset the amount amigo seeks in reliance.
in conclusion,amigo presented sufficient evidence that garza and bernal breached their employment agreements by resigning in november.further,amigo produced sufficient evidence to allow it to pursue its lost profits or,in the alternative,its lost investment to compensate it for garza and bernal breach.thus,with respect to this claim for breach of contract,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the license agreement 
sufficiency of the evidence of breach of the license 
amigo argues that garza and bernal also breached their employment agreements by allowing sbs to use their names and likenesses for commercial purposes without amigo consent.amigo contends that this was a breach of the license set forth in section,which states 
employee hereby grants employer a royalty free license to use employee name likeness to promote khhl and its programming,including any program hosted by employee or syndicated by employer,during the term of this agreement and any period thereafter during which employee is prohibited from competing with employer as set forth in section b hereof.during this period,employee shall not permit any other party to use employee name likeness for commercial or other business purposes without first obtaining the written consent of employer 
in response,garza and bernal the district court the license in section was only enforceable during garza and bernal employment at amigo.specifically,garza and bernal argue that,because section grants amigo a licence that remains in effect for months after termination of the employment agreements,it constitutes a restraint on trade unrestricted in scope or geographic area and is unenforceable under texas law.even if garza and bernal are correct that the license is unenforceable for the months after the term of the employment agreements expires,the license was still in effect under section during the term of this agreement,and the term of the employment agreements was at least three april.under section,the term of the employment agreements could only be cut short in accordance with the provisions of section.because we already determined that garza and bernal resignations were not in accordance with section,their resignations did not cut the initial accordingly the term of the.furthermore,even if the license acts as a restraint on trade during the term of the employment agreements,such a restraint is not impermissible and does not violate public policy.d injunctions covenants not to accept employment with anyone but the employer during the term of the contract are not opposed to public policy and have been held to be valid.emphasis added mission indep.school dist.diserens,granting an injunction preventing a former employee from performing services for another employer during the term of her employment agreement where performance of such services constituted a breach of contract and the employee services were special,unique,or extraordinary 
thus,the license was enforceable until at least april,and it is undisputed that sbs used garza and bernal radio names and likenesses for business purposes without amigo permission prior to april.
garza and bernal,however,further the district court the names referred to in the license are unambiguously their legal names,not their radio names,and,thus,they were not in breach of the license by allowing sbs to use their radio names.amigo,on the other hand,argues that the term names in section creates a latent garza and bernal had legal names and radio this latent ambiguity precluded the district court from granting judgment as a matter of law.
whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide by looking at the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the contract was entered.coker,at.a latent ambiguity exists if the meaning of language used in a written agreement becomes uncertain when applied to the subject matter of the contract.loaiza loaiza,cited in dell computer rodriguez,cir emphasis added.the latent ambiguity,however,must become evident when the contract is read in the context of the surrounding circumstances,not after parol evidence of intent is admitted to create an ambiguity.union fire ins.cbi,emphasis added.thus,in determining whether a latent ambiguity exists,courts may examine surrounding circumstances and the subject matter of the contract.loaiza,at.
examining the surrounding circumstances and the subject matter of the contract,the license in section creates a latent ambiguity.although only garza and bernal legal names were used in the text of the contract,the employment agreements concerned the employment of two radio personalities to perform their radio show entitled el chulo y la bola,and the license concerned the promotion of khhl and its programming,including the show.garza and bernal have two sets of legal names and their radio their radio names were the names used to promote the show thus,when applying the word name in section to garza and bernal,it is uncertain whether name refers to garza and bernal legal or radio name,and a latent ambiguity exists.
because of this latent ambiguity and because sbs used garza and bernal radio names and likenesses while the license was in effect,the district court erred in determining that amigo failed to produce sufficient evidence of breach of the license.see dell computer,at holding that where a latent ambiguity exists,interpretation of the contract becomes a question of fact.
sufficiency of the evidence of damages 
although amigo presented sufficient evidence that garza and bernal breached the license,the district court was correct in dismissing this claim because amigo failed to provide sufficient evidence that breach of the license caused amigo any damages.
on appeal,amigo asserts that its damages from garza and bernal breach of the license are exactly the same as its damages from garza and bernal untimely is,lost profits and,in the alternative,lost investment.these asserted damages,however,were caused solely by the loss of the el chulo show,which resulted from garza and bernal resignation,not from any subsequent breach of the license 
accordingly,amigo can not recover its asserted lost profits for breach of the license because its alleged lost profits stem solely from the untimely loss of the show.amigo does not assert that it lost any profits due to garza and bernal subsequent breach of the license.for instance,amigo does not assert that garza and bernal breach of the license allowed sbs to compete with khhl,thereby further diminishing khhl profits.
furthermore,amigo can not recover its lost investment in the show on the basis of the license because it did not produce any evidence that it made this investment in reliance on the license agreement.instead,amigo,anderson testimony quoted in footnote that amigo made its investment in the show in reliance on the contract term and the covenant not to compete contained in the employment agreements.
thus,with respect to amigo claim for breach of the license,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
amigo tortious interference with contract claim 
amigo asserts that the district court erred in dismissing its tortious interference with contract claim against sbs for lack of sufficient evidence.to recover for tortious interference with contract,a plaintiff must prove that a contract subject to interference exists that the alleged act of interference was willful and intentional that the willful and intentional act proximately caused damage and that actual damage or loss occurred.acs investors,mclaughlin.
on appeal,amigo only complains that sbs tortiously interfered with the employment agreements to the extent that sbs actions caused garza and bernal to resign prior to the expiration of the initial term.as explained below,amigo produced sufficient evidence of its tortious interference claim.
whether the employment agreements were subject to interference 
because this tortious interference claim only complains about garza and bernal untimely resignation,neither party disputes that the employment agreements were subject to inference until garza and bernal breached them by leaving amigo.amigo presented sufficient evidence that it knew of garza and bernal intent to permanently cease performing the show for amigo and work for sbs on the morning of november.thus,for the purpose of this appeal,the employment agreements were subject to interference until this time,and any acts taken by sbs after this time can not be considered in evaluating amigo tortious interference claim.
whether sbs committed willful and intentional acts of interference 
to show tortious interference,a plaintiff is not required to prove intent to injure,but rather only that the actor desires to cause the consequences of his act,or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it.sw.bell.john carlo,internal quotations omitted.moreover,the interfering party must have actual knowledge of the contract or business relation in question,or knowledge of facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe in the existence of the contract or business relationship.steinmetz,crow.
amigo contends that it produced sufficient evidence that sbs desired to cause bernal and garza to quit working for amigo to work for sbs,and that this was substantially certain to happen given sbs actions targeted at bernal and garza.specifically,amigo points to the miami meeting between sbs,hernandez,garza,and bernal and sbs communications and preparation of the sbs employment agreements after the miami meeting.
a.the miami meeting 
first,amigo produced sufficient evidence that alarcon,sbs president and chairman of the board,invited hernandez,garza,and bernal to the miami meeting for the purpose of discussing hiring garza and bernal to broadcast and syndicate the show from los angeles for sbs.specifically,hernandez testified by deposition summary in late november,alarcon contacted hernandez in response to a proposal hernandez had sent alarcon earlier in the year regarding sbs becoming an affiliate of the show,and hernandez informed alarcon that len was no longer syndicating the el chulo show after this conversation,alarcon contacted hernandez a second time,and this time alarcon was looking for a new show in los angeles and asked if hernandez could walk him alarcon through the process of how sbs could broadcast the el chulo show in los angeles at an station alarcon then invited hernandez to visit his offices in miami,florida,and he hernandez was made aware that joaquin garza and raul bernal were going to be present in that meeting as well and that the purpose of the meeting was that sbs was looking for a morning show for los angeles and they wanted to understand how that show would fit in with their current business plan.furthermore,garza testified that he received a call from alarcon in november,during which alarcon asked for us to go to his office in miami,to go to speak with him about the possibility of going back to los angeles.finally,brooks testified that when he confronted garza about the miami meeting shortly after it occurred,garza told him that they had a meeting with raul alarcon,and they garza and bernal were being offered a job by sbs.emphasis added.
second,amigo offered sufficient evidence that sbs the very the expenses garza incurred for food and hotel in attending the miami meeting.garza testified that sbs paid for my hotel,for my food.
finally,amigo offered sufficient evidence the time of the miami knew,or should have known,that garza and bernal were under contract with amigo.hernandez testified that during his first phone conversation with alarcon in late november,he informed alarcon that garza and bernal were working for amigo.furthermore,anderson testified that it was common in the radio industry for talent to have employment contracts that bound the talent to a term of years.even cueva,sbs counsel,testified that radio stations have similar needs in preventing talent from leaving and competing with their former employers.viewed in the light most favorable to amigo,sbs had actual knowledge of a business relationship between garza,bernal,and amigo,and,because binding employment contracts were common in the radio industry for talent,sbs had knowledge of facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe in the existence of a contract between garza,bernal,and amigo.crow,at see also top value,carlson mktg.group,defendant knew or should have known of the existence of a contract because it was common knowledge in the industry that grocers operated under written license agreements.
given this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude that sbs knew of garza and bernal employment agreements with amigo and nonetheless set up the miami meeting for the purpose of attracting garza and bernal to perform the el chulo show for sbs.thus,amigo presented sufficient evidence that sbs actions regarding the miami meeting constituted willful and intentional acts of interference 
sbs actions after the miami meeting 
amigo presented sufficient evidence that,after the miami meeting,sbs had actual knowledge of garza and bernal employment agreements with amigo and nonetheless continued to communicate with and negotiate to employ garza and bernal while they were still employed at amigo.
when brooks learned about the miami meeting,he asked anderson to send sbs a letter asking sbs not to interfere with garza and bernal employment agreements with amigo,which anderson did on november.thus,after november,it is undisputed that sbs definitively knew about garza and bernal employment agreements with amigo.
given sbs knowledge,amigo presented sufficient evidence that on november,sbs began to draft employment agreements for garza and bernal.plaintiff exhibit shows a string of between hernandez,cueva,and alarcon secretary,ivette davidson which indicate that hernandez and sbs were in the process of preparing the sbs employment agreements for garza and bernal to work at sbs,and sbs requested garza and bernal employment agreements with amigo to help the lawyer who is doing the new contracts.cueva testified that he requested to see garza and bernal employment agreements with amigo in order to determine if they existed and if they prevented sbs from employing garza and bernal.upon receiving the agreements,cueva evaluated them and,with the help of sbs outside counsel determined that they did not prevent sbs from hiring garza and bernal 
amigo then presented sufficient evidence that before garza and bernal left amigo,sbs transmitted the sbs employment agreements to hernandez,thereafter revised them in response to hernandez and bernal requests,and these agreements were significantly more lucrative than garza and bernal current employment agreements with amigo.cueva testified,and the evidence establishes,that on november day before garza and bernal stopped performing the transmitted what appeared to be final drafts of the sbs employment agreements to hernandez furthermore,cueva testified,and the evidence establishes,that on november,sbs revised the sbs employment agreements to accommodate for changes that were discussed between hernandez and bernal.finally,cueva testified that the drafts of the sbs employment agreements offered garza and bernal and per year,respectively,for a term of five years,amongst other bonuses.these terms were significantly more attractive to garza and bernal than their current agreements with amigo.
given this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude that although sbs definitively knew that garza and bernal were under contract with amigo,sbs continued to communicate with and negotiate with an attempt to lure them away from amigo.thus,despite the fact that garza and bernal did not sign any employment agreements with sbs until after they left amigo,amigo presented sufficient evidence that sbs actions after the miami meeting constituted willful and intentional acts of interference 
whether sbs intentional acts were the proximate cause of amigo damages 
to establish proximate cause,a party must show that the defendant took an active part in persuading a party to a contract to breach it.davis hydpro,emphasis omitted.merely entering into a contract with a party with the knowledge of that party contractual obligations to someone else is not the same as inducing a breach.id.
amigo presented sufficient evidence that sbs committed numerous acts of interference for the purpose of employing garza and bernal,as discussed in section supra,and these acts were successful in persuading garza and bernal to leave amigo.first,sbs knew the terms of garza and bernal contracts with amigo and offered them higher salaries and bonuses.second,garza and bernal knew of the sbs employment agreements and their terms before they left amigo.specifically,sbs transmitted final drafts of employment agreements to hernandez on november,the day before garza and bernal stopped performing the show,and revised those agreements on november,the day before garza and bernal definitively informed amigo that it would no longer be performing the show.finally,garza and bernal statements to amigo indicated that their decision to leave amigo was directly due to sbs offer of employment.brooks testified that on november,bernal informed him that he and garza had accepted positions with sbs in los angeles,and garza thereafter told him via phone that he did not need amigo any more.thus,amigo produced sufficient evidence of proximate causation.see top value,at finding sufficient evidence of proximate causation where the defendant made an active presentation and topped the terms of plaintiff previous contracts,resulting in a successful offer.
whether amigo suffered actual damages 
as discussed in section.b supra,amigo produced sufficient evidence of the fact and amount of damages that resulted from the loss of the is,amigo produced sufficient evidence of its
