plaintiffs are two brothers,aaron and matthew benay,who wrote and copyrighted a screenplay,the last samurai the screenplay.the benays contend that the creators of the film the last samurai the film copied from the screenplay without permission.they sued warner brothers entertainment,radar pictures,bedford falls productions,edward zwick,marshall herskovitz,and john logan collectively defendants,who wrote,produced,marketed,distributed the film.inter alia,the benays alleged copyright infringement under federal law and breach of contract under california law.
the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on the copyright and breach of contract claims.we affirm on the copyright claim.we reverse and remand on the breach of contract claim.
background 
the benays wrote their screenplay between and.they registered it with the writers guild of america in and with the federal copyright office on february.the benays agent,david phillips,pitched the screenplay to the president of production at bedford falls,richard solomon,on the telephone sometime between may,and may.phillips provided a copy of the screenplay to solomon on may.according to phillips,he provided the screenplay with the implicit understanding that if bedford falls used it to produce a film,the benays would be appropriately compensated.solomon informed phillips after receiving the screenplay that bedford falls had decided to pass because it already had a similar project in development.
the benays point to circumstantial evidence that,in their view,indicates that important aspects of the film were copied from the screenplay.defendants contend that the film was developed independently of the screenplay.the screenplay and the film are similar in some respects and dissimilar in others.
the protagonist in the screenplay is james gamble,a successful west point professor with a beautiful wife and a son.gamble travels to japan at the request of president grant.gamble owes a debt to the president because grant saved gamble career after he accidentally killed eight of his own men during the civil war.gamble is initially successful in training and leading the japanese imperial army,which is victorious in its first battle against the samurai.however,that battle turns out to be a strategic blunder because it incites a full samurai rebellion led by a treacherous samurai named saigo.gamble son is killed during saigo attack on a christian church service.the death of his son leads gamble to launch an attack against saigo,which results in a devastating loss for the imperial army.gamble falls into an stupor,in which he is haunted by his failure,his mistake during the civil war,and the death of his son.gamble eventually is pulled out of this crisis by his wife and by masako,a female samurai warrior who has saigo.the remainder of the screenplay consists of gamble campaign to exact revenge.a series of battles unfolds between the imperial army,led by gamble,and the samurai rebels.the conflict eventually ends with gamble killing saigo in a sword fight with the help of masako,who dies in the fight.gamble returns to the united states,where he lives in a house with his wife and a newborn child named masako.
the protagonist in the film is nathan algren,an unmarried alcoholic.he is haunted by his role in an attack on an innocent tribe during the indian campaigns.he has just been fired from his job hawking winchester rifles when he is recruited by his former commander to train the japanese imperial army in modern warfare.he travels to japan as a mercenary.after algren is captured by the samurai at the end of a disastrous first battle,he is exposed to traditional samurai culture.algren bonds with katsumoto,the honorable leader of the samurai rebellion,and falls in love with taka,the widow of a samurai algren killed while fighting for the imperial army.algren assimilates into a samurai village,eventually joining the samurai in a final futile battle against the modernized imperial army.after the samurai army is devastated,algren confronts the young emperor and teaches him the value of traditional samurai culture before returning to live with taka in the samurai village.
the benays filed suit on december,exactly two years after the public release of the film.they asserted claims of copyright infringement under federal law,and breach of contract,breach of confidence,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage under california law.only the copyright and breach of contract claims survived to the summary judgment stage.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on both claims.
the benays timely appealed the grant of summary judgment.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party to determine the presence of any issues of material fact.see kouf walt disney pictures television,cir.
iii.discussion 
copyright claim 
to prevail on their copyright infringement claim,the benays must demonstrate ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.funky films,time warner entm t,cir quoting feist,rural.serv.defendants do not deny that the benays own a valid copyright,but they deny having copied from the screenplay.the issue before us on appeal is whether there is substantial similarity between protected elements of the screenplay and comparable elements of the film.see id.absent evidence of direct copying,proof of infringement involves showings that the defendant had access to the plaintiff work and that the two works are substantially similar.quotation omitted.
when the issue is whether two works are substantially similar,summary judgment is appropriate if no reasonable juror could find substantial similarity of ideas and expression.id.quoting kouf,at.substantial similarity is a inquiry,but it may often be decided as a matter of law.id.quoting sid marty krofft television,mcdonald krofft,cir.indeed,w e have frequently affirmed summary judgment in favor of copyright defendants on the issue of substantial similarity.id.at quoting shaw lindheim,cir.
the ninth circuit employs a test for determining whether one work is substantially similar to another.shaw,at.to prevail in their infringement case,the benays must prove both substantial similarity under the extrinsic test and substantial similarity under the intrinsic test.id.emphasis in original.the extrinsic test is an objective comparison of specific expressive elements.cavalier random house,cir.the intrinsic test is a subjective comparison that focuses on whether the ordinary,reasonable audience would find the works substantially similar in the total concept and feel of the works.id.quoting kouf,at.on a motion for summary judgment,we apply only the extrinsic test.the intrinsic test is left to the trier of fact.see swirsky carey,cir funky films,f d at.if the benays fail to satisfy the extrinsic test,they can not survive a motion for summary judgment.see olson broad,cir.
the extrinsic test is an objective test based on specific expressive elements the test focuses on articulable similarities between the plot,themes,dialogue,mood,setting,pace,characters,and sequence of events in two works.kouf,at quotation omitted.a court must take care to inquire only whether the protect able elements,standing alone,are substantially similar.cavalier,at emphasis and quotation omitted.copyright law only protects expression of ideas,not the ideas themselves.id.at.familiar stock scenes and themes that are staples of literature are not protected.id,or situations and incidents that flow necessarily or naturally from a basic plot premise,can not sustain a finding of infringement.id.historical facts are also unprotected by copyright law.narell freeman,cir.
under the inverse ratio rule,if a defendant had access to a copyrighted work,the plaintiff may show infringement based on a lesser degree of similarity between the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing work.see shaw,at citing nimmer,nimmer on copyright,at see also rice fox broad,cir.for purposes of the benays copyright claim,we assume without deciding that the inverse ratio rule applies to lower the burden on the benays to show similarity.even if the defendants had access to the screenplay,the benays have not shown sufficient similarity between the screenplay and the film to maintain an infringement claim under federal copyright law.
the benays point to a number of similarities between the screenplay and the film.both have identical titles both share the historically unfounded premise of an american war veteran going to japan to help the imperial army by training it in the methods of modern western warfare for its fight against a samurai uprising both have protagonists who are authors of studies on war and who have flashbacks to battles in america both include meetings with the emperor and numerous battle scenes both are reverential toward japanese culture and both feature the leader of the samurai rebellion as an important foil to the protagonist.finally,in both works the american protagonist is spiritually transformed by his experience in japan.
we agree with the district court that w hile on cursory review,these similarities may appear substantial,a closer examination of the protectable elements,including plot,themes,dialogue,mood,setting,pace,characters,and sequence of events,exposes many more differences than similarities between plaintiffs screenplay and defendants film.the most important similarities involve unprotectable elements.they are shared historical facts,familiar stock scenes,and characteristics that flow naturally from the works shared basic plot premise.stripped of these unprotected elements,the works are not sufficiently similar to satisfy the extrinsic test.
plot and sequence of events 
in applying the extrinsic test,we look beyond the vague,abstracted idea of a general plot.berkic crichton,cir.though the screenplay and the film share the same basic plot premise,a closer inspection reveals that they tell very different stories.
in both the screenplay and the film,an american war veteran travels to japan in the to train the imperial army in modern western warfare in order to combat a samurai uprising.not surprisingly,the stories share similar elements as a result of their shared premise.in both,the protagonist starts in america and travels to japan where he meets the emperor,who is struggling to modernize japan.both protagonists introduce modern warfare to the imperial army,using contemporary western weaponry and tactics.both works feature a japanese foil in the form of the leader of the samurai rebellion.and in both works the protagonist suffers a personal crisis and is transformed as a result of his interaction with the samurai.
despite these similarities,the two narratives are strikingly different.we agree with the district court characterization 
plaintiffs protagonist,gamble,emerges from domestic security,to despair at the loss of his son,to revenge and triumph when he defeats his ruthless antagonist,saigo.in contrast,the protagonist in defendants film moves from isolation and behavior,to the discovery of traditional values and a way of life that he later comes to embrace.thus,unlike plaintiffs screenplay,which is largely a revenge story,defendants film is more a captivity narrative reminiscent in some respects to dances with wolves.
quotation omitted.
while the works share a common premise,that premise contains unprotectable elements.for example,there actually was a samurai uprising in the,the satsuma rebellion,led by saigo takamori,who is sometimes referred to as the last samurai.see charles yates,saigo takamori in the emergence of meiji japan,mod.asian stud,kenneth henshall,a history of japan from stone age to superpower palgrave macmillan ed.while there is no clear historical analogue to the american protagonist who travels to japan to help fight the samurai rebellion,it is not surprising that a hollywood film about the rebellion would insert an american character.
this case is similar to funky films,in which the two works at issue told the story of a small funeral home operated by two brothers after the sudden death of their father.at.the works shared numerous similarities in both works the older brother moved home from a distant city,was creative in contrast to his conservative younger brother,and initially had no interest in becoming involved in the family business in both the business was financially fragile in both a rival funeral home attempted to take over the home but failed and in both the younger brother changed his church affiliation in order to increase their client base.id.at.however,closer examination of the works revealed one to be essentially a murder mystery and the other to be a study of the way the characters struggle with life in the wake of the cataclysmic death of their father.id.at emphasis omitted.we therefore held that the plots developed quite differently and rejected the plaintiffs copyright claim.id.similarly,the screenplay and film in the case now before us tell fundamentally different stories,though they share the same premise and a number of elements that follow naturally from that premise.
characters 
the benays point to similarities between various characters in the two works,most notably the american protagonists.but on close inspection there are only a few similarities that have significance under copyright law.most of the similarities are either derived from historical facts or are traits that flow naturally from the works shared premises.see olson,at noting that only distinctive characters are protectable,not characters that merely embody unprotected ideas.
the most similar characters in the two works are the american protagonists,but the differences between them at least equal the similarities.the benays protagonist,gamble,begins the screenplay as a happily married and successful west point professor,while the defendants protagonist,algren,begins the film as an unmarried loner,a drunk,and a failure,with a meaningless job selling winchester rifles gamble flashbacks are to his accidental killing of eight of his own men during a civil war battle,while algren are to his role in a brutal attack on an innocent indian tribe and gamble gains an appreciation of japanese culture and honor but returns to america at the end of the screenplay,while algren fully assimilates into the samurai way of life by the end of the film.
although both works include the leader of the samurai rebellion as a central character,he is based on a historical figure,saigo takamori,and is therefore unprotected for copyright purposes.moreover,the screenplay saigo is a treacherous and ruthless warlord who deceives the emperor,attacks a church service resulting in the death of gamble son,and is killed by gamble at the end of the screenplay.by contrast,the film katsumoto is an honorable and spiritual samurai who respects the emperor,fights only to preserve the honor of the samurai way of life,and becomes a friend and mentor to algren by the end of the film.
the two works present the japanese emperor in starkly different ways.the emperor in both works seeks to modernize japan.the screenplay emperor is confident,wise,and.the film emperor,on the other hand,is young and tentative,torn between modernization and traditional japanese culture,and is bullied by his advisors.
there are a number of important characters in the film and the screenplay who have no obvious parallel in the other work.in the screenplay,gamble wife britany and his son trevor play an important role in the development of the plot.trevor death is the catalyst for gamble breakdown and is the motivation for his revenge against saigo.gamble relationship with his wife britany is tested throughout the movie.the screenplay also includes a character named masako,a beautiful samurai warrior who betrays saigo to help gamble.in the film,algren is childless.he falls in love with taka,the widow of a samurai warrior.but taka plays a very different role in the film from the roles played by britany and masako in the screenplay.taka helps algren assimilate into samurai culture and shares few character traits with britany.taka is graceful and giving,while britany is fiery and.unlike masako,taka is not a warrior.in the screenplay,britany father plays an important role in getting gamble to japan and is the central figure in a in which he attempts to break up gamble marriage.there is no parallel character or in the film.finally,the film includes algren former commander during the indian campaigns,whom algren despises.there is no parallel character in the screenplay.
the district court noted that both works explore general themes of the embittered war veteran,the water,and the clash between modernization and traditions.but to the extent the works share themes,those themes arise naturally from the premise of an american war veteran who travels to japan to fight the samurai.moreover,the works develop those themes in very different ways.the screenplay exalts the americanized modernization of japan,expressed by gamble triumphantly raising the american flag over iwo jima after killing saigo.it characterizes samurai as part of an ugly class system from japan feudal past,and is largely positive about the role of westerners in modernizing japan.by contrast,the film is ambivalent toward modernization and is nostalgic for disappearing japanese traditions.the film treats the samurai tradition as an honorable way of life,sadly left behind by modernization,and treats westerners as and exploitative.
given that both works involve an american war veteran who travels to japan to help the emperor fight a samurai rebellion,it is not surprising that they share certain settings a scene of the protagonist sailing into japan,scenes in the imperial palace,scenes on the imperial army training grounds,and battle scenes in various places in japan.these are all that flow naturally from the works shared unprotected premise and are therefore disregarded for purposes of the extrinsic test.see cavalier,at t his setting naturally and necessarily flows from the basic plot premise and therefore constitutes and can not support a finding of substantial similarity.
some of the settings are strikingly dissimilar.as the district court noted,the american settings of the two works are drastically different.the screenplay opens at west point with a classroom scene,a snowball fight,and a scene in gamble comfortable home.the film,on the other hand,opens at a san francisco convention hall where the drunk algren is hawking winchester rifles.in japan,the screenplay includes scenes in samurai castles and in an opium den where gamble has a spiritual crisis,none of which is in the film.the film includes extended scenes in a samurai village.no such village appears in the screenplay.
mood and pace 
both works contain violent action scenes.but we agree with the district court that the screenplay has a triumphant mood and is a story,while the film is more nostalgic and reflective in mood and employs leisurely sequences in addition to its battle scenes.the two works have opposing perspectives on the modernization of japan and the end of samurai culture.further,the pacing of the two works is substantially different.the screenplay jumps from battle scene to battle scene,while the film has a long period of relative calm in which algren is held in captivity in the samurai village.
there are limited similarities in dialogue between the two works.the benays point to both works use of the term gaijin.but this word,which means foreigner or stranger in japanese,naturally flows from the narrative of an american military advisor in japan.see grosso miramax film,cir finding no substantial similarity where the only similarities in dialogue between the two works come from the use of common,unprotectable poker jargon.the benays also point to the use of by the protagonists in the two works.but the use of is a common cinematic technique.a significant difference between the dialogues is that the screenplay is written almost entirely in english except for occasional words like gaijin,whereas the film contains substantial exchanges entirely in japanese.shaw,at finding dialogue similar where plaintiffs expert has set forth,dialogue from a variety of characters which almost match.
a title standing alone can not be copyrighted,but the copying of a title may have copyright significance as one factor in establishing an infringement claim.shaw,at quotation omitted.the benays make much of the fact that the two works share the title the last samurai.the defendants respond that the identity of titles is not significant because saigo takamori,the historical figure on which much of the film is based,is sometimes referred to as the last samurai.see charles yates,supra,at.the limited copyright significance of the shared title in this case is insufficient to overcome the overall lack of similarities between protected elements of the works.
at a very high level of generality,both works share certain plot similarities.funky films,at.but g eneral plot ideas are not protected by copyright law they remain forever the common property of artistic mankind.id.quoting berkic,at see also cavalier,f d at b asic plot ideas,such as this one,are not protected by copyright law.a number of similarities between the works arise out of the fact that both works are based on the same historical events,take place at the same time and in the same country,and share similar themes.these similarities are largely between unprotected facts,characteristics that flow naturally from their shared premise,and.see berkic,at.considering the screenplay and the film in their entireties,we conclude that the district court was correct in granting summary judgment to the defendants on the benays federal copyright claim.
breach of contract claim 
the benays assert a claim for breach of an contract under california law.contract law,whether through express or contracts,is the most significant remaining protection for literary or artistic ideas.other previously important protections,such as those against plagiarism,have been preempted by federal copyright law.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright nimmer matthew bender,ed.contract claims for protection of ideas are not preempted by copyright law because they allege an extra element that changes the nature of the action.grosso,at.that extra element is the agreement between the parties that the defendant will pay for the use of the plaintiff ideas,independent of any protection offered by federal copyright law.id.
to establish a case for breach of an contract based on the submission of their screenplay,the benays must establish that they submitted the screenplay for sale to defendants they conditioned the use of the screenplay on payment defendants knew or should have known of the condition defendants voluntarily accepted the screenplay defendants actually used the screenplay and the screenplay had value.mann columbia pictures,d,see also faris enberg,d.
it is settled law in california that novelty is not required for an contract claim arising out of unauthorized use.see desny wilder,cal d,disclosure of an idea may be protected by contract providing that it will be paid for regardless of its lack of novelty quotation omitted chandler roach,d.defendants do not rely on any purported lack of novelty in the benays screenplay.instead,they contend that we should affirm the district court on any of three grounds.a grant of summary judgment may be affirmed on an alternative ground so long as that ground is fairly supported by the record.see security life ins.of am.meyling,cir.the three grounds on which defendants rely are the benays can not establish the requisite fifth element of their contract claim,actual use of the screenplay by the defendants the benays failed to file their contract claim within two years of the breach of contract,as required by the california statute of limitations and there was no privity of contract between the benays and any of the defendants other than bedford falls.we decline to affirm on any of these three grounds.
actual use of the screenplay by defendants 
it is undisputed that defendants edward zwick and john logan were working on a script entitled west of the rising sun before the benays screenplay was pitched to richard solomon.in west of the rising sun,a civil war veteran joins a samurai and helps him
