this appeal involves a dispute over the copyright in the musical composition santa claus is comin to town the song,a classic christmas song written by fred coots and haven gillespie in the.in,congress enacted a complex statutory regime that as we explain later in this opinion gave authors and their statutory heirs the right to terminate previously made grants of copyright under certain circumstances,and thereby to recapture some of the value associated with the authors works.see,c.gloria coots baldwin,patricia bergdahl,and christine palmitessa plaintiffs represent coots statutory heirs since,they have attempted to navigate this legal thicket and terminate rights in the song held by emi feist catalog,emi under the terms of certain grants made by coots to emi predecessors.plaintiffs brought this lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,seeking a declaration that either a notice of termination served on emi in the termination notice or another such notice served in the termination notice will,upon becoming effective,terminate emi rights in the song.
the district court scheindlin,granted summary judgment to emi,holding that its rights in the song will subsist through the entire remaining copyright term which,under current law,is scheduled to expire in pursuant to a agreement the agreement that plaintiffs are powerless to terminate.we reverse.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that emi owns its rights in the song not under the agreement but instead under a subsequent contract executed in the agreement,and that the termination notice will terminate the agreement in.plaintiffs are,accordingly,entitled to a declaratory judgment in their favor.
background 
coots and gillespie sold the song and the right to secure copyright therein to emi predecessor leo feist,feist in an agreement dated september,the agreement.j.in the agreement,feist agreed to publish the song in saleable form within one year,and to pay coots and gillespie certain royalties generated by the song.on september,feist registered its copyright in the song with the copyright office.
at the time,the copyright act of the act,stat,was in effect.under the act,authors were entitled to copyright in their work for an initial period beginning on the date the work was published.they then had the right to renew their copyright for an additional renewal term,a right that they could exercise even if they had granted their rights in the initial copyright term to a publisher.thus,t he renewal term permit ted the author,originally in a poor bargaining position,to renegotiate the terms of the grant once the value of the work ha d been tested.stewart abend,see also penguin grp.usa steinbeck,cir.but authors could and often did grant their rights in the renewal term to publishers before the initial copyright term expired,and in fred fisher music witmark sons,the supreme court held that these grants were enforceable.unless the author died before the renewal term began in which case his renewal rights vested in his statutory heirs,notwithstanding his assignment of an expectancy in those rights,see miller music charles daniels,a grant of renewal rights ensured that the publisher would own the copyright for the entire period provided by the act.see steinbeck,at marvel characters,simon,cir.
while many authors sold their rights in the initial term and the renewal term simultaneously,coots granted his renewal rights separately,in the agreement.the agreement assigned to feist a number of musical compositions by coots,including the song,and all renewals and extensions of all copyrights therein,in exchange for certain royalties to be paid during all renewal periods of the united states copyright in each of said compositions.feist renewed its copyright in the song on september,at which point its rights were set to expire years after copyright was originally registered,on september.
in,congress enacted a major overhaul of copyright law the act,stat,several aspects of which are central to this appeal.for works created on or after january,the act did away with the act structure,replacing it with a single copyright term lasting for the life of the author plus fifty years.see id.a.by contrast,for works created before january,the act retained the act structure,see id.a,b,and for works like the song already in their renewal term,it extended the renewal term to years from the date copyright was originally secured.id.b.after the passage of the act,the rights in the song that coots had granted to feist were scheduled to expire in 
although the act extended copyright protection for works already in their renewal term,it contained a mechanism for giving authors and their families,as opposed to publishers who had come to own the renewal term rights,an opportunity to benefit from the extended term.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b hereinafter nimmer.to this end,c of the statute permitted authors or,if the author had died,certain statutory heirs designated in c to terminate the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright executed before january.c.because the parties dispute implicates the intricacies of this section,we quote the relevant portions at length 
termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period of five years beginning at the end of years from the date copyright was originally secured,or beginning on january,whichever is later.
the termination shall be effected by serving an advance notice in writing upon the grantee or the grantee successor in title 
a the notice shall state the effective date of the termination,which shall fall within the period specified by clause of this subsection,and the notice shall be served not less than two or more than ten years before that date.a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the copyright office before the effective date of termination,as a condition to its taking effect.
b the notice shall comply,in form,content,and manner of service,with requirements that the register of copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.
termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant.
in the case of a grant executed by one or more of the authors of the work,all of a particular author rights under this title that were covered by the terminated grant revert,upon the effective date of termination,to that author or,if that author is dead,to his statutory heirs.in all cases the reversion of rights is subject to the following limitations 
b the future rights that will revert upon termination of the grant become vested on the date the notice of termination has been served as provided by clause of this subsection.
d a further grant,or agreement to make a further grant,of any right covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective date of the termination.as an exception,however,an agreement for such a further grant may be made between the author and the original grantee or such grantee successor in title,after the notice of termination has been served as provided by clause of this subsection.
f unless and until termination is effected under this subsection,the grant,if it does not provide otherwise,continues in effect for the remainder of the extended renewal term.
in addition to this c termination right for pre grants,the act granted authors or their statutory heirs the right to terminate grants executed by the author on or after january.this termination right can be exercised during a period beginning at the end of years from the date of execution of the grant,but if the grant covers the right of publication of the work,that period begins at the earlier of years from the work publication or forty years from the execution of the grant.id.a.as with termination under c,termination under may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.id.a.
under the first of the termination provisions just described,c,the agreement was,as a pre grant,subject to termination starting on september,so coots could serve a termination notice as early as ten years before that date.c.between service of the notice and the date of termination,he could reach an agreement for a further grant of the terminated rights with feist or its successor in title,but no one else.id.c d.in fact,on september,coots served on feist successor,robbins music corporation robbins,a termination notice naming october,as the termination date for the agreement the termination notice.coots attorney,william krasilovsky,sent a copy of the termination notice to the register of copyrights on november.he then set about negotiating with robbins on coots behalf,culminating in the agreement,which was signed on december.
the agreement recited that coots the grantor had transferred his rights in the song renewal term to feist in the agreement that feist had renewed the copyright that congress had extended the renewal term in the act and that the parties hereto desire to insure that robbins the grantee shall,for the balance of the period of copyright in the song,be possessed of all united states copyright interest therein.coots agreed as follows 
grantor hereby sells,assigns,grants,transfers and sets over to grantee all rights and interests whatsoever now or hereafter known or existing,heretofore or at any time or times hereafter acquired or possessed by grantor in and to the song and various derivative works,under any and all renewals and extensions of all copyrights therein and all united states reversionary and termination interests in copyright now in existence or expectant,including all rights reverted,reverting or to revert to grantor,his heirs,executors,administrators or next of kin by reason of the termination of any transfers or licenses covering any extended renewal term of copyright pursuant to section of the copyright act of,together with all renewals and extensions thereof.
further,he made a series of representations,including that he had served on robbins and recorded in the copyright office a termination notice,which,the parties agreed 
shall for the purposes of this agreement and section c d of the copyright act of be deemed to have been served upon grantee,in advance of any further grant of rights hereunder,and shall be deemed to take effect at the earliest date possible under the copyright act of and the regulations prescribed by the register of copyrights.
robbins agreed to pay both a bonus to coots children in annual installments from to,and royalties as specified in the agreement for the period of the extended renewal term of copyright,a phrase that the agreement did not define.coots four children clayton coots,gloria coots baldwin,patricia coots chester,and john coots,also signed the agreement.as an inducement to robbins to enter into the agreement,they assigned to robbins all of their rights and interests in the song for the extended renewal term thereof.
on may,krasilovsky received a letter from the copyright office stating pursuant to our telephone conversation of march,we are returning the termination notice to you unrecorded.there is no explanation for this decision either in the letter or elsewhere in the record.at his deposition in this case,krasilovsky could not recall why the notice was returned or what had transpired in the telephone conversation mentioned in the letter.the parties agree that the termination notice was never actually recorded,although emi claims it was not aware of the of the notice until.
as noted,when the agreement was signed,the copyright in the song was scheduled to subsist until december,the end of the year years after copyright was initially secured.see supra note.the parties therefore did not anticipate that termination which is available only against grants executed after january,and lasting longer than years would be available against the agreement,which they thought would come to an end in,less than years later.things changed in,however,when congress passed the sonny bono copyright term extension act the act,stat.for copyrights still in their renewal term at that time,the act extended the renewal term to last years from the date copyright was originally secured.b.because the song copyright was secured in,its copyright was now set to expire on december.
the act also added a new termination right to allow authors and their heirs to extract value from the new extension of the renewal term.for copyrights still in their renewal term,authors or their statutory heirs could effect termination in the same general way as under c if the termination right provided in c has expired by such date and the author or owner of the termination right has not previously exercised such termination right.d.termination pursuant to d can be effected at any time during a period of years beginning at the end of years from the date copyright was originally secured,id.d in the song case,starting on september.
the possibilities created by the act led to a flurry of activity by coots statutory heirs who sought to take advantage of the termination rights that congress had afforded,but were forced to contend with uncertainty stemming from the fact that the termination notice was never recorded.in,coots heirs served on emi robbins successor and recorded in the copyright office a d termination notice with an effective date of september,the termination notice.evidently,the termination notice was based on the related premises that emi still owned its rights under the agreement a pre grant,and that coots had not already exercised his c termination rights.under the impression that the agreement was operative,emi personnel were confused by the termination notice they ran a search for a prior c termination notice,which came up empty.emi prepared a draft affidavit to refute the termination notice,but this was never sent.instead,in,emi began negotiating with krasilovsky,who was now representing coots heirs.
emi and krasilovsky agreed that in light of the agreement,emi rights in the song were more appropriately terminated under.accordingly,in early,coots statutory heirs served and recorded the termination notice,which indicated that the agreement would terminate pursuant to on december.krasilovsky then began negotiating to sell the rights back to emi.emi offered coots statutory heirs million for those rights,an offer that was rejected as insufficient.at that point,emi efforts to acquire the rights appear to have stalled.
two years later,in,warner chappell music,which had been acting as copyright administrator for a coots family venture called toy town toons,wrote to emi claiming the copyright in the song under the termination notice apparently having returned to the position that termination of the agreement had never taken place.emi responded to this letter through outside counsel,asserting that its copyright has not been and can not be terminated and would expire in.emi claimed that d termination was unavailable because coots had already exercised his c termination right in the agreement,and that d does not provide a second right to terminate where the right of termination has already been exercised.
in,coots statutory heirs served and recorded the termination notice.like the termination notice,the termination notice cited,not d,as the source of the heirs right to terminate the agreement.but in an abundance of caution,appellants br.at,the termination notice assumed that the termination notice was premature,on the theory which coots statutory heirs anticipated emi might advance that the agreement was a grant cover ing the right of publication of the work,a,and that the publication of the song under the agreement,which resulted in emi owning the nineteen years worth of rights spanning from to,took place in.on that potentially available theory,the agreement could not be terminated until december,forty years after the agreement execution.see id.i f the grant covers the right of publication of the work,the period during which termination is available begins at the end of years from the date of publication of the work under the grant or at the end of forty years from the date of execution of the grant,whichever term ends earlier.
on december,plaintiffs sued emi in the united states district court for the southern district of florida,seeking a declaration that the termination notice had terminated emi rights in the song on december,or,alternatively,that the termination notice would terminate emi rights on december.the florida court granted emi motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,and plaintiffs brought this action in the southern district of new york on december.plaintiffs now seek a declaration that the termination notice will terminate emi rights on december,or,alternatively,that the termination notice will terminate emi rights on december.
following discovery,the parties for summary judgment.on december,the district court granted emi motion and denied plaintiffs,holding that since the termination notice was never recorded,emi owns its rights in the song under the agreement which,as a pre grant,is not terminable under.baldwin emi feist catalog,d.although plaintiffs had not specifically argued that the termination notice terminated the agreement in under d,the district court rejected any such argument,concluding that d was unavailable because plaintiffs exercised their section c termination rights when they served the notice on emi and secured a substantial bonus payment.id.at.accordingly,the district court concluded that emi rights would survive until.judgment was entered on december,and plaintiffs timely appealed.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.back hastings on hudson union free sch,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,see nabisco,warner lambert,cir,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.a fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,and a dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby.
the first question we must address is whether emi owns its rights in the song under the agreement or,instead,under the agreement the termination notice and the termination notice purported to terminate emi rights pursuant to,but termination rights are not available against pre grants.see a.accordingly,if the agreement is the source of emi rights,plaintiffs can not terminate those rights under.plaintiffs argue that the agreement superseded the agreement and,upon doing so,became the operative source of emi rights.emi responds that the agreement did not supersede the agreement,and that coots failure to record the termination notice means that the agreement was never terminated and therefore remains in effect.
some preliminary discussion is necessary to understand the parties dispute fully.as noted,c d provides that a further grant,or agreement to make a further grant,of any right covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective date of the termination.as an exception,however,an agreement for such a further grant may be made between the author or his statutory heirs and the original grantee after the notice of termination has been served as provided by c.we will refer to the exception permitting,agreements with the original grantee as the exception.this exception was included in the act to give the grantee some advantage over others in obtaining the terminated rights.nimmer a see milne ex rel.coyne stephen slesinger,cir bourne mpl commc ns.
when an author or his statutory heirs serves a termination notice,the grantee previously undivided copyright interest is effectively split into three pieces,one owned by the author or his statutory heirs and two owned by the grantee.the author or his statutory heirs holds a future interest in the copyright.see c providing that the rights under this title that were covered by the terminated grant revert,upon the effective date of termination,to th e author or his statutory heirs mills music,snyder,labeling the interest a reversion.see generally restatement third of wills donative transfers am.law inst a future interest is an ownership interest in property that does not currently entitle the owner to possession or enjoyment of the property.this future interest,however unlike an author renewal right under the act,become s vested on the date the notice of termination has been served,c see range road music,music sales,d,which gives the grantee confidence,in negotiations under the exception,that the grantor actually has something to convey.compare nimmer a if the grantor dies after signing a new agreement but before the termination date,the original grantee is entitled to claim the benefit of the further grant of the terminated rights because the termination interest vested upon service,with miller music,at noting that under the act,assignees of renewal rights took the risk that the rights acquired would never vest in their assignors.
although an author or his statutory heirs interest vests immediately upon service of a termination notice,it becomes possessory,it entitles the author or his statutory heirs to ownership of the copyright only if the notice is recorded before the termination date.see c a a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the copyright office before the effective date of termination,as a condition to its taking effect.in other words,even after a notice is served,the interest that vests upon service may be divested if the notice is not recorded,and the grantee will continue to own the copyright through the end of the extended renewal term.see id.c f unless and until termination is effected under this subsection,the grant,if it does not provide otherwise,continues in effect for the remainder of the extended renewal term.nimmer b recordation is not a condition precedent to vesting,but a failure to record prior to the effective date of termination constitutes failure to satisfy a condition subsequent,and therefore results in invalidation.so upon being served with a termination notice,the grantee by virtue of the existing grant holds both a present interest scheduled to terminate on the notice effective date and a contingent future interest that will vest on that date and entitle the grantee to possession if the notice goes unrecorded.in common law property terms,these two interests are analogous to a term of years and a contingent remainder,respectively.see,jesse dukeminier et,property ed.
with this background in mind,in the prototypical agreement contemplated by the exception,the author or his statutory heirs convey only the future interest that vested in them upon service of the termination notice that is,the only interest they hold at the time the notice is served.in effect,emi claims that the agreement is such a prototypical agreement,and that coots conveyed to emi only the vested future interest scheduled to revert to him upon termination.from this premise,emi argues that the agreement remained in place as the source of emi other two interests in the song,the present interest that would have terminated in had the notice been recorded and the future interest contingent on the of the termination notice.when the notice effective date passed without its being recorded,emi urges,emi contingent future interest vested and entitled it to ownership of the song copyright.accordingly,on emi view that that contingent interest arises from the agreement,which remains in place,it claims that it currently owns the song copyright under the agreement.we disagree.
the agreement not only granted emi the future interest scheduled to revert to coots upon termination,it also replaced the agreement as the source of emi existing rights in the song.w here the parties have clearly expressed or manifested their intention that a subsequent agreement supersede or substitute for an old agreement,the subsequent agreement extinguishes the old one.northville indus.fort neck oil terminals,the question is simply whether the parties intended for the new contract to substitute for the old one,and that intention,if otherwise clear,need not be articulated explicitly in the new agreement.see moers moers,indicating that a new contract may discharge prior obligations expressly or through implication sheehy andreotti,asking whether the new contract,as a matter of intention,expressed or implied,was a substitution for the prior agreement samuel williston richard lord,a treatise on the law of contracts ed.t he intent of the parties that the new agreement is to abrogate the former contract can be determined either expressly or by implication from the new contract provisions margaret kniffin,corbin on contracts joseph perillo,ed.the question is wholly one of intention,to be determined by the usual process of interpretation,implication,and construction,gleaned from the expression of the parties.
the parties to the agreement clearly manifested an intention to replace the agreement and not merely to convey to emi coots future interest in the statutory renewal term extension.the relevant language is contained in of the agreement,which reads as follows 
grantor hereby sells,assigns,grants,transfers and sets over to grantee all rights and interests whatsoever now or hereafter known or existing,heretofore or at any time or times hereafter acquired or possessed by grantor in and to the song under any and all renewals and extensions of all copyrights therein and all united states reversionary and termination interests in copyright now in existence or expectant,including all rights reverted,reverting or to revert to grantor by reason of the termination of any transfers or licenses covering any extended renewal term of copyright pursuant to section of the copyright act of,together with all renewals and extensions thereof.
emphasis added.it is quite clear from the first half of the quoted language that coots was granting more than the vested future interest scheduled to revert to him or his statutory heirs upon termination he was also granting all rights and interests heretofore acquired or possessed by him under any and all renewals and extensions.ignoring the bedrock principle that a contract should be read to give effect to all its provisions,god battalion of prayer pentecostal church,miele,llp,quoting mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,emi makes no effort to explain why emi and coots would have included the first half of had they not meant for it to have some effect.but to give any effect to this language at all,we must read it as replacing the agreement,creating a new conveyance of all of coots interest in the copyright at once,and not merely as a piecemeal conveyance of his reversionary interest.put simply,it would make no sense to have two grants of the same exact rights be operative at the same time if the first half of were not meant to replace the agreement,there would be no reason for the parties to have included it.
emi arguments to the contrary do not persuade us to ignore the first half of.relying on our decision in penguin group usa steinbeck,emi points out that the agreement does not explicitly rescind the agreement or contain other language indicating a desire to replace that earlier contract.in steinbeck,we observed that parties to an agreement can mutually agree to terminate it by expressly assenting to its rescission while simultaneously entering into a new agreement dealing with the same subject matter.id.at quoting jones trice.relying on that principle,we held that an author or his legatee may,under the exception,rescind an earlier grant of copyright and enter into a new contract conveying rights in the same work to the same grantee see id.at accord milne,at.as we have already explained,however,an intention to enter into a substitute contract may be express or implied.see dc comics pac.pictures,app x,cir unpublished holding that under new york law,a copyright grant superseded a grant to the same grantee even though the latter agreement d id not,in express terms,cancel the agreement contracts noting that a contract replaces a previous one concerning the same subject matter if the subsequent contract either explicitly rescinds the earlier instrument or deals with the subject matter so comprehensively as to be complete within itself.emphasis added.by granting emi the same rights that it already owned under the agreement in addition to the new interest that vested in coots upon service of the termination notice,the agreement made it sufficiently clear that the parties intended to replace the earlier contract.
emi cites the ninth circuit decision in classic media.mewborn,cir,for the proposition that a grant of rights does not replace the prior grant.mewborn,however,is readily distinguishable.there,the defendant argued that a grant from the plaintiff the daughter of eric knight,who wrote lassie come home superseded a grant between the same parties,so that the plaintiff could not exercise c termination rights against the earlier grant.the court disagreed,holding that although the grant purported to convey certain movie,tv,and radio rights to the defendant,the grant had already conveyed the same exact rights,so the conveyance of those rights in the grant was a nullity.id.at.in other words,the plaintiff mere conveyance of the same rights twice did not show that the later grant superseded the earlier one.in mewborn,however,the grant conveyed ancillary rights that had not been conveyed by the grant,stated that the plaintiff was conveying all of the rights mentioned in the grant only to the extent such rights were owned by her,and expressly provided that those rights were being conveyed in addition to the rights granted under and pursuant to the grant.id.at.those three provisions,read together,unmistakably signaled the parties intention for the later contract to coexist alongside the earlier one,rather than replace it.no similar intention is evident from the agreement terms.
next,emi points to a of the agreement,in which coots represented that he had served and recorded the termination notice,and in which the parties agreed that the notice shall for the purposes of this agreement and section c d of the copyright act of be deemed to have been served upon grantee,in advance of any further grant of rights hereunder,and shall be deemed to take effect at the earliest date possible under the copyright act of.under the act,the earliest date possible on which the termination notice could have taken effect was in,so emi argues that a reflects the parties belief that the agreement would continue in effect until if the parties thought that the agreement would replace the agreement of its own force,why should it matter whether or when the termination notice took effect 
emi argument,however,ignores the fact that the termination notice had already been served and the parties thought at the time recorded in the copyright office.that fact distinguishes this case from others in which an earlier grant was rescinded and replaced without the author or his statutory heirs ever serving a termination notice,see steinbeck,at milne,at,and explains why the parties here clarified in of the agreement that coots conveyance to emi included all united states reversionary and termination interests including all rights reverted,reverting or to revert to grantor by reason of the termination.absent this assignment to emi of coots future interest in the song,it would not have been the least bit clear that the mere replacement of the agreement by the agreement would mean that the future interest that had already vested in coots upon serving the termination notice would not,in fact,entitle him to ownership of the song copyright on the notice effective date.see benjamin melniker harvey melniker,termination of transfers and licenses under the new copyright law,sch,noting uncertainty regarding whether a termination notice would result in the termination of the grantee rights if the grant were replaced between service of the notice and its effective date.given this uncertainty,it was sensible for the agreement to make unmistakably clear that emi would receive whatever rights would revert to coots on the termination notice effective date notwithstanding the replacement of the agreement.see,in re src holding,cir nothing prevents the parties from using a belt and suspenders approach in drafting in order to be doubly sure.
emi points to one more provision of the agreement b,in which emi agreed to pay roya
