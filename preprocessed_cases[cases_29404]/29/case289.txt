sybersound records sybersound,a karaoke record producer,appeals the district court judgment dismissing the first amended complaint fac it filed against its competitors collectively,corporation defendants,and their officers and employees collectively,individual defendants.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in this appeal,we determine whether a party lacking standing to bring a copyright infringement suit under the copyright act,but who complains of competitive injury stemming from acts of alleged infringement,may bring a lanham act claim,racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico claim,or related state law unfair competition claims,whose successful prosecution would require the litigation of the underlying infringement claim.we hold that it can not.
we also consider whether the transfer of an interest in a divisible copyright interest from a copyright to sybersound,unaccompanied by a like transfer from the other copyright,can be an assignment or exclusive license that gives the transferee a interest in the copyright.we hold that it can not.
factual background 
copyright compliance statements 
sybersound and the corporation defendants are competitors that produce and sell karaoke records.they primarily sell to a group of distributors and retailers that resell these records to the public.this purchasing group collectively,customers includes anderson merchandising,handleman entertainment resources,alliance entertainment corporation,wal mart,kmart,best buy,toys r us,and fry electronics.
according to sybersound,to reproduce and distribute karaoke records,karaoke record producers must obtain karaoke synchronization licenses from each copyright holder with an interest in each song included on the record.the customers require that the karaoke records they buy be licensed.to comply with the customers policies,sellers of karaoke records must obtain copyright licenses from and pay fees and full royalties to each of the copyright owners.some customers have instituted measures to ensure compliance with their licensing requirements.for example,in,handleman required its vendors to sign an indemnification agreement in which each vendor represents that it has all the appropriate and necessary licenses in order for handleman to sell vendor merchandise to handleman customers.the following year,handleman began requiring that each karaoke vendor annually provide a written certification that it has acquired karaoke licenses from each copyright holder and that each such license is current,valid and paid in full to the date of the opinion letter.similarly,anderson requires its vendors to provide written documentation that its karaoke recordings are fully licensed and that vendors are accurately reporting sales and accounting for royalties.
sybersound alleges that the corporation defendants misrepresent to the customers that their karaoke records are licensed and that all applicable royalties have been paid.specifically,sybersound alleges that its competitors claim to have all necessary licenses when they hold only compulsory licenses,licenses from less than of the copyright holders,or no licenses at all.it further alleges that the individual defendants have,on various occasions,admitted that they intentionally failed to acquire the appropriate licenses for their karaoke recordings.
sybersound also alleges that madacy and singing machine use misleading labeling on their karaoke records which state,for example,that all songs are used with permission or that the singing machine,the leader in home karaoke,strictly adheres to all applicable music copyright and licensing laws.
finally,sybersound alleges that uav and madacy licensing agent sent a letter to the customers and publishers falsely claiming that sybersound did not have licenses for many songs included in its recordings.
sybersound copyright infringement claim 
sybersound also claims that uav,madacy,audio stream,top tunes,and bci are infringing sybersound copyrights in several songs by producing karaoke records of these songs without obtaining a license from sybersound or its copyright assignor,tvt music publishing tvt.sybersound claims to have acquired an ownership interest in these songs by entering into a written agreement with tvt,an original to the copyright of these songs.this written agreement allegedly made sybersound an exclusive assignee and licensee of tvt copyrighted interests for purposes of karaoke use,and also the exclusive assignee of the right to sue to enforce the assigned copyright interest.according to sybersound,the copyright holders of these songs had an understanding that each could license only his or her respective shares and that a duly authorized karaoke recording would require a written license from each.
ii.procedural background 
sybersound,along with six music publishing companies,filed a complaint against the corporation defendants,alleging copyright infringement,violation of the lanham act,intentional interference with prospective economic relations,unfair competition under california business and professions code et,common law unfair competition,unfair trade practices under california business and professions code et,and seeking rescission and an accounting.the district court severed the music publishing plaintiffs from the suit and dismissed the claims for rescission of licenses and an accounting without prejudice.the corporation defendants then filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted these motions,dismissing the remaining claims with leave to amend.
sybersound then filed a fac that included most of the alleged causes of action pled in the original complaint,but also added claims against the individual defendants for violations of rico,a,c.the corporation defendants and the individual defendants collectively,defendants filed motions to dismiss the fac for failure to state a claim.the district court granted these motions,dismissing all claims with prejudice,and entered final judgment for the defendants sybersound timely appealed.

iv.discussion 
lanham act claim 
the lanham act a states in pertinent part 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which 
a is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person,or 
b in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
lanham act a,a.
the lanham act was intended to protect against the deceptive and misleading use of marks and to protect persons engaged in interstate commerce against unfair competition.dastar twentieth century fox film,d.section a,a,is one of the few provisions of the act that goes beyond trademark protection and addresses unfair competition.dastar,at.this provision,however,does not have boundless application as a remedy for unfair trade practices and is not a federal codification of the overall law of unfair competition but can apply only to certain unfair trade practices prohibited by its text.id.citations omitted.
sybersound contends that the corporation defendants engaged in unfair competition by violating copyright laws,thereby paying less in royalties and licensing fees to produce their products than sybersound did to produce its own,and by misrepresenting their compliance with the customers licensing policies,which permitted them to sell pirated records at prices that undercut sybersound own prices.furthermore,representatives of uav and madacy purportedly sent letters or made statements to the customers accusing sybersound of also failing to obtain the requisite licenses for its.sybersound contends these are misrepresentations under a b of the lanham act because they are made in commercial advertising or promotion to the customers and the misrepresentations are about the nature,characteristics,and qualities of the karaoke records.
sybersound claims that it is contesting only the corporation defendants misrepresentations in response to the customers policies.according to sybersound own description of copyright law in the context of karaoke synchronization licenses,however,the customers policies parallel the licensing agreements that exist in the recording industry and are a mechanism for the customers to ensure that the products they sell comply with copyright law.the nature of the alleged misrepresentation exposes a tension between the lanham act goal of preventing unfair competition and the copyright act goal of providing a statutory scheme granting rights only to copyright owners.
copyright is wholly a creature of statute,and the only rights that exist under copyright law are those granted by statute.silvers sony pictures entm t,cir en banc.under copyright law,only copyright owners and exclusive licensees of copyright may enforce a copyright or a license.see b conferring standing only to the legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right who is entitled to institute an action for any infringement while he or she is the owner of it silvers,at.therefore,third party strangers and nonexclusive licensees can not bring suit to enforce a copyright,even if an infringer is operating without a license to the detriment of a nonexclusive licensee who has paid full value for his license.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright,b.
the reasoning behind the supreme court decision in dastar,d,is instructive in resolving the issue before this court because it addressed the tension between the lanham act and the copyright act.id.at.
in dastar,a film company copied a television series that had passed into the public domain,and marketed it as its own.id.at.production companies that owned the exclusive television rights from the original book on which the series was based brought a lanham act suit,claiming that the lack of attribution to the original series misrepresented the origin of the series.id.the court held that origin of goods in the lanham act a a did not refer to the author of any idea,concept,or communication embodied in a good,but to the producer of the tangible good itself.id.at.otherwise,the lanham act would provide authors of creative works with perpetual protection that they did not have under the copyright act.id.
in dicta,the court further noted that if the film company had misrepresented,in advertising or promotion,that the contents of the video were significantly different from the series that it copied,it would have a lanham act claim for misrepresenting the nature,characteristics or qualities of its goods.id.at.
sybersound argues that the licensing status of each work is part of the nature,characteristics,or qualities of the karaoke products.following the reasoning in dastar,however,to avoid overlap between the lanham and copyright acts,the nature,characteristics,and qualities of karaoke recordings under the lanham act are more properly construed to mean characteristics of the good itself,such as the original song and artist of the karaoke recording,and the quality of its audio and visual effects.construing the lanham act to cover misrepresentations about copyright licensing status as sybersound urges would allow competitors engaged in the distribution of copyrightable materials to litigate the underlying copyright infringement when they have no standing to do so because they are nonexclusive licensees or third party strangers under copyright law,and we decline to do so.
accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of sybersound lanham act claims.
copyright infringement 
sybersound second cause of action alleges that uav,madacy,audio stream,top tunes,and bci infringed sybersound copyrights in nine songs.sybersound asserts standing to sue as a in the copyrights for those songs.
sybersound bases its copyright infringement claim on the following reasoning tvt is an original or joint copyright holder in nine songs.such are like tenants in common,each owning a share of the undivided whole,at,as reprinted in,under the bill,as under present law,coowners of a copyright would be treated generally as tenants in common,with each having an independent right to use or license the use of a work,subject to a duty of accounting to the other for any profits.sybersound contends that it stepped into tvt shoes and became a in the interest of the copyright when it became the exclusive assignee and licensee of tvt music publishing copyrighted interests for purposes of karaoke use,and also exclusive assignee of the right to sue to enforce the assigned copyright interests,for both present and past infringements in karaoke exploitation pursuant to an assignment agreement with tvt.citing d,sybersound asserts standing to sue,as a,for copyright infringement against the corporation defendants that use any of the nine referenced copyrighted songs for karaoke purposes without having obtained a license from sybersound or tvt.see b davis blige,cir may bring suit for copyright infringement without joining other.
sybersound analysis is flawed because,as a of the copyright,tvt could not grant an exclusive right in the interest of the nine referenced copyrights.
prior to the current copyright act,under the copyright act and the doctrine of indivisibility,a copyright owner could not assign less than the totality of rights commanded by copyright.gardner nike,cir quoting nimmer,supra,a a copyright owner possessed a bundle of rights that could not be assigned in parts.anything less than an assignment was considered to be a license,and only the copyright owner or assignee had standing to bring an infringement action.id.
the copyright act largely eliminated the doctrine of indivisibility and codified the divisibility of the bundle of rights that constitutes a copyright d silvers,at.however,d,entitled transfer of ownership,codified this divisibility as follows 
the ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law,and may be bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate succession.
any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright,including any subdivision of any of the rights specified by section,may be transferred as provided by clause and owned separately.the owner of any particular exclusive right is entitled,to the extent of that right,to all of the protection and remedies accorded to the copyright owner by this title.
d emphasis added.next,defines transfer of copyright ownership as an assignment,mortgage,exclusive license,or any other conveyance,alienation,or hypothecation of a copyright or any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright but not including a non exclusive license.emphasis added.in other words,exclusive rights may be chopped up and owned separately,and each separate owner of a subdivided exclusive right may sue to enforce that owned portion of an exclusive right,no matter how small.silvers,at emphasis added.
if tvt were the sole copyright owner of the nine referenced songs and had transferred an exclusive interest to sybersound assuming such a divisible interest exists,sybersound would have had standing as the exclusive licensee to sue the corporation defendants for infringement.however,even if a is a properly divisible interest in a copyright,tvt is not the exclusive owner of the interest in the copyright.in its request for judicial notice filed concurrently with its motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,madacy attached copies of copyright registration records from the united states copyright office showing that emi music publishing,beyonce publishing,scott storch music,music publishing,xtina music,logrhythm music,and others,are all of the copyrights in one or more of the nine assigned songs.thus,unless all the other of the copyright joined in granting an exclusive right to sybersound,tvt,acting solely as a of the copyright,could grant only a nonexclusive license to sybersound because tvt may not limit the other independent rights to exploit the copyright.see oddo ries,cir.sybersound does not allege that it has received the consent of the other to become the exclusive licensee for the interest.
sybersound assumes that because its assignment agreement with tvt says that tvt is transferring all its interests in the copyrights to sybersound,and says that sybersound became exclusive assignee of tvt copyrighted interest in karaoke use and of tvt right to sue,sybersound became a upon execution of the agreement.sybersound is mistaken.although the copyright act permits exclusive rights to be chopped up and owned separately,to be effective,the assignment or other type of alienation permitted by and d must be exclusive.since tvt assignment was admittedly,tvt succeeded only in transferring what it could under d,a license,which gives sybersound no standing to sue for copyright infringement.see nimmer,supra,b.
we hold that because sybersound is neither an exclusive licensee nor a in the nine copyrights,it lacks standing to bring the copyright infringement claims alleged in the fac,and,thus,its copyright infringement claims fail.
rico claims 
statutory standing 
rico provides a private right of action for a ny person injured in his business or property by a rico violation.c.sybersound seeks relief pursuant to rico statutes,a and c.a prohibits a person who receives income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity from using or investing such income in an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce c prohibits a person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in interstate commerce to conduct or participate in the conduct of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity 
sybersound alleges that some of the individual executives of the corporation defendants engaged in racketeering in violation of c by engaging in the predicate acts of criminal copyright infringement,mail fraud,and wire fraud.specifically,it alleges that the individual defendants engaged in copyright infringement by copying and distributing karaoke records for which they lacked licenses and did not pay royalties,and further engaged in mail and wire fraud by representing to the customers via mail or fax that they comply with the customers policies sybersound also seeks recovery under a,alleging that the corporation defendants invested the proceeds from these predicate acts to unfairly reduce prices to undercut their competitors.sybersound contends that it has met the standing requirements under a and c because it is a competitor that has been directly injured by the resulting undercutting of its prices.
in holmes securities investor protection,d,the supreme court held that congress intended the statute conferring a private right of action under rico,c,to include a proximate causation requirement because the relevant language in the rico statute mirrored that of the portions of the federal antitrust laws.holmes,at.it reasoned that at the time rico was enacted,courts had interpreted the provision to include a proximate causation requirement.id.because congress is presumed to know how the federal courts interpret its statutes,the supreme court concluded that congress intended that the courts read a similar proximate causation requirement into rico.id.
following the supreme court analysis in holmes,this court formulated three factors to determine whether the rico proximate causation requirement has been met 
whether there are more direct victims of the alleged wrongful conduct who can be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general whether it will be difficult to ascertain the amount of the plaintiff damages attributable to defendant wrongful conduct and whether the courts will have to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries.
mendoza zirkle fruit,cir quotations and citation omitted.the district court dismissed sybersound rico claim,reasoning that it had failed to overcome this proximate causation hurdle.
sybersound argues that as a competitor injured by unlawful predicate acts,it is the quintessential rico plaintiff that has suffered a direct injury.furthermore,sybersound claims that because of the small number of customers involved,damages would not be difficult to ascertain because it can establish when it lost a contract to a competitor charging lower prices.it also claims that its injuries are separate and distinct from the injuries to the copyright holders,eliminating the risk of multiple recoveries.
the supreme court recently clarified the proximate causation requirement for a suit brought under c,thereby foreclosing sybersound argument.anza ideal steel supply,d.
in anza,national steel supply national failed to charge new york sales tax to its customers and submitted fraudulent tax returns,which allegedly allowed it to undercut ideal steel supply corporation ideal prices.id.at.ideal brought suit under rico,a and c.id.at.the district court granted national rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.id.at.the second circuit vacated the district court judgment,holding that the plaintiff has standing even where the scheme depended on fraudulent communications directed to and relied on by a third party rather than the plaintiff.id.the supreme court reversed,holding that the attenuated harm suffered by ideal did not meet the directness requirement laid out in holmes as to the c claim.id.at.
in reaching its conclusion,the supreme court considered the principles underlying the directness requirement.id.at.first,o ne motivating principle is the difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.id.at.the supreme court noted that defrauding the tax authority did not require national to lower prices,since lower prices may have resulted from,for example,a decision that additional sales would justify a smaller profit margin.id.moreover,ideal lost sales could have resulted from factors other than petitioner alleged acts of fraud.businesses lose and gain customers for many reasons id.
similarly in this case,the court would have to engage in a speculative and complicated analysis to determine what percentage of sybersound decreased sales,if any,were attributable to the corporation defendants decision to lower their prices or a customer preference for a competitor products over sybersound,instead of to acts of copyright infringement or mail and wire fraud.see id.this case would require an even more speculative analysis than anza because sybersound has more than one principal competitor.
as noted by the supreme court,
t he element of proximate causation recognized in holmes is meant to prevent these types of intricate,uncertain inquiries from overrunning rico litigation.it has particular resonance when applied to claims brought by economic competitors,which,if left unchecked,could blur the line between rico and the antitrust laws.
id.at.when a court evaluates a rico claim for proximate causation,the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to plaintiff injuries.id.
second,t he requirement of direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims of an alleged rico violation can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.id.at.the supreme court noted that the direct victim,the state tax authority,could be expected to pursue national for its tax violations.id.here,as well,the more direct victims of the corporation defendants alleged infringement actions,the copyright holders,can be expected to pursue their own claims.in fact,prior to the severing of their claims,six music publishers pursued their copyright infringement claims as part of this very action.
the third factor discussed in holmes was the risk of multiple recoveries.holmes,at.anza makes clear,however,this is not a necessary condition for concluding that proximate cause is lacking.see anza.at acknowledging that there was no appreciable risk of duplicative recoveries.
following anza,we hold that sybersound can not overcome the proximate causation hurdle to assert a rico violation under c.
investment injury 
sybersound has not alleged an investment injury separate and distinct from the injury flowing from the predicate act,as required for a rico claim brought under a.
in nugget hydroelectric,pacific gas and electric,cir,we held that a plaintiff seeking civil damages for a violation of section a must allege facts tending to show that he or she was injured by the use or investment of racketeering income.in this case,sybersound must allege that the investment of racketeering income was the proximate cause of its injury.reinvestment of proceeds from alleged racketeering activity back into the enterprise to continue its racketeering activity is insufficient to show proximate causation.see wagh metris direct,cir,overruled on other grounds,odom microsoft,cir en banc westways world travel amr,d,explaining that when racketeering is committed on behalf of a corporation,almost every racketeering act committed by a corporation would also result in a a violation because corporations generally reinvest their profits,eviscerating the distinction between c and a.
sybersound argues that it meets a investment injury requirement because it is the direct victim of the use of proceeds generated by the predicate acts.its competitors used the proceeds from their copyright infringements and mail fraud to undercut sybersound prices.sybersound,however,has not alleged any injury separate and distinct from the injuries incurred from the predicate act itself.
here,sybersound injury stems from the alleged copyright infringement.the purported infringement by the corporation defendants,not the income from the sale of pirated records,allegedly allowed the corporation defendants to undercut sybersound prices.sybersound reliance on simon value behavioral health,cir,overruled on other grounds,odom,at,is unavailing.in that case,value behavioral health fraudulently denied health benefit claims to patients and reinvested that income to build a group of preferred medical providers who undertook to eliminate outside providers.id.the court,in dicta,noted that the victims of the investment were competitors who were driven out of business by the preferred providers.id.there,the competitors in simon would not have been injured by the predicate act of the fraudulent denial of health care benefits,but would have been directly injured by the reinvestment of the proceeds resulting from such denial.in contrast,sybersound competitive injury stems from the alleged copyright infringement for which it does not have statutory standing to bring a rico claim.
accordingly,we hold that the district court properly dismissed sybersound a and c rico claims.
state law claims 
preemption 
finally,sybersound seeks relief under a variety of california state laws.the district court dismissed all state law claims,finding that they are preempted by the copyright act.it reasoned that the underlying basis of each of sybersound state law claims is that because the corporation defendants failed to obtain complete licenses for the songs they sell,they caused harm to sybersound.it therefore concluded that the state law claims are merely copyright claims dressed up to look like state law claims and that the claims were not distinguishable from copyright infringement claims.
the copyright act explicitly preempts state laws that regulate in the area of copyright,stating that all legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section are governed exclusively by this title.a.copyright law does not preempt state laws with respect to activities violating legal or equitable rights that are not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section.id.b.traditionally,two conditions must be satisfied for a law to be preempted under the federal copyright act.downing abercrombie fitch,cir.first,the content of the protected right must fall within the subject matter of copyright as described in and.second,the right asserted under state law must be equivalent to the exclusive rights contained in section of the copyright act.id.
in this case,the plaintiff lacks standing to bring a claim of copyright infringement under the federal copyright law.the cases cited by sybersound to avoid preemption are inapplicable because they all involve plaintiffs who would have had standing under the federal copyright act,or who pursued claims,firoozye earthlink network,d plaintiff asserted own copyright claim rubin pub.same pmc,saban entm t,th,d,gravaman of complaint was that defendant prevented plaintiff from finalizing a licensing deal,overruled on other grounds,korea supply lockheed martin,cal th,d.
the exclusive rights of copyright owners granted by congress under of the copyright act may only be enforced by an owner or exclusive licensee of the right allowing the litigation of these state claims would defeat congress intent to have federal law occupy the entire field of copyright law.see b perfect,cybernet ventures,d.if we were to permit sybersound claims based on incidences of copyright infringement to proceed,sybersound would be litigating a third party copyright infringement claim under the guise of state law to prevail on either the infringement claim or the claim based on misrepresentations of whether infringement occurred,sybersound would have to prove that copyright infringement occurred.accordingly,the state law claims that necessarily depend on such a showing were properly dismissed.
we now turn to the remaining state law claims.
intentional interference with prospective economic relations 
sybersound alleges that the corporation defendants intended to disrupt,and have disrupted,its business relationships with its customers by engaging in the wrongful acts of misrepresenting to the customers that the corporation defendants are paying all royalties required under their licensing contracts,and that sybersound does not have valid licenses for its songs.
in california,the elements of the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage are 
an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third party,with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff the defendant knowledge of the relationship intentional wrongful acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship actual disruption of the relationship and economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.
korea supply,d,at.
as noted,to the extent an alleged wrongful act by the corporation defendants is based on copyright infringement,it is preempted.
furthermore,sybersound has failed to plead facts either showing or allowing the inference of actual disruption to its relationship with the customers.see silicon knights,crystal dynamics,finding the pleadings insufficient where the complaint alleged only that the misrepresentations induced distributors not to deal with plaintiffs without providing facts alleging an actual disruption to negotiations or potential contracts.in its complaint,sybersound merely states in a conclusory manner that it has been harmed because its ongoing business and economic relationships with customers have been disrupted.sybersound does not allege,for example,that it lost a contract nor that a negotiation with a customer failed.
accordingly,sybersound cause of action for tortious interference wit
