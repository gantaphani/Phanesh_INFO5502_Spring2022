petitioners are news media that disseminate news locally,regionally and nationally.on august,respondent superior court entered an order the order prohibiting media or anyone from publishing any nontilized images of the defendants in a pending criminal proceeding,regardless of the source from which media obtained the images.media petition for a writ of mandate seeks to reverse the order.media argue the order is a prior restraint on free speech invalid under the first amendment to the united states constitution and article i,section of the california constitution.real party in interest michael rose argues a court may prohibit publication of a criminal defendant likeness without offending the federal or state constitutions if that prohibition is necessary to protect that defendant right to a fair and impartial trial.
background 
several juveniles,including rose,were charged as adults with numerous crimes arising out of an attack on migrant workers in san diego county.the attack and resulting criminal charges have been the focus of substantial public interest and extensive coverage by the print and broadcast media.the names,ages and other identifying information of the juveniles have previously been published.
on july,in response to a request to permit coverage of the court proceedings,the court ordered that the media would be permitted in the courtroom and would be permitted to take photographs and videotapes,subject to the requirement that there be no cameras in the hallways and that the defendants faces be tilized in any photograph or videotape obtained in the courtroom.media does not challenge the propriety of the july,order.cal.rules of court,rule.
media obtained photographs of several of the defendants from lawful sources,including school yearbooks and photographs taken outside the courthouse,and published these photographs without tilizing the defendants faces.on august,in response to these publications,rose moved to expand the july,order.rose argued that because the identity of the defendants was an issue in the case,it was necessary to prohibit media from publishing photographs or videotapes of the defendants faces,regardless of the source of the photograph or videotape,to preserve the integrity of the evidence to be used at trial.the court agreed,and on august,enjoined media from publishing any nontilized images of the defendants regardless of the source of those images the court denied media request for modification or reconsideration of the order and media filed this petition for a writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause and held oral argument.
discussion 
an order enjoining publication of a photograph of a suspect in a pending court proceeding is classic prior restraint of speech.smith daily mail publishing,d,citing oklahoma publishing district court,d.prior restraints are one of the most extraordinary remedies known to our jurisprudence nebraska press stuart,d and carry a heavy burden against constitutional validity.id.at.see also gilbert national enquirer,th,d prior restraints are disfavored and presumptively invalid.it is undisputed that the material published by media here,and the future publication of material the order purports to enjoin,was lawfully obtained and truthful information.the publication of lawfully obtained,truthful information about a matter of public significance can not be restrained unless it is necessary to protect a state interest of the highest order.the florida star,d.the courts have consistently struck down similar efforts to enjoin the publication of lawfully obtained information about pending court proceedings.for example,in nebraska press stuart,supra,d the trial court enjoined publication of lawfully obtained,publicly available information relating to a defendant confessions or other strongly implicative information id.at,based on the dangers publication would pose to the defendant sixth amendment rights to a fair and impartial jury untainted by pretrial publicity.the united states supreme court,although articulating a test that might permit prior restraints in rare cases held that the barriers to prior restraint remain high and the presumption against its use continues intact nebraska press,supra,at.the defendants interest in a fair trial did not justify the prior restraint in that case.we are unaware of any case,in either federal or state court,that has upheld a prior restraint under the nebraska press criteria.see dist.for of california cir.
the california courts have likewise repeatedly struck down orders enjoining publication of lawfully obtained information concerning pending court proceedings.for example,in san bernardino county of public social services superior court d,the trial court order allowed the media access to a dependency proceeding but placed restrictions on reporting those proceedings,including a ban on publishing photographs of the minor.the appellate court held that although the media did not have a constitutionally protected right to attend the dependency proceedings in the case,the conditions placed on the media admittance to the proceedings were unconstitutional.the court stated at d,page.
the juvenile court clearly was without the power to restrict the press right to investigate and publish information which it has lawfully obtained.oklahoma publishing district court,supra,d the judiciary can not prohibit the publication of a juvenile name and picture when that information has been lawfully obtained by the media see also,smith daily mail publishing,supra,d.here the court,through its conditions,attempted to prohibit the publication of information without regard to how the press obtained the information.if the information was or is lawfully obtained,it is beyond the juvenile court power to so restrain the press.contrary to its statement that it did not have the power to make a gag order directed to the sun,the court by imposing such conditions for access in effect restricted the sun right to have access to sources of information and to publish information lawfully obtained by it.
similarly,in kgtv channel superior court th,d,a juvenile court held a detention hearing for a minor who was charged with murder.the media had previously published the minor full name and photographs of her in connection with a story about her arrest.the trial court order allowed the media to attend the detention hearing but prohibited the media from publishing her likeness in connection with reports of the hearing.this court concluded the order prohibiting publication of materials obtained from lawful public sources was an unconstitutional prior restraint,reasoning that under smith daily mail publishing,supra,the state interest in protecting and rehabilitating juveniles was insufficient to overcome the media first amendment rights.kgtv channel,supra,at,d.
rose contends the order is valid because it is a narrowly drawn prophylactic measure necessary to protect his constitutional right to a fair trial he argues that because the identity of the perpetrators of the various crimes will be a primary issue at trial,an order prohibiting dissemination of photographs depicting the defendants faces is essential to preserve the integrity of the witnesses testimony concerning the identity of the perpetrators.however,there apparently is no relevant authority upholding a prior restraint the rationale for which is the preservation of the integrity of a witness identification accordingly,we must test the validity of the order under the generic guidelines articulated in nebraska press stuart,supra,d.
although nebraska press did not declare that a prior restraint on reporting criminal proceedings is always void,it established that to uphold a prior restraint on reporting a public criminal proceeding,the court must examine the nature and extent of pretrial news coverage,whether means less onerous than a prior restraint are available to mitigate the dangers to the countervailing interest posed by the pretrial news publicity,and the effectiveness of prior restraint in preventing the dangers created by the publicity.nebraska press stuart,supra,at.in nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,the court addressed the
