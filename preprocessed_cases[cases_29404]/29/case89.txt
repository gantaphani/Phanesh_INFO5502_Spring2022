introduction 
this appeal arises from a decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york stanton,acting under the broadcast music,bmi consent decree to set a rate for music choice licensing of bmi music.the license would apply to bmi music used by music choice on its cable,satellite,and internet services between october,and september.since bmi and music choice were unable to agree on a rate,the consent decree required the court to set one.
the district court entered its first decision setting a rate in.see united states broad.music,civ.lls,wl,dist.lexis july,music choice i.in that decision,the district court rejected bmi proposed blanket license fee of,and fixed the rate at,less than half the rate established in a deal between bmi and dmx,a competitor of music choice.the district court reasoned that the price paid for music by retail customers that was the basis for the rate set under bmi agreement with dmx did not reflect the fair market value of the music to the extent that price included both the cost of the music itself as well as the cost of actually delivering the music to retail customers.the court concluded that the fair market value of the music was better expressed by the wholesale price at which music choice sold to cable and satellite operators.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.on appeal,we vacated and remanded the decision to permit the district court to reassess its calculation of the fair market value of the disputed music rights.see united states broad.music,cir music choice ii.on remand,the district court set the rate incorporating retail value as a component of the value of the music rights.see united states broad.music,civ.lls,wl,dist.lexis may,music choice iii.this appeal followed.because we believe that the district court misinterpreted the scope of our previous opinion,we again remand to permit the district court to exercise its unconstrained reconsideration.
background 
the history of this rate dispute is set out in comprehensive detail in music choice i,music choice ii,and music choice iii.familiarity with these decisions is presumed.music choice transmits different music channels,to listeners televisions via cable and satellite,and to their computers via the internet.music choice is a partnership between subsidiaries of adelphia cable,comcast cable,cox cable,emi group,motorola broadband communications sector,microsoft corporation,sony corporation of america,and time warner.
bmi is one of the two major performing rights societies which license the public performing rights to most copyrighted musical works in this country.ascap,its chief competitor,is the other bmi typically issues blanket licenses to broadcast any and all of the approximately million musical works in its portfolio for a finite period of time.because of the inherently conditions under which bmi and ascap operate,they are regulated by consent decrees.see bmi consent decree ascap consent decree in,the bmi consent decree was modified to create a rate court mechanism to fix reasonable license fees in the event bmi and its customers were unable to do so.from october through january,music choice had an interim license agreement with bmi that was rolled over from month to month.however,when music choice applied to bmi for a blanket license for cable,satellite and internet distribution for the period of october through september,the parties were unable to agree on terms and resorted to the rate court.
a rate court determination of the fair market value of the music is often facilitated by the use of reached after arms length negotiation between other similar parties in the industry.see music choice ii at.a good deal of the previous litigation in this case has focused on which agreements could serve as appropriate benchmarks for music choice and bmi.the main candidates were a licensing agreement between bmi and music choice,a licensing agreement between bmi and dmx the dmx agreement,a licensing agreement between music choice and ascap,and the rate bmi charged its radio and internet licensors 
in proceedings in the district court leading to music choice i,bmi argued that the court should use the dmx agreement as a benchmark and set the rate at of music choice gross revenues.music choice argued unsuccessfully for a lower rate based on what bmi charged radio broadcasters and internet licensees.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.the disagreement between bmi and music choice centered on the question of whether the dmx agreement provided an appropriate benchmark for music choice rate.music choice argued that the dmx agreement resulted from circumstances specific to music choice competitor dmx and did not reflect the relative bargaining positions of music choice and bmi.although bmi and dmx originally had an agreement that was essentially identical to the agreement between bmi and music choice of wholesale revenues plus of the cable operators gross revenues,sometime before the expiration of that agreement,dmx and bmi disagreed whether dmx was obligated to count the cost of hardware sold to retail customers towards the revenues of the retailers of which it was obligated to pay to bmi.in music choice i,the district court found that dmx strained financial situation made it eager to arrive at a deal with bmi,even if disadvantageous,so long as dmx was guaranteed that it would not pay more than its competition.dmx ultimately agreed to pay bmi half the amount bmi claimed it was owed in the hardware dispute,and the parties entered into a new license agreement the dmx agreement which required that dmx pay bmi of gross revenues.
the district court rejected the dmx agreement rate as a basis for setting the rate for music choice.the court reasoned that the dmx agreement was based on the retail price of the music and did not reflect the fair market value of the music to the extent that price included both the cost of the music itself as well as the cost of actually delivering the music to retail customers.it concluded that the fair market value of the music was better expressed by the wholesale price at which music choice sold to cable and satellite operators.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.the district court held that the concept on which the dmx rate agreement the license fees should capture a portion of the cable operators flawed,and should be disregarded in considering that agreement as a reference point.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.the district court appeared to set its final rate,of music choice gross revenues,because that rate reflected dmx rate once the cable operators revenues were removed,id.wl at,dist.lexis at,and was the same rate that bmi charged its internet licensees,id.wl at,dist.lexis at.
on appeal,in music choice ii,we remanded because we concluded that the district court should not have rejected the retail price of music as an indication of its fair market value.we said the district court erred by finding that retail price was not a good indicator of fair market value because the retail seller incurred,and needed to cover,the costs of processes and services necessary to bring the music to market,which were not provided by the copyright holders.music choice ii at.other than that,we express ed no view as to what would be a proper rate.id.at.
on remand and after further,the district court read music choice ii to endorse the dmx agreement as reflecting normal competitive market terms.music choice iii,wl at,dist.lexis at.it then reversed its previous course and adopted the rate of of music choice gross revenues set in the dmx agreement.it reasoned that the range is not novel,but well established in the industry agreements and practices.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.however,the district court reached this contrary conclusion without explaining why its earlier rejection of that rate,including its previous concern about the market conditions surrounding the dmx agreement,was wrong.this appeal followed.
