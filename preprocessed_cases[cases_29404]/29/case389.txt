anthony spinner brings this idea submission lawsuit against american broadcasting company,abc for abc alleged use of his ideas in creating and developing the hit television series lost.spinner submitted a script entitled to abc in,while abc lost was created and developed in and.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of abc.we affirm.
statement of facts 
spinner drafts his script and submits it to abc in 
spinner is a television producer,writer,and former studio executive in los angeles.he was nominated for an emmy for outstanding drama series as the executive producer of the series baretta,an abc television show.spinner is a former creative vice president at fox television.
around,sid and marty krofft television productions,smk approached spinner through his agents because smk and abc were interested in developing a television pilot with spinner.during a meeting with smk,spinner explained that he had always thought about doing people stranded in impossible circumstances,not contemporary,not like a hundred stories like that had been told,and how they would survive and the strange adventures they would meet there.the smk representatives liked the idea.in december,abc entered into an agreement with smk to retain spinner to write a pilot tentatively entitled smk was to pay spinner for his services and invoice abc for that amount.smk and spinner also entered into an agreement for spinner to write a proposed two hour television motion picture presently entitled 
spinner created a outline of characters and conflicts for the pilot and a page synopsis.richard heller of smk delivered these documents to two executives at abc,cliff alsberg and ken gross.at the time,alsberg was vice president of drama development at abc,and gross was director of drama development.spinner met with heller,alsberg,and gross at abc,where they gave him some thoughts and suggestions.he then wrote a page script entitled lost.he met with heller,alsberg,and gross again to discuss the script.they provided some notes on the script,one major point being that they wanted more awe and wonderment.spinner revised the script in response to alsberg and gross notes and submitted the second draft to abc around march or april the script.heller told spinner that alsberg and gross were very pleased with the script 
the script is about a group of eight survivors connected to the olympic team whose plane deep in the himalayas.the plane leaves from the tokyo airport hours after an international competition.five of the survivors are athletes,one is the team physician,one is a television reporter,and one is the pilot.among the athletes is a former military man who assumes leadership of the group,a spoiled rich girl with a drug addiction,and a man who shows a temper and challenges the former military man leadership of the group.the plane radio is smashed in the crash.the survivors must seek shelter,because with the snow and wind,they are certain to freeze to death at the crash site.one survivor goes through a craggy tunnel in the mountainside and comes out the other side in a prehistoric world that looks like a chunk of central africa,except the world is inhabited by dinosaurs and flying reptiles.he returns to the other survivors,who collect a few supplies from the crash site and follow him back to the lost world.as they enter the new world,an avalanche seals the tunnel behind them,cutting off their passage back to their world.the rest of the script tells the story of their attempt to survive in this new world,where they come up against creatures and primitive human beings.
sometime after spinner submitted the script,abc decided to pass on the project.spinner was told the project was far too expensive for abc to produce.spinner never spoke with gross about the script ever again,and he never spoke with alsberg about it again until,after the television series lost had premiered.alsberg left abc in,and gross left abc in.the television series lost was not created until to.
abc record retention schedule with an effective date of january,states that it retains unclaimed scripts scripts not returned to submitters permanently.abc did not return either draft of the script to spinner.
spinner submits a new idea in and 
in,spinner resubmitted his idea to abc.he verbally pitched the script to deborah leoni,then director of drama series development at abc.leoni suggested that he needed a new title and new spin on the project in order for her to be able to sell it to abc.spinner knew he had to change the project to such an extent that it would not be recognized as the script.he then created a new treatment telling a futuristic story that takes place in the outer space treatment.a spaceship bound for the planet lambar crash lands somewhere in the vast jadan galaxy after it is ripped off course by a cosmic storm.six human survivors of the crash and one android member of the crew struggle to survive in their new environment while faced with creatures,alien races,primitives,and other dangers.abc passed on the outer space treatment.in,spinner resubmitted the same treatment to abc,this time to an executive named greer shephard,who had taken over leoni position,as well as to leoni.abc passed again on the outer space treatment in.in response to abc separate statement of undisputed material facts,spinner admitted that the outer space treatment and the lost television show are not substantially similar in either plot,sequence of events,themes,characters,dialogue,mood,setting,or pace.
shephard left abc in.leoni left abc in.leoni and shephard were not involved in the creation,development,or production of the lost television show.neither one shared their communications with spinner or any of spinner writings and ideas with the creators of lost lloyd braun,damon lindelof,abrams,and jeffrey lieber.
spinner has testified unequivocally that he had no contact with the creators of lost.specifically,his deposition testimony was as follows 
you do contend that you ever had any contact with anybody who participated in the production or creation of the lost television show,do you 
never spoke to one of them,never met any of them.
and you do contend that you ever transmitted any of the materials surrounding the script to anybody involved in the production of lost,do you 
i never did.
and you do contend that you ever submitted any of the materials that comprise the outer space treatment to anybody involved in the production or creation of the television program lost,do you 
i do not contend that.
q.in fact,as far as you aware,you never had any contact with anybody involved in the production or creation of lost at all is that right 
that right.
abc develops the lost television show 
lloyd braun 
braun has worked in the entertainment industry for more than years.he first started working for abc entertainment television group in july.he was chairman of abc entertainment television group from january to april.braun does not know spinner and has never communicated in any manner with spinner.prior to this lawsuit,he had never heard of spinner.at no time while he was involved with lost did anyone ever mention to him any script or treatment by spinner,nor did anyone suggest to him that they knew anything about the contents of a script or treatment by spinner.braun has never read spinner script or outer space treatment.he has never spoken with or received any materials from leoni,alsberg,gross,or heller.he has never spoken with or received any materials from shephard regarding any of spinner work or ideas.
around late december,early january,braun was vacationing in hawaii.while sitting on the beach in hawaii,he came up with the concept for lost.the motion picture cast away century fox,about a survivor on a desert island,was on his mind.he thought about the concept of survivors of a crash landing on a deserted island.he also thought about the success of the unscripted reality television show survivor,and decided to marry the two concepts,survivor and cast away,together.he had the title lost in his head from a failed reality television show of the same title.
in july,braun was at a company retreat and pitched the idea of cast away the series to other executives at a brainstorming session.he compared his idea to cast away,survivor,and gilligan island,saying the show could have the inventiveness of gilligan island with a lord of the flies columbia pictures element.he pitched the show as a dramatization of how the castaways survive on the island,and they never make it off the island.the whole brainstorming session,including braun pitch,was transcribed by a reporting service.
jeffrey lieber 
lieber,a writer under contract with spelling entertainment at the time,was eventually assigned to work on a draft pilot for braun idea.lieber does not know spinner and has never communicated in any manner with spinner.prior to this lawsuit,he had never heard of spinner.at no time while he was involved with lost did anyone ever mention to him any script or treatment by spinner,nor did anyone suggest to him that they knew anything about the contents of a script or treatment by spinner.he has never read spinner script or outer space treatment.prior to and during the time he was working on lost,he did not have access to scripts submitted by other writers to abc or scripts stored in abc archives.lieber has never spoken with or received any materials from leoni,alsberg,gross,or heller.he has never spoken with or received any materials from shephard regarding any of spinner work or ideas.
around august,lieber began drafting an outline for braun proposed pilot.his vision for the project was inspired by the novel lord of the flies,which he characterizes as a realistic portrayal of a group of survivors figuring out how to govern and rebuild a society following a disaster.he completed a general outline on or around september.this first outline included core elements such as a small cast of plane crash survivors are stranded on a seemingly deserted tropical island,the use of a plane fuselage as a setting,competition for leadership roles among the survivors,debate over who to save with limited medical supplies,and mystery regarding the main characters backgrounds.in addition,his outline included a group of core characters such as a pregnant woman,an older gentleman who is calm and collected,a con man,a doctor,a drug addict,a military officer,and a spoiled rich girl.
after completing several more drafts of the outline and several drafts of the pilot script,lieber submitted a revised draft of the script entitled nowhere to abc on or about december.around a week later,he learned that braun had issues with the script,and approximately a week after that,he submitted another revised version of the script to abc.shortly after that submission,lieber learned that braun was looking for something different and had decided to work with a different writer.
abrams and damon lindelof 
braun turned to abrams when he was not satisfied with lieber work.abrams has been a writer,producer,and director for television and film for over years.abrams does not know spinner and has never communicated in any manner with spinner.prior to this lawsuit,he had never heard of spinner.at no time while he was involved with lost did anyone ever mention to him any script or treatment by spinner,nor did anyone suggest to him that they knew anything about the contents of a script or treatment by spinner.he has never read spinner script or outer space treatment.prior to and during the time he was working on lost,he did not have access to scripts submitted by other writers to abc or scripts stored in abc archives,with the exception of lieber script.he did not read lieber script,however.abrams has never spoken with or received any materials from leoni,alsberg,gross,or heller.he has never spoken with or received any materials from shephard regarding any of spinner work or ideas.
in early january,abrams received a call from braun regarding his idea for a show about people who survived a plane crash on an island.abrams wanted to work on it but knew he would need someone to help him write it because of his busy schedule he was running another television series at the time,alias.on or about january,abrams attended a meeting to flesh out ideas for the new show.there,he met lindelof for the first time.
lindelof has been a television and film writer for over years.he does not know spinner and has never communicated in any manner with spinner.prior to this lawsuit,he had never heard of spinner.at no time while he was involved with lost did anyone ever mention to him any script or treatment by spinner,nor did anyone suggest to him that they knew anything about the contents of a script or treatment by spinner.he has never read spinner script or outer space treatment.prior to and during the time he was working on lost,he did not have access to scripts submitted by other writers to abc or scripts stored in abc archives,with the exception of lieber script,which he read.lindelof has never spoken with or received any materials from leoni,alsberg,gross,heller,or shephard.
an abc executive contacted lindelof in early january and offered him the opportunity to meet with abrams about possibly working together on a new show.when lindelof and abrams met on january,they immediately connected and started sharing ideas for the show in a fashion.also present at the meeting were two writers and a producer from abrams show,alias,and two executives from abc heather kadin,vice president of drama,and thom sherman,senior vice president,drama development.lindelof and abrams exchange of ideas at that meeting included the following the show would be rooted in mystery such that each character would have a mysterious background and his or her own story to tell the island itself would be a mysterious character,a supernatural place where strange things happened the characters mysterious backgrounds would be revealed through a flashback device,focusing on one character story per episode the show would begin with a man waking up on the island after the plane crash,and the details of the crash itself would gradually be revealed using the flashback device and characters on the show would include other people who were on the island before the plane crash,adding to the mystery of the island.
lindelof drafted six pages of notes memorializing the ideas discussed at the meeting and circulated them by email to abrams and the alias writers and producer late the night after the meeting.the document contained ideas for the overall concept take braun tentpole idea the survivors of a plane crash find themselves on a desolate island in the middle of nowhere and give it legs.the show would explore the unknown,and in addition to the normal rigors of desolate island life,the characters would experience ongoing mysteries.the characters would be enigmatic as well.the document also contained a section entitled characters that set forth some of the main good guys and bad guys,including jack,the male lead,who was to be intelligent,handsome,and a natural born leader,and in later documents is a doctor kate,the female lead and our hero charlie,the antisocial who is still one of the good guys,and in later documents is a drug addict mike and walt,a father and his year old son,who had never had an opportunity to bond until this trip during which their plane crashed sawyer,the heavy,who is competent,charismatic,and able,but shows hints of temper and violence djani,a technically skilled engineer,who in later documents becomes sayid,a former iraqi military officer and shannon,the femme fatale and not your prototypical b ch.finally,the document also contained a section entitled weird s t that might happen in the pilot,including something very big moves through the trees in the distance a horrifying noise wakes everyone up in the middle of the night and then abruptly stops a transmitter can not transmit because a stronger signal transmitting from somewhere else on the island is blocking it,and the characters discover the other transmission is a distress call in french playing on a loop and recorded many years ago in.
time was short if the show was going to be broadcast during the to television season.typically,networks would have already selected scripts for pilots around december,and principal photography would have commenced shortly thereafter.lindelof and abrams were thus tasked with drafting an outline by the end of the week.between january and,lindelof created and circulated at least four separate versions of notes or draft outlines to abrams and the alias writers and producer who were also present at the meeting.on january,lindelof sent a final version of a page outline entitled lost to kadin and sherman at abc.braun also received the outline and thought it was brilliant.he called lindelof the next day and told him abc was going to produce the pilot based solely on the outline.
by january,lindelof had created a rough cast list for the pilot and had started creating character sides for actors to read when auditioning for the show.in february,while they were working on the pilot script,abrams and lindelof were conducting casting sessions for the show,and the actors they liked for certain characters influenced the way they were writing those characters.the evolution of the first draft of the pilot script is documented in the record in january and february,as lindelof finished each act of the script and revised the acts,he sent the drafts by email to abrams and the alias team.abrams and lindelof finished a complete first draft of the pilot script on february,and submitted it to braun,kadin,and sherman.they revised the script numerous times and submitted the final script on april.by early may,they and the lost staff writers had created a bible that provided an overview of the show and described its general format,various elements of the show,character biographies,and approximately ideas for the future of the show.
the pilot for lost premiered in two parts on september and.the series ran for six seasons,with the final episode airing in.
abc searches for spinner work in its records 
lisa petraglia is executive director of legal affairs administration at abc.during the period to,she supervised the searches conducted of abc files for any scripts,treatments,or other works by spinner.abc searched the hard copy and electronic files of the abc personnel involved in the creation of lost,as well as those involved with spinner submission of the script and the outer space treatment.specifically,abc searched the files of the drama development department including the files of gross,alsberg,leoni,shephard,and any files relating to smk,the files of the former literary rights department,and the files of braun,kadin,and sherman,among others.the searches did not yield any iteration of the script.the searches did yield a copy of the outer space treatment,found in leoni files.
procedural history 
spinner filed the operative complaint on july,for breach of contract against abc and touchstone television productions.he alleges that an contract was created between him and abc when abc solicited the script,he submitted the script with the reasonable expectation of payment if abc used it,abc accepted it knowing that he expected payment,and abc used it.he further alleges that abc had access to and used his script to develop and produce the television series lost.he asserts that he is due an ongoing royalty for abc use of the ideas in his script.
on or around august,abc moved for summary judgment on three grounds the creators of lost had no reasonable possibility of access to spinner work lost is not substantially similar to spinner work and,even if there were triable issues of fact regarding access and substantial similarity,the undisputed evidence established that abc independently created lost,and independent creation was a complete defense to the action.the court granted summary judgment in favor of abc and held that abc had negated plaintiff claims by providing sufficient evidence to establish both that it did not have access to plaintiff original script and that the script for lost was created independently.
the court entered judgment on december.spinner filed a timely notice of appeal.

discussion 
generally,there is no property right in an idea.the general rule of law is,that the noblest of human productions knowledge,truths ascertained,conceptions,and ideas become,after voluntary communication to others,free as the air to common use.desny wilder cal d,desny,quoting international news service associated press.nevertheless,the california supreme court held in desny,supra,at pages,that an idea can be the subject of an express or implied contract,and its disclosure and submission can be consideration for a promise to pay compensation.plaintiffs may therefore have a cause of action in contract for disclosing an idea to a defendant that uses that idea without compensation.
in an idea submission case such as this,to prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract,plaintiffs must show they clearly conditioned the submission of their ideas on an obligation to pay for any use of their ideas the defendants,knowing this condition before the plaintiffs disclosed the ideas,voluntarily accepted the submission of the ideas and the defendants found the ideas valuable and actually used them that is,the defendants based their work substantially on the plaintiffs ideas,rather than on their own ideas or ideas from other sources.mann columbia pictures,d,fn.mann.
the summary judgment motion in this case,and thus this appeal,focuses solely on the use element.when plaintiffs do not have direct evidence of use,they may raise an inference of use by showing the defendants had access to their ideas and the defendants work is substantially similar to the plaintiffs ideas.hollywood screentest of america,nbc universal,th,d hollywood screentest teich general mills,d,teich.
even when the plaintiffs raise an inference of use,however,the defendants may dispel that inference with evidence that conclusively demonstrates the defendants independently created their product.teich,supra,d at.when the defendants produce evidence of independent creation that is clear,positive,uncontradicted and of such a nature that it can not rationally be disbelieved,the inference of use is dispelled as a matter of law.see also hollywood screentest,supra,th at,d mann,supra,d at.in such a case,it is appropriate to grant summary judgment on the plaintiffs contract claim on the ground that the use element has been negated by uncontroverted evidence of independent creation.hollywood screentest,supra,at,d.
this is all to say that an issue of fact regarding substantial similarity is not necessarily sufficient to overcome summary judgment when the defendants show as a matter of law that they independently created their product.in an idea submission case,similarities that do not result from copying are similarities without legal significance.teich,supra,d at,quoting with approval the analogous copyright principle that the law imposes no prohibition upon those who,without copying,independently arrive at the precise combination of words or notes which have been copyrighted italics omitted see also mann,supra,d at.similarities between two works were without legal significance when inference of use was rebutted with clear,positive,and uncontradicted evidence of independent creation.in other words,similarity is no longer a material issue when the defendants show conclusively that they independently created their product.
even if we assume for the sake of argument that there are substantial similarities between the script and lost,we agree with the trial court that abc presented conclusive and uncontradicted evidence of independent creation so as to negate the use element of spinner cause of action.moreover,the independent creation defense is bolstered by the fact that spinner evidence of access is actually speculation,conjecture,or guess work,which weakens any inference of use that abc must dispel.
spinner showing of access is insufficient as a matter of law 
we begin with the issue of access.to the extent spinner has established any inference of use,the inference is not based on proof of access.his proof of access is inadequate as a matter of law.
preliminarily,we note that both parties rely on copyright infringement cases in making their access arguments.they do so with good reason.the framework for proving use in an idea submission claim is parallel to the framework for showing copying in a copyright claim.the elements of a copyright infringement claim are ownership of the copyright and actual copying by the defendant.meta film associates,mca,meta film.copying is usually proven circumstantially through evidence of access and substantial similarity.id.at.it therefore comes as no surprise that the parties,as well as the court below,have relied on analogous copyright cases.see nimmer on copyright the law of ideas,b,rel.pub noting that idea submission law borrows liberally from copyright jurisprudence and relying on copyright jurisprudence in discussing access in law of ideas.we likewise look to analogous copyright cases for guidance,in addition to idea submission cases.
access means that the defendants had an opportunity to view or to copy the plaintiffs work.meta film,supra.at.more than a bare possibility of access is required,however.see also mann,supra,d at.when there is no direct evidence of access,the defendants must have had a reasonable possibility to view the plaintiffs work,which must be based on more than mere speculation.meta film,supra,at see also mann,supra,at.
bare corporate receipt of the plaintiffs work may not be sufficient to show access.meta film,supra.at.a reasonable possibility of access requires a sufficiently strong nexus between the intermediary to whom the plaintiffs submitted their work and the creator of the allegedly offending work.id.at merrill paramount pictures,no.cv svw wl merrill.the relationship linking the intermediary and the creator should be more than the simple fact that they share a common employer.meta film,supra,at.for instance,the nexus may be sufficiently strong when the intermediary was in a position to transmit the plaintiffs work to the creator,was a supervisor with responsibility for the creator work,was part of the same work unit,was a contributor of creative ideas or material to the creator work,or was otherwise in contact with the creator regarding some subject matter that overlapped with the plaintiffs work.id.at.in other words,the intermediary and the alleged copier occupy positions such that it is natural for one to impart information to the other.id.at.
here,spinner evidence is insufficient as a matter of law because he relies on a bare possibility of theoretical access premised on mere speculation.his theory of access is that the abc drama development executives who were involved in the creation of lost braun,kadin,and sherman had a reasonable opportunity to view the script because abc had a policy of permanently retaining unreturned scripts,and the script must have been present somewhere in a script library at abc.this is guess work.first,despite the retention policy spinner cites,abc never found the script in its drama development files this is perhaps unsurprising,given the passage of time between spinner submission on the one hand and the creation of lost and this lawsuit on the other.second,spinner refers repeatedly to a script library at abc,but there is no evidence that there was a centralized library of sorts the executives could access and search.compare robinson new line cinema,wl access inferred based on,among other things,direct evidence that script was logged into computerized script library and executive involved in creating infringing work had access to library robinson.the existence of a script library is supposition based on abc policy that it will permanently retain unreturned scripts.
third,the nexus between the people to whom spinner submitted his work and the actual creators of lost does not remotely approach strong.the purported nexus involves several potential intermediaries and several areas of speculation.spinner submitted the script to abc executives alsberg and gross.they both left abc in the.leoni,the executive to whom spinner verbally repitched his idea in the early,left abc in.braun,who conceived of the general concept for lost,first started working for abc in.although these individuals shared abc as an employer and drama development as a work unit,they were not employed at the same time,and in the case of alsberg and gross,the people who actually received the script,their employment at abc ended decades before braun employment and the creation of lost.thus,alsberg,gross,and leoni were in no position to transmit spinner work to braun and the other creators lieber,abrams,and lindelof.indeed,none of these creators state they have ever spoken with or received any materials from alsberg,gross,or leoni.there is therefore no evidence that alsberg,gross,and leoni had contact with the creators such that they could contribute ideas to lost.and they certainly did not have supervisory responsibility over the creators of lost.these potential intermediaries simply did not occupy positions such that it would be natural for them to impart information to the lost creators.meta film,supra.at.
to the extent spinner is suggesting that kadin and sherman are potential intermediaries because these executives had supervisory responsibility over lost,sat in on the initial meeting between lindelof and abrams,and reviewed lindelof and abrams work,there is also no evidence that these executives had any contact with the original intermediaries who actually received spinner work.any theory of transmission is,again,speculation.spinner theory of access always comes back to the bare possibility that kadin,sherman,or braun had access to the script through an imagined script library,and they then conveyed his ideas to lieber,abrams,and lindelof.this theory is simply not supported by any evidence.mann,supra,d at.mere possibilities do not afford the basis for factual inferences.
this is made all the more apparent when we compare this case to the case on which spinner relies for his script library theory,robinson.in robinson,the court held that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to reasonable possibility of access for several reasons.robinson,supra,wl.the intermediary who received the plaintiff work and the executive responsible for the allegedly infringing product worked for the same company at the same time and were only two floors apart.ibid.both of them attended the same weekly meeting for executives.ibid.and it was undisputed that the intermediary received the plaintiff script and had the details of the script submission logged into their employer computerized script library,which was accessible to the other executive.ibid.robinson is distinguishable not only because the evidence suggested the intermediary and the creator could have crossed paths and traded information,but also because direct evidence showed that a script library existed and the plaintiff script was entered into it.we have no comparable evidence here.
besides his main theory regarding the script library,spinner also argues that access can be inferred from the speed of lost creation.he asserts that the four days lindelof and abrams took to draft the initial outline and the overnight decision to produce the pilot based on the outline alone was unprecedented.even if we assume that this was unprecedented timing for creating a page outline and making a decision,these facts alone do not give rise to a reasonable inference of access.the evidence shows that abc was,indeed,trying to move with speed because it hoped to produce lost for the to television season,and the creators were already behind if this was the case.moreover,the single case that spinner cites for this argument is distinguishable in that the inference of access arose not from the short creative time frame alone other facts showed the plaintiff work was widely disseminated and the alleged infringers had the opportunity to view that work.jb oxford first tennessee bank national d.
in sum,spinner has shown only a bare possibility of access based on speculation,supposition,and guess work.he has not shown a reasonable possibility of access as a matter of law.see meta film,supra.at evidence of access insufficient as a matter of law when only connection between intermediary and studio that created allegedly infringing work was that intermediary was under contract with studio regarding other projects and had an office on studio lot.any inference of use,therefore,would have to be based on substantial similarity alone.
abc evidence of independent creation is uncontroverted and dispels any inference of use as a matter of law 
assuming for the purposes of argument that substantial similarity between the script and lost gives rise to an inference of use,abc has proffered uncontradicted evidence that it independently created lost.
we begin with the two published california decisions discussing independent creation at length.teich,supra,d at pages,set forth the independent creation defense to an idea submission lawsuit.see also id.at,d oes proof that there was no copying of plaintiff product make a complete defense,although the thing actually used by defendant was closely similar to the one which plaintiff had presented to it the authorities require an affirmative answer.in that case,teich developed an idea for a gadget that made sun pictures,consisting of a black opaque envelope containing a collapsed cardboard holder,a negative,which was a picture printed on cellophane,and two pieces of sensitized paper.id.at.the gadget printed the negative picture on the sensitized paper upon exposure to the sun.ibid.teich submitted this idea to general mills with the thought that it could be used as a cereal box prize.id.at.on july,teich met with an advertising and sales promotion manager of a division of general mills in his san francisco office.the manager expressed approval of the gadget and asked teich to work on some improvements.ibid.teich left some samples with the manager.d at.he made several attempts to contact the manager after that meeting,but he was unsuccessful.id.at.in january,teich saw that general mills was offering in one of its cereals a magic sun picture,which bore a marked similarity to his gadget.ibid.the basic principle was the same but there were differences in details,though the differences were insignificant.id.at.
