we must decide whether a rock band unauthorized use of an artist illustration in the video backdrop of its stage show was a fair use under copyright law.
plaintiff derek seltzer is an artist and illustrator.in,he created scream icon,a drawing of a screaming,contorted face.seltzer made copies of scream icon,including large posters and smaller prints with adhesive backs,which he has sold and given away.see appendix a.many scream icon posters have been plastered on walls as street art in los angeles and elsewhere.since then,seltzer has moved on to other projects,but at times he has used scream icon to identify himself and his work presence by placing it on advertisements for his gallery appearances,and at some point he licensed it for use in a music video.
defendant roger staub is a photographer and professional and video designer.in,staub photographed a brick wall at the corner of sunset boulevard and gardner avenue in los angeles which was covered in graffiti and posters including a weathered and torn copy of scream icon.see appendix staub found it interesting and saved this picture in his personal library.
defendant green day is a rock band,and defendants billie joe armstrong,michael pritchard,and frank wright are its musicians.green day has sold over million records worldwide since its debut in.in may of,green day released its eighth studio album,century breakdown.in anticipation of the tour in support of this album,green day engaged defendant performance environment design ped to create the lighting,pyrotechnic effects,and video backdrops for the concert.subsequently,ped arranged for staub to create the video backdrops for green day performances.
staub created a video backdrop for each of the songs on green day set list.before making these backdrops,staub repeatedly listened to century breakdown and studied the album art,which uses graffiti and street art as significant visual elements.
one of the songs for which staub created a backdrop was the eighth song on the album,entitled east jesus nowhere.staub stated goal was to convey the song mood,tone or themes.according to staub,the theme of the song is the hypocrisy of some religious people who preach one thing but act otherwise the song is about the violence that is done in the name of religion.
what staub ultimately created for this song is the work at the heart of this case,an approximately video.the video depicts a brick alleyway covered in graffiti.as east jesus nowhere is performed,several days pass at an accelerated pace and graffiti artists come and go,adding new art,posters,and tags to the brick alleyway.the graffiti includes at least three images of jesus christ,which are defaced over the course of the video.throughout the video,the center of the frame is dominated by an unchanging,but modified,scream icon.staub used the photograph he had taken at sunset and gardner,cut out the image of scream icon and modified it by adding a large red cross over the middle of the screaming face.he also changed the contrast and color and added black streaks running down the right side of the face.staub image further differs from scream icon because staub original photograph was of a weathered,slightly defaced,and torn poster.scream icon is nonetheless clearly identifiable in the middle of the screen throughout the video.
staub video backdrop was played behind green day during the performance of east jesus nowhere at approximately seventy concerts from july,through november,and also during green day performance of the song at the mtv video music awards on september.at some point,seltzer became aware that green day was using his art and on september,he wrote the band an alerting them to their unauthorized use stating that he would like to work out a resolution to this issue.apparently no resolution was possible,because on november,seltzer registered a copyright in scream icon,and his counsel sent green day a letter.green day subsequently stopped using the video backdrop.
in march,seltzer filed the instant action.his first amended complaint alleges direct and contributory copyright infringement,violations of the lanham act,and various state law claims.after discovery,defendants collectively,green day moved for summary judgment.they primarily argued that staub video backdrop was fair use under.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment on all claims.
green day then moved for attorneys fees under.the district court found that seltzer claims had been objectively unreasonable and granted the motion in full,awarding the defendants a total of.seltzer timely appeals both the grant of summary judgment and the grant of attorney fees.
the fair use doctrine permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when,on occasion,it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster.campbell acuff rose music,d internal quotation marks omitted.consequently,establishes that fair use of a copyrighted work is not an infringement of copyright and lays out four factors to apply when considering whether the use of a work is fair 
the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for educational purposes the nature of the copyrighted work the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
these four factors must all be explored,and all the results evaluated together,in light of the purposes of copyright.campbell,at.
whether green day use of seltzer scream icon constituted fair use is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.sofa entm t,dodger,cir.where no material,historical facts are at issue and the parties dispute only the ultimate conclusions to be drawn from those facts,we may draw those conclusions without usurping the function of the jury.fisher dees,cir.as the supreme court held in harper row publishers,nation,w here the district court has found facts sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors,an appellate court need not remand for further factfinding but may conclude as a matter of law that the challenged use does not qualify as a fair use of the copyrighted work,d internal alterations and quotation marks omitted.as in fisher,n o material historical facts are at issue in this case.the parties dispute only the ultimate conclusion to be drawn from the admitted facts.at.
the first factor in the fair use inquiry is the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.the supreme court has stated that the central purpose of this factor is to see whether and to what extent the new work is transformative.campbell,at.works of this type lie at the heart of the fair use doctrine guarantee of breathing space within the confines of copyright,and the more transformative the new work,the less will be the significance of other factors.id.internal citations omitted.
although transformation is a key factor in fair use,whether a work is transformative is a often highly contentious topic.see,cariou prince,cir wallace,concurring in part and dissenting in part disagreeing with majority as to whether artists use of certain copyrighted photographs was transformative would remand for further fact finding monge maya magazines,cir,dissenting disagreeing with majority as to whether a magazine publication of wedding photographs was transformative bouchat balt.ravens,cir niemeyer,dissenting disagreeing with majority as to whether the baltimore ravens football team use of a flying b logo was transformative.a leading treatise on this topic has lamented the frequent misuse of the transformation test,complaining that it has become a conclusory label which is all things to all people.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a b,internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at listing cases which have erroneous ly with held the transformative label.
the plethora of cases addressing this topic means there is no shortage of language from other courts elucidating or obfuscating the meaning of transformation.to navigate these treacherous waters,we turn to the most definitive formulation of the test.the supreme court in campbell stated that one work transforms another when the new work adds something new,with a further purpose or different character,altering the first with new expression,meaning or message.campbell,at.this understanding was drawn by the court in large part from second circuit judge pierre leval article in the harvard law review,toward a fair use standard,harv.in that article,judge leval further clarified his understanding of transformative works 
the use must be productive and must employ the quoted matter in a different manner or for a different purpose from the original.a quotation of copyrighted material that merely repackages or republishes the original is unlikely to pass the test in justice story words,it would merely supersede the objects of the original.if,on the other hand,the secondary use adds value to the original if the quoted matter is used as raw material,transformed in the creation of new information,new aesthetics,new insights and understandings this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society.
applying this understanding,green day use of scream icon is transformative.green day used the original as raw material in the construction of the video backdrop.it is not simply a quotation or a republication although scream icon is prominent,it remains only a component of what is essentially a focused music video about religion and especially about christianity images of jesus christ appear and are defaced several times during the course of the video.
the message and meaning of the original scream icon is debatable.to us,it appears to be a directionless anguished screaming face.seltzer himself testified to his view of the meaning of the original piece it addresses themes of youth culture,skateboard culture,culture,it an iconic reference to a culture and time in los angeles when the image was made.but regardless of the meaning of the original,it clearly says nothing about religion.with the cross,in the context of a song about the hypocrisy of religion,surrounded by religious iconography,staub video backdrop using scream icon conveys new information,new aesthetics,new insights and understandings that are plainly distinct from those of the original piece.at his deposition,seltzer seemed to acknowledge as much,when he stated that staub backdrop tainted the original message of the image and made it now synonymous with lyrics,a video,and concert tour that it was not originally intended to be used with.
although the law in this area is splintered,as discussed above,our conclusion on transformation is generally in line with other appellate authority on transformative use.in the typical case,the use is one which makes no alteration to the expressive content or message of the original work.see,monge,at magazine publication of photos of secret wedding of celebrity was not transformative because it did not alter the first work with new expression,meaning or message second alteration in original elvis presley,passport video,cir use of copyrighted clips of elvis television appearances was not transformative when the clips were played without much interruption,if any,and serve d the same intrinsic entertainment value that is protected by plaintiffs copyrights,overruled on other grounds as stated in flexible lifeline,precision lift,cir per curiam news serv.cbs,cir merely plucking the most visually arresting excerpt from lans nine minutes of footage can not be said to have added anything new,as amended cir ringgold black entm t television,cir use of a poster as decoration on a tv show not transformative because it was used for precisely a central purpose for which it was created and defendants had done nothing with the poster to add anything new.
in contrast,an allegedly infringing work is typically viewed as transformative as long as new expressive content or message is apparent.this is so even where as here the allegedly infringing work makes few physical changes to the original or fails to comment on the original.see,cariou,at artist who altered and incorporated several copyrighted photographs into a series of paintings and collages engaged in transformative use as to most of the paintings because the images were presented with fundamentally different aesthetic bill graham archives dorling kindersley,cir use of concert posters in a timeline in a book on the history of the grateful dead was transformative their use was as historical artifacts rather than for artistic expression and promotion blanch koons,cir artist who incorporated and altered copyrighted fashion photograph of a pair of women legs as part of a larger work of art engaged in a transformative use kelly arriba soft,cir use of exact replicas of artist photographs as thumbnail images in a search engine was transformative because their purpose was completely transformed from their original use as fine art news,at inclusion of copyrighted clip in video montage,using editing to increase dramatic effect,was transformative.
we conclude,therefore,that green day use of scream icon was transformative.furthermore,although the statute instructs us to consider the commercial nature of a work and green day concert was undoubtedly commercial in nature the degree to which the new user exploits the copyright for commercial gain as opposed to incidental use as part of a commercial enterprise affects the weight we afford commercial nature as a factor.elvis presley,at.green day use of scream icon was only incidentally commercial the band never used it to market the concert,cds,or merchandise.under these circumstances,the first fair use factor weighs in green day favor.
the second factor that instructs us to consider is the nature of the copyrighted work which recognizes the fact that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others.campbell,at.scream icon is a creative work,meriting strong protection under this factor.
mitigating this factor in favor of green day is that we are instructed to consider the extent to which a work has been published.harper row publishers,at the fact that a work is unpublished is a critical element of its nature.kelly,at.published works are more likely to qualify as fair use because the first appearance of the artist expression has already occurred.kelly,at.here,as in kelly,scream icon was widely disseminated,both on the internet and on the streets of los angeles before green day used it in their concerts.accordingly,seltzer controlled the first public appearance of his work.see harper row publishers,at.this tends to weigh in favor of the fair use of that work.
considering this factor as a whole,it weighs only slightly in seltzer favor.
the third factor looks to the quantitative amount and qualitative value of the original work used in relation to the justification for that use.sofa entm t,at see also campbell,at.this factor captures the fact that an allegedly infringing work that copies little of the original is likely to be a fair use.see,sofa entm t,at holding that ed sullivan introduction of the four seasons band was both qualitatively and quantitatively insignificant.here,green day copied most of scream icon,both quantitatively and qualitatively.
however,unlike an episode of the ed sullivan show or a book manuscript,scream icon is not meaningfully divisible.given that fact,this court has acknowledged that this factor will not weigh against an alleged infringer,even when he copies the whole work,if he takes no more than is necessary for his intended use.kelly,at.as the supreme court has recognized,this factor necessarily overlaps somewhat with the first factor the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use.campbell,at.here,as in kelly,the use of the entire work was necessary to achieve green day new expression,meaning or message.id.at see also kelly,at.
thus,this factor does not weigh against green day.
the fourth factor asks what effect the allegedly infringing use has on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work
