we must decide whether california law allows a celebrity to sue a greeting card company for using her image and catchphrase in a birthday card without her permission.
paris hilton is a controversial celebrity known for her lifestyle as a flamboyant heiress.as the saying goes,she is famous for being famous.
she is also famous for starring in the simple life,a reality television program.the show places her and fellow heiress nicole ritchie in situations for which,the audience is to assume,their privileged upbringings have not prepared them.for example,work.in an episode called sonic burger shenanigans,hilton is employed as a waitress in a fast food joint.as in most episodes,hilton says,that hot,whenever she finds something interesting or amusing.she has registered the phrase as a trademark with the united states patent trademark office.
hallmark cards is a major national purveyor of greeting cards for various occasions.this case is about one of its birthday cards.the front cover of the card contains a picture above a caption that reads,paris first day as a waitress.the picture depicts a cartoon waitress,complete with apron,serving a plate of food to a restaurant patron.an oversized photograph of hilton head is on the cartoon waitress body.hilton says to the customer,do touch that,it hot.the customer asks,what hot hilton replies,that hot.the inside of the card reads,have a smokin hot birthday.
hilton sued hallmark,asserting three causes of action.the first amended complaint alleges misappropriation of publicity under california common law false designation under the lanham act,a and infringement of a federally registered trademark.hallmark filed a motion to dismiss each claim under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.the district court granted one portion of the motion to dismiss the trademark infringement claim,a judgment from which hilton does not appeal.by separate motion,hallmark moved specially to strike hilton right of publicity claim under california statute in both motions,hallmark raised defenses peculiar to each cause of action,some based on the first amendment to the united states constitution and some not.
the district court denied the remaining portions of the motions to dismiss and denied the special motion to strike the claim.it concluded that the defenses required a more inquiry than is permissible at such stage of the case.hallmark timely appeals.
before discussing the merits of this appeal,we must assure ourselves that we have jurisdiction over the appeal of denials of both motions.
as to the special motion to strike,appellate courts generally have jurisdiction only over final judgments and orders.digital equip.desktop direct,d.the collateral order doctrine,however,entitles a party to appeal not only from ordinary final judgments but also from a narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation,but must,in the interest of achieving a healthy legal system,nonetheless be treated as final.digital equip,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we have held that denials of special motions to strike under california statute fall into this narrow class.batzel smith,cir noting that motions to strike assert a form of immunity from suit but englert macdonell,cir holding that the denial of an motion under oregon law is not an appealable collateral order,while recognizing that the denial of a california motion is.thus,we are satisfied that we have jurisdiction to review the denial of hallmark motion under the collateral order doctrine 
denials of motions to dismiss under rule b are ordinarily not appealable,even as collateral orders.see catlin united states.however,we permit the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over otherwise orders that are inextricably intertwined with another order that is properly appealable.batzel,at.this doctrine requires either that we must decide the pendent issue in order to review the claims properly raised on interlocutory appeal or that resolution of the issue properly raised on interlocutory appeal necessarily resolves the pendent issue.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
we first address whether we have jurisdiction over the denial of the motion to dismiss the lanham act claim as an order inextricably intertwined with the motion.
hallmark argues that the defenses it raises to hilton lanham act claim are based on some of the same first amendment concerns that animate its potential defenses to the misappropriation of publicity claim.that may be,but hallmark only moved to strike the misappropriation of publicity claim.indeed,it could not have moved to strike the lanham act claim because,as the parties agree,the statute does not apply to federal law causes of action.see bulletin displays,llc regency outdoor,d.a motion to dismiss one cause of action is not,ordinarily,inextricably intertwined with a motion to strike a different cause of action under california law,even if the two claims are doctrinally similar.
because a federal court can only entertain special motions to strike in connection with state law claims,there is no properly appealable order with which the lanham act claim could be inextricably intertwined.we therefore lack jurisdiction to review it.
what about the denial of the portions of hallmark motion to dismiss pertaining to the misappropriation of publicity claim,the same claim that was the target of the motion 
it is clear that not every motion to dismiss the same claim that underlies an motion is inextricably intertwined with such motion.we have held,for example,that a motion to dismiss for lack of personal is not inextricably intertwined with an motion.batzel,at.in zamani carnes,however,we did review a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,which was made as an alternative to an special motion to strike the same claim,cir.we did it,however,without considering whether we had jurisdiction to do it zamani does not,therefore,compel us to conclude that a motion to dismiss a substantive claim under rule b is inextricably intertwined with a special motion to strike.see,united states booker,cir an assumption is not a holding.we must consider the question for ourselves.
the first type of inextricably intertwined order is one that we must review in order to review the claims properly raised on interlocutory appeal.batzel,at internal quotation marks omitted.resolution of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not a predicate to resolving an motion.as we illustrate in this very opinion,we can proceed directly to the motion without any interference from a motion to dismiss.
an order may also be inextricably intertwined with an immediately appealable one if resolution of the issue properly raised on interlocutory appeal necessarily resolves the pendent issue.id.internal quotation marks omitted.to determine whether a motion to dismiss the pendent issue is inextricably intertwined with an motion to strike the issue properly raised in this sense,we must briefly consider the inquiry associated with an motion.
as we discuss infra,an motion requires the court to ask,first,whether the suit arises from the defendant protected conduct and,second,whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of success on the merits.if the first question is answered in the negative,then the motion must fail,even if the plaintiff stated no cognizable claim.of course,if a plaintiff stated no cognizable claim,then the defendant would be entitled to dismissal under rule b.thus,a rule b motion to dismiss may succeed where an motion to strike would not.
the converse is also true.the second stage of the inquiry determines whether the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.integrated healthcare holdings,fitzgibbons,th,d,internal quotation marks omitted.such test is similar to the one courts make on summary judgment,though not identical.thus,a defendant who has stated a legal claim but has no facts to support it could prevail on an motion,though he would not have been able to win a motion to dismiss.
the foregoing illustrates that neither the denial nor the grant of an motion necessarily resolves,batzel,at,a motion to dismiss regarding the same claim.that is,it is possible for an appellate court to hold that an special motion to strike should be granted or denied without thereby dictating the result of a motion to dismiss the same claim under rule b.our cases make clear that if the properly appealable order can be resolved without necessarily resolving the pendent order,then the latter is not inextricably intertwined with the former.see id.we therefore must conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review that portion of hallmark rule b motion to dismiss the right of publicity claim because it is not inextricably intertwined with any properly appealable order.
having weeded out of this appeal matters over which we lack jurisdiction,we now address the merits of denial of hallmark special motion to strike the claim.
california,like some other states,has a statute designed to discourage strategic lawsuits against public participation.slapps masquerade as ordinary lawsuits but are brought to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.batzel,at internal quotation marks omitted.as california statute explains,the state legislature has found there to be a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for redress of grievances.a.because it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and because this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process,the statute is to be construed broadly.id.
under the statute,
a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
id.b.the phrase act in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue is defined by four specific categories of communications.id.e the relevant one here is the fourth,category any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.id.e.
california courts evaluate a defendant motion in two steps.first,the defendant moving to strike must make a threshold showing that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in subsection e of the statute.equilon,llc consumer cause,cal th,d,quoting b.second,i f the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.navellier sletten,cal th,d.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.wilson parker,covert chidester,cal th,d,internal quotation marks omitted.t hough the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.b.
for hallmark motion to succeed,it must make its threshold showing at step one that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.equilon,llc,d,at internal quotation marks omitted e.the exact inquiry at the first step is somewhat amorphous,but it seems to contain two distinct components.
first,the activity the plaintiff is challenging must have been conducted in furtherance of the exercise of free speech rights.by its terms,this language includes not merely actual exercises of free speech rights but also conduct that furthers such rights.e see also navellier,d,at the california l egislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law.
the california supreme court has not drawn the outer limits of activity that furthers the exercise of free speech rights.it seems to suffice,however,that the defendant activity is communicative,commonwealth energy investor data,th,d,and some courts do not discuss this part of the inquiry at all,see,integrated healthcare holdings,d at not discussing whether an email message was in furtherance of free speech rights.thus,the courts of california have interpreted this piece of the defendant threshold showing rather loosely.see also paul for council hanyecz,th,d,holding that campaign money laundering was in furtherance of political speech but an invalid exercise of free speech rights because it was illegal,overruled on other grounds by equilon enters.llc,d,at.
one sensible place to start is to determine whether the activity in question is speech under first amendment law.here,hallmark card certainly evinces a n intent to convey a particularized message,and in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.spence washington,d per curiam stating requirement for conduct to qualify as speech for purposes of the first amendment.but compare tenafly eruv ass n,borough of tenafly,cir concluding that hurley.gay,lesbian bisexual group of boston,d modified the spence standard,with colacurcio city of kent,cir reiterating the spence standard without any gloss from hurley.whether or not hallmark must show that its card is speech under the spence test or a modification thereof,it certainly suffices that hallmark can make such a showing.
thus,hallmark card qualifies as speech and falls comfortably within the universe of types of communication that california courts have considered conduct in furtherance of the exercise of free speech rights upon which to base motions to strike.
next,hallmark must show that the sale of its card was in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.e.hilton contends that the card merely appropriates the waitress role she played on the simple life.she therefore views this lawsuit as a garden variety private dispute over who profits from her image.according to hilton,the card implicates no issue of public interest because it involves no issue at all,only a celebrity who interests many people 
sitting in diversity,we must begin with the pronouncements of the state highest court,which bind us.see.power,berkeley,cir.the california supreme court has not clearly established what constitutes an issue of public interest,but it has provided some guidance.first,n othing in the statute itself categorically excludes any particular type of action from its operation.navellier,d,at.indeed,t he statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted liability.id.emphasis omitted.thus,the particular cause of action hilton has brought is irrelevant to our decision.ordinary commercial causes of action like breaches of contract,see generally navellier,cal th,d,or indeed misappropriation of publicity,can be strategic lawsuit s against public participation as much as defamation can be,id.at.
second,the california supreme court has declined to hold that the statute does not apply to events that transpire between private individuals.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.that neither hilton nor hallmark are public officials,therefore,can not be dispositive.furthermore,the court has explicitly rejected the assertion that the only activities qualifying for statutory protection are those which meet the lofty standard of pertaining to the heart of.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the activity of the defendant need not involve questions of civic concern social or even topics may suffice.
the question before us is whether the topic,the issue,can be a celebrity like paris hilton,or whether,as hilton agues,it must be the subject of some defined debate.
in interpreting the statute,the california supreme court has insisted on its language,including its preamble.see equilon,d,at when on previous occasions we have construed the statute,we have done so strictly by its terms id.at discussing the addition of the broadly construed language to the statutory preamble as a correction of prior judicial decisions adopting narrowing constructions navellier,d,at rejecting a narrowing construction of the statute because it would contravene the legislature express command that section shall be construed broadly quoting a see also briggs eden council for hope opportunity,cal th,d,construing plain language of the statute in light of the preamble.
that preamble declares it to be in the public interest of the state of california to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance to this end,this section shall be construed broadly.a.the california supreme court has defined significance to mean importance or consequence.briggs,d,at.thus,we must construe public issue or issue of public interest in section e broadly in light of the statute stated purpose to encourage participation in matters of public importance or consequence.
understood this way,the statute does not appear to favor a construction limiting the meaning of issue to a subject of a specific debate.however,we need not rest on the implications of the california supreme court and the statute,which do not definitively answer the question,because we have guidance from the california court of appeals.batlan bledsoe in re bledsoe,cir.
the california intermediate appellate courts have developed multiple tests to determine whether a defendant activity is in connection with a public issue.one commonly cited test comes from rivero american federation of state,county,municipal employees,th,d,concluding that the plaintiff supervision of eight individuals was not a matter of public interest,where people involved had received no public attention or media coverage.there,the court of appeal for the first district surveyed the appellate cases and divined from them three categories of public issues statements concern ing a person or entity in the public eye conduct that could directly affect a large number of people beyond the direct participants or a topic of widespread,public interest.id.at.the fourth district has followed this approach.see,commonwealth energy,d at describing rivero as the first systematic treatment of the public interest aspect of the statute.
by contrast,weinberg feisel,a case from the third district,articulated a somewhat more restrictive test,designed to distinguish between issues of public,rather than merely private,interest.th,d.
first,public interest does not equate with mere curiosity.second,a matter of public interest should be something of concern to a substantial number of people.thus,a matter of concern to the speaker and a relatively small,specific audience is not a matter of public interest.third,there should be some degree of closeness between the challenged statements and the asserted public interest the assertion of a broad and amorphous public interest is not sufficient.fourth,the focus of the speaker conduct should be the public interest rather than a mere effort to gather ammunition for another round of private controversy.finally,a person can not turn otherwise private information into a matter of public interest simply by communicating it to a large number of people.
id.at internal quotation marks,citations,and alteration omitted.
although these approaches do not precisely overlap,we need not decide between them,because hallmark birthday card satisfies both tests.
hallmark card falls into either the first or third categories that rivero outlined statements concern ing a person or entity in the public eye or a topic of widespread,public interest,d at,respectively.there is no dispute that hilton is a person in the public eye and a topic of widespread,public interest,and that she was such well before this controversy thus,hallmark card is in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,e,under rivero.
although the application of the weinberg test presents a closer call,we conclude it comes to the same result again,there is no dispute that paris hilton career is something of concern to a substantial number of people,weinberg,d at.the connection between the challenged statements the birthday card and the asserted public interest hilton life,image,and direct.id.after all,the card spoofs hilton persona.there was no preexisting controversy between hallmark and hilton,so the fourth and fifth considerations that the weinberg court considered are inapposite.see id.at.
weinberg does caution,however,that public interest does not equate with mere curiosity.id.at citing time,firestone,d.however,this warning comes in the context of weinberg insistence that courts apply the statute only to public,not to private matters.thus,weinberg elaborated that a public controversy does not equate with any controversy of interest to the public for example,a divorce action between the scion of one of america wealthier industrial families and his palm beach society wife may have piqued the public interest but was not a public controversy.id.at internal citations omitted.we read this to mean that a private controversy,even between famous people,that interests the public is not enough.under weinberg,for the activities of celebrities to be a public issue,the activities,as well as the personages involved must be public.
this limitation does not apply here,however.hallmark card does not spoof some personal detail of hilton life such as a divorce,it spoofs her trademark phrase and her public very things that interest people about her.thus,weinberg,too,supports hallmark position that its card deals with a public issue.
du charme international brotherhood of electrical workers,th,d,is not to the contrary.hilton contends that du charme requires some sort of ongoing controversy,dispute or discussion which effects sic the public.this overstates the rule of du charme.such case held that 
in order to satisfy the public of public interest requirement of subdivision e and of the statute,in cases where the issue is not of interest to the public at large,but rather to a limited,but definable portion of the public a private group,organization,or community,the constitutionally protected activity must,at a minimum,occur in the context of an ongoing controversy,dispute or discussion 
id.at emphasis added.
subsequent california appellate courts have honored this clear limitation of du charme.see,fitzgibbons,d at du charme contrasted its situation with matters of widespread public interest internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,hallmark need not show that its card commented on any ongoing public controversy to make the threshold showing under du charme because,as she has acknowledged,hilton privileged lifestyle and her catchphrase that hot are matters of widespread public interest.
in short,all of the various approaches that california appellate courts have used to define public issue or an issue of interest to the public appear to support the conclusion that hallmark birthday card is indeed in connection with such an issue.that the card is a commercial product and hilton lawsuit a dispute over who can profit from her image does not defeat hallmark ability to make its threshold showing.we therefore conclude that hallmark has shown that hilton suit for misappropriation of publicity arises from conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.a,e.
hallmark,however,has only passed the threshold.t he statute does not bar a plaintiff from litigating an action that arises out of the defendant free speech or petitioning it subjects to potential dismissal only those actions in which the plaintiff can not state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.navellier,d,at internal citations,quotation marks,and alternations omitted.at this second step of the inquiry,the required probability that hilton will prevail need not be high.the california supreme court has sometimes suggested that suits subject to being stricken at step two are those that lack even minimal merit.id.at.
hilton claim is for misappropriation of the common law right of publicity.see generally eastwood superior court,d,superseded by statute,cal,as recognized in knb enters.matthews,th,d.the elements of the claim under california law are the defendant use of the plaintiff identity the appropriation of plaintiff name or likeness to defendant advantage,commercially or otherwise lack of consent and resulting injury.downing abercrombie fitch,cir internal quotation marks omitted.hallmark has not disputed that hilton can meet these elements.instead,hallmark claims two affirmative defenses under california law,both based on the first amendment the transformative use defense and the public interest defense we discuss each in turn.
under california law,when an artist is faced with a right of publicity challenge to his or her work,he or she may raise as an affirmative defense that the work is protected by the first amendment inasmuch as it contains significant transformative elements or that the value of the work does not derive primarily from the celebrity fame.comedy iii,gary saderup,cal th,d.this transformative use defense poses what is essentially a balancing test between the first amendment and the right of publicity.winter dc comics,cal th,d,internal quotation marks omitted.
the application of the defense,which the california supreme court based loosely on the intersection of the first amendment and copyright liability depends upon whether the celebrity likeness is one of the raw materials from which an original work is synthesized,or whether the depiction or imitation of the celebrity is the very sum and substance of the work in question.comedy iii,d,at.in other words,w e ask whether a product containing a celebrity likeness is so transformed that it has become primarily the defendant own expression rather than the celebrity likeness.and when we use the word expression,we mean expression of something other than the likeness of the celebrity.id.u nder this test,yet another formulation cautions,when an artist skill and talent is manifestly subordinated to the overall goal of creating a conventional portrait of a celebrity so as to commercially exploit his or her fame,then the artist right of free expression is outweighed by the right of publicity.id.at.
the potential reach of the transformative use defense is broad.the form of the expression to which it applies is not confined to parody and can take many forms,including fictionalized portrayal lampooning and subtle social criticism.id.at citations omitted.nor should courts be concerned with the quality of the artistic forms of expression fully qualify for first amendment protection.id.it is thus irrelevant whether hallmark card qualifies as parody or art.nor does it matter that hallmark sought to profit from the card the only question is whether the card is transformative.winter,d,at the question is whether the work is transformative,not how it is marketed.
we think it clear that hallmark may raise the transformative use defense.the applicability of the defense,however,does not preclude hilton from showing the minimal merit needed to defeat hallmark motion to strike only if hallmark is entitled to the defense as a matter of law can it prevail on its motion to strike.in this context,we note that comedy iii envisioned the application of the defense as a question of fact.see d,at although the distinction between protected and unprotected expression will sometimes be subtle,it is no more so than other distinctions triers of fact are called on to make in first amendment jurisprudence.emphasis added.thus,hallmark is only entitled to the defense as a matter of law if no trier of fact could reasonably conclude that the card was not transformative.
case law provides two useful data points for such inquiry.in comedy iii,the california supreme court held that literal,conventional depictions of the three stooges,drawn in charcoal and sold on,make no significant transformative or creative contribution.d,at.thus it is clear that merely merchandising a celebrity image without that person consent,the prevention of which is the core of the right of publicity,does not amount to a transformative use.
winter furnishes a counter example.there,the california supreme court held that the publisher of a comic book was entitled to summary judgment on the grounds of the transformative use defense.the cover of the comic book showed cartoon figures based on two musicians johnny and edgar winter that were distorted for purposes of lampoon,parody,or caricature and drawn as and half worm characters in a larger story.at.the court held the cartoon characters were sufficiently transformative to defeat a right of publicity action brought by the entirely human persons on which they were based.id.
comedy iii and winter,then,bookend the spectrum on which hallmark birthday card is located.winter provides an example of a use that is transformative as a matter of law comedy iii illustrates one that is not.as long as hallmark card is not in the same category as the comic book in winter,then the motion to strike must be denied.for if the card is neither legally transformative nor legally not transformative,then hilton has shown some probability of success because a trier of fact might reasonably consider the card to be not transformative.see cal.civ.b.
hilton basic contention is that hallmark lifted the entire scene on the card from the simple life episode,sonic burger shenanigans.the conceit behind the program was to place hilton and her friend nicole ritchie into the life of an average person,including working for a living.in the episode,the women work at a restaurant.they cruise up to customers cars on roller skates and serve them their orders.true to form,hilton occasionally remarks that a person,thing,or event is hot.
hallmark card,hilton claims,is a of this episode.hallmark maintains that its card is transformative because the setting is different and the phrase,that hot,has become a literal warning about the temperature of a plate of food.
to be sure,there are some differences between the waitressing hilton does in the simple life episode and the portrayal in hallmark card.hilton uniform is different,the style of the restaurant is different service rather than service,and the food is different rather than bacon and eggs.in the card,the body underneath hilton head is a cartoon drawing of a generic female body rather than a picture of hilton real body.finally,hilton catchphrase appears consistently in its familiar,idiomatic meaning.despite these differences,however,the basic setting is the same we see paris hilton,born to privilege,working as a waitress.
we need not decide whether these differences render hallmark card transformative.they are far afield from the total,phantasmagoric conversion of the musicians into the comic book characters at issue in winter.although the evocation of the musicians in that case was less than subtle,they were merely part of the raw materials from which a larger story,which is itself quite expressive,w as synthesized.winter,d,at.there is no larger story here,just a spoof on a scene from hilton television program.that hilton body is a cartoon representation of a human being in a waitress outfit,instead of a photograph of hilton actual body,does not suffice to analogize this case to winter.the cartoon representations in win
