in this case,a heartfelt plea for personal protection is juxtaposed with the limits of copyright law and fundamental principles of free speech.the appeal teaches a simple lesson a weak copyright claim can not justify censorship in the guise of authorship.
by all accounts,cindy lee garcia was bamboozled when a movie producer transformed her acting performance into part of a blasphemous video proclamation against the prophet mohammed the producer now in jail on unrelated matters uploaded a trailer of the film,innocence of muslims,to youtube.millions of viewers soon watched it online,according to garcia.news outlets credited the film as a source of violence in the middle east.garcia received death threats.
asserting that she holds a copyright interest in her fleeting performance,garcia sought a preliminary injunction requiring google to remove the film from all of its platforms,including youtube.the district court denied the injunction,finding that garcia did not establish likely success on the merits for her copyright claim.nor did she demonstrate that the injunction would prevent any alleged harm in light of the film presence on the internet.a divided panel of our court reversed,labeled her copyright claim as fairly debatable,but then entered a mandatory injunction requiring google to remove the film.that injunction was later limited to versions of the film featuring garcia performance.
as garcia characterizes it,the main issue in this case involves the vicious frenzy against garcia that the film caused among certain radical elements of the muslim community.we are sympathetic to her plight.nonetheless,the claim against google is grounded in copyright law,not privacy,emotional distress,or tort law,and garcia seeks to impose speech restrictions under copyright laws meant to foster rather than repress free expression.garcia theory can be likened to copyright cherry picking,which would enable any contributor from a costume designer down to an extra or best boy to claim copyright in random bits and pieces of a unitary motion picture without satisfying the requirements of the copyright act.putting aside the rhetoric of hollywood hijinks and the dissent dramatics,this case must be decided on the law.
in light of the copyright act requirements of an original work of authorship fixed in any tangible medium,a,the mismatch between garcia copyright claim and the relief sought,and the copyright office rejection of garcia application for a copyright in her brief performance,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying garcia request for the preliminary injunction.as a consequence,the panel mandatory injunction against google was unjustified and is dissolved upon publication of this opinion.
background and procedural history 
in july,cindy lee garcia responded to a casting call for a film titled desert warrior,an thriller set in ancient arabia.garcia was cast in a cameo role,for which she earned.she received and reviewed a few pages of script.acting under a professional director hired to oversee production,garcia spoke two sentences is george crazy our daughter is but a child her role was to deliver those lines and to seem concerned.
garcia later discovered that mark basseley youssef nakoula basseley nakoula or sam bacile had a different film in mind an polemic renamed innocence of muslims.the film,featuring a crude production,depicts the prophet mohammed as,among other things,a murderer,pedophile,and homosexual.film producers dubbed over garcia lines and replaced them with a voice asking,is your mohammed a child molester garcia appears on screen for only five seconds.
almost a year after the casting call,in june,youssef uploaded a minute and second trailer of innocence of muslims to youtube,the website owned by google,inc,which boasts a global audience of more than one billion visitors per month after it was translated into arabic,the film fomented outrage across the middle east,and media reports linked it to numerous violent protests.the film also has been a subject of political controversy over its purported connection to the september,attack on the united states consulate in benghazi,libya.
shortly after the benghazi attack,an egyptian cleric issued a fatwa against anyone associated with innocence of muslims,calling upon the muslim youth in america and europe to kill the director,the producer,and the actors and everyone who helped and promoted this film.garcia received multiple death threats.
legal wrangling ensued.garcia asked google to remove the film,asserting it was hate speech and violated her state law rights to privacy and to control her likeness.garcia also sent google five takedown notices under the digital millenium copyright act,claiming that youtube broadcast of innocence of muslims infringed her copyright in her dramatic performance.google declined to remove the film.
on september,garcia first sued google,youssef,and other unnamed production assistants in los angeles superior court.her complaint alleged a compendium of torts and assorted wrongdoing under california law.as against google,garcia made claims for invasion of privacy,false light,and violating her right to publicity.she brought the same claims against youssef and added fraud,unfair business practices,slander,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the state court denied garcia motion for a temporary restraining order and for an order to show cause re preliminary injunction,because she had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits.on september,garcia voluntarily dismissed her state court suit.
one day later,garcia turned to federal court.she filed suit in the united states district court for the central district of california and again named google and youssef as codefendants.garcia alleged copyright infringement against both defendants and revived her state law claims against youssef for fraud,unfair business practices,libel,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
garcia then moved for a temporary restraining order and for an order to show cause on a preliminary injunction but only on the copyright claim.she sought to bar google from hosting innocence of muslims on youtube or any other website.
on november,the district court denied garcia motion for a preliminary injunction.as an initial matter,the court concluded that garcia ha d not demonstrated that the requested relief would prevent any alleged harm,because,by that point,the film trailer had been on the internet for five months.nor did garcia establish a likelihood of success on the merits.in particular,the district court found that the nature of garcia copyright interest was unclear,and even if she could establish such a copyright,she granted the film directors an implied license to distribute her performance as a contribution incorporated into the indivisible whole of the film.
a divided panel of our court reversed.more than a year and a half after the film was first uploaded,the panel majority first issued a secret takedown order,giving google hours to remove all copies of innocence of muslims from youtube and other platforms.the panel embargoed disclosure of the order until it issued its opinion.the panel later amended the order to allow youtube to post any version of the film that did not include garcia performance.
in its opinion,the panel majority reversed the district court and granted garcia preliminary injunction.garcia google,amended by garcia google,cir.despite characterizing garcia copyright claim as fairly debatable,the panel majority nonetheless concluded that garcia was likely to prevail on her copyright claim as to her individual performance in innocence of muslims.at.in contrast to the district court factual finding of an implied license from garcia to youssef,the panel opinion held that the license ran in the opposite direction youssef implicitly granted garcia a license to perform his screenplay,and that garcia did not grant youssef an implied license to incorporate her performance into the film.id.at.finally,the panel majority held that,because of the death threats against her,garcia had established irreparable harm and the equities and public interest favored an injunction.id.at.the opinion did not address the first amendment consequences of the mandatory takedown injunction,beyond stating that the first amendment does not protect copyright infringement.
judge smith dissented.he wrote that garcia had not met the high burden required for a mandatory preliminary injunction because she was unlikely to succeed on her copyright claim.id.at,dissenting.specifically,garcia was not likely to prove her performance was a work,nor would she likely meet the copyright requirements of authorship and fixation,among other shortcomings with her claim.id.at.in sum,b ecause the facts and law do not clearly favor issuing a preliminary injunction to garcia,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying garcia requested relief.id.at.
we granted rehearing en banc garcia google,cir.
i.the district court decision 
garcia sued under a slew of legal theories,but she moved for a preliminary injunction on just one of them the copyright claim.hence,copyright is the only basis for the appeal.garcia tort allegations and claimed harm resulting from those torts,such as emotional distress do not figure into our analysis.
we begin with the basics.
the district court order denying garcia motion for a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.alliance for the wild rockies cottrell,cir.because our review is deferential,w e will not reverse the district court where it got the law right,even if we would have arrived at a different result,so long as the district court did not clearly err in its factual determinations.id.internal citation omitted.
the supreme court has emphasized that preliminary injunctions are an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.winter nrdc.the district court correctly identified that garcia must satisfy winter test.a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must show that she is likely to succeed on the merits,she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,the balance of equities tips in her favor,and an injunction is in the public interest.farris seabrook,cir citing winter,at.
the first factor under winter is the most important likely success on the merits.aamer obama.cir we begin with the first and most important factor whether petitioners have established a likelihood of success on the merits.because it is a threshold inquiry,when a plaintiff has failed to show the likelihood of success on the merits,we need not consider the remaining three winter elements.ass des eleveurs de canards et du quebec harris,cir quoting dish network,cir.
garcia burden here is doubly demanding because garcia seeks a mandatory injunction,she must establish that the law and facts clearly favor her position,not simply that she is likely to succeed.
why garcia requested injunction required google to take affirmative action to remove and to keep removing innocence of muslims from youtube and other sites under its auspices,whenever and by whomever the film was uploaded.this relief is treated as a mandatory injunction,because it orders a responsible party to take action.marlyn nutraceuticals,mucos pharma gmbh,cir citation omitted.as we have cautioned,a mandatory injunction goes well beyond simply maintaining the status quo pendente lite and is particularly disfavored.stanley of,cir internal citations omitted.the district court should deny such relief unless the facts and law clearly favor the moving party.id.quoting anderson united states,cir.in plain terms,mandatory injunctions should not issue in doubtful cases.park vill.apartment tenants ass mortimer howard trust,cir.
as we shall see,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that garcia was not likely to succeed on her copyright claim much less that the law and facts clearly compel suppression of a controversial and politically significant film.
the central question is whether the law and facts clearly favor garcia claim to a copyright in her acting performance as it appears in innocence of muslims.the answer is no.this conclusion does not mean that a plaintiff like garcia is without options or that she could have sought an injunction against different parties or on other legal theories,like the right of publicity and defamation 
under the copyright act,c opyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression including motion pictures.a.that fixation must be done by or under the authority of the author.benchmarked against this statutory standard,the law does not clearly favor garcia position.
the statute purposefully left works of authorship undefined to provide for some flexibility.see nimmer on copyright.nevertheless,several other provisions provide useful guidance.an audiovisual work is one that consists of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by machines or other electronic equipment,plus accompanying sounds.in turn,a motion picture is an audiovisual work consisting of a series of related images which,when shown in succession,impart an impression of motion,together with accompanying sounds,if any.id.these two definitions embody the work here innocence of muslims is an audiovisual work that is categorized as a motion picture and is derivative of the script.garcia is the author of none of this and makes no copyright claim to the film or to the script instead,garcia claims that her performance itself merits copyright protection.
in the face of this statutory scheme,it comes as no surprise that during this litigation,the copyright office found that garcia performance was not a copyrightable work when it rejected her copyright application.the copyright office explained that its longstanding practices do not allow a copyright claim by an individual actor or actress in his or her performance contained within a motion picture.thus,f or copyright registration purposes,a motion picture is a single integrated work assuming garcia contribution was limited to her acting performance,we can not register her performance apart from the motion picture.
we credit this expert opinion of the copyright office the office charged with administration and enforcement of the copyright laws and registration see inhale,starbuzz tobacco,cir.the copyright office position reflects a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.southco,kanebridge,cir en banc alito,quoting yates.hendon,
in analyzing whether the law clearly favors garcia,aalmuhammed lee,cir,provides a useful foundation.there,we examined the meaning of work as the first step in analyzing joint authorship of the movie malcolm x.the copyright act provides that when a work is prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole,the work becomes a joint work with two or more authors.emphasis added.garcia unequivocally disclaims joint authorship of the film.
in aalmuhammed,we concluded that defining a work based upon some minimal level of creativity or originality would be too broad and indeterminate to be useful.at internal quotation marks omitted.our animating concern was that this definition of work would fragment copyright protection for the unitary film malcolm x into many little pieces 
so many people might qualify as an author if the question were limited to whether they made a substantial creative contribution that that test would not distinguish one from another.everyone from the producer and director to casting director,costumer,hairstylist,and best boy gets listed in the movie credits because all of their creative contributions really do matter.
garcia theory of copyright law would result in the legal morass we warned against in aalmuhammed splintering a movie into many different works,even in the absence of an independent fixation.simply put,as google claimed,it make s swiss cheese of copyrights.
take,for example,films with a large cast the proverbial cast of thousands such as ben hur or lord of the rings the silent epic ben hur advertised a cast of people.in the lord of the rings trilogy,extras tramped around middle earth alongside frodo baggins played by elijah wood.treating every acting performance as an independent work would not only be a logistical and financial nightmare,it would turn cast of thousands into a new mantra copyright of thousands.
the dissent spins speculative hypotheticals about copyright protection for book chapters,movie outtakes,baseball games,and jimi hendrix concerts.see dissent at.this hyperbole sounds a false alarm.substituting moral outrage and colorful language for legal analysis,the dissent mixes and matches copyright concepts such as collective works,derivative works,the requirement of fixation,and sound recordings.the statutory definitions and their application counsel precision,not convolution.see.the citation to effects associates,cohen,cir kozinski,is particularly puzzling.there,neither party disputed the plaintiff copyright,and the plaintiff independently fixed the footage and licensed it to the filmmakers.see id.at 
the reality is that contracts and the doctrine govern much of the hollywood performance and production world.see nimmer on copyright b.absent these formalities,courts have looked to implied licenses.see effects,at.indeed,the district court found that garcia granted youssef just such an implied license to incorporate her performance into the film but these legal niceties do not necessarily dictate whether something is protected by copyright,and licensing has its limitations.as filmmakers warn,films rarely use licenses.even if filmmakers diligently obtain licenses for everyone on set,the contracts are not a panacea.content distributors,like youtube and netflix,wo have easy access to the licenses litigants may dispute their terms and scope and actors and other content contributors can terminate licenses after thirty five years.see a.untangling the complex,and often phantom chain of title to tens,hundreds,or even thousands of standalone copyrights is a task that could tie the distribution chain in knots.and filming group scenes like a public parade,or the march on washington,would pose a huge burden if each of the thousands of marchers could claim an independent copyright.
garcia copyright claim faces yet another statutory barrier she never fixed her acting performance in a tangible medium,as required by a work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord,by or under the authority of the author,is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.emphasis added.according to the supreme court,the author is the party who actually creates the work,that is,the person who translates an idea into a fixed,tangible expression entitled to copyright protection.cmty.for creative non violence reid.garcia did nothing of the sort 
for better or for worse,youssef and his crew fixed garcia performance in the tangible medium,whether in physical film or in digital form.however one might characterize garcia performance,she played no role in fixation.on top of this,garcia claims that she never agreed to the film ultimate rendition or how she was portrayed in innocence of muslims,so she can hardly argue that the film or her cameo in it was fixed by or under her authority.
in sum,the district court committed no error in its copyright analysis.issuance of the mandatory preliminary injunction requires more than a possible or fairly debatable claim it requires a showing that the law clearly favor s garcia.see stanley,at.because neither the copyright act nor the copyright office interpretation supports garcia claim,this is a hurdle she can not clear.
irreparable harm 
although we could affirm the district court solely on the copyright issue,see dish network,at,we address irreparable harm because the grave danger garcia claims can not be discounted and permeates the entire lawsuit.
at first blush,irreparable harm looks like garcia strongest argument.garcia understandably takes seriously the fatwa and threats against her and her family,and so do we.the difficulty with garcia claim is that there is a mismatch between her substantive copyright claim and the dangers she hopes to remedy through an injunction.garcia seeks a preliminary injunction under copyright law,not privacy,fraud,false light or any other cause of action.hence,garcia harm must stem from copyright namely,harm to her legal interests as an author.salinger colting,cir the relevant harm is the harm that occurs to the parties legal interests.
looking to the purpose of copyright underscores the disjunction garcia case presents.article,section of the constitution provides that copyrights promote the progress of science and useful arts.hence,the framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression.by establishing a marketable right to the use of one expression,copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas.harper row publishers,nation,see also eldred ashcroft,noting that copyright purpose is to promote the creation and publication of free expression emphasis in original.in keeping with copyright function,the justification of the copyright law is the protection of the commercial interest of the author.it is not to protect secrecy,but to stimulate creation by protecting its rewards.salinger,f d at quoting new era publ ns int l,aps henry holt.
as garcia frames it,the main issue in this case involves the vicious frenzy against garcia that the film caused among certain radical elements of the muslim community,which has caused severe emotional distress,the destruction of her career and reputation and credible death threats.with respect to irreparable harm,she argues that t he injuries she seeks to avoid damage to her reputation,unfair,forced promotion of a hateful film,and death will be avoided if any injunction issues.
this relief is not easily achieved under copyright law.although we do not take lightly threats to life or the emotional turmoil garcia has endured,her harms are untethered from and incompatible with copyright and copyright function as the engine of expression.
in broad terms,the protection of privacy is not a function of the copyright law to the contrary,the copyright law offers a limited monopoly to encourage ultimate public access to the creative work of the author.bond blum,cir see also monge maya magazines,cir quoting bond and pointedly noting copyright cases are analyzed only under copyright principles,not privacy law.
likewise,authors can not seek emotional distress damages under the copyright act,because such damages are unrelated to the value and marketability of their works.see in re dawson,cir noting that actual damages in the context of the copyright act cover only economic damages internal citation omitted mackie rieser,cir rejecting copyright damages where the infringement did not in any way influence the market value of a piece of outdoor artwork but instead boiled down to the author personal objections to the manipulation of his artwork.
by way of example,erstwhile professional wrestler and reality tv star hulk hogan wanted to enjoin from posting a sex tape of hogan with a mistress,claiming copyright infringement.bollea gawker media,llc,d.the district court found an absence of irreparable harm because hogan produced no evidence demonstrating that he will suffer irreparable harm in the copyright sense absent a preliminary injunction.the only evidence in the record reflecting harm to hogan relates to harm suffered by him personally and harm to his professional image due to the private nature of the video content.this evidence does not constitute irreparable harm in the context of copyright infringement.id.at new era publ ns.at denying injunction sought not in good faith for its intended purpose of protecting the value of publication rights,but rather to suppress a derogatory study of the founder of the church of scientology.
privacy laws,not copyright,may offer remedies tailored to garcia personal and reputational harms.on that point,we offer no substantive view.ultimately,garcia would like to have her connection to the film forgotten and stripped from youtube.unfortunately for garcia,such a right to be forgotten,although recently affirmed by the court of justice for the european union,is not recognized in the united states.see case c,google spain sl agencia española de protección de datos aepd,ecli eu c may,requiring google to consider individual requests to remove personal information from its search engine internet law protection of personal data court of justice of the european union creates presumption that google must remove links to personal data upon request,harv.
nor is garcia protected by the benefits found in many european countries,where authors have moral rights to control the integrity of their works and to guard against distortion,manipulation,or misappropriation.see kelley chicago park dist,cir describing differences in moral rights in american copyright law versus other countries.except for a limited universe of works of visual art,such as paintings and drawings protected under the visual artists rights act of,united states copyright law generally does not recognize moral rights.motion pictures specifically are excluded from moral rights protection.w ork of visual art does not include any motion picture or other audiovisual work.
in short,garcia harms are too attenuated from the purpose of copyright.we do not foreclose that in a different circumstance with a strong copyright claim,a court could consider collateral consequences as part of its irreparable harm analysis and remedy.providing that the court may grant injunctions as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.but such a case is not before us.
garcia waited months to seek an injunction after innocence of muslims was uploaded to youtube in july she did not seek emergency relief when the film first surfaced on the internet.the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding this delay undercut garcia claim of irreparable harm.see oakland tribune,chronicle publ g,cir plaintiff long delay before seeking a preliminary injunction implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.nimmer on copyright a c noting unreasonable delay can defeat irreparable injury and the length of time need not be great.garcia notes that she moved swiftly once the film was translated into arabic and sparked death threats against her.but that proves the point the gravamen of garcia harm is untethered from her commercial interests as a performer,and instead focuses on the personal pain caused by her association with the film.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that garcia failed to muster a clear showing of irreparable harm.see flexible lifeline,precision lift,f d,cir harm must be proved,not presumed.quoting nimmer on copyright a.
in the face of a doubtful copyright claim and the absence of irreparable harm to garcia interests as an author,we need not consider the final two winter factors,the balance of equities and public interest.
ii.the panel injunction 
in february,the panel majority issued the following injunction google,shall take down all copies of innocence of muslims from and from any other platforms under google control,and take all reasonable steps to prevent further uploads of innocence of muslims to those platforms.soon after,the panel amended the order to state that the prohibition did not preclude the posting or display of any version of innocence of muslims that does not include cindy lee garcia performance.
although the first order was more sweeping,the second cast the court in the uneasy role of film editor.the amendment only mattered if google assumed authority to change the content of someone else copyrighted film.to no one surprise,the end result was the same the entire film remained removed from youtube.
the takedown order was unwarranted and incorrect as a matter of law,as we have explained above.it also gave short shrift to the first amendment values at stake.the mandatory injunction censored and suppressed a politically significant film based upon a dubious and unprecedented theory of copyright.in so doing,the panel deprived the public of the ability to view firsthand,and judge for themselves,a film at the center of an international uproar.
although the intersection between copyright and the first amendment is the supreme court teaches that copyright is not categorically immune from challenges under the first amendment.eldred,at internal citation omitted.to be sure,this is not a case of copyright infringement,such as seeking to restrain the use of copyrighted computer code.the panel takedown order of a film of substantial interest to the public is a classic prior restraint of speech.alexander united states,temporary restraining orders and permanent injunctions,court orders that actually forbid speech activities are classic examples of prior restraints.prior restraints pose the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on first amendment rights,hunt nbc,cir citation omitted,and garcia can not overcome the historical and heavy presumption against such restraints with a thin copyright claim in a performance.
the amended injunction issued february,is dissolved immediately and has no force or effect.
conclusion 
at this stage of the proceedings,we have no reason to question garcia claims that she was duped by an unscrupulous filmmaker and has suffered greatly from her disastrous association with the innocence of muslims film.nonetheless,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied garcia motion for a preliminary injunction under the copyright laws.
we do have to craft new rules of copyright law to resolve this appeal.we just have to follow the law we established a few years ago,without controversy,on the subject of irreparable harm.the majority decision to do more is a mistake in my view,and not just because much of what the majority says about copyright law may be wrong.see dissent at.we are usually well advised to decide no more than we need to,even when resolving routine appeals typical of those we likely to see in the future.we should be all the more cautious when resolving an appeal like this one,a case that could not be more atypical as far as copyright infringement actions go and one that is highly charged on both sides to boot.because the risk of making bad law in these circumstances is particularly high,we should aim to decide as narrowly as we can,leaving the task of crafting broad new rules for a case in which it is actually necessary to do so.see frederick schauer,do cases make bad law,chi.
had we chosen to decide narrowly here,we could have affirmed the district court denial of a preliminary injunction by focusing solely on the irreparable harm prong.garcia bore the burden of showing that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of the requested injunction.winter natural res.def.council.the only form of injury garcia has alleged that could qualify as irreparable is the risk of death she faces as a result of the fatwa issued against her.unlike the majority,i willing to assume that the risk of death qualifies as irreparable injury in this context.but under our decision in perfect,google,cir,garcia also had to prove a causal connection between the irreparable injury she faces and the conduct she hopes to enjoin.id.at.in other words,she had to show that removing the film from youtube would likely eliminate or at least materially reduce the risk of death posed by issuance of the fatwa.
the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding,albeit for reasons different from those i offer here,that garcia failed to satisfy the irreparable harm prong.the sad but unfortunate truth is that the threat posed to garcia by issuance of the fatwa will remain whether the innocence of muslims is available on youtube or not.garcia is subject to the fatwa because of her role in making the film,not because the film is available on youtube.the film will undoubtedly remain accessible on the internet for all who wish to see it even if youtube no longer hosts it.bottom line garcia requested injunction wo change anything about the content of the film or the part,however limited,she played in its making.
of course,garcia role in making the film has been completely misunderstood.she never actually uttered the highly offensive words her character speaks in the film.she had no idea that the scenes in which she appeared would later be used as part of an diatribe,and she strongly opposes the film message.correcting these misperceptions might well eliminate or reduce the threat garcia faces,but she has already taken numerous steps to do just that.she has publicly denounced the film and done everything within her power including bringing this lawsuit to disassociate herself from the film hateful message.
the declaration submitted by garcia expert on islamic and middle eastern law the only evidence she offered that addresses causation directly candidly describes the tenuous causation theory garcia relies on.garcia expert did not assert that removing the film from youtube would likely cause the fatwa against her to be lifted.he instead noted that garcia public statements condemning the film here have been received in the muslim world with controversy,and opined that removing the film from youtube would cause others to believe that garcia condemnations are sincere if she is successful in pulling the content down from the internet,it will likely help her in terms of believability of her message condemning the film and its message.emphasis added.
in my view,this sparse evidence does not show that removing the film from youtube would be likely to mitigate the risk of death garcia faces.at most,the expert bare assertion establishes that granting the requested injunction will have an incremental but effect on garcia credibility.the declaration notably stops short of suggesting that the injunction would have any impact let alone a likely impact on the actions of the necessary audience the cleric who issued the fatwa and those who would be inclined to carry it out.nor is it obvious why success in getting the district court to order the film removal from youtube would be critical to bolstering the believability of garcia message.demanding the injunction seems to speak loudly and clearly in its own right about the sincerity of her views on the film.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that,on this record,garcia failed to satisfy the irreparable harm prong.under our decision in perfect,that alone requires us to affirm the district court denial of a preliminary injunction.at.i concur in the judgment for that reason only.
garcia dramatic performance met all of the requirements for copyright protection it was copyrightable subject matter,it was original and it was fixed at the moment it was recorded.so what happened to the copyright at times,the majority says that garcia performance was not copyrightable at all.and at other times,it seems to say that garcia just did do enough to gain a copyright in the scene.either way,the majority is wrong and makes a total mess of copyright law,right here in the hollywood circuit.in its haste to take internet service providers off the hook for infringement,the court today robs performers and other creative talent of rights congress gave them.i wo be a party to it.
youssef handed garcia a script.garcia performed it.youssef recorded garcia performance on video and saved the clip.until today,i understood that the rights in such a performance are determined according to elementary copyright principles an original work of authorship,a,requires only copyrightable subject matter and a minimal degree of creativity.feist publ ns,rural.serv.the work is fixed when it is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.and at that moment,the author or authors of the work instantly and automatically acquire a copyright interest in it.a.this is exactly string theory more like copyright.
garcia performance met these minimal requirements the majority does contend otherwise.the majority nevertheless holds that garcia performance is a work,apparently because it was created during the production of a film,innocence of muslims.but if you say something is not a work,it means that it is copyrightable by anyone.under the majority definition of work,no one not even youssef can claim a copyright in any part of garcia performance,even though it was recorded several months before innocence of muslims was assembled.instead,innocence of muslims the ultimate film is the only thing that can be a work.if this is what my colleagues are saying,they are casting doubt on the copyrightability of vast swaths of material created during production of a film or other composite work.
the implications are daunting.if garcia scene is not a work,then every take of every scene of,say,lord of the rings is not a work,and thus not protected by copyright,unless and until the clips become part of the final movie.if some dastardly crew member were to run off with a copy of the battle of morannon,the dastard would be free to display it for profit until it was made part of the final movie.and,of course,the,the alternative scenes,the special effects never used,all of those things would be fair game because none of these things would be works under the majority definition.and what about a draft chapter of a novel is there no copyright in the draft chapter unless it gets included in the published book or if part of the draft gets included,is there no copyright in the rest of it 
this is a remarkable proposition,for which the majority provides remarkably little authority.aalmuhammed lee,cir,the only case that the majority cites,says just the opposite.in aalmuhammed,we considered a claim by a contributor to the movie malcolm x that he was a joint author of the entire movie.id.at.everyone in aalmuhammed agreed that the relevant work was malcolm x.the only question was whether the contributor was a joint author of that work.we went out of our way to emphasize that joint authorship of a movie is a different question from whether a contribution to the movie can be a work under section a.id.at.and we clearly stated that a contribution to a movie can be copyrightable and thus can be a work.id.at.
the majority newfangled definition of work is directly contrary to a precedent that has never been questioned,effects associates,cohen,cir.there,we held that a company that created special effects footage during film production retained a copyright interest in the footage even though it became part of the film.id.at see also oddo ries,cir.the majority tries to distinguish effects associates by arguing that the footage there was a standalone work that was separately fixed and incorporated into a film.maj.but garcia performance was also separately fixed and incorporated into innocence of muslims.why then are the seven shots featuring great gobs of alien yogurt oozing out of a defunct factory interspersed in the stuff,at,any more a standalone work than garcia performance youssef was required to use any part of garcia performance in the film he could have sold the video clip to someone else.the clip might not have had much commercial value,but neither did the special effects scenes in effects associates.nothing in the copyright act says that special effects scenes are works entitled to copyright protection but other scenes are not.and what about scenes that have actors and special effects are those scenes entitled to copyright protection as in effects associates,or are they denied copyright protection like garcia scene 
a.the majority also seems to hold that garcia is not entitled to copyright protection because she is not an author of the recorded scene.according to the majority,garcia ca be an author of her own scene because she played no role in her performance fixation.
but a performer need not operate the recording equipment to be an author of his own performance.see,at,at see also nimmer on copyright a at to.without garcia performance,all that existed was a script.to convert the script into a video,there needed to be both an actor physically performing it and filmmakers recording the performance.both kinds of activities can result in copyrightable expression.see nimmer on copyright f at to discussing baltimore orioles,major league baseball players ass n,cir garcia performance had at least some minimal degree of creativity apart from the script and youssef direction.see feist,at.one p ersonality always contains something unique.it expresses its singularity even in handwriting,and a very modest grade of art has in it something which is one man alone.bleistein donaldson lithographing.to dispute this is to claim that gone with the wind would be the same movie if rhett butler were played by peter lorre.
actors usually sign away their rights when contracting to do a movie,but garcia did and she was youssef employee.i therefore find that garcia acquired a copyright in her performance the moment it was fixed.when dealing with material created during production of a film or other composite work,the absence of a contract always complicates things.see effects associates,at moviemakers do lunch,not contracts.without a contract the parties are left with whatever rights the copyright law gives them.it not our job to take away from performers rights congress gave them.did jimi hendrix acquire no copyright in the recordings of his concerts because he did run the recorder in addition to playing the guitar garcia may not be as talented as hendrix who is but she no less entitled to the protections of the copyright act.
b.while the copyright office claims that its longstanding practices do recognize garcia copyright interest,it does seem that the register of copyrights got the memo.the register was a member of the delegation that signed the beijing treaty on audiovisual performances.see copyright office,annual report of the register of copyrights.the treaty would recognize garcia rights in her performance.it provides that performers have the exclusive right of authorizing the fixation of their unfixed performances,and reproduction of their performances fixed in audiovisual fixations,in any manner or form.world intellectual property organization,beijing treaty on audiovisual performances,ii.
the patent office,which led the delegation,states that law is generally compatible with the treaty,as actors and musicians are considered to be authors of their performances providing them with copyright rights.patent trademark office,background and summary of the wipo audiovisual performances treaty.although the copyright office has issued a statement of compatibility,it hard to believe that it would sign on if it believed that the treaty key provisions are inconsistent with copyright law.in fact,the copyright office praised the treaty as an important step forward in protecting the performances of television and film actors throughout the world.copyright office,newsnet beijing audiovisual performances treaty.except in the ninth circuit.
the copyright office position is thus inconsistent at best.and,in any event,neither the copyright office reasoning nor the authority it relies on in its letter to garcia fare any better than the majority.the copyright office would refuse copyright registration to an actor like garcia because an actor or an actress in a motion picture is either a joint author in the entire work or,as most often is the case,is not an author at all by virtue of a work made for hire agreement.however,garcia is a joint author of the entire movie and did sign any agreements.she does fit into either category.like the majority,the copyright office would wish this problem away by refusing registration unless the copyright claimant personally recorded his performance.but nothing in the legislative history relied on by the copyright office which concerned joint authorship of an entire film suggests that a does retain any copyright interest in a video clip of his acting performance because it recorded by the film producer.see,at.
the harm the majority fears would result from recognizing performers copyright claims in their fixed,original expression is overstated.the vast majority of copyright claims by performers in their contributions are defeated by a contract and the work for hire doctrine.see nimmer on copyright b at to william patry,patry on copyright.and most of the performers that fall through the cracks would be found to have given an implied license to the film producers to use the contribution in the ultimate film.see effects associates,at.very few performers would be left to sue at all,and the ones that remain would have to find suing worth their while.they would be able to claim the valuable rights of joint authorship of the movie,such as an undivided share in the movie or the right to exploit the movie for themselves.see nimmer on copyright at to.rather,their copyright claims would be limited to the original expression they created.see aalmuhammed,at effects associates,at.which is why filmmaking has ground to a halt even though we held a ago that where a contributes to a book or movie,the exclusive rights of copyright ownership vest in the creator of the contribution,unless there is a written agreement to the contrary.effects associates,at.
regardless,the supreme court has reminded us that speculation about future harms is no basis for courts to shrink authorial rights.times tasini.in tasini,freelance authors argued that the inclusion in databases of their articles that originally appeared in periodicals infringed their copyrights in the works.id.at.publishers warned that devastating consequences,including massive damages awards,would result if the court were to hold for the freelancers.id.at.the court nonetheless held for the freelancers,turning back the parade of horribles deployed by the publishers.the court explained that there are numerous models for distributing copyrighted works and remunerating authors for their distribution.id.at.tasini is a powerful reminder that movie producers,publishers and distributors will always claim that the sky is falling in cases that might recognize an individual contributor copyright interest in material he created they will always say,as google says here,that holding in the contributor favor will make swiss cheese of copyrights.
but under our copyright law,the creators of original,copyrightable material automatically acquire a copyright interest in the material as soon as it is fixed.there no exception for material created during production of a film or other composite work.when modern works,such as films or plays,are produced,contributors will often create separate,copyrightable works as part of the process.our copyright law says that the copyright interests in this material vest initially with its creators,who will then have leverage to obtain compensation by contract.the answer to the swiss cheese bugbear is for courts to limit who can acquire copyrights in order to make life simpler for producers and internet service providers.it for the parties to allocate their rights by contract.see effects associates,at.google makes oodles of dollars by enabling its users to upload almost any video without for potential copyright infringement.google business model,like that of the database owners in tasini,assumes the risk that a user upload infringes someone else copyright,and that it may have to take corrective action if a copyright holder comes forward.
the majority credits the doomsday claims at the expense of property rights that congress created.its new standard artificially shrinks authorial rights by holding that a performer must personally record his creative expression in order to retain any copyright interest in it,speculating that a contrary rule might curb filmmaking and burden the internet.but our injunction has been in place for over a year reports of the internet demise have been greatly exaggerated.for the reasons stated here and in the majority opinion in garcia google,cir,i conclude that garcia copyright claim is likely to succeed.i also find that garcia has made an ample showing of irreparable harm.it her life that at stake.see id.at.
we use the transliteration mohammed because both parties use this spelling.we note that,according to the american library association library of congress arabic romanization table,available at http,an alternate transliteration is muhammad.
