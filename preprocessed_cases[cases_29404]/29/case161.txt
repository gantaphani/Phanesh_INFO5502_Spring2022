the national collegiate athletic association,the ncaa,appeals the district court order declaring that the ncaa two in four rule violates section i of the sherman antitrust act,and permanently enjoining the enforcement of that rule.because we conclude that the district court erred in applying an abbreviated or analysis and in its definition of the market for purposes of antitrust analysis,and because the record does not contain evidence to support a proper market definition,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
the ncaa is a voluntary organization of over colleges and universities that promulgates rules and regulations designed to,in its own words,maintain intercollegiate athletics as an integral part of the educational program and the athlete as an integral part of the student body.to accomplish this goal,the ncaa adopts bylaws formulated by a legislative body drawn from the association membership.the ncaa members agree to follow those.of concern in this case is a portion of the ncaa division i men basketball regulations,specifically because of a restriction on the type and number of games individual schools are permitted to play.
men division i basketball is divided into conferences within each conference the member schools individually play each other.each school,however,makes its own schedule and may seek several games.the ncaa sets the maximum number of games that each team may play per year.throughout the year,there are various tournaments in which a school team may participate,some of which are certified and some of which are not.certified tournament events are early season tournaments.these events were originally introduced as a means of encouraging scheduled games with schools in alaska and hawaii that traditionally had difficulty scheduling games because of their inconvenient locations.in recent years,the ncaa has become concerned that the more powerful basketball schools,members of the big six conferences were disproportionately taking advantage of the certified events.to address this concern,the ncaa adopted proposal,which increases to the number of allowed games per season for each team,provides that a team participation in a certified event,regardless of how many games the team actually plays as part of that event,counts as one game toward the ncaa regular season maximum,and permits each team to participate in not more than one certified basketball event in one academic year,and not more than two certified basketball events every four years.as stated in the text of,the rationale of the rule is to 
address competitive equity concerns by giving many division i institutions an opportunity to compete in certified events,particularly those outside the continental united states,so that the inherent recruiting and competitive advantages are distributed equally among division i institutions.this proposal will provide division i men and women basketball programs greater flexibility in the scheduling of basketball contests.it will permit institutions the opportunity to participate in certified contests in accordance with the legislation or to add additional contests to the institution schedules during those years in which the institution either is not permitted to engage in a certified contest or chooses not to participate in such an event.
the plaintiffs in this case are promoters of outside certified tournament events the promoters.they allege that the ncaa is less concerned with the disproportionate advantage to the big six conferences than it is with the monies that the outside promoters of certified events are able to make in connection with these events.the promoters contend that the two in four rule,the prong of that limits teams to two certified events every four years,was adopted purely to deny outside promoters the opportunity to make money from the certified events.
complaining that the application of this rule limited their ability to schedule events with schools having the most powerful and famous basketball programs,which in turn hampered their ability to sell tickets and make broadcast contracts,the promoters initiated this suit on december,alleging that the two in four rule is a violation of the sherman antitrust act.on august,they filed a motion for preliminary injunction under of the clayton act that motion was then consolidated with a motion for permanent injunction.the district court issued an opinion and order on july,holding that because the rule had not been in effect long enough to permit its effect to be accurately evaluated,the motion for preliminary injunction was denied and the motion for permanent injunction would be held in abeyance.the plaintiffs renewed their request for a permanent injunction on february,asserting that there was by then enough evidence to justify the injunction.the district court granted the permanent injunction on july.worldwide basketball and sports tours,ncaa,d.the ncaa timely appealed,and because of the nature of the injunction,the ncaa sought and obtained from this court a stay and order for expedited appeal.
our standard of review for the granting or denial of a permanent injunction is mixed 
when reviewing the decision of a district court to grant or to deny a request for issuance of a permanent injunction,we employ several different standards of review.factual findings are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard,legal conclusions are reviewed de novo,and the scope of injunctive relief is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.

section one of the sherman act provides that 
every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is declared to be illegal.every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony,and,on conviction thereof,shall be punished by fine not exceeding if a corporation,or,if any other person,or by imprisonment not exceeding three years,or by both said punishments,in the discretion of the court.
by its plain language,this section applies to the two in four rule only if the rule is commercial in nature.the ncaa maintains that the rule is academically directed and motivated and its commercial impact is negligible.the promoters and the district court,on the other hand,assume that the two in four rule involves a restraint of trade or commerce.id.
the dispositive inquiry in this regard is whether the rule itself is commercial,not whether the entity promulgating the rule is commercial.see,virginia vermiculite,grace,cir.at least some ncaa rules have been held to be commercial and hence subject to antitrust scrutiny.see ncaa bd.of regents of the university of oklahoma,d bd.of regents finding ncaa rules limiting live broadcasting of college football games subject to scrutiny under sherman act.one of our sister circuits has held that ncaa rules governing eligibility for participating in collegiate sports are not commercial,see smith ncaa,cir,vacated on other grounds by ncaa smith,d,but this circuit has not yet addressed the commercial or nature of particular ncaa rules.
we think it apparent that the two in four rule has some commercial impact insofar as it regulates games that constitute sources of revenue for both the member schools and the promoters.we therefore assume that the district court implicit finding that the two in four rule is commercial is supported by the evidence and we proceed on that basis.
in order to establish their claim under section of the sherman act,the promoters must prove that the ncaa participated in an agreement that unreasonably restrained trade in the relevant market.hockey league players plymouth whalers hockey club,cir.the ncaa does not dispute the promoters claim that the two in four rule represents an agreement in which the ncaa participated.the ncaa vigorously contests the district court conclusion that the two in four agreement unreasonably restrains trade in the relevant market.
whether an agreement unreasonably restrains trade is determined under one of two approaches the per se rule and the rule of reason.it is that cases involving industries in which horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all should be analyzed using the rule of reason.see bd.of regents,at.see also hockey league,at finding that the district court erred in failing to apply the rule of reason analysis to a challenge concerning hockey league eligibility rules.because there is no doubt that horizontal restraints are necessary to make the kind of league competition at issue available,the rule of reason applies.
under the rule of reason analysis,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the conduct complained of produces significant anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets.hockey league,at.if the plaintiff is able to meet that burden,the defendant must provide evidence to establish that the restraint complained of has procompetitive effects sufficient to justify the injury resulting from the anticompetitive effects of the restraint.id.the plaintiff is then left to prove that the legitimate procompetitive objectives can be achieved in a substantially less restrictive manner.id.
this court has held that the determination of a relevant market is composed of the articulation of a legal test which is then applied to the factual circumstances of each case.white white,amer.hosp.supply,cir citations omitted emphasis in original.accordingly,while a district court conclusion concerning what constitutes the relevant market is subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review,the district court formulation of the market tests may be freely reviewed on appeal as a matter of law.id.at.
when applying the rule of reason,the courts have occasionally applied what has come to be called an abbreviated or analysis.accordingly,in analyzing a restriction on the number of ncaa football games which could be televised in bd.of regents,the supreme court held that a naked restraint on price and output requires some competitive justification even in the absence of a detailed market analysis.bd.of regents,at.similarly,in ftc indiana fed of dentists,d,the court found that no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character of a horizontal agreement among dentists to withhold from insurers for use in benefit determinations.id.at.quoting soc.of prof l eng rs united states,d.recently,in california dental ftc,d,the supreme court granted certiorari to address when abbreviated or rule of reason is appropriate.id.at.the court reasoned that 
there is generally no categorical line to be drawn between restraints that give rise to an intuitively obvious inference of anticompetitive effect and those that call for more detailed treatment.what is required,rather,is an enquiry meet for the case,looking to the circumstances,details,and logic of a restraint.the object is to see whether the experience of the market has been so clear,or necessarily will be,that a confident conclusion about the principal tendency of a restriction will follow from a quick or at least quicker look,in place of a more sedulous one.
id.at.in analyzing cases such as bd of regents,indiana fed of dentists,and soc.of prof l eng rs in which an abbreviated or analysis was applied,the court found that i n each of these cases an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets.id.at.
in its decision denying a preliminary injunction,the district court found application of the rule of reason inappropriate,stating that t he two in four rule simply does not have the obvious effects as the rule at issue in board of regents did,so as to dispense with the full rule of reason analysis.in its decision granting a preliminary injunction,the court again suggested that it was applying the full rule of reason analysis.see worldwide basketball sports tours,d at.after accurately announcing the requirements of the full rule of reason,however,the district court stated that if a plaintiff can show that the restraint has actually produced significant effects,such as a reduction in output,a formal market analysis is unnecessary.id.at quoting metro industries,sammi,cir quoting bhan nme,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this is,in fact,an able exposition of the standard.indeed,the authority ultimately quoted by the district ninth circuit opinion in relies upon indiana fed of dentists,which the supreme court referred to as forming the basis for the abbreviated or analysis.see bhan,at citing indiana fed of dentists,at.see also california dental,at.characterizing indiana fed of dentists as forming the basis for quick look.
we believe that the district court was correct the first time this is not a case which is suitable for analysis.far from being a case in which an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets,id.emphasis added,here the relevant market is not readily apparent and the plaintiffs have failed to adequately define a relevant market,thereby making it impossible to assess the effect of on customers rather than merely on competitors.while it is true that the rule of reason can sometimes be applied in the twinkling of an eye,bd.of regents,at.quoting areeda,the rule of reason in antitrust analysis general issues federal judicial center,june parenthetical omitted,this abbreviated or analysis may only be done where the contours of the market and,where relevant,submarket,are sufficiently or defined to permit the court to ascertain without the aid of extensive market analysis whether the challenged practice impairs competition.under the approach,extensive market and analysis is not necessarily required,but where,as here,the precise product market is neither obvious nor undisputed,the failure to account for market alternatives and to analyze the dynamics of consumer choice simply will not suffice.the district court therefore erred in applying a analysis.
in considering what is the relevant market for determining the control of price and competition,no more definite rule can be declared than that commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes make up that part of the trade or commerce,monopolization of which may be illegal.united states du pont de nemours.the relevant market encompasses notions of geography as well as product use,quality,and description.hockey league,at quoting tanaka of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.relying on du pont,this court has found the reasonable interchangeability standard to be the essential test for ascertaining the relevant product market test.white white,at.reasonable interchangeability may be gauged by the product uses,whether the substitute products or services can perform the same function,consumer response that is,consumer sensitivity to price levels at which they elect substitutes for the defendant product or service.id.citation omitted.
the supreme court has long recognized that within a product market,submarkets may exist which,in themselves,constitute product markets for antitrust purposes.brown shoe united states,d citing du pont de nemours,at.the boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity,the product peculiar characteristics and uses,unique production facilities,distinct customers,distinct prices,sensitivity to price changes,and specialized vendors.id.
a submarket merely provides several new factors,in addition to the existing ones of selling price,uses,and physical characteristics,which the court may use in determining interchangeability between different products.white white,at quotation,citation,and emphasis omitted.however,a submarket analysis incorporates,but does not replace,the standard market test.it merely adds new factors to that test so as to more precisely define the market affected by the defendant actio
