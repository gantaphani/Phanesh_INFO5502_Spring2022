in an issue of first impression,we consider whether an order compelling enforcement of a contractual agreement to submit a dispute to a referee,and staying proceedings in the interim,is immediately appealable.the dispute stems from a written agreement between plaintiffs bagdasarian productions,llc and janice karman collectively,plaintiffs and defendant twentieth century fox film corporation fox,regarding the popular alvin and the chipmunks movies.the parties agreement literary material the agreement granted fox various rights to develop and produce movies based on the alvin properties and engaged plaintiffs to render services in connection with the pictures on a work for hire basis.the agreement also contained a forum of law provision that any dispute would be brought in california state or federal court and governed by california law.the agreement further provided that any dispute arising out of the agreement would be submitted to a general reference pursuant to california code of civil procedure 
when a dispute arose regarding certain services karman provided in connection with alvin and the chipmunks,the squeakquel the squeakquel,plaintiffs filed this action.fox moved to stay the case and to refer the dispute to a referee as the agreement provided.the district court granted the motion,whereupon plaintiffs brought this interlocutory appeal to contest the reference.because we conclude we lack jurisdiction at this stage of the proceedings,we dismiss the appeal.
facts and procedural history 
in march,plaintiffs and fox entered into the agreement,which granted fox rights to use and alvin materials owned or controlled by plaintiffs.the agreement defines the property covered by the agreement as 
that certain property generally known as alvin and the chipmunks chipmunks chipmunks go to the movies,alvin and the chipmunks series,the alvin show,including various television series produced commencing in,through,and through,created controlled by ross bagdasarian,ross bagdasarian,janice karman,bagdasarian productions,llc,and any and all associated characters including simon,theodore,alvin and david seville now or hereafter created and to the extent owned controlled by owner,and any and all other plots,themes,titles,story lines,names related thereto,and any and all other elements relating to any of the foregoing,now existing or created hereafter.
the agreement then grants fox the following rights in the property 
the right to develop,produce,distribute,exhibit,exploit,advertise,promote and publicize,throughout the universe,in and by any and all manner,media,devices,processes and technology now known or hereafter devised,exclusively and in perpetuity,theatrical motion pictures and home video motion pictures based on the property,merchandising rights and commercial rights as set forth in paragraphs a,b c,and d,and the motion picture and analogous and allied rights related thereto collectively,motion picture and allied rights in and to the property 
in the same paragraph,plaintiffs agree to 
furnish fox the services of ross bagdasarian and janice karman collectively,artist,as producers in connection with the development and possible production of the theatrical motion picture project s currently entitled alvin and the chipmunks.owner shall cause artist to render all services customarily rendered by producers in the motion picture industry,including supervision of the screenplay materials required by fox.
the agreement also incorporated by reference the standard terms and conditions for purchase of literary material st c,which provided,among other things,that the results and proceeds of artist services hereunder are being specially ordered by fox for use as part of a motion picture and shall be considered a work made for hire by fox and,therefore,fox shall be the author and copyright owner thereof for all purposes throughout the universe.the st c also define literary material as written matter,whether published or unpublished,in any form,including a novel,treatment,outline,screenplay,teleplay,story,manuscript,play or otherwise,which may be included in or upon which a motion picture may be based.
released in,the first film enjoyed great financial success.fox then began work on a second film,the squeakquel.according to the complaint,fox contacted plaintiffs and indicated it was searching for a story for the squeakquel.karman prepared a treatment which she pitched to fox in march.fox adopted this as a working draft and karman worked with fox screenwriters on the treatment over the next several months.
disappointed with its own writer first draft of a screenplay,in october fox asked karman to the screenplay.fox allegedly offered karman additional compensation beyond that payable under the agreement,but karman rejected the offers as insufficient and the parties never reached an agreement.nonetheless,the complaint alleges karman delivered a new screenplay to fox and worked with fox writers to revise the working draft.completed in april,the final version contained many scenes,dialogue,and other expressions contributed by karman.
plaintiffs then filed suit alleging karman was a of the squeakquel screenplay and entitled to an accounting of profits alternatively,fox had infringed her copyright in the screenplay fox was unjustly enriched by exploitation of karman screenwriting and graphic design services and fox breached various contractual obligations to plaintiffs under the agreement,pertaining to merchandising rights,compensation for the sequel,approval rights and access to meetings.
in response,fox moved to refer all these disputes pursuant to california code of civil procedure and to stay this action.fox motion was based on a provision in the st c,which provided 
any claim or dispute arising out of this agreement shall be submitted to a general,reference referee to hear and decide all matters relating to the claim or dispute pursuant to california code of civil procedure.
determining that all of plaintiffs claims arose out of the agreement or required interpretation of it,the district court granted the motion to refer,staying proceedings in the meantime.
discussion 
finality of order 
we must independently ascertain whether we have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal.see allstate ins.hughes,cir.we have jurisdiction to hear appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.so long as the matter remains open,unfinished or inconclusive,there may be no intrusion by appeal.cohen beneficial indus.loan.
there is no traditional final decision or judgment here.instead,the court entered a stay pending the section reference.a stay is not ordinarily a final decision for purposes of moses cone mem.hosp.mercury constr.however,courts will in limited circumstances permit immediate appeal if the stay order effectively puts the plaintiff out of court creating a substantial possibility there will be no further proceedings in the federal forum,because a parallel proceeding might either moot the action or become res judicata on the operative question.see id.noting this usually occurs with cases under colorado river,abstention,or a closely similar doctrine see also lockyer mirant,cir stay appealable where bankruptcy court proceeding might moot action intel advanced micro devices,cir stay appealable where court stayed action under colorado river doctrine.
but here,plaintiffs fail to explain how the reference puts them out of court.the principal cases on which plaintiffs rely to support this claim involve parallel proceedings.that is not the case here.there is no ongoing,separate court proceeding rather,it is this very same proceeding which has been referred,not to state court,but to a proceeding before a referee.a decision by the referee can not possibly moot this action or be res judicata rather,it will supply a statement of decision under a,the basis for the currently nonexistent final judgment.
plaintiffs nonetheless argue they have been effectively put out of court because there will be no further merits review by the district court.although they are correct that with consensual references under section,the decision of the referee must stand as the decision of the court,
