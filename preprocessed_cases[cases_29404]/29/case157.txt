background 
substantive facts 
many of the facts set forth below were included in this court factual discussion in nhlpa i.we reiterate them here because of their importance to our determination of the claims at issue in this appeal.
the ontario hockey league ohl consists of twenty teams,with players aged sixteen to twenty.two of the teams are located in michigan,one is in pennsylvania,and the remaining teams are based in ontario,canada.the ohl,along with the western hockey league and the quebec major junior hockey league,form the major junior leagues of the canadian hockey league chl.the major junior leagues constitute one of the three major sources of players in the national hockey league nhl entry draft the others are european leagues and american colleges and high schools.
ohl eligibility rules permit each team to carry only three,or overage,players.additionally,under the ohl rule,which is at the heart of this case,no overage player can be signed by an ohl team unless he was previously on a canadian hockey association cha or usa hockey player registration the previous season.the national college athletic association ncaa does not permit players holding either type of registration to play at a ncaa school.these two ohl rule requiring overage players to have a been on a cha or usa hockey registration,and the ncaa rule barring players with either of those to prevent ohl teams from signing any ncaa players,because such a player would not have been permitted by the ncaa to have obtained the registration required by the ohl of players.
rule is commonly referred to as the van ryn rule.mike van ryn van ryn was a university of michigan hockey player when he was drafted by the new jersey devils,an nhl team,in june.pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement cba between the nhl and the nhlpa,the devils thus obtained the rights to van ryn for one year,at which point,if the devils failed to sign van ryn,he would become an unrestricted free agent.under the terms of the cba those rights would only be extended past one year if van ryn remained in ncaa competition,or went to play for a hockey league.
van ryn remained in ncaa competition at the university of michigan for one year following the draft,which extended the devils rights to him for one year.he then signed with the sarnia sting,an ohl club.the ohl is affiliated with the nhl,and therefore,the devils rights to van ryn were not extended by van ryn signing with the sting.van ryn thus became an unrestricted free agent in june,and signed a contract with the nhl louis blues.had van ryn not played in an affiliated league for the year during which the devils had exclusive rights to him,his only path to free agency would have been to sit out for the season.
the devils,with the support of the nhl,attempted to declare van ryn a defected player ineligible for free agency,but an arbitrator rejected this effort.within two months of the arbitration decision and van ryn signing with the blues,the ohl adopted the van ryn rule.unsurprisingly,plaintiffs regard the adoption of the rule as an attempt to prevent other ncaa players from achieving free agency via the route traveled by van ryn.defendants dispute this motive,and note that a rule similar to the van ryn rule,which prevented overage players from playing in the ohl if they had not played there as,was in effect from to.david branch,the ohl commissioner,has stated that the rule was implemented because,given that the opportunities for overage players are obviously limited by ohl rules,it seemed fitting and appropriate to include those players who had given the ohl their time and talent over a number of years and to exclude those who had not done so.
defendants also point out that former ncaa players who will not turn twenty before december of any season may play in the ohl.however,pursuant to section of the cba,players generally must be at least nineteen years old to be selected in the nhl entry draft.thus,few ncaa players who have been drafted by an nhl team will be able to sign with an ohl team and follow the path taken by mike van ryn to unrestricted free agency.
plaintiffs anthony aquino aquino and edward caron caron,were,at the time the complaint was filed,ncaa hockey players who aspired to play in the nhl.both players contend that the van ryn rule precluded them from achieving unrestricted free agency and the financial rewards it can confer.aquino was drafted by the owen sound attack,an ohl team,at age sixteen.he chose to play instead at merrimack college in massachusetts,and remained at merrimack for three seasons.the sound attack later traded its rights to aquino to another ohl team,the oshawa generals.in june,aquino was drafted by the dallas stars of the nhl.aquino desired to play in the ohl during the season,and did in fact play for the generals briefly after the district court issued a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the van ryn rule and until that injunction was stayed by this court in nhlpa aquino ultimately signed an nhl contract with the atlanta thrashers.caron similarly argues that he sought to play in the ohl in,and that he would have signed an ohl contract but for the van ryn rule.
ii.procedural history 
plaintiff nhlpa,an unincorporated labor association and the exclusive collective bargaining representative for all current and future nhl hockey players,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan on march,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of present and future nhl players.defendants moved to dismiss the suit on the grounds of forum non conveniens and lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court denied appellants motion to dismiss.hockey league players ass plymouth whalers hockey club et,d.
on july,the nhlpa moved to amend the complaint to add aquino as a plaintiff and requested a preliminary injunction,barring enforcement of the van ryn rule,on his behalf.both motions were granted on august.defendants appealed the grant of the preliminary injunction to this court,which stayed the injunction on november,and then reversed and remanded the case to the district court.
on remand,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,which added caron as a plaintiff and incorporated additional allegations in an attempt to address this court opinion in nhlpa defendants,arguing that plaintiffs had not succeeded in curing the defects identified by this court decision,moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted that motion and entered judgment in favor of defendants on december.notice of this appeal was filed on january.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court conducts de novo review of a district court dismissal of a complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.pr diamonds,chandler,cir citing valassis communications aetna cas.sur,cir.
in considering whether a complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,this court construes the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept s all factual allegations of the plaintiff as true,and determine s whether the plaintiff undoubtedly can prove no set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief.ricco potter,cir quoting marks newcourt credit group,cir citations omitted.although this is a liberal pleading standard,it requires more than the bare assertion of legal conclusions.rather,the complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.in re delorean motor,cir.
ii.the sherman act 
section of the sherman antitrust act provides that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is hereby declared to be illegal.as is obvious from the language and purpose of the sherman act,the unilateral actions of a solitary actor can not violate section,and therefore a threshold issue in all sherman act cases is whether more than one actor is implicated in the challenged restraint.see copperweld independence tube,d.
because every contract could be construed as a restraint of trade,the supreme court has held that for a claim to be actionable under the sherman act,the restraint challenged must be unreasonable.collegiate athletic ass bd.of regents of of,d.whether a restraint is unreasonable is determined under either a per se rule or the rule of reason.nhlpa i,at citations omitted.
the per se rule is appropriate where the challenged practice is entirely void of redeeming competitive rationales.id.quoting law collegiate athletic ass n,cir.in granting plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court applied the per se rule.this court reversed the district court and held that the rule of reason approach was appropriate,noting that courts consistently have analyzed challenged conduct under the rule of reason when dealing with an industry in which some horizontal restraints are necessary for the availability of a product such as sports leagues.id.at quoting law,at.we apply the rule of reason here as well.
under the rule of reason,a plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating significant effects within a relevant market.if the plaintiff meets this burden,the defendant is required to proffer evidence of effects of the restraint justifying the injuries.assuming the defendant succeeds in doing so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that any legitimate objectives can be achieved in a substantially less restrictive manner.id.at citations omitted see also worldwide basketball and sport tours,collegiate athletic ass n,cir.
iii.plaintiffs claim of a conspiracy among defendants 
with these principles in mind,we turn to count i of plaintiffs second amended complaint,which alleges a conspiracy among the member teams of the ohl to adopt the van ryn rule in violation of the sherman act.
multiple actor requirement 
a threshold requirement of the sherman act is that the challenged agreement be entered into by multiple parties.see copperweld,at.while defendants do not contend that the ohl acted as a single actor in this case,we nonetheless will briefly explain our conclusion that the ohl and the various member teams of the ohl represent multiple actors.
other courts considering the actions of professional sports leagues have found the leagues to be joint ventures whose members act in concert,agree to promulgate league rules,rather than one solitary acting unit.am.soccer league football league,cir see also fraser major league soccer,cir bd.of regents,at.the second circuit explained that to hold otherwise would create a loophole that would permit league members to escape antitrust responsibility for any restraint entered into by them that would benefit their league even though the benefit would be outweighed by its anticompetitive effects.am.soccer league,at.we are persuaded that this logic applies in the instant case.just as the national football league could not accurately be characterized as a single economic entity,neither could the ohl,which exists only as constituted by its twenty member teams.we therefore conclude that when they adopt eligibility rules,the member teams of the ohl constitute multiple actors who act in concert.thus,the adoption of the van ryn rule represents an agreement between multiple actors,as required by section of the sherman act.
whether the district court erred in determining that plaintiffs failed to identify a relevant market,as required to state a rule of reason claim 
as we noted in nhlpa i,plaintiffs first complaint did not attempt to define a relevant market.nhlpa i,at.nevertheless,in granting the preliminary injunction,the district court determined that the relevant market was the market for competition among ohl and chl teams for player services.we rejected that holding,explaining that 
t he market for player services in the ohl is not a market that involves economic competition.the ohl rules clearly limit the amount a player may be paid to schooling and a limited stipend t he effect on the market as defined by plaintiffs is on athletic competition,which is not protected by the antitrust laws.the application of the van ryn rule does not result in any economic injury to the market for competition among ohl and chl teams for player services,but merely substitutes one arguably less skilled player for another arguably more skilled player.while a player barred by the rule is precluded from taking advantage of the benefits of playing on an ohl team,numerous other categories of players,including anyone under sixteen or over twenty,are similarly barred.
id.citations omitted.
plaintiffs argued before the district court on remand,and now before this court,that the determination by the sixth circuit in nhlpa i that the ohl market for player services is not an economic market is not binding under the law of the case doctrine because it was made on appeal from a preliminary injunction.we disagree.the district court is bound by the determinations of this court unless one of three circumstances is met substantially different evidence is subsequently raised a subsequent contrary and controlling view of the law is decided or a decision is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.hanover ins.am.eng g,cir.on remand from nhlpa i,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint which added some general allegations regarding the ohl chl as a market for player services,including the assertion that the ohl and chl clubs provide unique developmental opportunities for players like aquino and caron.other professional leagues in north america and europe are inferior developmental opportunities are unwilling to sign players like aquino and caron.however,these broad allegations only confirm this court earlier holding that with respect to the market for player services in the ohl chl,the harm alleged is to athletic and not economic competition.furthermore,these allegations do not constitute substantially different evidence.
neither this circuit nor the supreme court,subsequent to the opinion in nhlpa i,has issued an opinion contrary to that case.finally,we are satisfied that our prior decision in nhlpa i was not only not clearly erroneous,but in fact was correct.thus,none of the conditions announced in hanover insurance are met in this case,and both the district court and this court are bound by our holding in nhlpa i that the ohl market for player services is not a market that involves economic competition.nhlpa i,at.
however,this court expressly refused to apply a rule of reason analysis to other markets for player services,as they had not been alleged in the complaint.id.nonetheless,in dismissing the case on remand,the district court concluded that plaintiffs have not made any persuasive arguments or cited any authority that would lead the court to a different conclusion than the sixth circuit that the market for player services,whether it is in the ohl,chl,or nhl,is not a market that involves economic competition within the meaning of the sherman act.at.emphasis added.this is an erroneous and overbroad reading of nhlpa i.in nhlpa i,this court determination that the ohl market for player services is not an economic market was grounded in the fact that ohl players are paid fixed stipends and thus ohl teams do not compete with each other economically for players.again,this court expressly refused to consider whether other markets for player services might constitute relevant markets.nhlpa i,at.the holding in nhlpa i therefore does not bar a finding that another market for player services is a relevant market if plaintiffs can establish that it does involve economic competition,and the district court apparent conclusion to the contrary was in error.
the market for sixteen to hockey players in north america is a relevant market 
we consider whether any of the remaining four proposed relevant markets alleged by plaintiffs in their second amended complaint constitute relevant markets under section of the sherman act.they are the market for player services among teams in the canadian hockey league the market comprised of north american organizations that compete for the services of hockey players the market comprised of north american organizations that compete for the services of hockey players ages sixteen through twenty and the market for player services in the national hockey league.
generally,a relevant market is one which includes products or services that are reasonably interchangeable with,as well as identical to,defendant product affected by the rule or regulation being challenged.am.council of certified podiatric physicians and surgeons am.bd.of podiatric surgery,cir see also brown shoe united states,d united states dupont de nemours.a similar rule applies to supplier markets such as the employment market in the instant case the relevant market is one where employment positions are reasonably interchangeable with those offered by defendant.see,nhlpa i,at todd exxon,cir see also alabama power fed.power comm n.reasonable interchangeability may be gauged by the product uses,whether the substitute employees can perform the same function,employer response that is employer sensitivity to price levels at which they elect substitutes for the employees service s.white white,am.hosp.supply,cir.
we conclude that the relevant market in this case is the pool of players from which the ohl draws its players,the market for sixteen to hockey players in north america.this market includes the nhl,the ohl,and other north american leagues.this market meets the requirement of reasonable interchangeability of employees with defendants employees,as there is significant substitution between the market for player services in the nhl and that for sixteen to players in other north american leagues,including the ohl.indeed,as the nhlpa alleges in its complaint,t he nhl and ohl share players and have detailed rules providing for the loan and recall of players between the ohl and nhl.at 
furthermore,unlike the market for player services in the ohl,this market is economically competitive.this is so because while the member teams of the ohl may not compete economically with each other for players within their league,they do have an economic impact on the market for sixteen to hockey players in north america,as do the other relevant leagues.
because of the of demand between the nhl,ohl,and other leagues in north america for the services of sixteen to old hockey players,the remaining markets alleged by plaintiffs the market for player services among teams in the canadian hockey league the market comprised of north american organizations that compete for the services of old hockey players and the market for player services in the national hockey league are overly narrow.the eighth circuit confronted a similar issue,albeit in a products market rather than a services market,in brookins int l motor contest ass n,cir.in that case,a manufacturer of auto transmissions sued an automobile race sanctioning body over its restrictions on the types of transmissions which could be used in sanctioned races.plaintiffs attempted to define the products market narrowly,as transmissions used in modified car racing sanctioned by defendants.the court rejected that assertion because it required proof,which plaintiffs failed to provide,that there is no of demand between this sanctioned game and other games that modified car racers might choose to play.id.citations omitted.the court instead defined the relevant market as transmissions used in all oval track racing.
we similarly conclude that the alternative markets proposed by plaintiffs must fail because in each instance,plaintiffs have failed to show that there is no of demand between the market as narrowly defined,limited to the market for player services in the chl,or the nhl,or limited to players and the broader market definition we accept today.see also queen city pizza,domino pizza,cir finding the market for a particular brand of pizza ingredient to be too narrowly defined to constitute the relevant market tv communications network,turner network television,cir finding the market for tnt channel to be too narrow to constitute a relevant market a company does not violate the sherman act by virtue of the natural monopoly it holds over its own product.
whether the district court erred in determining that plaintiffs failed to identify effects of the van ryn rule 
although we conclude that the district court erred in determining that plaintiffs had failed to identify a relevant market,we decline to reverse the district court dismissal of count i of the complaint because plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently identify effects of the van ryn rule.as noted above,a plaintiff alleging an unreasonable restraint on trade under the rule of reason theory must show significant effects of the challenged restraint.nhlpa i,at see also worldwide basketball,at.
plaintiffs essentially allege two types of effects of the van ryn rule an effect on competition among ohl teams,and an effect on player salaries in the relevant market because some players who might otherwise have achieved free agency in the nhl are unable to do as a result of the van ryn rule.for the reasons that follow,both of these arguments fail.
harm to athletic competition is not a cognizable effect under the sherman act 
plaintiffs allege in their second amended complaint that the van ryn rule has an actual and significant impact on quality.by the ohl own admission the van ryn rule substitutes less skilled hockey players for more skilled hockey players,which has an actual and detrimental impact on the quality of the players in the ohl labor pool and the quality of the hockey games produced as a result.at.
this is exactly the argument that was rejected by this court in nhlpa i,which noted that athletic competition is not protected by the antitrust laws.at.plaintiffs do not allege that diminished quality of athletic competition results in an economic injury.the district court correctly rejected plaintiffs claim that the diminished level of play in the ohl as a result of the van ryn rule is an effect within the meaning of the antitrust laws.
any harm caused by some players inability to achieve free agency in the nhl is caused by the nhl collective bargaining agreement,and not the van ryn rule 
the other effect alleged by plaintiffs is that players who would have become nhl free agents by spending one year in the ohl must now enter the nhl through its draft system.the district court found that this effect had no detrimental economic effect on the markets identified by plaintiffs,concluding that plaintiffs continue to confuse injury to competitors,which is not protected by antitrust laws,with injury to competition.at.
in our view,the district court analysis mischaracterizes plaintiffs argument.plaintiffs contend that the van ryn rule eliminates one path to nhl free agency,thereby limiting the competition between nhl clubs for these players services and rendering the market for nhl players,and,presumably,the market for all other young professional hockey players in north america,less competitive.such an injury is an injury to competition within the meaning of the sherman act.see atlantic richfield usa petroleum,d the antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition,not competitors.quoting brown shoe united states,d emphasis in original.
however,we must stil
