plaintiff debra laws laws brought suit against defendant sony music entertainment,sony for misappropriating her voice and name in the song all i have by jennifer lopez and cool j.the district court found that sony had obtained a license to use a sample of laws recording of very special and held that laws claims for violation of her common law right to privacy and her statutory right of publicity were preempted by the copyright act.we agree with the district court that the copyright act preempts laws claims,and we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
in,professional vocalist and recording artist debra laws and spirit productions spirit entered into a recording agreement with records elektra to produce master recordings of laws vocal performances for elektra.the agreement gave elektra the sole and exclusive right to copyright such master recordings and the exclusive worldwide right in perpetuity to lease,license,convey or otherwise use or dispose of such master recordings.elektra also secured the right to use and to permit others to use your name,the artist name likeness,other identification,and biographical material concerning the artist in connection with such master recordings.notwithstanding these provisions,elektra agreed that we shall not,without your prior written consent,utilize or authorize others to utilize the masters in any or sight and sound devices intended primarily for home use,and we or our licensees shall not,without your prior written consent,sell records embodying the masters hereunder for use as premiums or in connection with the sale,advertising or promotion of any other product or service.in,laws recorded the song very special,which was released on laws album on the elektra label.elektra copyrighted the song that same year.
in november,elektra agent,warner special products,entered into an agreement with sony music entertainment,sony to grant sony a license to use a sample of debra laws recording of very special in the song all i have,performed by recording artists jennifer lopez and cool j.the agreement required sony to include a credit stating,featuring samples from the debra laws recording very special in any reproduction.warner,elektra agent,did not seek permission from laws or spirit before it released the disc and video,and neither laws nor spirit was compensated.
sony subsequently released a jennifer lopez compact disc and music video incorporating brief samples of very special into her recording of all i have.the sampled portions include a segment approximately ten seconds in length at the beginning of all i have,and shorter segments repeated in the background throughout the song.sony included the required credit in the booklet accompanying the compact disc.the song and lopez album,this is me then,became a huge commercial success,netting over dollars.at one time all i have was the number one song in the united states.
in february,laws brought an action in the superior court of california,county of los angeles,alleging multiple claims.the two claims relevant to this appeal were a common law claim for invasion of privacy for the misappropriation of laws name and voice and a claim for misappropriation of laws name and voice for a commercial purpose under california civil code.the complaint sought injunctive and monetary relief.
sony removed the case to the united states district court for the central district of california and sought to join elektra as a necessary party.the court denied the motion.sony filed a summary judgment motion,which the district court granted,ruling that both of laws misappropriation claims were preempted by the copyright act.laws filed a timely appeal.
ii.standard of review 
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see buono norton,cir.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to laws and determine whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether the district court properly applied the relevant substantive law.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.summary judgment may be affirmed on any ground supported by the record.id.
we review de novo whether a federal law preempts a state law.see radici associated ins,cir.the district court interpretation of state law is also reviewed de novo.see rabkin or.health scis,cir.
iii.analysis 
the copyright clause of the constitution provides that congress shall have the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries const.art.i,cl.pursuant to this authority,congress enacted the copyright act,to define and protect the rights of copyright holders.under the act,the owner of copyright has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize others to display,perform,reproduce or distribute copies of the work,and to prepare derivative works.id.the copyright is the right to control the work,including the decision to make the work available to or withhold it from the public.
sections a and b of title describe when the act preempts legal and equitable rights granted by state common law or statute.section a states 
on and after january,all legal and equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section in works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections and are governed exclusively by this title.thereafter,no person is entitled to any such right or equivalent right in any such work under the common law or statutes of any state.
id.a.section b states 
nothing in this title annuls or limits any rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any state with respect to subject matter that does not come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections and,including works of authorship not fixed in any tangible medium of expression 
id.b.congress explained what the statute made obvious t he intention of section is to preempt and abolish any rights under the common law or statutes of a state that are equivalent to copyright and that extend to works,within the scope of the federal copyright law,at see also maljack prods.goodtimes home video,cir.
we have adopted a test to determine whether a state law claim is preempted by the act.we must first determine whether the subject matter of the state law claim falls within the subject matter of copyright as described in and second,assuming that it does,we must determine whether the rights asserted under state law are equivalent to the rights contained in,which articulates the exclusive rights of copyright holders see downing abercrombie fitch,cir.
laws alleges two causes of action.first,she asserts a claim for protection of her voice,name and likeness under california common law right of privacy.to sustain this action,laws must prove the defendant use of the plaintiff identity the appropriation of plaintiff name or likeness to defendant advantage,commercially or otherwise lack of consent and resulting injury.eastwood superior court,d,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in knb enters.matthews,th,d see also downing,at.second,laws asserts a statutory misappropriation or right of publicity claim under california civil code a,which provides that 
any person who knowingly uses another name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner,on or in products,merchandise,or goods,or for purposes of advertising or selling,or soliciting purchases of,products,merchandise,goods or services,without such person prior consent shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof.
we have observed that t he remedies provided for under california civil code complement the common law cause of action they do not replace or codify the common law.downing,at.nevertheless,for purposes of our preemption analysis,section includes the elements of the common law cause of action.see id.under section,a plaintiff must prove all the elements of the common law cause of action plus knowing use and a direct connection between the alleged use and the commercial purpose.for convenience sake,we will refer to laws claims as right of publicity claims.
sony does not argue that common law privacy actions and statutory claims under section are preempted generally by section rather,it argues that they are preempted as applied to the facts of this case.we thus turn to whether the subject matter of laws right of publicity claims comes within the subject matter of copyright,and whether the rights laws asserts under california law are equivalent to those created under the copyright act.
a.the subject matter of copyright 
we first consider whether the subject matter of laws misappropriation claim is within the subject matter of the copyright act.we conclude that it is.sections and of the act identify the works of authorship that constitute the subject matter of copyright.section of the act extends copyright protection to original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which they can be reproduced,either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.a.that section defines a work of authorship to include sound recordings.id.a.a work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord,by or under the authority of the author,is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.id.laws master recordings held by elektra are plainly within these definitions.
laws nevertheless contends that the subject matter of a copyright claim and a right of publicity claim are substantively different.she argues that a copyright claim protects ownership rights to a work of art,while a right of publicity claim concerns the right to protect one persona and likeness.sony,by contrast,contends that the subject matter of a right of publicity in one voice is not different from a copyright claim when the voice is embodied within a copyrighted sound recording.sony argues that once a voice becomes part of a sound recording in a fixed tangible medium it comes within the subject matter of copyright law.
our jurisprudence provides strong guidance to the resolution of this question.in sinatra goodyear tire rubber,cir,nancy sinatra filed suit against goodyear tire on the basis of an advertising campaign that featured these boots are made for walkin,a song that sinatra made famous.goodyear tire had obtained a license from the copyright proprietor for the use of music,lyrics,and arrangement of the composition.goodyear tire subsequently used the music and lyrics in its ads,which were sung by unknown vocalists.she alleged the song had taken on a secondary meaning that was uniquely injurious to her.we rejected her claim 
a ppellant complaint is not that her sound is uniquely personal it is that the sound in connection with the music,lyrics and arrangement,which made her the subject of popular identification,ought to be protected.but as to these latter copyrightable items she had no rights.presumably,she was required to obtain permission of the copyright owner to sing boots,and to make an arrangement of the song to suit her own tastes and talents.had she desired to exclude all others from use of the song so that her secondary meaning with the song could not be imitated she could have purchased those rights from the copyright proprietor.one wonders whether her voice would have been identifiable if another song had been presented,and not her song,which unfortunately for her was owned by others and licensed to the defendants.
id.at.although sinatra was decided prior to passage of the preemption provision in section,we nonetheless ruled that the copyright act impliedly preempted sinatra state law claim.id.at.we later confirmed this holding in midler ford motor,cir,when we observed that t o give sinatra damages for defendants use of the song would clash with federal copyright law.
in midler,recording and performing artist bette midler filed suit against an advertising agency and its client when a professional sound alike was used to imitate midler voice from her hit song do you want to dance.the agency did not acquire a license to use midler recording instead,it had obtained a license from the song copyright holder and then attempted to get midler to do the commercial.when midler agent advised the agency that she was not interested,the agency hired someone who had been a backup singer for midler and could imitate her voice and style.indeed,the singer was instructed to sound as much like bette midler as possible.we held that midler common law misappropriation claim was not preempted by copyright law because the thing misappropriated,her voice,was not copyrightable in that instance.we explained 
midler does not seek damages for the defendant use of do you want to dance,and thus her claim is not preempted by federal copyright law.copyright protects original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.a voice is not copyrightable.the sounds are not fixed.what is put forward as protectible here is more personal than any work of authorship.
id.at citation omitted.what midler sought was relief from an unauthorized vocal imitation for advertising purposes,and that was not the subject of copyright.
we subsequently applied midler in waits,cir.the voice of tom waits,a professional singer,songwriter,and actor,was imitated and then broadcast in a commercial for.waits filed a right of publicity claim under california law.we held that the claim was not preempted by copyright law because it was for infringement of voice,not for infringement of a copyrightable subject such as sound recording or musical composition.id.at.thus,the issues in waits were whether the defendants had deliberately imitated waits voice rather than simply his style and whether waits voice was sufficiently distinctive and widely known to give him a protectible right in its use.these elements are different in kind from those in a copyright infringement case challenging the unauthorized use of a song or recording.id.
in this case,laws voice misappropriation claim is plainly different from the claims in midler and waits and falls within the subject matter of copyright.in contrast to midler and waits,where the licensing party obtained only a license to the song and then imitated the artist voice,here sony obtained a license to use laws recording itself.sony was not imitating very special as laws might have sung it.rather,it used a portion of very special as sung by debra laws.see also brown ames,cir the crucial difference between this case and daboub gibbons,cir is that in daboub the basis of the misappropriation claim was the song itself,bringing it within section ambit,whereas here the basis of the misappropriation claim was defendants use of plaintiffs names likenesses.
laws does not dispute sony contention that the recording of very special was a copyrighted sound recording fixed in a tangible medium of expression.laws right of publicity claim is based exclusively on what she claims is an unauthorized duplication of her vocal performance of the song very special.although california law recognizes an assertable interest in the publicity associated with one voice,we think it is clear that federal copyright law preempts a claim alleging misappropriation of one voice when the entirety of the allegedly misappropriated vocal performance is contained within a copyrighted medium.our conclusion is consistent with our holdings in midler and waits,where we concluded that the voice misappropriation claim was not preempted,because the alleged misappropriation was the imitation of the plaintiffs voices.neither of those imitations was contained in a copyrighted vocal performance.moreover,the fact that the vocal performance was copyrighted demonstrates that what is put forth here as protectible is not more personal than any work of authorship.midler,at.
laws points to two cases for support.both cases,however,involve photographs used in advertising,and are distinguishable from this case.in downing,we held that a claim based on the right of publicity was not preempted by the copyright act.in downing,retailer abercrombie fitch was developing a surfing theme surf nekkid for its subscription catalog.abercrombie published a photo of the plaintiffs,who were participants in a surf championship in hawaii in.abercrombie ran the photo,which it had purchased from the photographer who held the copyright,and it identified the plaintiffs by name.abercrombie went well beyond mere republication of the photograph.without obtaining plaintiffs consent to use their names and images,it also offered exactly like those worn by the plaintiffs in the photo.we noted that the photograph itself was within the subject matter protected by the copyright act.but abercrombie had not merely published the photograph.rather,it published the photo in connection with a broad advertising campaign,identified the by name,and offered for sale the same worn by the plaintiffs in the photo.by doing so,it had suggested that the surfers had endorsed abercrombie.accordingly,we concluded that it is not the publication of the photograph itself,as a creative work of authorship,that is the basis for plaintiffs claims,but rather,it is the use of the plaintiffs likenesses and their names pictured in the published photograph.id.at see also brown,at no preemption where the record company used the names and likenesses of musicians,song writers,and producers on compact disks,tapes,catalogs and posters.we thus concluded that the claim was not within the subject matter of copyright because a person name or likeness is not a work of authorship within the meaning of.downing,at.
laws also relies on a second case,toney usa,cir,in which the seventh circuit held that a claim under the illinois right of publicity act was not preempted by the copyright act.toney was a model who had posed for photographs used to promote products on packaging and in national advertisements.defendants owned the copyright for the photograph of toney that was used,and had a right to use it from november to november any other use would be negotiated separately.in apparent violation of their understanding,defendants continued to use the photographs in their advertising beyond.toney alleged that this use violated her right of publicity under illinois law.the seventh circuit concluded that 
toney identity is not fixed in a tangible medium of expression.there is no work of authorship at issue in toney right of publicity claim.a person not authored and it is not fixed.the fact that an image of the person might be fixed in a copyrightable photograph does not change this the fact that the photograph itself could be copyrighted,and that defendants owned the copyright to the photograph that was used,is irrelevant to the right of publicity claim the defendants did not have her consent to continue to use the photograph 
id.at.the fact that the photograph was copyrighted could not negate the fact that toney had reserved artistic control over her image for any period beyond the contractual time frame.the seventh circuit concluded that toney claim was not preempted 
in contrast,jennifer lopez song all i have incorporated samples of deborah laws very special and gave her the attribution negotiated by elektra and sony.sony did not use laws image,name,or the voice recording in any promotional materials.her state tort action challenges control of the artistic work itself and could hardly be more closely related to the subject matter of the copyright act.
we find more to the point,and quite persuasive,the california court of appeal decision in fleet cbs,th,d.there,defendant cbs owned the exclusive rights to distribute a motion picture in which plaintiffs performed.a third party who financed the operation of the movie refused to pay plaintiffs their previously salaries.plaintiffs brought suit against cbs alleging,inter alia,that by airing the motion picture using their names,pictures,and likenesses without their consent,cbs had violated their statutory right of publicity.the court of appeal held that the copyright act preempted the action.as the court observed,it was not merely plaintiffs likenesses which were captured on was their dramatic performances which are copyrightable.id.at.o nce plaintiffs performances were put on film,they became dramatic work s fixed in a tangible medium of expression at that point,the performances came within the scope or subject matter of copyright law protection,and the claims were preempted.id.at see also downing,at in fleet,the plaintiffs were actors in a copyrighted film.the claims of the plaintiffs were based on their dramatic performance in a film cbs sought to distribute.this is clearly distinguishable from this case where the appellants claim is based on the use of their names and likenesses,which are not copyrightable.in effect,the plaintiffs right of publicity claim was a question of control over the distribution,display or performance of a movie cbs owned.since cbs use of plaintiffs likenesses did not extend beyond the use of the copyrighted material it held,there was no right of publicity at issue,aside from the actors performances.had the court held otherwise,each actor could claim that any showing of the film violated his right to control his image and persona.
laws makes much of the fact that she possessed a right of first refusal in all future uses of very special under the original production agreement with elektra.she contends that this right expressly gives her control over the use of her name and voice in connection with any use of very special.she also contends that i f the copyright holder itself,elektra asylum,was not ceded such rights,then as a matter of law its licensee does not possess those rights.in effect,laws contends that her contractual reservation gives her an interest in the copyright and,concomitantly,renders elektra copyright partially subject to her control.
we express no view as to the effect of laws reservation in the production agreement and no view as to any remedies that laws may have against elektra.whether or not the two parties contracted around the actual use of a copyright does not affect our preemption analysis.to the extent that laws has enforceable,contractual rights regarding the use of elektra copyright,her remedy may lie in a breach of contract claim against elektra for licensing very special without her authorization.see grosso miramax film,cir 
in sum,we hold that laws cause of action is within the subject matter of copyright.
equivalent rights 
we must next determine whether the rights she asserts under california law are equivalent to the rights protected under the copyright act.we conclude that they are.in del madera props.rhodes gardner,cir,overruled on other grounds,fogerty fantasy,d,we outlined the test for determining whether state rights were equivalent to those under the copyright act 
to satisfy the equivalent rights part of the preemption test the alleged misappropriation must be equivalent to rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section of the copyright act.section provides a copyright owner with the exclusive rights of reproduction,preparation of derivative works,distribution,and display.to survive preemption,the state cause of action must protect rights which are qualitatively different from the copyright rights.the state claim must have an extra element which changes the nature of the action.
id.at quotations and citations omitted.in del madera properties,the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had allegedly misappropriated a copyrighted land map to plan a new development.plaintiff advanced an unfair competition claim and argued that it was qualitatively different from copyright because the unfair competition claim required the breach of a fiduciary duty,an element not required under copyright.we squarely rejected del madera argument 
this argument does not add any extra element which changes the nature of the action.the argument is constructed upon the premise that the documents and information belonged to del madera and were misappropriated by the defendants.del madera ownership of this material,and the alleged misappropriation by the defendants,are part and parcel of the copyright claim.
