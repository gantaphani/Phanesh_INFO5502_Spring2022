this case,involving a song by a group,comes to us with district court orders and memorandum opinions spread over a combined pages.the district court docket contains a staggering entries.and the briefs of the parties on appeal are a bit unfocused to say the least.but although it a tough job,someone has to do it,so with shoulder to the wheel,we forge on.
lake county,indiana,is the home of gary,a gritty industrial town southeast of chicago.but there much more to lake county than miles of pristine beachfront along the indiana dunes national the lake county convention and visitors bureau the bureau wants you to know that.to get the word out,the bureau commissioned a tune singing the county praises,the distribution of which led to this lawsuit for copyright infringement.cheryl janky says she composed the song and never gave the bureau permission to use it.the bureau maintains that janky was only a and that it had the authority to use the song by licensing it from the other songwriter,henry farag.the district court entered partial summary judgment in favor of that she was the sole a jury awarded her in damages.the bureau now appeals,contending that summary judgment was improper given the evidence of.in the alternative,the bureau submits that the district court erred when it denied a motion for remittitur or new trial in light of janky failure to mitigate damages.janky from an order concerning the imposition of sanctions against her counsel under rule.
before we get to the underlying facts,we need to assess our jurisdiction.see mostly memories,for your ease only,cir a court of appeals has an obligation to examine its jurisdiction sua sponte,even if the parties fail to raise a jurisdictional issue.quoting wingerter chester quarry,cir.the bureau has made this task more complicated than usual because its brief is defective.at oral argument the bureau clarified that it seeks,first and foremost,review of the summary judgment decision.however,that is not at all apparent from the bureau brief,which neither references the lower court summary judgment opinion within the jurisdictional statement nor includes that opinion within its short appendix,all in violation of the applicable rules.see fed.a,a cir.a,a.janky brief is any better.although we take these rules seriously,we are nonetheless willing to forgive the violation in this case because we do in fact have jurisdiction.to be sure,the bureau was not permitted to appeal as of right following the grant of partial summary judgment.see liberty mut.ins.wetzel,d p artial summary judgment s limited to the issue of a petitioner liability are by their terms interlocutory,see fed.rule civ.proc.c,and where assessment of damages remains to be resolved have never been considered to be final within the meaning of.so we do not fault the bureau for waiting to appeal until the denial of its motion for new trial or remittitur.and though the bureau did a poor job of explaining exactly what it seeks,we are satisfied that the denial of the motion for new trial or remittitur implicates all prior orders,including the decision on summary judgment.with that sorted out,then,we can turn to the facts.
janky and farag were members of stormy weather,an group farag heard through the grape vine that the bureau was looking for a song to represent lake county,and he suggested that the band might want to give it a shot.janky took the initiative.after farag made the announcement,she got to work writing the music and lyrics for a tune she called wonders of indiana indiana.when it was complete,janky obtained a copyright for the song in may,listing herself as the sole author.janky then showed the song to farag.although farag thought it had potential,he recommended revising the lyrics to better suit the bureau vision.pursuant to a conversation with the bureau chief executive officer,farag suggested that the song needed to focus more on lake county in particular,as opposed to indiana in general,and include references to the area as chicago neighboring south shore and to its ethnic diversity.janky testified that farag recommendations,which she adopted,accounted for percent of the lyrical content.with the song revamped,janky filed a new copyright registration form in december,this time listing farag as a who provided additional lyrics and styling the effort a joint work.similarly,she filed a document with the american society of composers,authors and publishers ascap stating that farag held a percent ownership share.she now says that was all a mistake.
according to janky,farag was not a and she did not intend to give him credit as such.rather,she testified that she placed farag name on the registration form as an indication of her gratitude and to demonstrate that she appreciated every little bit of support.she said she now realizes that the proper way to acknowledge a de minimis contribution is by making a notation on the album cover.
farag sees it differently.he says the lyrical changes were significant,and revisions were also made to the melody.
this difference of opinion did not manifest itself immediately,however.for the time being,there was music to be made.janky,farag,and the rest of stormy weather recorded a demo of the song at thunderclap studios in hammond,indiana.they followed that up with a music video and presented their work to the bureau for review.the bureau was would be a great marketing tool.and stormy weather was a generous partner.rather than seeking to extract a profit from the venture,stormy weather agreed to allow the bureau to use the video and song in return for the costs of production.beyond that,the group decided the publicity generated from the bureau use of the material would be payment enough.farag issued a nonexclusive license to the bureau to that effect.
the bureau first use of the song came on december.the bureau opened a new visitor center that day,and it commemorated the occasion not only by playing the music video,but also with a live performance.when stormy weather completed production of the album on which the song ultimately appeared,published by street gold june of,the bureau purchased copies to resell at the visitor center beginning around the same time,the bureau treated callers placed on hold to the sounds of stormy weather,and it frequently played the song at the visitor center and used it in promotional ads.so passed the next three years.
on july,janky filed yet another copyright registration form,ostensibly to correct the mistake she had made in the previous form.janky omitted farag name,listing herself as the sole author of the music,lyrics,and arrangement performance.and at some point in time she notified the bureau that she was the exclusive owner.however,the bureau did not stop using the tune until she filed this lawsuit against it in october.
janky alleged in her complaint just like in her latest registration form that she was the sole author of the song and had a valid copyright in the tune to the exclusion of farag.as a result,so the theory went,farag license to the bureau was without effect and the latter use of the song illegal.although janky originally filed her complaint in the eastern district of michigan and named farag and street gold as additional defendants,the case was transferred to the northern district of indiana early,and the matter was stayed against farag and street gold pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings.the parties thereafter consented to have a magistrate judge handle the case.after conducting discovery,for summary judgment were filed.in march of,the magistrate judge issued his summary judgment decision in favor of janky.a jury trial,on damages,was conducted a year later,in march of.
the main in the district court and here on whether janky holds the copyright to the song by herself or whether she shares it with farag as a coauthor.in general,individuals are of a work only where they intend to create a joint work and contribute independently copyrightable material.erickson trinity theatre,cir.applying this standard,the magistrate judge found in favor of janky on both scores.first,he found that a jury would have no choice but to conclude that farag and janky did intend to b
