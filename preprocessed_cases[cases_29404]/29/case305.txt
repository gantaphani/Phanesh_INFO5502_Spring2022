surfvivor media,and peter deptula collectively surfvivor or deptula appeal the grant of summary judgment in favor of survivor productions,et collectively survivor,on surfvivor federal and state trademark infringement claims.surfvivor also challenges the magistrate judge ruling limiting discovery to allow examination of only certain survivor goods.
because no material issue of fact was raised reflecting confusion between the marks,we affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of survivor.we also hold that the discovery rulings were well within the bounds of the court discretion.
factual procedural background 
factual.and the surfvivor mark 
deptula holds three federal trademarks for the mark surfvivor,an amalgamation of the words surf and survivor.deptula has adorned the majority of his hawaiian products,ranging from sunscreen,to,to surfboards,with that mark.of these products,approximately thirty to fifty percent of plaintiff wares are emblazoned with the surfvivor mark alone.the remaining wares sport a tiny surfvivor mark along with a logo,such as college insignia.
visually,the surfvivor mark consists of the term surfvivor in block or cursive writing,often accompanied by a stylized graphic,such as a sun or a surfer.deptula has been using this mark for several years and has advertised his wares on local television and radio shows,on his website,and at local trade shows.surfvivor goods are primarily sold to hawaiian consumers through the local university,a chain of drugstores,military exchanges,and hawaiian branches of major retailers.deptula would like to expand surfvivor presence,but has not made any firm plans to do so.
and the survivor mark 
several years after deptula coined the surfvivor name,the began broadcasting a reality television show,survivor,involving a cast that must survive in extreme outdoor conditions.the show has been a viewer favorite for several years.
survivor producers created a special survivor logo for advertising and marketing purposes.as with the surfvivor mark,the survivor mark is emblazoned on a wide range of consumer merchandise,including,shorts,and hats.the survivor mark consists of the word survivor in block script,and is often accompanied by the words outwit,and outlast,or is superimposed on a stylized graphic suggesting the location of a particular series.
survivor producers acknowledge awareness of deptula mark.
evidence of actual confusion 
after survivor aired,deptula encountered a few people who wondered whether his business was sponsored by survivor.one retailer and one customer mistook survivor sunscreen for deptula product,and one trade show attendee thought that deptula business was endorsed by survivor producers.
survivor never received any complaints from confused customers,and a survey commissioned by survivor revealed that fewer than two percent of four hundred and two sunscreen purchasers were confused by the two marks.none of deptula customers ever returned any surfvivor goods because of a mistaken belief that the goods they purchased were produced or endorsed by survivor.no merchant stopped doing business with deptula on account of confusion between the product lines.
procedural background 
deptula filed suit against survivor for trademark infringement.during the course of pretrial litigation,deptula petitioned the court for an order compelling discovery of any survivor goods or services beyond,sunscreen and lipbalm.in response,the court limited discovery to survivor,sunscreen and lip balm,concluding that any other evidence would be irrelevant.
survivor subsequently moved for summary judgment,which was granted on the basis that deptula failed to present sufficient evidence to prove one of the elements of a trademark infringement the marks are similar enough to create a likelihood of confusion.because deptula state law claims relied on the same likelihood of confusion standard as deptula federal claim,the state law claims were also dismissed.deptula filed a timely appeal.
ii.standards of review 
the decision to grant summary judgment in a trademark infringement claim is reviewed de novo,and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party.see dreamwerks prod.group,skg studio,cir.we may affirm on any basis finding support in the record.commonwealth of the northern mariana islands united states,cir.although disfavored in trademark infringement cases,summary judgment may be entered when no genuine issue of material fact exists.see thane int l,trek bicycle,cir.
discovery rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see garneau city of seattle,cir.this standard also applies to rulings regarding the relevance of evidence see id.
iii.analysis 
deptula asserts infringement claims under the lanham act,and related state law claims.a successful trademark infringement claim under the lanham act requires a showing that the claimant holds a protectable mark,and that the alleged infringer imitating mark is similar enough to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.kp permanent,lasting impression i,d citation omitted.the test for likelihood of confusion requires the factfinder to determine whether a reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of the good or service bearing one of the marks.dreamwerks,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we have recognized two distinct claims in the trademark infringement context forward confusion and reverse confusion.see id.at.forward confusion occurs when consumers believe that goods bearing the junior mark came from,or were sponsored by,the senior mark holder.see id.at.to avoid summary judgment on a forward confusion claim,deptula must raise a material question of fact regarding whether the buying public thought that surfvivor was either the source of,or was sponsoring,the television show and its product line.by contrast,reverse confusion occurs when consumers dealing with the senior mark holder believe that they are doing business with the junior one.see id.to survive a summary judgment motion on a reverse confusion claim,a question of material fact would have to be raised as to whether consumers believed that survivor was either the source of,or was a sponsor of,deptula wares.we address each theory in turn,and then discuss the disposition of deptula state law claims,and motion to compel discovery.
forward confusion claim 
we need not determine whether deptula raised a material issue of fact on the forward confusion claim.deptula may not proceed on this theory because he failed to reference it in his complaint.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir upholding dismissal of a claim where the complaint contained no facts in support of that claim.deptula did not seek an opportunity to amend his complaint,relying instead on his argument that he sufficiently pled a claim for forward confusion.accordingly,deptula has no cognizable forward confusion claim to review on appeal.see id.
reverse confusion claim 
to analyze likelihood of confusion,we consider the following eight factors,generally referred to as the sleekcraft factors 
strength of the mark s 
relatedness of the goods 
similarity of the marks 
evidence of actual confusion 
marketing channels 
degree of consumer care 
the defendants intent 
likelihood of expansion.

i.the strength of the senior surfvivor mark 
the purpose of examining the strength of the plaintiff mark is to determine the scope of trademark protection to which the mark is entitled entrepreneur media,smith,cir.the more unique the mark,the greater the degree of protection.see id.
trademarks are divided into five categories.the two strongest sets of marks are arbitrary and fanciful marks,which trigger the highest degree of trademark protection.see id.at.arbitrary marks are common words that have no connection with the actual example,dutch boy pai
