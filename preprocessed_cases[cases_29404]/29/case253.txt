this appeal stems from the district court summary judgment dismissing fleischer studios,fleischer copyright and trademark infringement action.the district court ruled that fleischer held neither a valid copyright nor a valid trademark in the betty boop cartoon character and thus lacked standing to sue.fleischer appeals.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to a,and our jurisdiction arises under.we affirm.
betty boop combined in appearance the childish with the large round baby face with big eyes and a nose like a button,framed in a somewhat careful coiffure,with a very small body fleischer studios ralph freundlich.betty boop was the creation of max fleischer,then head of fleischer studios,original fleischer.beginning in,original fleischer developed a number of cartoon films featuring betty boop.for a time,original fleischer licensed the betty boop image for use in toys,dolls,and other merchandise.approximately ten years after creating her,original fleischer abandoned betty boop and sold its rights to both her cartoons and her character.soon after,in,original fleischer was dissolved.
max fleischer family attempted to revive the fleischer cartoon business in the early.the family incorporated its new entity under the same name as original fleischer and attempted to repurchase the intellectual property rights to the betty boop character.to be clear,fleischer,the plaintiff in this action,is a distinct and separate entity from the now defunct original fleischer which first owned betty boop.
fleischer believes that its purchases have made it the exclusive owner of the betty boop character copyright and trademark.based on this belief,fleischer licenses the betty boop character for use in toys,dolls,and other merchandise.this merchandise has reached such a high level of popularity that even drug dealers have been known to use it.see united states lakoskey,cir a search warrant was issued,and the package was opened pursuant to that warrant on january.the package contained a large ceramic betty boop doll,with four concealed,separately wrapped plastic bundles of methamphetamine inside.
the defendants in this action.com,x one x movie archive,and leo valencia collectively,also license betty boop merchandise.the copyright pursuant to which licenses its products is based on vintage posters featuring betty boop image that has restored.
during summary judgment proceedings before the district court,the parties disputed whether fleischer owned an exclusive copyright to the betty boop character.fleischer asserted that its ownership of the copyright,which was first owned by original fleischer,arises through several alternative chains of title.only one chain is relevant here,however,because fleischer has abandoned the others on appeal.the purported title chain is as follows original fleischer transferred its rights to paramount pictures,paramount in paramount transferred those rights to um m tv um m in in,um m transferred these rights to national telefilm associates,nta,which became republic pictures in and finally,republic pictures transferred the exclusive copyright to fleischer in.
disputed this alleged chain of title,arguing that there was no admissible evidence to establish each link in the chain with the exception of the transfer from original fleischer to paramount.the district court agreed and held that fleischer failed to satisfy its burden of proof regarding the transfer of rights from um m to nta and from nta to republic pictures.
the district court also dismissed fleischer trademark infringement claim,holding that fleischer failed to submit proper evidence of a registered federal trademark in the betty boop image,and,although it had evidence of a registered federal trademark in the name betty boop,the fractured ownership and use of that mark destroyed fleischer trademark rights.the court further held that fleischer did not establish that it owned trademarks in betty boop name or image.
there is no doubt that a separate betty boop character copyright exists.although there is no evidence in the record that original fleischer filed a copyright registration for the betty boop character,that is of no moment.because all of the copied works were created before,both parties agree that the copyright act of act applies to the copyrights at issue in this litigation.see fellowship church ananda church of,cir.under section of the act 
the copyright provided by this title shall protect all the copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted,and all matter therein in which copyright is already subsisting,but without extending the duration or scope of such copyright.the copyright upon composite works or periodicals shall give to the proprietor thereof all the rights in respect thereto which he would have if each part were individually copyrighted under this title.

the parties agree that betty boop became a separate copyrightable component of one of original fleischer films,and we accept that concession for the purposes of this appeal.shivers amerco,cir see also rice,at.the logical result of this concession is that original fleischer owned all the rights in respect to betty boop which it would have if it had individually copyrighted it kaplan fox film.
fleischer now appeals,objecting to both the district court copyright and trademark rulings.we review the district court summary judgment de novo.ellison robertson,cir.
fleischer bears the burden of proving copyright ownership.litchfield spielberg,cir to prove copyright infringement,the plaintiff must show ownership of the copyright.as mentioned earlier,fleischer asserts ownership of a copyright in the betty boop character through the following chain of title original fleischer to paramount to um m to nta to republic pictures to fleischer.because this complete chain is necessary to establish ownership,fleischer copyright action requires it to establish each link.
it is undisputed that in paramount obtained from original fleischer the rights to both the betty boop character and numerous betty boop cartoons.what is disputed,however,is whether paramount then transferred the betty boop character to um fleischer argues that it did so by a purchase agreement that stated,in part 
paramount hereby grants and assigns to um m all of paramount right,title and interest in and to said photoplays of betty boop which are deliverable by paramount to um m hereunder and do not revert to paramount under paragraph hereof,hereinafter for convenience referred to as sold photoplays,any copyrights subsisting therein,the literary material upon which they are based and the instruments whereby paramount acquired its right,title and interest in and to such literary material 
however,a key provision in that same agreement carved out the transfer of the characters in those sold photoplays 
anything to the contrary notwithstanding,no grant or assignment is made hereunder to um m of the characters and characterizations contained in said sold photoplays or said literary material,or of the copyrights in said characters or characterizations,or of any production or other rights in said characters and characterizations,or to use said characters and characterizations or the names of said characters or trade names,trademark and names of the series of sold photoplays or of said literary material in any manner except only as part of the particular sold photoplay in which they or any of them are contained 
in other words,the purchase agreement explicitly provided that the right to the betty boop character copyright was retained by paramount,rather than transferred to um m.the a nything to the contrary notwithstanding clause is unambiguous.see cisneros alpine ridge,t he use of such a notwithstanding clause clearly signals the drafter intention that the provisions of the notwithstanding section override conflicting provisions of any other section.
the doctrine of indivisibility has no impact on this conclusion.t he doctrine of indivisibility is a rule that relates primarily to standing.abend mca,f d,cir,aff on other grounds sub,stewart abend.under the doctrine,a licensee of a,someone who holds only partial copyright not copyright a work in the licensee name.id.fleischer argues that if,as we hold here,paramount retained the copyright to the betty boop character but transferred the copyright to the films to um m,the doctrine of indivisibility would have prevented um m from renewing its copyright.that result is evidence,according to fleischer,that neither party intended to separate the betty boop character and film rights.at most,fleischer states,paramount may have retained a contractual right or license back to exploit the character apart from the films.
fleischer is mistaken.under the act,the doctrine of indivisibility may have prohibited a copyright owner from renewing his or her copyright if,for example,he or she had previously sold the rights to his or her story.id or,because the law abhors a forfeiture,a court would deem the purported owner of the rights to be a mere licensee,thereby allowing the author to renew the copyright.sybersound records,uav,cir.but that is not the scenario here.through the um m agreement,um m obtained the totality of rights commanded by copyright for the betty boop films,quoting gardner nike,cir what it did not obtain were the rights to the betty boop character.while the doctrine of indivisibility may have prohibited um m from renewing the film copyright if,for example,it did not obtain the dvd distribution rights to the betty boop films it purchased,the doctrine would have had no impact on um m attempt to renew its copyright if it did not own a character copyright component part of the film.see richlin pictures,cir renewal of motion picture permitted without owning all component parts fellowship church,at a blanket copyright gives a magazine publisher rights in an individual contribution only if the publisher owns the common law copyright as the author of the contribution,or as the author assignee,citing mail express life pub,cir.in short,the doctrine of indivisibility does not deprive copyright holders of the right to transfer or,in this case,retain the component parts of their copyrights.if we held otherwise,we would be directly contravening section of the act by depriving paramount of all the rights in respect to the component part which it would have if each part were individually copyrighted.repealed 
contrary to another of fleischer arguments,paramount conduct subsequent to the execution of the contract does not cast doubt on our conclusion.fleischer is correct that subsequent conduct can be used in some instances to discern contractual intent.see wolkowitz fdic in re imperial credit industries,cir.however,paramount subsequent conduct is not evidence of paramount intent to transfer the betty boop character to um paramount did not stand idly by while um m renewed the copyrights and profited from ownership of those copyrights.instead,the record suggests that three years after entering into the um m agreement,paramount transferred its betty boop character copyright to harvey films.while we have doubts as to whether the use of subsequent behavior in this the contractual language is appropriate,see wells fargo bank trust mcduffie,cir,paramount subsequent behavior supports our conclusion that it did not transfer the rights to the betty boop character copyright by the um m agreement.
the dissent states that we are answer ing only half of the issue by failing to explain what happened to the copyright after it transferred to harvey films in the.dissent at.that complaint is not.in this case,the only issue raised by fleischer on appeal is whether fleischer obtained the betty boop copyright via the chain of title original fleischer to paramount to um m to nta to republic to fleischer.in the district court,fleischer raised a number of other theories but the district court held all of them to be faulty.by not seeking review of those holdings here,fleischer has abandoned them.see cook schriro,cir issue not raised on appeal is abandoned united states gregory,cir same.the dissent can not resurrect them.it would be patently unfair to to rule in favor of fleischer on one of the theories not raised in fleischer opening brief.see stuard stewart,cir w e are not going to construct an argument for the state sua sponte,depriving stuard counsel of a fair chance to respond to it.
perhaps fleischer should have argued that waived its argument by not asserting it to the district court.resolution trust first am.bank,cir explaining that issues not raised before the district court are generally forfeited.perhaps fleischer does not object to argument on this ground because,as argues,it raised the issue with sufficient clarity to preserve it.whatever the reason,fleischer failure to argue that waived this argument requires us to reach its merits.norwood vance,cir this court will not address waiver if not raised by the opposing party.
upon review of the merits of argument,it is clear that paramount did not transfer the copyright to the betty boop character to um because the chain of title is broken,and the only chain of title at issue in this appeal is this one involving um m,the district court properly dismissed fleischer claim.
fleischer also sued for infringing its trademarks.the products to which fleischer objected include betty boop dolls as well as and handbags prominently displaying her image.the district court dismissed fleischer claim,holding that fleischer did not provide evidence,in the time required by the federal rules of civil procedure,that fleischer owned either the common law or federally registered trademarks that allegedly infringed.
both parties briefs discuss the details of whether the district court decision was correct,including the issue of whether cartoon characters are protectable as trademarks,whether fleischer owns a registered image trademark in betty boop image and name,whether fleischer owns a commonlaw trademark in betty boop,whether the fractured ownership of the betty boop copyright precludes fleischer from asserting a trademark claim,and,finally,whether infringed fleischer marks.but all of these arguments are mooted by controlling precedent that neither party cited international order of job daughters lindeburg,cir.
although the parties did not cite or argue the application of job daughters to the facts of this case,and while the district court did not base its decision on that case,it is clear that we have the power to affirm the district court decision on an alternate basis if it is supported by the record.badea cox,cir.because resolving this issue is in the interest of judicial economy,we elect to do so.see united states koyomejian,cir,citing badea,at.
in job daughters,plaintiff job daughters sued defendant lindeburg for trademark infringement arising out of lindeburg manufacture and sale of jewelry bearing the job daughters insignia.at.job daughters was a young women organization that used its name and emblem as trademarks.id.lindeburg was a maker and retailer of fraternal jewelry.id.lindeburg began selling jewelry and related items bearing the job daughters insignia and,after failing to negotiate a license,job daughters sued lindeburg for trademark infringement.id.
when the case came to us on appeal,we evaluated the same trademark infringement claims that are asserted here those based on and a.job daughters,at.we held that lindeburg was not using the job daughters name and emblem as trademarks.id.at.that conclusion,and the reasoning that job daughters used to reach it,are directly applicable to the case before us.
in general,job daughters stated,
trademark law is concerned only with identification of the maker,sponsor,or endorser of the product so as to avoid confusing consumers.trademark law does not prevent a person from copying functional features of a product which constitute the actual benefit that the consumer wishes to purchase,as distinguished from an assurance that a particular entity made,sponsored,or endorsed a product.
it is not uncommon for a name or emblem that serves in one context as a collective mark or trademark also to be merchandised for its own intrinsic utility to consumers.we commonly identify ourselves by displaying emblems expressing allegiances.our jewelry,clothing,and cars are emblazoned with inscriptions showing the organizations we belong to,the schools we attend,the landmarks we have visited,the sports teams we support,the beverages we imbibe.although these inscriptions frequently include names and emblems that are also used as collective marks or trademarks,it would be naive to conclude that the name or emblem is desired because consumers believe that the product somehow originated with or was sponsored by the organization the name or emblem signifies.
id.at internal citations omitted emphases added.
after setting forth these principles,job daughters explained the role of the court in determining whether an infringer use of an image and name was for functional or trademark purposes a court must closely examine the articles themselves,the defendant merchandising practices,and any evidence that consumers have actually inferred a connection between the defendant product and the trademark owner.id.at.accordingly,we held 
lindeburg was not using the job daughters name and emblem as trademarks.the insignia were a prominent feature of each item so as to be visible to others when worn,allowing the wearer to publicly express her allegiance to the organization.lindeburg never designated the merchandise as official job daughters merchandise or otherwise affirmatively indicated sponsorship.job daughters did not show a single instance in which a customer was misled about the origin,sponsorship,or endorsement of lindeburg jewelry,nor that it received any complaints about lindeburg wares.finally,there was evidence that many other jewelers sold unlicensed job daughters jewelry,implying that consumers did not ordinarily purchase their fraternal jewelry from only official sources.we conclude that job daughters did not meet its burden of proving that a typical buyer of lindeburg merchandise would think that the jewelry was produced,sponsored,or endorsed by the organization.the name and emblem were functional aesthetic components of the product,not trademarks.there could be,therefore,no infringement.
job daughters is directly applicable to fleischer trademark claims.even a cursory examination,let alone a close one,of the articles themselves,the defendant merchandising practices,and any evidence that consumers have actually inferred a connection between the defendant product and the trademark owner,reveal that is not using betty boop as a trademark,but instead as a functional product.see id.at.just as in job daughters,betty boop w as a prominent feature of each item so as to be visible to others when worn id.never designated the merchandise as official fleischer merchandise or otherwise affirmatively indicated sponsorship.id.fleischer did not show a single instance in which a customer was misled about the origin,sponsorship,or endorsement of products,nor that it received any complaints about wares.id.given the marked similarity between the facts of job daughters and the appeal before us,we reach the same conclusion here as in our earlier decision.the name and betty boop image were functional aesthetic components of the product,not trademarks.there could be,therefore,no infringement.see also new kids on the block news am,cir t he trademark laws do not give the new kids the right to channel their fans enthusiasm and dollars only into items licensed or authorized by them,citing job daughters.
dastar twentieth century fox film,another case that both parties failed to cite,is also relevant.dastar held that where a copyright is in the public domain,a party may not assert a trademark infringement action against an alleged infringer if that action is essentially a substitute for a copyright infringement action.id.at.to do so would be to circumvent the copyright act and allow trademark holders perpetual rights to exploit their creative work.id.the court explained,
the right to copy,and to copy without attribution,once a copyright has expired,like the right to make an article whose patent has the right to make it in precisely the shape it carried when to the public.in general,unless an intellectual property right such as a patent or copyright protects an item,it will be subject to copying.the rights of a patentee or copyright holder are part of a carefully crafted bargain,under which,once the patent or copyright monopoly has expired,the public may use the invention or work at will and without attribution.thus,in construing the lanham act,we have been careful to caution against misuse or of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by patent or copyright.
id.internal quotations,citations and alterations omitted emphases added.
if we ruled that depictions of betty boop infringed fleischer trademarks,the betty boop character would essentially never enter the public domain.such a result would run directly contrary to dastar.at to hold otherwise would be akin to finding that a created a species of perpetual patent and copyright,which congress may not do.
therefore,even if fleischer owns trademarks in betty boop,it can not assert a trademark infringement action against given that use of betty boop is functional and aesthetic,and because ruling in fleischer favor would prevent the betty boop character from ever entering the public domain,fleischer infringment claim is barred by job daughters and dastar.
in light of our holding,we also deny as moot fleischer motion to take judicial notice of the incontestible status of its trademark registrations.
i respectfully dissent.
the beginning and the ending of this story are undisputed.max fleischer created the lovable character betty boop in the.in,he sold to paramount pictures the copyright to certain cartoons and to the character betty boop herself.max fleischer died in.
after fleischer death,some of his descendants incorporated fleischer studios,which is plaintiff here.part of plaintiff plan was to bring back into circulation the character betty boop.carrying out that plan,plaintiff purchased the rights to betty boop from various entities in the and.when defendants began selling betty boop merchandise,plaintiff brought this action alleging,among other things,copyright infringement.
plaintiff must establish the chain of title of the copyright to the character betty boop.it is undisputed that paramount owned the copyright as of.the dispute focuses on the chain of title between paramount and plaintiff.in the district court,plaintiff argued,primarily,that paramount sold the copyright in to um m tv corporation,which eventually sold it to plaintiff.plaintiff argued,alternatively,that even if paramount did not sell the copyright to um m,paramount sold the copyright in to harvey films,which eventually sold the copyright to plaintiff.in other words,one chain of title leads through um m and another leads through harvey films,but both paths lead to plaintiff.
a.the district court view copyright transferred to um m 
the district court held that paramount sold the copyright to um m in.the district court held,however,that the link between um m and plaintiff was broken,largely because of the court evidentiary rulings.plaintiff appealed.
on appeal,plaintiff made precisely the arguments one would expect the district court erred in its evidentiary rulings and in its conclusion that the link between um m and plaintiff was broken.in their answering brief,defendants defended the district court holdings on those points.in my view,plaintiff is correct that the district court erred.for example,the relevant statements in the settlement agreement qualify as an exception to hearsay under federal rule of evidence and establish the link between um m and plaintiff.
in sum,if the copyright transferred to um m,plaintiff prevails.
defendants new theory copyright transferred to no one 
defendants also raised an entirely new theory.they argued that the district court erred in concluding that paramount sold the copyright to um defendants argued that,because of the doctrine of indivisibility,the copyright passed neither to um m nor to harvey films instead
