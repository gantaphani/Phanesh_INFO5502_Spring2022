in october of,pollack began negotiations with stewart agent,steve levine at icm,for a concert tour of south and latin america by stewart.pollack had in each of the cities the proposed tour would visit.on october,one of these subpromotors,plaintiff achilles sojo of argentina,arranged for to be deposited into icm trust account to demonstrate good faith.pollack thereafter agreed with levine and stewart manager,annie challis,on a,concert tour commencing february,for million,half of which was due on signing of a formal contract.
tyerman becomes involved.
on november,challis sent stewart attorney,barry tyerman at ah,an email outlining the terms of the tour and instructing tyerman to prepare a contract and collect the deposit.tyerman enclosed the first draft of the contract to pollack in a letter dated november.the letter directed pollack to sign and return the contract and arrange for wire transfer of the balance of the first payment,to the ah trust account.

pollack discussed the release of the funds with sojo and,after pollack signed the release,sojo commenced ticket sales in argentina.sojo testified it is customary to sell tickets after money is released to the artist.after pollack signed the release,was transferred from the icm trust account to the ah trust account.
the negotiations continue and eventually unravel.
at some point,pollack changed the due date for the first payment of the deposit in the fourth draft of the contract from january to january,initialed the change and returned the draft to tyerman.on january,pollack advised tyerman by the promoters had agreed to pay approximately for monitors at the concert venues,thus concluding the last deal point in dispute.a formal contract was never signed.however,witnesses on both sides of the dispute agreed concert tours frequently proceed in the absence of a signed contract and,in some cases,the contract is signed after the tour is completed.

postevidentiary motions,verdict and postverdict motions.

discussion 
admissibility of the testimony of the plaintiffs expert.defendants contention.
the defendants contend the trial court erroneously permitted owen sloane,an entertainment attorney practicing since,to testify the parties did not reach a binding agreement in that there was no meeting of the minds.the defendants argue such expert opinion testimony is inadmissible to determine the intentions of contracting parties transport indem.american fid.cas.d.or to explain matters of common knowledge kotla regents of university of california th,d.they claim sloane also improperly defined legal terms such as meeting of the minds and guaranteed compensation summers gilbert th,d and he improperly testified the contract drafts contained no provision barring ticket sales without stewart prior written approval,the deposited money did not belong to stewart,the liquidated damages clause was not a fair and reasonable forfeiture beasley wells fargo bank d,d the validity of liquidated damages clause is a question of law,and the three grounds identified by tyerman in the cancellation letter january,were not legally valid grounds upon which to claim breach of contract.the defendants claim sloane even testified pollack was credible while levine,challis and tyerman were biased in stewart favor.
defendants conclude sloane,like the expert witness in summers,made plaintiffs closing argument from the witness stand.summers gilbert,supra,th at,d.thus,the result of the trial would have been more favorable to the defendants had sloane improper testimony been excluded.
defendants failed to object to much of the testimony they claim was inadmissible.
the defendants claim they have preserved this issue for appeal by making a motion in limine which was denied and by objecting at trial to similar testimony by sloane.thus,any further objection would have been futile.city of long beach farmers merchants bank th,d.
however,the trial court sustained at least one of the defendants objections to sloane testimony.specifically,when plaintiffs counsel asked if sloane had an opinion as to whether the parties expressed their intention that there be a signed agreement in order for there to be a binding contract,the trial court sustained an objection interposed by the defendants that the answer would invade the province of the jury.given that the trial court sustained at least one objection to sloane opinion testimony,it can not be said that further objection by the defendants would have been futile.however,even if the defendants failure to object in the trial court is overlooked,the claim fails on the merits.
sloane testimony properly admitted.
generally,the opinion of an expert is admissible when it is r elated to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact,subd.a summers gilbert,supra,th at,d.also,t estimony in the form of an opinion that is otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.however,where the jury is just as competent as the expert to consider and weigh the evidence and draw the necessary conclusions,then the need for expert testimony evaporates.citation.people torres th,d summers gilbert,supra,at,d.
the record reveals sloane testimony related primarily to the customs and practices of the entertainment industry,specifically,the music concert business.because these customs and practices are sufficiently beyond common experience,sloane expert opinion was admissible to assist the trier of fact.marx v.the diners club,cir,securities business neal farmers ins.exchange cal d,attorney properly could opine whether an insurance company acted in bad faith.
any error in the admission of sloane testimony was harmless.
even if some of the opinions expressed by sloane invaded the province of the jury,the error does not require reversal.the opinions expressed by sloane were exactly the opposite of the opinions expressed by the defendants expert,tyerman,who had been stewart attorney for years and who testified both as a percipient witness and an expert.
the defendants argue tyerman rebuttal testimony can not be used to show the error was harmless because,at the time of this testimony,tyerman was being examined by plaintiffs counsel after sloane already had testified improperly there was no contract.the defendants assert they were entitled to rebut sloane testimony without waiving the claim of evidentiary error.hoel city of los angeles d,an attorney who submits to the authority of an erroneous adverse ruling,after making appropriate objections,does not waive the error in the ruling by introducing responsive evidence to offset or explain the erroneously admitted evidence so far as possible.
however,other defense witnesses with credentials similar to tyerman in the entertainment industry testified stewart entered into a binding contract with pollack.for example,levine,stewart agent,testified they had a deal after stewart appearance was confirmed.challis,stewart manager,testified she thought they had a confirmed deal.finally,stewart himself appeared as a witness at trial and testified a deal is a deal.
we are confident the admission of the opinion of a single expert on the plaintiffs side to oppose the repeatedly expressed contrary opinion on the defendants side does not require reversal.because exclusion of sloane testimony with respect to whether the parties reached a meeting of the minds would not have altered the result of the trial,any error must be seen as harmless.soule general motors cal th,d,finney gomez th,d cal.const.art.vi.
the judgment on the count of intentional interference with contract must be reversed.
the jury found the defendants interfered with subcontracts among pm group and ake music pm group and cie brasil pm group and jose dueno ake music and rafael fernandez ake music and multimusica and velarde and grand entertainment.each of these subcontracts contemplated a concert performance by stewart at one or more of the venues on the proposed tour.
however,as a matter of law,stewart and his agents could not have interfered with the performance of these subcontracts.the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations is committed only by who have no legitimate interest in the scope or course of the contract performance.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d.consequently,a contracting party is incapable of interfering with the performance of his or
