plaintiff robert donchez filed suit against defendants coors brewing company coors and foote cone belding advertising,incorporated fcb,claiming they violated the lanham act,federal common law,and colorado state law by misappropriating for use in a national advertising campaign a unique character he had created,as well as a related term,beerman,that he alleged was associated with the character.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all claims.donchez appeals.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
donchez is a colorado resident.in january,he applied to become a beer vendor for the colorado rockies baseball team.the rockies hired donchez and assigned him badge number,identifying him as the first licensed beer vendor in rockies history.in his work as a vendor,donchez allegedly created an image of a distinct,outspoken,character and named him bob the beerman.at.the bob the beerman character used beer,peanuts and cracker jacks as props to entertain crowds.id.the bob the beerman character also used various catch phrases,including the following my favorite word in the english language beer two favorite words cold beer three favorite words cold beer man id.at.in the fall of,donchez filed for service mark protection for the bob the beerman character pursuant to colorado law.donchez mark,bob the beerman,was registered by the state of colorado,under the class of education and entertainment services,on october.id.at.
acting as bob the beerman,donchez worked as a vendor not only at rockies baseball games,but also at football,hockey and basketball events in the denver area and in other cities.id.at.donchez also provided entertainment services on television,radio and in print as well as appearing live at a number of charitable and other events in the denver area and other cities.id.in,donchez authored a book titled a view from the stands a season with bob the beerman,that described his character antics and experiences during his first season vending beer at rockies baseball games.id.at.in,donchez starred and collaborated in and a video production entitled ultimate bob vendors a profile in courage.id.at.
during the course of his work for the rockies,donchez was encouraged by steve saunders,an employee of coors,to contact coors to see if coors would be interested in a promotional theme based upon his bob the beerman character.id.at.saunders assisted donchez in arranging a meeting with integer group,llc integer,a company that performed local promotions work for coors,in january in golden,colorado.during the meeting,donchez suggested to tom hohensee,an integer employee,that coors should feature his bob the beerman character in an advertising campaign.in support of that suggestion,donchez appeared in his bob the beerman costume and gave hohensee a copy of his book and videotape.however,coors and integer ultimately decided not to enter into any type of contractual arrangement with donchez 
in april,coors began a national television advertising campaign for its coors light product utilizing many different actors and an actress portraying beer vendors.id.at.the advertisements featured the vendors interacting with the crowd in amusing ways at sporting events.id.some of the vendors call ed themselves or we re referred to by customers as beerman,or the beerman,or hey,beerman,or hey,beerstud.id.the advertisements were produced by defendant fcb.
according to donchez,friends,acquaintances,and fans at the rockies ballpark began making comments to him regarding the coors advertising campaign.some,according to donchez,assumed coors had purchased his character,or that donchez was somehow affiliated with the coors advertising campaign,while a few assumed he was copying the coors advertisements.
on march,donchez filed suit against coors and fcb asserting claims for violation of the common law right of publicity,service mark infringement under colorado law,common law service mark infringement,unfair competition in violation of the lanham act,violation of the colorado consumer protection act,unjust enrichment,and unfair misappropriation and exploitation of business value.following extensive discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.on september,the district court granted defendants motion with respect to all claims.
donchez contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on all his claims.in particular,donchez contends the district court usurped the role of the jury by ma king credibility assessments and weigh ing the evidence relevant to each of his claims.aplt.br.at.further,donchez contends the district court decided disputed fact issues such as whether beerman is generic both generally and as used by defendants and whether defendants advertisements appropriated his likeness.id.lastly,donchez contends the district court extended its initial findings to his other state law claims without properly analyzing the distinct elements and nature of these claims.id.
we review de novo a district court grant or denial of summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.see alexander oklahoma,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we view the evidence,and draw reasonable inferences therefrom,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.combs pricewaterhousecoopers,llp,cir.
service claims 
in the final pretrial order,donchez characterized three of the claims in his complaint as being dependent on his service mark rights.these three claims included service mark infringement under.the second claim for relief in the complaint common law service mark infringement the third claim for relief in the complaint and unfair competition under a of the lanham act,a the fourth claim for relief in the complaint.we address these claims in reverse order.
unfair competition in violation of a of lanham act 
section a of the lanham act,prohibiting the use of false designations of origin,protects against service mark infringement even if the mark has not been federally registered.search,llc,cir.to prevail in an action for unfair competition under a,a plaintiff must establish that her mark is protectable,and the defendant use of an identical or similar mark is likely to cause confusion among consumers.packman chicago tribune,cir see search,at.for the reasons that follow,we conclude donchez has failed to present sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find in his favor on the first of these elements,and thus the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.
federal law defines a service mark to include any word or any combination thereof used by a person to identify and distinguish the services of one person,including a unique service,from the services of others and to indicate the source of the services,even if that source is unknown.to be protectable,a mark must be capable of distinguishing the products or services it marks from those of others.lane capital,lane capital,cir.there are five different categories of terms with respect to the protection of a mark generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,and fanciful.id.the five categories have been succinctly described in the following manner 
a mark is generic if it is a common description of products or services and refers to the genus of which the particular product or service is a species.a mark is descriptive if it describes the product or service features,qualities,or ingredients in ordinary language or describes the use to which the product or service is put.a mark is suggestive if it merely suggests the features of the product or service,requiring the purchaser to use imagination,thought,and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of the goods or services.an arbitrary mark applies a common word in an unfamiliar way.a fanciful mark is not a real word at all,but is invented for its use as a mark.
these categories reflect both the eligibility for protection and the degree of protection accorded a particular mark.id.if a term is generic the common name for a product or service,it is ineligible for protection because t he public has an inherent right to call a product or service by its generic name.search,at.a descriptive mark may be eligible for protection,but only if it has acquired a secondary meaning in the minds of the public.id.fanciful words expressly coined to serve as trade or service marks,arbitrary common words applied in unfamiliar ways,and suggestive marks words that connote,rather than describe,some quality or characteristic of a product or service are inherently distinctive,and thus receive the greatest protection against infringement.id.
the categorization of a mark is a factual question.see courtenay communications hall,cir heileman brewing,cir stroh brewery,cir.notably,however,the own perception of the mark is not the object of the inquiry.lane capital,at.rather,the function is to determine,based on the evidence before it,what the perception of the purchasing public is.id.
here,it is undisputed that defendants did not,in the course of the challenged advertising campaign,use the term bob the beerman.defendants did,however,repeatedly use the phrase beerman or beer man in their campaign,and it is the use of that term which donchez contends violated a of the lanham act.accordingly,the question we must address is how to classify that term for purposes of a.because donchez has never registered the term with the united states patent and trademark office,it is his burden to demonstrate that it is protectable under a.see courtenay communications,at ale house,raleigh ale house,cir.
in his response to defendants summary judgment motion,donchez argued the term beerman was suggestive because he used it not only for beer vending services,but also to identify his entertainment and promotional services throughout colorado.at.donchez further argued there was at least a triable issue on whether hearing the term beerman require d some imagination to determine the actual nature of his entertainment services.id.at.in support of his arguments,donchez pointed to a single piece of evidence,a report prepared by one of his expert witnesses,curtis krechevsky,in which krechevsky allegedly stated that 
it is my opinion that the use of the term beerman in connection with books and entertainment services was use in a suggestive sense and not descriptively.as specifically regards entertainment services,i believe that a leap of imagination or mental effort is required to understand the nature of the covered services from the mark beerman.
id.for whatever reason,however,donchez has not included that report in his appellate appendix.thus,we can not consider the report and the statements included therein in determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the classification of the term beerman.in turn,that leaves donchez without any evidence to support his assertion that the term beerman is suggestive 
in his appellate pleadings,donchez argues,as he also did in district court,that the term beerman is at least descriptive and has acquired a secondary meaning when used in the context of entertainment and promotional services.aplt.reply br.at.in support of his assertion that the term is descriptive rather than generic,donchez points to three items of evidence documents and testimony indicating that prior to this lawsuit in april,coors filed applications with the united states patent and trademark office seeking trademark registration for the terms beerman and,and abandoned those applications after this lawsuit was filed the lack of any definitions of the term beerman in leading dictionaries and survey evidence regarding the public view of the term beerman.
addressing these items of evidence in order,we conclude they carry little,if any,weight.with regard to the trademark applications filed by coors in,coors was seeking trademark protection for the terms beerman and only in connection with clothing,and caps,printed materials,and beer.as applied to those three categories of products,the terms appear to be something other than generic or descriptive.however,the question at issue is how to classify the term beerman as applied to services,or more specifically a beer vending character.coors trademark applications,in our view,lend no support,one way or the other,with regard to the resolution of that question.
as for the fact that the term beerman does not appear in any leading dictionaries,it is true this type of evidence can,depending on the context,be relevant to the issue of genericness.shoe shonac,cir.defendants suggest,however,there is a rational explanation for the term beerman not appearing in any leading dictionaries it is a composite term made up of two generic words that are,in fact,found in all dictionaries,beer and man.further,defendants argue,u nlike combinations of generic words that have unexpected,beerman is nothing more than the sum of its parts.aplee.br.at.we are not persuaded that a jury could rationally find,based solely on the lack of dictionary definitions,that the term beerman is descriptive.
the last piece of evidence cited by donchez concerns the results of a telephone survey conducted by defendants.approximately persons in the denver area were asked whether nine different names,including the term beerman,were common name s or brand name s.at.the term beerman was recognized as a common or generic name by of the respondents.id.at.donchez,however,attempts to interpret the results in his favor by noting that several other terms,including draft beer,popcorn,vendor,and mascot,were found by a higher percentage of the respondents,from to to be common or generic terms.further,donchez cites one of his own expert witnesses,robert gulovson,who opined there is a statistically significant difference between the responses obtained for beerman and the other common names in the survey.at.again,however,we are not persuaded that a rational trier of fact could find,based on donchez interpretation of the defendants survey results,that the term beerman is descriptive rather than generic.in particular,the number of survey respondents classifying the term beerman as generic was clearly substantial.further,there is no indication that the survey respondents were asked to classify the term beerman as applied to entertainment or promotional services.
even assuming the evidence presented by donchez was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find that the term beerman is descriptive rather than generic when applied to entertainment or promotional services,we conclude he has failed to present sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find that the term has acquired a secondary meaning.secondary meaning exists only if most consumers have come to think of the word as not descriptive at all but as the name of the product or service.packman,at internal quotations omitted.a plaintiff may establish secondary meaning through the use of direct evidence,such as consumer surveys or testimony from consumers.flynn ak peters,cir.a plaintiff may also 
establish secondary meaning for a name by presenting circumstantial evidence regarding the length and manner of its use,the nature and extent of advertising and promotion of the mark and the efforts made in the direction of promoting a conscious connection,in the public mind,between the name or mark and a particular product or venture.
id.internal quotations omitted.
in his opening appellate brief,donchez does not point to any evidence in the record that would help establish secondary meaning for the term beerman.we therefore turn,out of an abundance of caution,to donchez response to defendants summary judgment motion,a copy of which is included in his appendix.in that response,donchez cited four declarations which he described as coming from members of the public within the rocky mountain region and identify ing the term beerman with his entertainment and promotional services.at.donchez has included only two of those declarations in his appendix.one declaration is from an individual named harold beier who worked as an usher at rockies games.the other declaration
