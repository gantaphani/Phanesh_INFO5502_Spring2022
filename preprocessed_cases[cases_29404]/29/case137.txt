on appeal,the defendants proffer myriad issues,but their principal complaints implicate the district court determining that production companies,such as the plaintiffs,can hold copyrights under mexican law,permitting the plaintiffs to recover damages for both copyright infringement and unfair competition,and awarding attorney fees and costs to the plaintiffs.in addition,the defendants assert a litany of legal and factual errors purportedly committed by the district court during the trial.the plaintiffs the district court grant of partial summary judgment to the defendants on the copyright status of seven of the disputed films.we affirm the district court on all issues advanced on appeal,except for the quantum of attorneys fees and costs awarded to the plaintiffs,which we remand to the district court for a more precise determination,per the johnson factors of the plaintiffs recoverable fees and costs incurred.
facts and proceedings 
in the,the defendants began distributing a variety of mexican films in the.this activity included films that had been produced and released by the plaintiffs in mexico during that country golden age of cinema,between the and the.the plaintiffs acknowledge that,at the time the defendants began distributing these films in the,of them had lost their copyrights here for failure of the authors to comply with copyright formalities,such as registering and renewing copyrights.according to the plaintiffs,however,the legal status of these films changed in when the adopted the uruguay round agreement act uraa thereby amending the copyright act the uraa eliminated many of the formalities previously required for copyrighting foreign works in the,including registration and notice.the uraa also provided,effective january,for the automatic restoration of copyrights in various foreign works that had fallen into the public domain in the as a result of their foreign authors failure to follow copyright formalities 
following congress adoption of the uraa,the defendants began to obtain assignments of rights to the films from some individual contributors,such as screenwriters and music composers.the defendants did not,however,contact any of the plaintiffs to obtain assignments or licenses to these films.the defendants continued to distribute mexican films in the after january,the date on which the copyrights were automatically restored in those films that were eligible for copyright restoration under the uraa.
in june,the plaintiffs filed suit in the district court for the district of columbia,alleging that the defendants violated the plaintiffs restored copyrights in the films here at issue.the plaintiffs also alleged unfair competition by the defendants in violation of the lanham act,as well as several claims.the defendants filed a,and,a few months later,the case was transferred to the southern district of texas.
following discovery,the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment that they were the authors of the films under mexican law and thus held the copyrights that were restored under the uraa.defendants filed two for partial summary judgment,claiming that under mexican law,only natural persons,such as the individual contributors,and not artificial or juridical persons,such as film production companies,could be authors and seven of the films produced by plaintiffs were ineligible for copyright restoration under the uraa because these seven had fallen into the public domain in mexico.the defendants also filed a motion to dismiss the action and another for partial summary judgment.
the district court eventually denied all motions except one,granting the defendants second motion for partial summary judgment concerning the copyright status of the seven particular films that had fallen into the public domain in mexico.in denying the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment,the district court acknowledged that interpretation of mexican copyright law under is a question of law for determination by the court on this question,the district court ruled that film production companies can hold derecho de autor author right under the mexican civil code.the district court reserved for trial,though,the disputed issue whether the plaintiffs had in fact obtained mexican copyrights in the remaining films.
following these rulings,the parties engaged in extensive motion practice.the defendants filed,inter alia,another five motions for partial summary judgment,for a total of eight such motions.the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the denials of its motion for partial summary judgment and a motion to stay discovery.the district court denied all motions and set the case for trial.
in the ensuing jury trial,the district court permitted both sides to adduce testimony about the requirements of mexican copyright law and the district court instructed the jury that a film production company can be an author under mexican copyright law for purposes of the uraa.the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs,finding that the plaintiffs own the copyrights in the films remaining in dispute,the defendants violated the copyrights in all films,the defendants were guilty of unfair competition,and the defendants should pay the plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs.the jury awarded the plaintiffs copyright infringement damages of,unfair competition damages of,and attorneys fees and costs of.
the defendants filed several motions,requesting that the district court make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law,grant a judgment as a matter of law,grant a new trial,and render a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the district court denied all these motions and entered its amended final judgment,which ordered,in addition to the damages awarded at trial,declaratory and equitable relief in favor the plaintiffs.the defendants and the plaintiffs each timely filed notices of appeal.
analysisa.can film production companies hold copyrights under mexican law.standard of review.
we review questions regarding foreign law de novo.this analysis is plenary.
the author right under mexican law.
the uraa provides that a c opyright subsists in restored works,and vests automatically on the date of restoration.the copyright in a restored work vests initially in the author or initial rightholder of the work as determined by the law of the source country of the work.the uraa thus establishes two categories for foreign copyright owners whose copyrights can be restored authors,and initial rightholders.the class of initial rightholders includes only owners of a copyright in a sound recording,music composers whereas,the class of authors includes all other creators of works originally copyrighted in foreign jurisdictions.accordingly,the plaintiffs can claim restored copyrights in their films under the uraa only if the plaintiffs are considered authors under mexican copyright law of the source country of the work.
the defendants principal contention on appeal is that the plaintiffs,as film production companies,can not be authors under the mexican civil code.the defendants maintain that the mexican civil code permits only individuals,natural persons,to be authors that the law does not permit corporations or other legal entities to be authors for purposes of claiming copyright entitlements.in contending that only natural persons can hold copyrights under mexican law,the defendants argue that we should never reach the restoration analysis under the uraa,because the plaintiffs fail this threshold determination of qualification to hold copyrights under the law of the source country of the work.
in response,the the government of mexico,as amicus that the defendants failure even to mention the collaboration doctrine of the mexican civil code is telling.they note that in mexican law,the collaboration doctrine covers various provisions regarding copyrights claimed by corporations,which necessarily create copyrighted works only through the collaboration of individuals,their agents and employees.thus,article of the mexican civil code provides 
the person or corporation that imprints or publishes a work made by various individuals with the consent of such individuals will have the property in the entire work,except each individual will retain the right to publish anew their own composition,independently,or in a collection 
subsequent amendments and of mexico copyright laws in and specify that whoever creates a work with the collaboration of one or more other authors is entitled to the author right derecho de autor in the entire work,as long as the contributors are mentioned in the work and are paid for their respective contributions finally,the amendment of the mexican copyright laws provides explicitly that p hysical persons and legal entities who produce a work with the special and remunerated collaboration of one or more persons shall enjoy with respect to that work the author right therein 
the defendants devote a substantial portion of their briefs to discussing the role of collective bargaining agreements cba in mexico.the defendants appear to believe that the plaintiffs maintained before the district court and continue to maintain on appeal that they have copyrights in the films by virtue of having obtained assignments of the copyrights via the cbas of the natural persons who worked for the production companies.if the defendants harbor such a belief,they are mistaken.the cbas that the plaintiffs submitted into evidence were meant to prove only that the plaintiffs employees had been paid,thereby satisfying one of the requirements under the collaboration doctrine for the plaintiffs,as production companies,to claim copyrights in the films that they produced.
the defendants insistence that an author right under mexican law vests only in a natural person is simply wrong.as amicus,the government of mexico explains that throughout every iteration of its intellectual property laws,mexico has recognized the producer as the rightful owner of the copyright of any film in its entirety.provisions of the mexican civil code identified by the plaintiffs clearly support this position thus,the district court correctly determined that the plaintiffs can be and are authors under mexican law,and thus can hold mexican copyrights derecho de autor in the films that they have produced.
are the seven films excluded by the district court eligible for restoration of their copyrights under the uraa 
the defendants second motion for partial summary judgment requested that the district court eliminate consideration of seven of the plaintiffs original claims for copyright infringement,contending that the films had fallen into the public domain under mexican copyright law,thereby precluding restoration of their copyrights under the uraa the district court granted that motion,ruling that the seven films had fallen into the public domain in mexico and thus were ineligible for copyright restoration in the 
standard of review.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court a motion for summary judgment is properly granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact in reviewing all of the evidence,we must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe,and we should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmoving party the nonmoving party,however,can not satisfy his summary judgment burden with conclusional allegations,unsubstantiated assertions,or only a scintilla of evidence 
registration requirements of mexican copyright law.
following the threshold determination whether one who claims a restored copyright is an author under the source country law,the uraa predicates restoration of the work copyright on its meeting three requirements the work is not in the public domain in the source country,is in the public domain in the because of noncompliance with copyright formalities,lack of subject matter protection,or lack of national eligibility,and was first published in the source country and was not published in the within days after its initial foreign publication the district court determined that the seven films in question were not eligible for copyright restoration under the uraa because they had fallen into the public domain in the source.
these seven films were produced and released between and,and thus were governed by the copyright provisions of the mexican civil code.article of that code states 
the author who publishes a work can not acquire the rights granted to him by this title if he does not register the work within a period of three years.at the conclusion of this term,the work enters the public domain if not registered 
it is undisputed that the plaintiffs never registered their copyrights in the seven films here at issue.in,though,mexico amended its copyright laws to eliminate the registration requirement.article of the ley federal de derecho de autor states that 
copyright protection provided under this law to authors is conferred upon the simple creation of the work,without the necessity of deposit or registry previously required for its protection 
thus,for any works originally published in mexico after the effective date of the abolition of that country registration requirement january,authors received automatic copyright protection.
the amendment of the mexican copyright law also contained a safe harbor for any previously published works that had fallen into the public domain under the code prior to the new law effective date of january.authors who had failed to register their works within three years following their publication,as required under article of mexico code,thereby allowing such works to fall into the public domain,were given a period of repose following the aforesaid effective date of the revision during which to register their works and thereby restore their copyrights 
is the restoration provision of the amendment applicable to the seven films at issue 
it is undisputed that four of the seven films that the district court ruled to have fallen into the public domain were released by the plaintiffs less than three years before january,when the copyright provisions went into effect.on appeal,the plaintiffs urge us to reverse the summary judgment concerning these four films,contending that the law,not the code,is applicable.they direct us to that language of the copyright law stating that authors of works that had been previously published under the code,and had fallen into the public domain prior to january,were accorded a safe harbor during which to register these works and restore their copyrights.the plaintiffs also note that any work created after the law went into effect received automatic copyright protection,with no registration requirement.thus,urge the plaintiffs,a temporal hiatus results from the effective dates of these two provisions of mexico copyright law for works that were published after,but never registered works in this category had not yet lost their copyrights under the code when the law went into effect yet,the law did not provide for either an automatic copyright in,or a period of repose for registration of,works published during this short period.
based on this analysis of the copyright law,the plaintiffs first contend that the four films that they produced during this gap between and should be granted copyright protection under the terms of the copyright law.in so claiming,however,the plaintiffs are in essence asking us to rewrite article of mexico copyright law to apply retroactively its automatic copyright date three years earlier than is specified in the statute.this we decline to do.as the district court recognized in its summary judgment order,the automatic copyright provision expressly applies only to those works first published on or after january.each of the plaintiffs four films were produced and released either in or,and thus,by the plain words of the statute,do not qualify for the automatic copyright provision of the law.
the plaintiffs alternatively maintain that canons of mexican constitutional law support their interpretation of the automatic copyright provision as having retroactive effect,despite the statute express terms to the contrary.they say that canons of mexican constitutional law preclude retroactive application of statutes only when doing so would work to the detriment of a person legal rights retroactive application is actually sanctioned when it works in favor of both personal and property rights.the plaintiffs thus conclude that retroactive application of the automatic copyright provision to works created after would advance mexico strong policy interest in favoring the moral rights of an author over the public interest.
we are not convinced by the plaintiffs alternative request that we judicially rewrite the statute to provide for automatic copyright protection as early as,rather than the statute express effective date of january.in fact,there is no reason for us to consider the canons of mexican constitutional law in retroactive application of statutes because there is a completely reasonable explanation for the purported gap in the copyright law there was simply no need to provide a safe harbor for works that remained within the grace period for registration by or later than january,because authors of those works still had time remaining in which to register these works.the safe harbor was needed for works that had already fallen into the public domain it was only the authors of these works who were given an explicit second bite at the apple.works produced between january and january remained within the grace period specified under the code during which their authors could register them.thus,mexico copyright law implicitly recognized that authors of works created within this period still had time to register their works,as required under the terms of the code,and thus were not in need of a grace period or safe harbor.
simply put,the plaintiffs should have realized in that they needed to register their copyrights in these four films before the code grace period expired.it should have been obvious to them that,when the copyright provisions went into effect the following january,the new automatic copyright provisions would not apply to these four films.the plaintiffs do not dispute the fact that they never registered the four films in question neither is there evidence in the record indicating that they did so.by the plain terms of the applicable code,these films fell into the public domain in mexico.thus,they are ineligible for copyright restoration under the uraa.
are the registration requirements of the code applicable to all seven films 
the plaintiffs propose yet another theory for holding that all seven disputed films retained their copyright protection and thus did not fall into the public domain after the code grace period expired.they note that the code registration requirement applied only to works that were published.the plaintiffs quibble semantically that films are never published rather,they are released.thus,argue the plaintiffs,the literal terms of the code registration provision do not apply to films at all.
the plaintiffs identify no mexican canon of constitutional law or statutory interpretation that should guide our construction of the code registration requirement.neither do they identify any mexican court opinion or other authoritative mexican interpretation of the code registration requirement of films books or other published works.when there are gaps in foreign law,though,a court may use forum law to fill them 
in this regard,courts have broadly interpreted the copyright statutes to cover new types of works that clearly fall within the ambit of their protection,even though these new kinds of works are not covered literally by the terminology employed in the statutes at the time of their enactment furthermore,it would be anomalous for us to exempt films from the duties imposed on authors by the code while affording these same films the benefits provided to authors by the very same code.accordingly,we are satisfied that the term publishes,as broadly used in the code,was intended to encompass all appropriate forms of distributing copyrighted works to the public.as,in the,films could be distributed to the public only by being released to theaters,it would be nonsensical to construe the code registration requirement as not applicable to the very films that benefit from the copyright protections afforded by the other provisions of that code.we hold that the code registration requirements are applicable to films,necessarily including the seven disputed here.
do damage awards for both copyright infringement and unfair competition constitute a double recovery 
standard of review.
the defendants effort to obtain a remittitur order from the district court is grounded in their contention that the plaintiffs received a double recovery.we review a denial of remittitur for abuse of discretion and will only order a remittitur if we are left with the perception that the verdict is clearly excessive.
does recovery for both copyright infringement and a lanham act violation constitute a clearly excessive verdict 
following the jury verdict,the defendants filed a motion for remittitur in the district court,insisting that the jury award of damages for both copyright infringement and unfair competition constituted a double recovery.the defendants insist that the copyright act preempts claims for unfair competition.the district court denied this motion yet,on appeal,the defendants the same contention.given this preemption of unfair competition claims,they maintain,a plaintiff can not assert and recover on both.accordingly,argue the defendants,the district court should not have permitted the jury to award compensatory damages on both claims in this case the damages are duplicative and thus excessive,requiring remittitur.
in response,the plaintiffs rightly point out that the defendants confuse allegations of unfair competition under the lanham act with such allegations under state tort law.this confusion is revealed in the defendants reliance on those of our cases in which we have held that the copyright act preempts state claims for conversion,misappropriation,plagiarism,disparagement and defamation in this case,though,the plaintiffs lodged a federal claim for unfair competition under the lanham act 
the federal copyright act does not preempt the federal lanham act,or.in fact,it is common practice for copyright owners to sue for both infringement under the copyright act and unfair competition under the lanham act.such a litigation posture has never been disallowed by the courts on grounds of either preemption or impermissible double recovery we discern no basis in law or fact that supports the defendants contention that the district court abused its discretion in denying their request for remittitur.
trial errors asserted by the defendants.
the defendants on appeal allege a litany of trial errors yet,they offer no logically structured arguments in support of these assertions.the federal rules of appellate procedure require that an appellant brief set out in its argument section the appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.the purpose of the requirements in respect of briefs is to conserve the time and energy of the court and clearly to advise the opposite party of the points he is obliged to meet.beyond rote recitations of the standards of review and erroneous citations to case law the defendants do not provide us with any in their argument or by reference to the voluminous determining that the district court committed the proffered errors.t
