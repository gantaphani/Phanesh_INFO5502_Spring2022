background 
in,al jardine,mike love,brian wilson,carl wilson,and dennis wilson formed the beach boys.the band shortly thereafter achieved huge commercial success,producing numerous hit songs and touring to huge audiences throughout the country.in,the members of the beach boys incorporated bri to hold and administer the intellectual property rights for the beach boys.currently,bri is equally owned by four shareholders,who are also its directors al jardine,mike love,brian wilson,and the estate of carl wilson.bri is the registered owner of the beach boys trademark.
over the years,personal difficulties arose between some of the members,and some members of the band decided to not tour full time,or at all.in,the members of the beach boys incorporated brother tours,which handled their touring and distributed their touring income.in,the directors of bri agreed to devote a certain percentage of the touring income to the corporation for use of the trademark and designated a larger percentage of the income to those members who actually toured.by,carl wilson had died,love and jardine no longer wanted to tour together,and brian wilson did not want to tour at all.love began negotiating with bri the terms of a license to use the beach boys trademark in connection with his own band.
bri directors met on july,to discuss how the trademark should be used.the representative of carl wilson estate suggested that bri issue licenses to each shareholder on the same terms and conditions as the license that was being negotiated with love,thus giving each member an equal right to tour.three of the four board members,including jardine,voted to grant each beach boy a license.on october,bri executed a license agreement with love the love license.the love license contained clauses designed to protect the value of the trademark,requiring the licensee to preserve the beach boys style and to choose from a list of approved booking agencies and managers.
the parties dispute whether bri and jardine entered into a license agreement.after the july bri board meeting,jardine began touring with his own band,using a booking agent and manager that were not included in the list approved by the love license.on october,jardine attorney sent bri a letter saying that jardine would be performing as beach boys family and friends,and that therefore,a license from bri was unnecessary.on october,bri told jardine that his unlicensed use of the trademark would be an infringement.
jardine then proposed a license that included terms different from those included in the love license.jardine proposal contemplated only a royalty to bri on the first million of gross receipts and a percent royalty thereafter.bri proposed a percent royalty across the board.love license required a royalty of percent of the first million and percent of receipts thereafter.also,jardine wanted to use a booking agent and manager that were not on the approved list.jardine stated that,whether or not bri accepted the proposal,he would continue performing as the beach boys family and friends.
the bri board scheduled another meeting for november,to discuss jardine proposal.before the meeting,jardine attorney sent a letter to the board with a proposed license agreement signed by jardine.at the meeting,the bri board voted to reject jardine proposal.in the months following the meeting,jardine both attempted to negotiate an agreement and claimed he had a license.
jardine and his band continued to perform using names that included the beach boys trademark.the performances were promoted under names such as al jardine of the beach boys and family friends the beach boys family and friends beach boys family friends the beach boys,family friends beach boys and family as well as,simply,the beach boys.jardine and his band performed in locations and on dates close to love the beach boys shows.with two bands touring as the beach boys or as a combination,show organizers sometimes were confused about what exactly they were getting when they booked jardine band.a number of show organizers booked jardine band thinking they would get the beach boys along with special added guests,but subsequently canceled the booking when they discovered that jardine band was not what they thought it was.numerous people who attended one of jardine shows said that they had been confused about who was performing.during this time period,bri sent jardine cease and desist letters objecting to jardine use of the trademark.
on april,bri filed its complaint in the district court alleging that jardine was infringing its trademark.jardine answered,asserting the defenses of fair use,laches,estoppel,and unclean hands,and counterclaimed for breach of employment agreement,breach of license agreement,and for a declaratory judgment that jardine could tour as the beach boys family and friends.on march,the district court issued the preliminary injunction prohibiting jardine from using the beach boys,the beach boys family and friends,and other similar combinations,but still allowing jardine to refer to his past membership in the band in a descriptive fashion.
on march,two weeks before the close of discovery,jardine moved for leave to amend his pleading to add claims against the shareholders and directors of bri and an additional counterclaim against bri for breach of fiduciary duty.the district court denied the motion.on june,bri moved for summary judgment on its trademark infringement claim and jardine counterclaims.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of bri and issued a permanent injunction against jardine use of the trademark.this timely appeal followed.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see entrepreneur media,smith,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact that remain for trial and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.at.because of the intensely factual nature of trademark disputes,summary judgment is generally disfavored in the trademark arena.id.quoting interstellar starship,epix,cir.therefore,a district court may grant summary judgment and we may uphold a grant of summary judgment only if no genuine issue exists regarding likelihood of confusion.thane int l,trek bicycle,cir.
discussion 
trademark infringement 
jardine contends that his use of bri trademark is protected by either the classic fair use doctrine or the nominative fair use doctrine.in new kids on the block news am.publ g,cir,we noted that the classic fair use defense could not be applied in that case because this is not the classic fair use case where the defendant has used the plaintiff mark to describe the defendant own product.id.at.we then held that,where the defendant uses a trademark to describe the plaintiff product,rather than its own a commercial user is entitled to a nominative fair use defense.id.in cairns franklin mint,cir,we reiterated the distinction between the classic fair use and nominative fair use doctrines.
the nominative fair use analysis is appropriate where a defendant has used the plaintiff mark to describe the plaintiff product,even if the defendant ultimate goal is to describe his own product.conversely,the classic fair use analysis is appropriate where a defendant has used the plaintiff mark only to describe his own product,and not at all to describe the plaintiff product.
to illustrate this distinction,we cited a number of cases that applied the nominative fair use analysis.see id.for example,in new kids,the defendant newspapers used the new kids trademark to refer to the music band new kids itself in order to describe the defendants own telephone polls about the band.new kids,at.see cairns,at.in volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft church,cir,the defendant car repair shop used the plaintiff trademarked name volkswagen in a sign that said modern volkswagen porsche service.id.at.in smith chanel,cir,a seller of imitation perfumes advertised its chance perfume as indistinguishable from the trademarked chanel perfume.id.in boston athletic ass n,cir,a television station referred to and made broadcasts of the trademarked boston marathon.id.at.in all these cases,the defendant used the plaintiff trademark to refer to the plaintiff product,and therefore the nominative fair use analysis applied.
following new kids,we have applied the nominative fair use defense in a number of cases.in most of these cases,the nominative fair use defense,as opposed to the classic fair use defense,clearly applied because the defendant used the plaintiff mark undeniably to refer to the plaintiff product,even though the defendant ultimate goal was to describe his own product.in motors,cir,the defendant automobile manufacturer referred to plaintiff,a basketball star who had won an award three years in a row,in a commercial for a car that also had won an award three years in a row.id.at.in downing abercrombie fitch,cir,the defendant clothing company used the trademarked names and photograph of plaintiffs,surfing champions,to market shirts copied from those worn by plaintiffs in the photograph.id.at.these were not cases in which the defendant used the plaintiff mark only to describe the defendant own product,and not at all to describe the plaintiff product.see cairns,at explaining when classic fair use analysis applies.rather,these were cases in which the defendant used the plaintiff mark to describe the plaintiff himself and the surfing champions though the ultimate goal was to describe the defendant own product.see id.explaining when nominative fair use analysis applies.
we also have applied the nominative fair use analysis where the plaintiff trademark was also the defendant title.in playboy enterprises,welles,cir,plaintiff playboy sued the defendant,who was playboy playmate of the year in,for her use of that trademarked title on her own website,which offered information about her and free photographs of her,advertised photographs for sale and membership in her photo club,and promoted her services as a spokesperson.id.at.we explained in cairns that the classic fair use analysis did not apply in playboy because welles had not used the playboy mark only to describe her own product,and not at all to describe the plaintiff product.cairns,at.although welles arguably also used the mark to describe herself in the first she herself was indeed playboy playmate of the year in fact that welles used playboy mark to describe playboy product at all precluded the application of the classic fair use analysis.see id.
here,jardine argues that either the classic fair use or the nominative fair use defense applies.as in playboy,whether the defendant use of the mark refers to the plaintiff product at thus whether classic fair use analysis or nominative fair use analysis not clear.jardine illustrates this point with his conflicting arguments that his use of the beach boys mark describes the beach boys product,thus requiring application of the nominative fair use analysis,and that,in the alternative,his use of the beach boys mark describes only founding member of the beach not at all to describe the beach boys product,thus requiring application of the classic fair use analysis.where the defendant uses his or her own title,which happens also to be plaintiff trademark,defendant can argue convincingly both that the use refers to defendant and that the use refers not at all to defendant.in these situations,the distinction often proves more frustrating than helpful.
rather than contorting ourselves into finding either that jardine used the beach boys mark to describe the beach boys or that jardine used the beach boys mark only to describe himself and not at all to describe the beach boys,we analyze each defense separately.we note first that the classic fair use defense,codified in the lanham act,b,applies only to marks that possess both a primary meaning and a secondary only when the mark is used in its primary descriptive sense rather than its secondary trademark sense see cairns,at under the common law classic fair use defense a junior user is always entitled to use a descriptive term in good faith in its primary,descriptive sense other than as a trademark.quoting thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademark and unfair competition ed accord park n fly,at.the lanham act,under certain circumstances,permits the nontrademark use of descriptive terms contained in an incontestable mark.johnson son,cir zatarain,oak grove smokehouse,cir ideal,gardner bender,cir.section b allows the defense to trademark infringement that 
the use of the name,term or device charged to be an infringement is a use,otherwise than as a mark of a term or device which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such party,or their geographic origin.
we have explained that the primary cost of recognizing property rights in trademarks is the removal of words from our language.new kids,at.we therefore recognized that the classic fair use defense in essence,forbids a trademark registrant to appropriate a descriptive term for his exclusive use and so prevent others from accurately describing a characteristic of their goods.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.if the trademark holder were allowed exclusive rights in such use,the language would be depleted in much the same way as if generic words were protectable.id.see restatement third of unfair competition cmt.a trademark rights extend only to the source significance that has been acquired by such terms,not to their original descriptive meanings.
we consistently have applied the classic fair use analysis to infringement cases involving descriptive marks used in their primary,descriptive sense.in cairns,we cited in re video cassette recorder antitrust,cir,as a good example of classic fair use.cairns,at.in that case,the defendant sold receivers to which two videocassette recorders could be attached and labeled the relevant terminals on the backs of its machines and,at.we concluded that defendant use of plaintiff trademark,a descriptive mark that identified plaintiff videocassette recorder,was descriptive of defendant own product.id.at.because defendant used plaintiff mark in its primary,descriptive sense and in good faith,defendant use was not an infringement.id.
likewise,in entrepreneur media,smith,cir,we recognized that trademark protection extends only to the secondary,trademark meaning of a descriptive mark,and not to the primary descriptive meaning of the terms.see id.at.in that case,we concluded that plaintiff trademark entrepreneur was a descriptive mark that directly identified plaintiff printed publications.id.we emphasized that,although the plaintiff trademark holder had the exclusive right to use its trademark in printed publications pertaining to business opportunities,the plaintiff can not have the exclusive right to use the word entrepreneur in any mark identifying a printed publication addressing subjects related to entrepreneurship.id.at emphasis in the original 
we similarly have allowed classic fair use of a suggestive mark,which carries both an unprotectable primary meaning and a protected secondary meaning.see brookfield communications,at accord,at explaining that the b classic fair use defense can apply to a mark regardless of its classification as descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful,so long as the mark carried a descriptive primary meaning and a trademarked secondary meaning.in brookfield communications,we concluded that defendant legitimately could use the term movie buff in its metatags to denote the term primary descriptive meaning of motion picture enthusiast.we emphasized,however,that defendant could not use the plaintiff su
