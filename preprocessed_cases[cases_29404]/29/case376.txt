we confront a claim that california son of sam law facially violates constitutional protections of speech by appropriating,as compensation for crime victims,all monies due to a convicted felon from expressive materials that include the story of the crime.we conclude that these provisions of the california statute are facially invalid under both the free speech clause of the first amendment to the federal constitution as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment,and the liberty of speech clause of the california constitution art.i,subd.a 
the california law was first enacted in as civil code section stats,ch.in,the law was renumbered as section stats,ch,and it has since been amended on several occasions see stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch.as currently in effect,the law seeks to prevent a convicted felon,or a profiteer,from exploiting the felon crimes for financial gain while victims of crime go uncompensated.
one prong of the california statute,in effect since the law inception,imposes an involuntary trust,in favor of damaged and uncompensated crime victims as beneficiar ies,on a convicted felon proceeds from expressive materials books,films,magazine and newspaper articles,video and sound recordings,radio and television appearances,and live presentations that include or are based on the story of a felony for which the felon was convicted,except where the materials mention the felony only in passing,as in a footnote or bibliography,subds.a,b see former,subds.a,b,stats,ch.for convenience,we sometimes hereafter refer to this portion of the statute,governing proceeds from expressive materials that include the story of the crime,by its operative provision,section,subdivision b section b.
more recent amendments to the california statute attack the financial exploitation of crime from a second,distinctly different angle.since,the law involuntary trust provisions have also applied to profits received by the felon,or his or her representative,from the sale or transfer of any thing or right,the value of which is enhanced by the notoriety gained from the commission of a felony for which a convicted felon was convicted,subd.a,italics added see also,subd.b.in,the involuntary trust provisions were further extended,with limited exceptions,to profiteer s of the felony,any person s who derive income by selling memorabilia,property,rights,or things for values enhanced by their notoriety,subds.a b,b.as necessary,we sometimes hereafter refer to this prong of the statute,governing profits from things sold for their notoriety value,by its operative provision,section,subdivision b section b 
in,the united states supreme court held that a somewhat similar new york law violated the first amendment.simon schuster,members of state crime victims bd,d simon schuster.in provisions somewhat like california section b,the statute at issue confiscated,for the benefit of crime victims,all monies a criminal was due under contract with respect to a reenactment of the crime,or from the expression of his or her personal thoughts or feelings about the crime,in a film,broadcast,print,recording,or live performance format.
finding the new york law facially invalid,the simon schuster majority reasoned that the statute,as a direct regulation of speech based on content,must fall unless it satisfied a strict level of constitutional scrutiny.the new york law failed this test,said the majority,because although the state had a compelling interest in compensating crime victims from the fruits of crime,the statute at issue was not narrowly tailored to that purpose.simon schuster,supra,d.
the flaw most clearly identified by the simon schuster majority was that the new york statute was overinclusive.the majority noted two respects in which the new york law regulated speech too broadly for its compelling purpose.first,the law applied to expressive works in which one merely admitted crimes for which he or she had not been convicted.second,it confiscated all profits from expressive works in which one made even incidental or tangential mention of his or her past crimes for nonexploitative purposes.simon schuster,supra,d.
california analogous provision,section b,similarly imposes a financial penalty on protected speech.yet section b,like its new york counterpart,fails to satisfy strict scrutiny because it,too,is overinclusive.section b contains the fundamental defect identified in simon schuster it reaches beyond a criminal profits from the crime or its exploitation to reach all income from the criminal speech or expression on any theme or subject,if the story of the crime is included.
though section b,unlike the new york law,applies only to persons actually convicted of felonies,and states an exemption for mere passing mention of the felony,as in a footnote or bibliography,subd.a,these differences do not cure the california statute constitutional flaw.by any reasonable construction,the california statute is still calculated to confiscate all income from a wide range of protected expressive works by convicted felons,on a wide variety of subjects and themes,simply because those works include substantial accounts of the prior felonies.
because we conclude,contrary to the court of appeal,that section b is invalid,we will reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
on july,frank sinatra,sinatra,son of the late singer,filed a complaint in los angeles superior court.named as defendants were barry keenan,joseph amsler,john irwin,peter gilstrap,columbia pictures a division of sony pictures entertainment,and new times,new times.
as pertinent here,the complaint alleged as follows in,keenan and amsler,acting pursuant to a conspiracy with irwin,kidnapped sinatra,from his nevada hotel room and drove him to los angeles,where he was held until his father paid a ransom.during his captivity,sinatra,suffered economic loss,physical suffering,and emotional distress.keenan,amsler,and irwin were later apprehended,tried,convicted of felony offenses,and incarcerated under california law following their arrests,the kidnappers made media statements,since admitted to be false,that sinatra,had conspired in his own kidnapping to extract money from his father.these defamatory statements caused further damage to sinatra,business and reputation.
the complaint further alleged in january,keenan and one or both accomplices arranged with gilstrap,or with new times publisher of new times los angeles,a tabloid magazine,for gilstrap to interview keenan about the kidnapping.the purpose was to produce a story for sale to print,broadcast,and film media.monies derived from exploiting the kidnapping story would be split among gilstrap,new times,and the kidnappers.an article entitled snatching sinatra,authored by gilstrap,appeared in a january issue of new times los angeles.in late january and thereafter,other magazines reported that columbia pictures had bought the motion picture rights to snatching sinatra for up to million.in february,citing section,sinatra,made demand on columbia pictures to withhold from the kidnappers,and from gilstrap and new times as the kidnappers representatives,any monies otherwise due such persons or entities for the motion picture rights.columbia pictures refused to do so without a court order.
the complaint asserted that under section,all monies due to the kidnappers,or to their representatives gilstrap and new times,for preparation for sale of the story of sinatra,kidnapping,the sale of the rights to the story,or the sale of materials that included or were based on the story,were proceeds as defined by subdivision a and profits as defined by subdivision a,and were thus subject to an involuntary trust in favor of sinatra,a statutory beneficiary,subd.a a.the complaint sought an order that the defendants,particularly columbia pictures and new times,hold such present and future proceeds and profits in trust for sinatra.it also sought an injunction to prevent columbia pictures and new times from paying such proceeds and profits to any other defendant,and require that all such payments be made instead to sinatra,to the extent of his damages or,in the alternative,to the superior court for distribution for the benefit of the victims of the kidnapping.
on august,after a hearing at which only sinatra,columbia pictures,and new times appeared,the trial court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting columbia pictures,during the pendency of the action,from paying any monies to keenan,amsler,irwin,or their representatives or assigns in connection with the motion picture rights to the story of sinatra,kidnapping 
on november,keenan first appeared in the action by filing,on his own behalf only,a demurrer to the complaint.at the same time,keenan moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction.the demurrer asserted,among other things,that section was facially invalid under the speech clauses of the federal and state constitutions.keenan constitutional attack was based solely on a comparison between section and the new york law struck down in simon schuster,supra,d.
in this regard,keenan noted that because the california statute,like its new york counterpart,targeted a criminal income from telling the story of his crime,it penalized the content of speech,required strict scrutiny,and was not narrowly tailored to compensate crime victims from the profits of crime.keenan urged that,by the standards set forth in simon schuster,supra,d,the california statute was both underinclusive,because it reached only expressive activity,not other sources of income,and overinclusive,because it penalized all expressive works by convicted felons which included more than passing mention of their crimes.
in response,sinatra,asserted that the simon schuster majority had only found new york law overinclusive.sinatra,argued that section solves the overinclusiveness problem identified in simon schuster by covering only convicted felons and exempting expressive materials that contain only a passing mention of the felony.moreover,he contended,section is not underinclusive because it is precisely drawn to ensure that victims of crime are compensated before the felon profits from telling the story of their victimization.
on december,the trial court issued an order overruling keenan demurrer for the reasons stated in sinatra,opposition papers.in the same order,the court denied keenan motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction,reiterating its findings,made when the injunction was granted,that section is not unconstitutional as written and was narrowly drafted to overcome the effects found by the supreme court in simon schuster.
on december,keenan filed in the court of appeal the instant petition for mandate or other appropriate relief.the petition requested a writ directing the superior court to vacate its orders overruling his demurrer and granting the preliminary injunction,to enter a new order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend,and to dissolve the preliminary injunction.on january,the court of appeal stayed proceedings in the trial court,ordered the parties to appear for oral argument on the merits of the petition,and called for the filing of a return and reply 
the parties briefs in the court of appeal,like those in the trial court,focused entirely on comparisons between california son of sam law and the new york counterpart addressed in simon schuster.again keenan claimed the california statute singled out expressive activity for regulation on the basis of content,required strict scrutiny,and was both overinclusive and underinclusive by the standards set in that case.again sinatra,urged that section solved the overinclusiveness problem identified in simon schuster because,unlike the new york statute,california law applied only to convicted felons and exempted expressive materials which made mere passing mention of the felony.
the court of appeal denied writ relief,concluding,among other things,that section does not infringe constitutional rights of speech.in this regard,the court of appeal accepted sinatra,arguments that section lacks the defects of overbreadth identified in simon schuster,because it is limited to convicted felons and does not confiscate a felon proceeds from expressive materials that contain mere passing mention of the felony.
the court of appeal declined to decide whether the california statute was impermissibly underinclusive.the court reasoned it need not do so because,contrary to keenan insistence,simon schuster had not expressly found the new york statute underinclusive.because keenan does not otherwise elaborate on the issue of underinclusiveness,said the court,a nd since his attack on section is limited to those issues considered in simon schuster,our discussion of the statute is similarly limited.we granted review we now reverse.
discussion 
in the late,new york was terrorized by serial killer david berkowitz,popularly known as the son of sam.by the time berkowitz was apprehended,publicity about the case had enhanced the value of the rights to his story.new york legislature sought to prevent berkowitz and other notorious criminals from exploiting for profit the tales of their sensational crimes while their victims went uncompensated.the resulting statute,discussed in greater detail below,was dubbed the son of sam law.simon schuster,supra,d.in,the united states and over states,including california,had some form of son of sam law.see kealy,a proposal for a new massachusetts law the grandson of sam new eng,comment,son of sam laws killing free speech or promoting killer profits whittier,fns.
california version,as pertinent here,provides that all past and future proceeds,subds.a,b paid or owing to a convicted felon,subds.a,b from the sale of expressive materials or the rights thereto,subds.a,b are subject to an involuntary trust for designated beneficiaries b if the materials include or are based on the story of the felony ibid.a convicted felon is one convicted,or found not guilty by reason of insanity,subd.a of a felony,as defined by any california or united states statute,subd.a,which was committed in california,subd.a.story means a depiction,portrayal,or reenactment of a felony but shall not be taken to mean a passing mention of the felony,as in a footnote or bibliography,subd.a.a beneficiary is one who has a legal claim against the convicted felon,including a survivorship or wrongful death claim,for physical,mental,or emotional injury,or pecuniary loss,caused by the felony,subd.a.
the trust continues for five years from the conviction,or from the payment of any covered proceeds to the felon,whichever is later.b.the felon unpaid obligations for restitution,restitution and penalty fines,and attorney fees have first priority against the trust,subd.d.within the trust period,beneficiaries may bring actions to recover their respective interests in the remaining funds,subd.c,and the filing of such an action extends the trust period until such actions are concluded,subd.b.each beneficiary interest is an equitable share,given the funds available,of his or her recoverable damages from the crime,less any compensation already received from the felon or from the restitution fund,subds.a,d.payment to the beneficiary may be ordered from proceeds already received by the felon and,as necessary,from proceeds to be received in the future,subd.c.
within one year after the conviction or the felon receipt of covered proceeds,whichever is later,subd.e,the attorney general may also bring an action to impose an express trust on covered proceeds,thus requiring their placement in a bank depositary,subd.e see also,subd.e,if he proves it is more probable than not that there are beneficiaries entitled to compensation for the felony,subd.e.either a beneficiary or the attorney general may,in appropriate circumstances,obtain a preliminary injunction to prevent waste of proceeds subject to the involuntary trust,subd.f.
funds subject to the trust,but not claimed by a beneficiary at the end of the trust period,do not revert to the felon ownership.instead,they must be transferred to the controller for allocation to the restitution fund.b see also,subd.e.
as indicated above,the united states supreme court struck down a similar new york law in simon schuster,supra,d.we conclude the analysis of simon schuster governs this case and renders section b invalid as well.both the new york and california laws impose financial penalties on protected speech.thus they must,at a minimum,satisfy strict constitutional scrutiny.both laws seek to serve compelling interests in preventing criminals from exploiting their crimes for profit,and in compensating crime victims from the profits of crime.yet both laws are overinclusive for those purposes,because they confiscate all income from all expressive materials,whatever their general themes or subjects,that include significant discussions of their creators past crimes.
our reasoning requires,of course,a detailed examination of simon schuster.the new york statute there at issue provided that if any person accused or convicted of a crime in this state was due money under contract with respect to a reenactment of the crime by way of a movie,book,magazine article,tape recording,phonograph record,radio or television presentation,or live entertainment of any kind,or for expressions of the person thoughts or feelings about the crime,the contract must be reported to the new york state crime victims board new york board,and the money due must be paid over to the new york board to be placed in an escrow account,primarily for the benefit of victims who,within five years thereafter,won money judgments against the criminal.simon schuster,supra,d see exec.law,mckinney supp.the statute defined convicted persons to include those who had voluntarily and intelligently admitted crimes for which they were not prosecuted.simon schuster,supra,at,italics omitted exec.law b.
while the law was in effect,simon schuster,contracted to finance and publish a book by henry hill,a former gangster turned government witness.the book would tell the story of hill organized crime career.after considerable investment of time and effort by hill and his coauthor,the book,wiseguy,was published in.its colorful account of hill many criminal exploits,and of life inside the mafia,met with commercial and critical success.
when the new york board learned of wiseguy publication,it invoked the son of sam law.after reviewing the book,and simon schuster contract with hill,the new york board determined that all monies paid or owed to hill under the contract were subject to the statute escrow provisions.simon schuster was ordered to pay the new york board all future sums due to hill,and hill was ordered to pay the new york board all sums already remitted to him.simon schuster filed a federal suit,seeking a declaration,under united states code section,that the new york law was facially invalid under the first amendment.the federal district court granted the new york board motion for summary judgment,and a divided court of appeals affirmed.simon schuster,supra,d.
the united states supreme court unanimously concluded that the judgment of the court of appeals must be reversed six justices,in an opinion authored by justice,first noted that a statute is presumptively inconsistent with the first amendment if it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of the content of their speech.leathers medlock,d in the context of financial regulation,it bears repeating,as we did in leathers,that the government ability to impose burdens on speech raises the specter that the government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.at.the first amendment presumptively places this sort of discrimination beyond the power of the government.simon schuster,supra,d.
new york son of sam law was a presumptively invalid burden on speech,said the majority,because i t singles out income derived from expressive activity for a burden the state places on no other income,is directed only at works with a specified content,and plainly imposes a financial disincentive only on speech of a particular content.simon schuster,supra,d.because the statute penalized speech on the basis of its content,the majority concluded,the law must survive strict constitutional scrutiny,the state must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.citation,at.
the majority emphasized that the state had no compelling interest in shielding readers and victims from negative emotional responses to a criminal public retelling of his misdeeds.indeed,the majority observed,the protection of offensive and disagreeable ideas is at the core of the first amendment.simon schuster,supra,d.on the other hand,the majority agreed,states do have compelling interests in ensuring that victims of crime are compensated by those who harm them ibid,preventing wrongdoers from dissipating their assets before victims can recover ibid,ensuring that criminals do not profit from their crimes,at,and transferring the fruits of crime from the criminals to their victims,at.moreover,the majority concluded it could assume without deciding that royalties from a criminal book about his crimes,the form of income at issue in the case before it,represent the fruits of crime,at.
of course,the majority observed,new york could not defend its statute by narrowly defining the interest at stake in terms of the actual operation of its law.new york claimed a compelling interest in preventing criminals from retaining the profits of storytelling about their crimes before their victims were compensated.however,the majority noted,the state could not show why it had a greater interest in compensating crime victims from the profits of such storytelling than from the criminal other assets.nor could the state justif y a distinction between this expressive activity and any other activity in connection with its interest in transferring the fruits of crime from criminals to their victims.simon schuster,d.in short,the majority concluded,the state has a compelling interest in compensating victims from the fruits of the crime,but little if any interest in limiting such compensation to the proceeds of the wrongdoer speech about the crime,at.
accordingly,the majority reasoned,it must examine whether new york statute was narrowly tailored to advance the former,not the latter,objective.simon schuster,supra,d.the new york statute was not so tailored,the majority determined,for a s a means of ensuring that victims are compensated from the proceeds of crime,the son of sam law is significantly overinclusive,italics added.in the majority view,two factors in particular illustrated the statute overbreadth.first,the statute applies to works on any subject,provided that they express the author thoughts or recollections about his crime,however tangentially or incidentally.citation,italics in original.second,the statute broad definition of person convicted of a crime enables the board to escrow the income of any author who admits in his work to having committed a crime,whether or not the author was ever actually accused or convicted.citation.ibid.
these two provisions,said the majority,combine to encompass a potentially very large number of works.had the son of sam law been in effect at the time and place of publication,it would have escrowed payment for such works as the autobiography of malcolm x,which describes crimes committed by the civil rights leader before he became a public figure civil disobedience,in which thoreau acknowledges his refusal to pay taxes and recalls his experience in jail and even the confessions of saint augustine,in which the author laments my past foulness and the carnal corruptions of my soul,one instance of which involved the theft of pears from a neighboring orchard.citations.amicus association of american publishers,has submitted a sobering bibliography listing hundreds of works by american prisoners and,many of which contain descriptions of the crimes for which the authors were incarcerated,including works by such authors as emma goldman and martin luther king.a list of prominent figures whose autobiographies would be subject to the statute if written is not difficult to construct the list could include sir walter raleigh,who was convicted of treason after a dubiously conducted trial jesse jackson,who was arrested in for trespass and resisting arrest after attempting to be served at a lunch counter in north carolina and bertrand russell,who was jailed for seven days at the age of for participating in a protest against nuclear weapons.the argument that a statute like the son of sam law would prevent publication of all of these works is would have been written without the son of sam law clearly reaches a wide range of literature that does not enable a criminal to profit from his crime while a victim remains uncompensated.simon schuster,supra,d,fn.omitted,italics in original.
in sum,said the majority,new york son of sam law has singled out speech on a particular subject for a financial burden that it places on no other speech and no other income.the state interest in compensating victims from the fruits of crime is a compelling one,but the son of sam law is not narrowly tailored to advance that objective.as a result,the statute is inconsistent with the first amendment.simon schuster,supra,d.
in separate opinions,justices blackmun and kennedy concurred in the judgment.justice blackmun opined that the new york law was underinclusive as well as overinclusive,and we should say so.simon schuster,supra,d conc.opn.of blackmun.justice kennedy suggested that a statute is unconstitutional per se if it regulates the specific content of speech which is neither defamatory,nor tantamount to a criminal act,nor an impairment of some other constitutional right,nor an incitement to lawless action,nor calculated to bring about an imminent harm the state has the substantive power to prevent.a statute that regulates the content of speech beyond these narrow limits,said justice kennedy,can not be saved by finding that it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest,at.conc.opn.of kennedy.
in his efforts to distinguish section b,sinatra,first makes a cursory argument that california statute,unlike new york,is not a presumptively invalid regulation of speech.the effort must fail.section b,like the new york statute at issue in simon schuster,places a direct financial disincentive on speech or expression about a particular subject.the california statute explicitly targets and confiscates a convicted felon proceeds from books,films,articles,recordings,broadcasts,interviews,or performances that include the story of the felon crime.while certain classes of,fighting words,some be subject to regulation because of their directly injurious nature see,paul,d chaplinsky new hampshire,discussions of crime have never been included in this limited category 
sinatra,asserts that laws imposing financial penalties on speech do not necessarily violate the first amendment.he cites cases for the principle that the government need not subsidize the exercise of free speech or other constitutional rights,lyng automobile workers,d denial of food stamps to household with striking worker regan taxation with representation of,d denial of tax exemption to organizations engaged in lobbying harris mcrae,d denial of federal funds to reimburse abortions.but he fails to show how section b,by confiscating income from speech based on its content,departs from the presumptively unconstitutional form of statute at issue in simon schuster.
nor does it matter that new york law focused on media entities contracts for crime stories,while section b targets crime story proceeds in the hands of the criminal himself.as simon schuster noted with respect to the facts in that case whether the first amendment speaker is considered to be henry hill,whose income the statute places in escrow because of the story he has told,or simon schuster,which can publish books about crime with the assistance of only those criminals willing to forgo remuneration for at least five years,the statute plainly imposes a financial disincentive only on speech of a particular content.simon schuster,supra,d.the government power to impose financial disincentives on speech surely does not vary with the identity of the speaker simon schuster,supra,at,and section b,like the new york statute,establishes a financial disincentive to create or publish works with a particular content simon schuster,supra,at,italics added 
section b is thus a suspect regulation of speech.as such,the section is unconstitutional unless,at a minimum,it is narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.simon schuster,supra,d sable communications of,fcc,d.in applying this standard,we must first determine what,if any,such compelling interests section b seeks to serve.
by its terms,section b confiscates,for the benefit of uncompensated victims of crime,sums due or owing to a convicted felon from expressive materials that include the story of the felony.it thus appears the purpose of section b is to assure that the fruits of one this case,proceeds from exploiting the story of those be used to compensate crime victims.
statements of legislative intent confirm this inference.when the predecessor of section b was adopted in,the legislature declared,as justification for the law,that v ictims of felonies have a special relationship to proceeds from the sale of stories about those felonies which are written by persons convicted of committing them.stats,ch.it further recited that the new law amplifies and supplements civil code sections making one an involuntary trustee,for the benefit of the true owner,of any thing gained by fraud,accident,mistake,undue influence,violation of trust,or other wrongful act and confirming the duty to compensate for injury or damage caused by one legal wrong.in connection with more recent amendments to section,the legislature asserted,in a paraphrase from simon schuster,that t he state has a compelling interest in ensuring that convicted felons do not profit from their crimes and that the victims of crime are compensated by those who harm them.stats,ch,subd.b.
though there is no compelling interest in targeting a criminal storytelling proceeds in particular for the purpose of compensating crime victims simon schuster,supra,d,the state does have a compelling interest in using the fruits of crime generally for that purpose,at.we may assume,in this regard,that the fruits of crime include a criminal proceeds from exploiting the story of the crime,at.the question thus arises whether section b,within its sphere of operation,is narrowly tailored to ensure that the fruits of crime are used to compensate the victims of crime.
of course,to be narrowly tailored does not require that there be no conceivable alternative,but only that the regulation not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests citation.board of trustees,state of fox,d.we examine whether section b meets this test 
keenan urges that section b is underinclusive,because it confiscates profits from expressive activity,storytelling about one crimes,while leaving undisturbed other gains and profits the criminal might realize from the crimes or their exploitation.portions of the majority discussion in simon schuster,supra,d,imply such a flaw in the new york statute there at issue.at several points,the majority stressed that the statute singled out a criminal profits from expressive activity to the exclusion of all other profits,and suggested that the state could demonstrate no compelling interest in such a distinction when fashioning a law to compensate crime victims from the fruits of crime,at.justice blackmun suggested this was tantamount to a conclusion that the new york statute was underinclusive,at.conc.opn.of blackmun.
however,having determined that the new york law was overinclusive,the high court expressly stated it need not decide whether the law was underinclusive as well.simon schuster,supra,fn,d.noting that keenan attack on the california statute was focused primarily on simon schuster,the instant court of appeal similarly refused to address the issue of underinclusiveness.because we hereafter conclude that california law,like new york,is overinclusive in any event,we pursue a similar course.
indeed,any conclusion that the new york statute was underinclusive might not apply to california law.as noted above,the california statute,unlike new york,does confiscate at least one additional category of a criminal profits,those derived from sales of memorabilia,property,things,or rights for a value enhanced by their notoriety value.b.in the posture of this case,and lacking further development of the issue by the parties in their briefs,we need not and do not decide whether the california statute,which includes but reaches beyond profits,is underinclusive.
we are persuaded,however,that section b,like the new york law at issue in simon schuster,is overinclusive and therefore invalid.as did the new york statute,section b penalizes the content of speech to an extent far beyond that necessary to transfer the fruits of crime from criminals to their uncompensated victims.even if the fruits of crime may include royalties from exploiting the story of one crimes,section b does not confine itself to such income.instead,it confiscates all a convicted felon proceeds from speech or expression on any theme or subject which includes the story of the felony,except by mere passing mention.by this financial disincentive,section b,like its new york counterpart,discourages the creation and dissemination of a wide range of ideas and expressive works which have little or no relationship to the exploitation of one criminal misdeeds.
in at least one respect,the involuntary trust provision of section b operates more harshly against expressive materials that depict the creator past crimes than did the escrow account provided for by the new york law at issue in simon schuster.under the new york statute,proceeds from a crime story contract were to be turned over to the new york board for placement in escrow,but if,at the end of five years,no valid claims of the criminal victims or creditors were pending,remaining funds in the account were returned to the criminal.simon schuster,supra,d see exec.law a.under section b,by contrast,any entrusted amounts not subject to legitimate individual claims at the end of the trust period are turned over to the controller for allocation to the restitution fund 
sinatra,nonetheless urges that two features of section b cure the overinclusiveness problem identified in simon schuster.first,he notes,section b,unlike new york law,applies only to persons actually found guilty of felonies committed in this state,subd.a.thus,sinatra,points out,california statute,unlike new york,presents no danger that an innocent person will be penalized,or that income from an expressive work will be confiscated simply for inclusion of a past offense that was minor,or for which the work creator was never prosecuted.second,sinatra,observes,section b applies only to expressive materials that include the story of a felony for which one was convicted,and exempts mere passing mention of the felony,as in a footnote or bibliography,subd.a.these restrictions,sinatra,insists,negate simon schuster concern,with respect to the new york statute,that all profits from an expressive work would be confiscated though the work mentioned a past offense only tangentially or incidentally.simon schuster,supra,d.
we are not persuaded.in simon schuster,the supreme court illustrated the overbroad sweep of the new york statute by showing that it encompassed even minor,unprosecuted offenses or mere tangential or incidental mention of past crimes in a larger context.simon schuster,supra,d.but we do not read simon schuster as suggesting that a statute which exhibited marginal narrowing in these particular regards would necessarily pass constitutional muster.
instead,the court concern was with the essential values of the first amendment.as the court lengthy discussion discloses,the vice of the new york law was that in order to serve a relatively narrow crime victims from the fruits of statute targeted,segregated,and confiscated all income from,and thus unduly discouraged,a wide range of expressive works containing protected speech on themes and subjects of legitimate interest,simply because material of a certain to one past included.
thus,the california statute limitation to felony convictions does not suffice to avoid an overbroad infringement of speech.as simon schuster made clear,one motivated in part by compensation might discuss his or her past crimes,including those that led to felony convictions,in many contexts not directly connected to exploitation of the crime.one might mention past felonies as relevant to personal redemption warn from experience of the consequences of crime critically evaluate one encounter with the criminal justice system document scandal and corruption in government and business describe the conditions of prison life or provide an inside look at the criminal underworld.
mention of one past felonies in these contexts may have little or nothing to do with exploiting one crime for profit,and thus with the state interest in compensating crime victims from the fruits of crime.yet section b entrusts and permanently confiscates all income,whenever received,from all expressive materials,whatever their subject,theme,or commercial appeal,that include a substantial description of such offenses,whatever their nature and however long in the past they were committed thus,even as so limited to felony convictions,section b is not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interests it purports to serve.
as indicated above,the simon schuster majority also found overbreadth in the new york statute because it confiscated profits from expressive works that express ed the author thoughts or recollections about his crime,however tangentially or incidentally.simon schuster,supra,d,italics added.sinatra,urges that the california statute avoids this defect because it applies only to expressive materials containing the story of the,a depiction,portrayal,or reenactment of the criminal episode,subd.a,and because it expressly exempts mere passing mention of the felony,as in a footnote or bibliography ibid.thus,sinatra,suggests,the california statute applies only when an expressive work provides narrative detail about a felony for which the work author or creator was convicted,and does not discourage mere acknowledgement of a prior felony conviction in the context of another subject.
the attorney general echoes this view,suggesting that a story,as defined by the section,subdivision a,is a vivid depiction,portrayal,or reenactment.further,the attorney general suggests,the exemption is for passing mention,as in a footnote or bibliography,italics added,demonstrating that the example given is illustrative only,and that other forms of passing mention are also exempt.
these arguments do not convince us that section b focuses with sufficient precision on the fruits of crime,while leaving other income undisturbed.simon schuster illustrated the overbreadth of the new york statute by observing that it reached even incidental and tangential mention of past crimes,but nothing in simon schuster suggests the new york law could have cured its overinclusive effect simply by providing an exemption for tangential or incidental references.moreover,simon schuster neither stated nor implied that the federal constitution might allow confiscation,on behalf of crime victims,of all proceeds from any expressive work that includes a descriptive account,or even a vivid account,of a past crime committed by the author.
such arbitrary demarcation lines do not comport with the basic rationale of simon schuster.a statute that confiscates all profits from works which make more than a passing,nondescriptive reference to the creator past crimes still sweeps within its ambit a wide range of protected speech,discourages the discussion of crime in nonexploitative contexts,and does so by means not narrowly focused on recouping profits from the fruits of crime.
indeed,keenan,joined by his amici curiae,urges that the passing mention exemption is so imprecise and unclear that it constitutes an impermissibly vague basis for the censorship of protected speech.grayned city of rockford,d see also reno american civil liberties union,d.we need not resolve the vagueness issue,because we are persuaded that,by any reasonable interpretation,the statute remains overinclusive.certainly the statutory definition of story includes any substantial account of the facts and circumstances of a past felony which led to conviction,and the passing mention exemption would not provide safe harbor to materials containing such a substantial account.but there are multiple contexts in which expressive materials,with diverse subjects and themes unrelated to the exploitation of one crimes,might include substantial accounts of those episodes.
had section b been in effect at the time and place of publication,the statute would have applied to numerous works by authors whose discussions of larger subjects make substantial,and often vividly descriptive,contextual reference to prior felonies of which they were convicted a statute which operates in this fashion disturbs or discourages protected speech to a degree substantially beyond that necessary to serve the state compelling interest in compensating crime victims from the fruits of crime.accordingly,we conclude,in conformity with simon schuster,that section b is facially invalid under the first amendment to the united states constitution.
we reach a similar result under the liberty of speech clause of the california constitution art.i,subd.a the california provision provides similar,and sometimes greater,protection of speech than the first amendment,los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles cal th,fn,d,and neither party suggests any reason why it should provide lesser protection under the circumstances of this case 
conclusion 
the trial court overruled keenan demurrer to sinatra,complaint,reasoning that the storytelling provision of california statute b,on which the complaint is solely based see fn,ante,is not unconstitutional.the court of appeal affirmed on similar grounds.because we have concluded,contrary to both lower courts,that section b is invalid,we must reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed,and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.
the majority correctly observes civil code section,subdivision b shares the essential constitutional flaws condemned in simon schuster,members of state crime victims bd,d simon schuster.lest it seem the moral of the story is crime does pay,i write separately to dispel the understandable misconception that every son of sam law is unconstitutional.a properly drafted statute can separate criminals from profits derived from their crimes while complying with the first amendment.
the simon schuster court recognized the fundamental difference between works like the confessions of saint augustine or letter from birmingham jail and a work entitled snatching sinatra.in the former examples,it is the public prominence,fame,wit,passion and eloquence of the authors that make these stories valuable.the crimes caused negligible harm to any actual victim and added nothing to the marketability of the stories.in contrast,keenan crime involved both a serious harm and is the source of his work profitability judging by the title of his literary effort,it is the celebrity status of his victim that makes the story noteworthy.
notwithstanding today decision,the state may constitutionally seize any asset of a criminal to redress the harm inflicted upon his victim.additionally,the state may seize the fruits of the crime to render it unprofitable.for some works,like the autobiography of malcolm x,it may be difficult to determine the extent to which royalties result from the author criminal involvement or his literary skill.but the existence of hard cases that might win an challenge does not mean all such laws are facially unconstitutional.the first amendment protects schlock journalism as well as great literature.thus,keenan has every right to tell his story.that does not mean the first amendment guarantees he can keep the money.and therein lies the tale.
in simon schuster,supra,at pages,the united states supreme court found new york law could further two compelling state interests,which reflect the notion that crime should neither impoverish the victim nor enrich the criminal.toward the former imperative,the court recognized the compelling interest in ensuring that victims of crime are compensated by those who harm them.id.at.toward the latter end,the court acknowledged the compelling interest in ensuring that criminals do not profit from their crimes.id.at.the fulfillment of these interests restores both victim and criminal to the status quo ante and nullifies the tangible effects of the crime.
simon schuster invalidated the new york law,however,because it seized revenues without necessarily serving either state interest.should a prominent figure write his autobiography at the end of his career,and include a brief recollection of having stolen a nearly worthless item the board would control his entire income simon schuster,supra,at.because the book popularity would be due to the author lawful prominence rather than his perhaps previously undiscovered crime,the author income would not be a fruit of the crime,and thus seizure would not serve the antiprofit interest.since the stolen item was nearly worthless,seizure would not serve the compensation interest.accordingly,the court found the law significantly overinclusive.id.at.a properly structured statute could avoid this overinclusivity by seizing only assets that would compensate the victim or render crime unprofitable.
the hypothetically prominent figure who mentions a minor theft in his autobiography bears a strong resemblance to saint augustine,and very little to defendant.defendant kidnapping created more than trivial harm,and it appears the notoriety of his criminal conduct is substantially responsible for the salability of his literary efforts.thus,seizure of defendant royalties serves one or both of the compelling state interests.if so,the state may constitutionally distinguish between snatching sinatra and the confessions of saint augustine.
the constitutionality of seizing a criminal assets to compensate his victims is beyond dispute.as simon schuster observed,every state has a body of tort law serving this exact interest.simon schuster,supra,at.to effect compensation,it is immaterial whether the funds come from the fruits of crime or the defendant other assets.
although compensation may have been a goal of new york law,it failed to achieve it constitutionally.the law seized only those assets generated by the offender storytelling.the problem was not the law underinclusivity per se after all,a statute need not solve every problem to be constitutional.a law would be underinclusive if it granted the victim only a partial share of the profits or compensation only up to a maximum sum these limitations,however,would not create the constitutional defect cited in simon schuster the nature of the speech restriction.
the high court deemed the law presumptively unconstitutional because it imposed a financial burden on speakers due to the content of their speech.simon schuster,supra,at.the new york statute singles out income derived from expressive activity for a burden the state places on no other income,and it is directed only at works with a specified content.id.at.the dissenting opinion of judge newman in the court below demonstrated this discrimination.simon schuster,fischetti cir,fischetti dis.opn.of newman.judge newman observed the new york state crime victims board applied the law to the autobiography of jean harris,who had killed scarsdale diet doctor herman tarnower simon schuster,at.because the book referred to the homicide in two chapters.fischetti,at.if her book had concerned only the conditions at her prison,her royalties,though enhanced by the notoriety of her crime,would have been protected from seizure.ibid.the distinction between the treatment of the actual book and the hypothetical book shows how t he son of sam law establishes a financial disincentive to create or publish works with a particular content.simon schuster,at.
the discrimination triggered strict scrutiny,whereby the state must show the law is narrowly drawn to further a compelling state interest.simon schuster,supra,at.but new york limited the law reach to storytelling only the court found no rational reason why the state should have any greater interest in compensating victims from the proceeds of such storytelling than from any of the criminal other assets.id.at.the limitation thus not only created the need to establish a compelling interest,it also rendered the state interest less than compelling the state has a compelling interest in compensating victims from the fruits of the crime,but little if any interest in limiting such compensation to the proceeds of the wrongdoer speech about the crime.id.at.a law that shields assets such as harris home or stock portfolio from a compensation order hardly serves that interest.
the high court reasoning shows that a law without this limitation would likely survive review,because the law would not be content based thus avoiding strict scrutiny and the law would narrowly serve the compelling interest of victim compensation,and thus,a fortiori,survive a lesser level of scrutiny.the rhode island supreme court discussed the validity of such a broader law in bouchard price bouchard neither plaintiffs nor the attorney general justified the act applicability solely to expressive activity.the state compelling interest in compensating victims from the proceeds of crime would be better served,for example,by making available to a victim all the criminal assets,however and wherever derived.such an expansion of the resources potentially available to a victim would avoid the statute achilles heel of singling out only expressive activity for a special burden.we note that victims of a crime may normally bring a civil action against the offender to recover damages.after a judgment has been obtained,a victim may proceed against the defendant assets whether or not these assets represent royalties obtained from the commercial exploitation of the crime.the enforcement of such a civil judgment against a defendant assets following a personal injury or property loss has not heretofore presented a first amendment problem.bouchard,at,fn.omitted.indeed,simon schuster itself approved of new york statutory provisions for prejudgment remedies and orders of restitution.simon schuster,supra,at,and the majority likewise observes the propriety of seizure of a defendant assets to compensate a victim,ante,d at,fn,at.
a state may thus seize a defendant assets in a manner to ensure compensation.simon schuster does not stand for the proposition that the government can not recoup the proceeds of expressive activity relating to crime.rather,the government can not single out those proceeds for special treatment while ignoring other assets.united states seale cir,fn.courts may thus constitutionally order restitution from sources including,but not limited to,the defendant income from storytelling.jackson cir.the law may prevent a criminal from enjoying any of his wealth while his victim remains uncompensated.
the state may also pursue the compelling interest of depriving criminals of their profits.new york law was defective in this regard it did not fully deprive criminals of their profits,only those profits resulting from storytelling.if jean harris exploited her criminal notoriety by writing a book,the state could confiscate those royalties.if instead of telling her story she chose to exploit her notoriety by charging for underwear depicting the scarsdale diet logo with a red slash through it these royalties would be protected from seizure.the law message was not that crime does pay but that speaking about crime does pay.deterring crime is a compelling state interest,deterring speech is not.the disparate treatment accorded the income from her book and from the hypothetical merchandise reveals the discriminatory nature of the new york law.
furthermore,the discrimination undermined the compelling nature of the interest served by the law.the state could not offer any justification for a distinction between storytelling and any other activity in connection with its interest in transferring the fruits of crime from criminals to their victims.simon schuster,supra,at.there is a compelling interest in depriving criminals of their profits,but little if any interest in limiting such deprivation to the proceeds of the wrongdoer storytelling.see id.at.
whether the law pursues the compensation or antiprofit interest,a limitation on the law scope to storytelling is the achilles heel of a son of sam provision.virginia law,therefore,bars a defendant from exploiting her criminal notoriety through any means.it seizes a ny proceeds or profits received or to be received directly or indirectly by a defendant or a transferee of that defendant from any source,as a direct or indirect result of his crime or sentence,or the notoriety which such crime or sentence has conferred upon him.ann.regardless of whether a virginia criminal profited by selling her account of the crime,her autograph or her furniture for an exorbitant price she could not enjoy such revenues under this law 
section,subdivision b similarly avoids content discrimination in its seizure of profits.in conjunction with section,subdivision a,it authorizes seizure of all income from anything sold or transferred by the felon including any right,the value of which thing or right is enhanced by the notoriety gained from the commission of a felony the statute is indifferent to the thing expressive or nonexpressive character,and if expressive,its content.the majority correctly observes section,subdivision b is clearly severable from subdivision b,ante,d at,fn,at,and today decision does not affect the continuing validity of the former provision.
the content neutrality of section,subdivision b is arguable,insofar as the law distinguishes between activity that exploits criminal notoriety and that which does not.for example,if keenan published a book of poetry anonymously,the royalties would probably not qualify as profits as defined by the subdivision.but if he marketed the poems as sizzling sonnets from the sinatra snatcher,the royalties would be enhanced by his criminal notoriety,and thus subject to seizure 
on the other hand,simon schuster observed statutes may be content neutral,and thus avoid strict scrutiny,where they are intended to serve purposes unrelated to the content of the regulated speech,notwithstanding their incidental effects on some speakers or messages but not others.simon schuster,supra,at,fn,citing ward rock against racism,d city of renton playtime theatres,d.although new york law was too overinclusive to qualify,a more narrowly drawn statute might face only intermediate scrutiny under ward and city of renton.simon schuster,supra,at,fn.moreover,even if held to be content based,a statute that pursues a compelling interest depriving criminals of all their profits and is narrowly drawn seizing only profits could survive strict scrutiny.
a law that neutrally seizes all profits of crime comports with simon schuster,supra,d and thus the first amendment.even when his victim has been fully compensated,a criminal is not entitled to profit from his crimes.
as the foregoing analysis shows,a state may constitutionally seize assets by pursuing the compelling interest of compensating victims,in which case the state may seize assets from any source including assets that are not the fruits of the crime up to the amount of the victim damages.likewise,a state may constitutionally seize assets by pursuing the compelling interest of depriving criminals of assets that are the fruits of crime.and there is no apparent reason why a state must select only one compelling interest to pursue.a state may pursue both interests separately seizing all assets up to the amount of damage under the compensation rationale,and then all fruits of crime under the antiprofit theory.because each phase would neutrally seize assets in furtherance of a compelling state interest,the law would avoid the constitutional pitfalls noted in simon schuster.
