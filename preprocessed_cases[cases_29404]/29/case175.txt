the defendants organized a car race.although twenty cars were originally scheduled to race,fourteen of the twenty did not participate after it was discovered that a flaw in their tires rendered them dangerous for use at full speed on one part of the track.disappointed fans sued,seeking their expenses in attending and viewing the race.the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.the plaintiffs appeal we affirm.
background 
the fédération internationale de fia is an international body that governs certain types of automobile racing.the most famous is formula one,which uses cars specially designed for racing.the sport has traditionally been popular in europe,but formula one races often referred to as grand prix races have been held elsewhere in an effort to spread their popularity.one such race,the united states grand prix usgp or the race,was scheduled to be run at the indianapolis motor speedway ims in speedway,indiana,on june through.grand prix races are events,with two days of practice driving and qualifying laps that determine the position of the cars at the start of the race,followed by the race itself on the final day.twenty teams of two,each representing a different auto scheduled to roll.
on june,during the first day of practice driving,driver ralf schumacher crashed when his left rear tire blew out on turn thirteen of the ims track,a banked turn,apparently unusual among formula one race courses.sport reporters began to see a disturbing pattern schumacher used tires manufactured by michelin etc,and another driver using michelin tires had suffered a and crashed on that same turn the previous year.the next day,michelin sent a letter to the fia race director and safety delegate at ims stating that it had warned its teams that it might not be safe to use its tires unless the vehicle speed in turn can be reduced.michelin acknowledged that it was too late to get different tires to the track for qualifying laps and that the rules required cars to race on the same sort of tires used to qualify.since fourteen of the twenty cars scheduled to race used michelin tires,this was a significant problem.
the fia shot back a letter dated june,the day of the race,refusing to level the playing field or,more precisely,the race track between cars using the questionable michelin tires and solid bridgestone tires.it would alter neither the rules for instance,by permitting racers to use different tires than those used to qualify nor the course for instance,by adding a chicane ahead of turn thirteen to force the bridgestone teams to reduce their speed prior to the turn as well.it was the michelin teams own fault they had brought suitable equipment to the track.they had basically two options race on different tires and accept a penalty,or take turn thirteen slower than the bridgestone teams and hope to make up time on the rest of the track.
the plaintiffs complaint claims that in the hours leading up to race time,michelin and its teams threatened not to participate unless changes were made to help them.allegedly s everal proposals were discussed but no agreement was reached as to a solution because the fia and the ferrari team,the latter armed with bridgestone tires and pressing its advantage,refused to agree to any solutions acceptable to the other teams.the plaintiffs claim that the racing teams,the fia,michelin and ims finally agreed that all the teams would participate in a formation lap also known as a parade lap that takes place prior to the start of racing proper,but that afterwards the michelin teams would exit from the track,leaving only the bridgestone teams to drive the race.
that is precisely what happened.everyone was furious.representatives of the fia,michelin,ims and the racing teams rained accusations and recriminations upon one another,calling the race a farce and saying that the fans had been cheated.the racing crowd dubbed the affair indygate.
several fans who attended the usgp separately filed purported class actions against the fia and some related organizations governing formula one racing,ims,the racing teams and michelin.they alleged that the defendants owed them the price of their tickets and the cost of travel and other expenses they had incurred in attending the race only the latter is now relevant,since michelin has been permitted to give the fans a full refund of the ticket price.the cases were consolidated in the southern district of indiana,where the district court,without certifying a class,dismissed the plaintiffs third amended complaint for failure to state a claim.the plaintiffs now appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo.moranski motors,cir.a plaintiff complaint need only contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.the statement must give fair notice of the claims against the defendant and a reasonable opportunity to form an answer.pratt tarr,cir.dismissal is appropriate if a plaintiff does not allege such a claim or if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle her to relief.edwards snyder,cir.
the plaintiffs seek to recover from the various defendants under several different theories breach of contract and tortious interference with the same,promissory estoppel and negligence.we discuss each theory in turn.
breach of the ticket contract 
the plaintiffs allege first that ims and,somehow,the other defendants breached a contractual obligation to the race attendees when only six cars drove.whenever it sold a ticket to the usgp,the plaintiffs claim,ims and somehow the other defendants promised a regulation formula one racing league race in exchange for the ticket price.the plaintiffs then claim that in light of the rules governing formula one racing,a grand prix has to have at least twelve cars in it.only six cars participated here,breaching the contract.
this claim arguably should fail because ims promised only to admit the plaintiffs to the race grounds on the days of the grand prix.while we are unaware of any indiana case addressing the nature of a contract formed by the sale of an admission ticket,skalbania simmons,addressing a class certification question in a beach of contract action by season ticket holders against a hockey franchise,but explicitly reserving the merits,most states agree that the seller contracts only to admit the plaintiff to its property at a given time.the plaintiff buys the ticket,of course,in order to see an event that is scheduled to occur on the grounds,but the seller does not contract to provide the spectacle,only to license the plaintiff to enter and view whatever event transpire s.castillo tyson,see also petrich mcy music world,d,yarde metals,new england patriots,sweeney united artists theater circuit,six flags theme parks,dir.of revenue,wichita state.intercollegiate athletic ass marrs,d.but see miami dolphins,genden bach,so d,holding that a provision of a season ticket agreement requiring a refund when games were cancelled due to labor strikes was triggered when a football team played a game using strikebreakers.
the plaintiffs provide us no reason not to construe their tickets this way.while one could contract to provide a spectacle,one wonders why an exhibitor like ims would do so,given that it has control over its grounds but not over the performers and their scheduled performances.further,a spectator could reasonably decide to do without a contractual right to the spectacle itself,trusting that the exhibitor will work with the performers to ensure that the spectacle goes off lest both develop a bad reputation that could damage their future business.in the present case,formula one is struggling to take root in the united states,where the racing of stock cars modified versions of cars designed for the general public,governed by nascar is the preeminent automotive sport.indygate potential damage to formula one american reputation was a serious concern for everyone involved some speculated at the time that the fia might never hold a race at ims again.
nonetheless,because we are sitting in diversity,conservatism is in order in construing indiana law,lexington ins.rugg knopp,cir,so we rest our decision on a narrower ground.even assuming,as the plaintiffs claim,that they had a contractual right to a regulation formula one race and further assuming a right to have the race stewards properly interpret the applicable regulations on the spot,they got such a race here.the plaintiffs claim that certain provisions of the formula one sporting regulations regulations operate poorly with fewer than eleven first eight finishers get points towards the annual championship,regulations,and certain infractions may be penalized,in among other ways,by moving the offending car ten slots back in the starting grid,regulations c.but while a race under the regulations may be less rich,interesting or challenging than a race,it is not prohibited or nonsensical under the rules like a soccer match between three teams or a basketball team getting a first down.these rules can not be interpreted to impose a minimum car requirement.there is no reason to claim,as the plaintiffs in all seriousness do,that no race occurred.
additionally,the regulations explicitly permit any race for which fewer than twelve cars are available to be cancelled.any league sport must address common complications that can prevent a contest from properly occurring,including the of contestants.in baseball,for instance,a team that fails to field nine players unthinkable,the plaintiffs suggest forfeits the game.official baseball rules,available at.in formula one racing,when fewer than twelve cars are available for a race,officials may cancel one gets points towards the annual championship,even if they show up ready to go.regulations.we are reluctant to conclude that a contest deprived the plaintiffs of a formula one race when,given the way the fia has chosen to address in its sport,the race could properly have been cancelled and the plaintiffs quite legitimately deprived of any race whatsoever.see castillo,at holding that the fight in which mike tyson was disqualified for biting evander holyfield ear was nonetheless a regulation boxing match.
the plaintiffs urge that even if the race could have been cancelled,the defendants were contractually required to use reasonable efforts not to cancel it,and that all the teams should have tried harder to put on a good race.but while every competitive sport is built around the presumption that the players will try hard to win,a contest is not invalidated by a player poor effort.a team can not claim that a loss does not count because one of its members was dogging it.and once it is established that the plaintiffs received a regulation race,they admit that they had no additional right to a race that was exciting or drivers that competed well.see,beder cleveland browns,ohio app d,see also seko air freight,transworld,cir that the chicago cubs turn out to be the doormat of the national league would not entitle the ticketholder to a refund.
while the plaintiffs were upset and perhaps justifiably so if the complaint allegations are true at the bridgestone teams for putting their desire to win ahead of a taste for even competition,or at the michelin teams for deciding to take their ball and go home rather than do the best they could,the plaintiffs had no contractual right to a different performance.the dismissal of their claim for breach of the ticket contract must be affirmed,and with it the dismissal of their claim that some defendants tortiously induced others to breach the contract.
breach of other contracts 
the plaintiffs also claim that the defendants breached other contracts among themselves which impact the duty of each of the defendants to present the usgp as represented,and of which the plaintiffs were third party beneficiaries to the extent that the contracts are meant to control and determine i the proper operation of the race ii the application of the rules of defendants and the international sporting code and iii the obligations of michelin to provide safe and suitable tires for the formula one automobiles entered in this race.as already noted,the complaint does not allege a violation of the rules,and the plaintiffs have not argued the possibility of a tire obligation in this court their argument has focused on portions of two contracts submitted in the concorde agreement and the fia commercial agreement.the plaintiffs claim that further discovery will reveal that these agreements give them the right to have the defendants use their best efforts to ensure that at least sixteen cars race in every formula one event it is almost unthinkable that the defendants granted fans of their sport the legal right to interfere with their private business relations,though the story is not farfetched enough to make a rule b dismissal appropriate on that ground.see loubser thacker,cir,cert.denied,d.it is clear from the language of the contracts,however,that the three provisions upon which the plaintiffs rely do not grant them any such right.
one provision,concorde agreement,imposes a duty upon all teams to use their best endeavours to procure together that additional cars are entered into any race into which fewer than twenty cars have been entered.but even assuming that entry means actually racing rather than registering to race,the plaintiffs could not have held rights under the provision as third party beneficiaries.under indiana law a contract grants a nonparty rights only if an intent to grant the rights affirmatively appear s from the language of the instrument when properly interpreted and construed.cain griffin.the plaintiffs argue that extrinsic evidence can be helpful to that interpretation and construction,but that is true only insofar as the background of the circumstances known at the time of execution reveals the meaning of the terms of the contract itself.biddle baa indianapolis,llc,aff in relevant part.in the present case,section explicitly enumerates the parties that hold rights the signatory teams jointly undertake to the fia and to the commercial rights holder to provide twenty cars per race emphasis added the fans are not among those listed.
the plaintiffs also point to two other provisions in which all parties agree to try to ensure that at least sixteen drivers participate in the annual formula one racing league,not an individual grant the fia the power to alter the limitations to let cars that would otherwise not meet formula one requirements participate.these duties and powers do not relate to individual races.it would be strange if they did,given that concorde agreement already requires efforts to secure twenty rather than sixteen cars one of the two provisions,concorde agreement,explicitly says it is w ithout prejudice to clause.consequently,the contracts were not violated in this case,and dismissal of the plaintiffs claims as beneficiaries of these contracts must be affirmed.
promissory estoppel 
next,the plaintiffs claim that promissory estoppel binds the defendants to pay them their expenses in traveling to see the usgp.they allege that the defendants conspired and acted together to provide advertising and promotion that indicated ten teams and twenty cars would drive in the race,and that they did so with the expectation that the plaintiffs would rely on the representations.the plaintiffs relied fewer than twenty cars drove they want damages.
this claim must fail because no reasonable promoter or racing fan would have regarded a race advertising and promotion concerning the number of cars scheduled to roll as a promise upon which someone could reasonably rely.under indiana law,a person will be estopped to deny a duty to fulfill a promise only where the promise was made with the expectation that it would induce,and it does induce,reasonable reliance by the plaintiff.brown branch.whether a statement could reasonably be taken as a reliable promise depend s on the knowledge that the promisee brings to the table.garwood packaging,allen,cir applying indiana law.if a plaintiff,given her background and knowledge,should have known that an event was doubtful and might not occur,then it was not reasonable for her to rely on a defendant promis
