the trial court awarded plaintiff dirk summers a million dollar default judgment.defendant rue mcclanahan appeals from the judgment and the trial court orders denying her motions to set aside her default and vacate the judgment.because we conclude plaintiff attempted service of process did not substantially comply with the requirements of code of civil procedure section,we reverse the first trial court order and remand the cause to the trial court with directions to set aside defendant default,vacate the default judgment and set a reasonable time for defendant to file and serve such motions or responsive pleadings as she deems appropriate.
facts and proceedings below 
the essential facts are undisputed 
summers filed this action against mcclanahan for slander,libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress growing out of a failed joint business venture.the complaint seeks damages on each cause of action in an amount exceeding according to proof at the time of trial and an award of punitive and exemplary damages against defendant mcclanahan according to proof at the time of trial.
plaintiff counsel,eugene paolino,declared he served the summons and complaint in this action on mcclanahan on june,by leaving copies with barbara lawrence,mcclanahan authorized agent,at lawrence office in los angeles and mailing copies to lawrence at her office address.included with the summons and complaint were letters from paolino to lawrence and mcclanahan,a notice of deposition directed to mcclanahan and deposition subpoenas directed to four other persons.lawrence testified she immediately forwarded the documents to john edwards,mcclanahan attorney.edwards currently represented mcclanahan in another action involving summers.
edwards wrote to paolino a few weeks after receiving the documents from lawrence.edwards complained paolino attempt to directly communicate with mcclanahan knowing full well that she is represented by counsel constituted a violation of rule of the rules of professional conduct.he also objected to the deposition notice and subpoenas and informed paolino that unless he took the depositions off calendar a motion to stay the depositions and to quash the notice and subpoenas will be made and sanctions requested.edwards did not contend the summons and complaint had been improperly served on mcclanahan.paolino did not reply to edwards letter.
on november,paolino mailed a copy of a request for entry of default and court judgment to mcclanahan in care of lawrence at the same address he had used for the summons and complaint.the request for court judgment stated the amounts of general and special damages were to be proved.lawrence testified she never received this document.when mcclanahan still did not respond to the complaint paolino filed the request for entry of default and court judgment,along with a proof of service of the summons and a due diligence declaration.
at the default hearing summers submitted an declaration summarizing his case against mcclanahan and his professional background as a television writer and producer.he stated as a result of mcclanahan defamatory statements about him he had been unable to obtain work and sought damages for past and future lost earnings in the amount of million,damages for loss of reputation in the amount of million and punitive damages in the amount of million.summers made no attempt to serve mcclanahan with this declaration or a statement of damages under code of civil procedure section or a statement of punitive damages under code of civil procedure section.
the trial court entered a default judgment in favor of summers and against mcclanahan in the sum of million.
six days after entry of the judgment mcclanahan filed a motion to set aside the default and default judgment on the grounds of improper service of the summons and extrinsic fraud or mistake.
the trial court denied this motion.the court agreed lawrence was not authorized by mcclanahan to accept service of process on her behalf.it also found,however,lawrence had forwarded the summons and complaint to edwards who admitted to being mcclanahan counsel.because the documents found their way to the defendant by admitted receipt of counsel for defendant the trial court concluded service was effective under code of civil procedure section which authorizes service of the summons and complaint on a person authorized by the defendant to receive service of process.
mcclanahan filed a second motion to set aside the default and default judgment accompanied by a demurrer to the complaint.this time she based her motion on attorney fault under section,subdivision b.in his declaration accompanying the motion edwards stated at the time he received the complaint from lawrence he did not believe mcclanahan had been properly served.accordingly he advised mcclanahan she had been sued but that she had not been served and she did not have to respond to the complaint until she was served.therefore,edwards declared,the decision to not file a response was entirely mine and was not the fault of mcclanahan.
the trial court denied this motion too.the court ruled the second motion was a subsequent application for the same order it had previously denied and as such was barred by section,subdivision b because it was not based on any new or different facts,circumstances or law only on a different theory for relief.the court further ruled the motion was premature because edward fault was in concluding mcclanahan had not properly been served but an appellate court might conclude edwards was correct.
mcclanahan filed a timely notice of appeal from the default judgment and the orders denying her motions to set aside the default and default judgment.
discussion 
for the reasons discussed below we conclude the trial court erred in denying mcclanahan first motion to vacate the default and set aside the judgment based on summers failure to properly serve the summons and complaint.
historical background of section.
in the california legislature enacted a comprehensive revision of the laws governing service of process the legislature based this revision on recommendations contained in a report by a joint committee representing the judicial council and the state bar and these recommendations were adopted as the legislative history of the statute 
prior to the amendments many courts had required strict and exact compliance with the statutory requirements for service of process in adopting a liberal construction of the new law our supreme court relied on its understanding of the statutes legislative history and its well considered view of public policy although the court was misled as to the legislative history,its public policy analysis was clearly correct 
at the time california enacted its new statutes many other jurisdictions had adopted a liberal,practical approach to service of process issues.
karlsson is illustrative of cases viewing service of process issues from a practical standpoint.service of process on rabinowitz was effected by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint with his spouse at their maryland home three weeks after rabinowitz had preceded his family to arizona where he took a new job and bought a home intending never to return to maryland.rabinowitz remained in maryland to complete moving arrangements and the sale of their home before joining her husband in arizona.it was undisputed rabinowitz promptly notified her husband of this service of process the issue before the court of appeals was whether substituted personal service on rabinowitz satisfied rule,subdivision d of the federal rules of civil procedure which provides for substituted service on a person at his dwelling house or usual place of abode.in resolving this issue the court declined to choose between or attempt to reconcile cases in hopeless and irreconcilable conflict over the meaning of dwelling house and usual place of abode.instead the court concluded insofar as a person abode or dwelling depended on the person intention to return or not return to his living quarters such an intent is not the test for effective service in itself but is some indication as to whether or not it is likely in a particular case that the one served will actually receive notice of the commencement of the action and thus be advised of his duty to defend.the court went on to state to the extent that there is any rule or guide to be followed by the federal courts in such a case it is that where actual notice of the commencement of the action and the duty to defend has been received by the one served,the provisions of rule d should be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction of the court,thus insuring the opportunity for a trial on the merits.
the karlsson court distinguished the facts in the case before it from those in williams capital transit in williams,process was served on a defendant at the home they had once shared in washington.at the time of service on the she and the defendant had not seen each other for three years.in the meantime,defendant had remarried and moved to salt lake city defendant former spouse did not inform him she had been served with process.he did not learn of the default judgment against him until three years after its entry the court of appeals in williams affirmed the trial court order setting aside the judgment against defendant because his wife home was not his place of abode when process was served on her 
to the karlsson court the distinction between the facts in the case before it and the facts in williams lay in the likelihood of service resulting in actual notice to the person intended to be served.in karlsson the family ties between the rabinowitzes made it highly likely rabinowitz would receive notice of the action from rabinowitz in time to defend.on the other hand the court concluded from the facts in williams i t is patent that the likelihood of the husband receipt,through such service of process,of actual knowledge of the action and his duty to defend is rather remote.
cases construing the revised service of process law.
in pasadena superior court the issue was whether service of process on a person erroneously identified by a corporation in official documents as its secretary and treasurer constituted service on the corporation under section,subdivision b which authorizes service by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the corporation secretary or treasurer.it was undisputed the erroneously identified forwarded the papers to the real and the real discussed the case with the other directors of the corporation 
adopting a liberal and practical approach to service of process our supreme court held the plaintiff,by serving a corporate agent with ostensible authority to receive process,effected valid service upon the defendants.the court noted,t he case at bar demonstrates the desirability of liberal construction of the new statutes.in this case,the court explained,d efendant corporation,having misled plaintiff,bears the responsibility for plaintiff failure to serve an authorized corporate officer,and should not be permitted to strip itself of assets in order to avoid the payment of an uncontested judgment.
the liberal and practical approach to service of process has been followed in subsequent court of appeal decisions.in gibble research,the court stated it is well settled that strict compliance with statutes governing service of process is not required.rather,in deciding whether service was valid,the statutory provisions regarding service of process should be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the court if actual notice has been received by the defendant.
nevertheless there are cases decided after the enactment of the revised statutes which have continued to apply the strict construction rule.in multitech,for example,the court stated a defendant is under no duty to respond to a defectively served summons.the notice requirement is not satisfied by actual knowledge of the action without service conforming to the statutory requirements which are to be strictly construed.
edwards may have relied on the line of cases in advising mcclanahan she did not have to respond to summers complaint.if he did rely on those cases he erred.it is clear from our supreme court opinion in pasadena the old rule of strict construction has been rejected and a new rule of liberal construction has been adopted 
summers failed to demonstrate substantial compliance with section.
section authorizes personal service on a defendant by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to a person authorized by him to receive service of process.
in its comments on this provision the judicial council stated if the process is delivered to an agent of defendant,such agent must be one who is authorized by law or appointment to receive service of process,and the agent of an individual for other purposes is not necessarily authorized to receive such process.
in doherty the united states supreme court provided guidance for determining who is a proper agent for acceptance of service on behalf of a defendant.the court concluded a specific appointment is not required,but the relationship must be close and enduring enough to make it highly probable the defendant will receive actual notice.
the plaintiff in doherty goodman was a resident of iowa who served process on the defendant securities dealer,a resident of new york,by delivering the summons and complaint to an employee of defendant in his des moines office.the employee only specific authority was to sell securities for defendant.defendant never consented that service of process upon this agent should constitute service upon himself.the supreme court nevertheless upheld the service under an iowa law which authorized service of process on any agent or clerk employed in the office of an individual or company doing business in any county other than that in which the principal resides.the court rejected the defendant due process challenge to the statute.it agreed with an iowa supreme court opinion which upheld the statute against a constitutional attack because there is not only reasonable probability but practical moral certainty that the defendant will receive actual notice of the pendency of the action.
in a law review note examining doherty the author characterized the method of service authorized by the iowa statute as unquestionabl y reasonable the owner of the business selects as his agent for business purposes the person upon whom the summons is served.furthermore,the statute limits service to a clerk or agent,persons who can reasonably be expected to notify the party sued.
when a defendant challenges the court personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving,inter alia,the facts requisite to an effective service.taking into consideration the comment of the judicial council and the interpretation of the new service of process statutes by our supreme court in pasadena we conclude summers failed to carry his burden of proof.
summers contends the present case is analogous to warner.records,golden west music sales in which service of process on arthur leeds,the attorney for the individual defendants,resulted in actual notice to the defendants the court in warner noted leeds was not only the defendant agent,he was a in the case.the nature of the services performed by leeds for defendants and the necessity for his repeated communication with them in performing those services,made it highly probable that defendants would receive actual notice of the service of process on leeds upon their behalf.
warner is distinguishable from the case before us in several important ways.in our case,process was not served on mcclanahan attorney,edwards,but on her personal manager,lawrence.lawrence was not a in the lawsuit brought by summers and had no involvement in the transaction giving rise to summers action.furthermore,the court in warner did not hold service of process on leeds under the circumstances described above constituted service on the individual defendants.it only concluded service of the summons and complaint on leeds could be valid as to the individual defendants because leeds relationship with the individual defendants may ha
