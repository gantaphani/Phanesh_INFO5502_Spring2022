for many years,electric membership corporation,a north carolina electric cooperative,had a agreement with time warner partnership,a cable service provider,permitting time warner to attach its cable to electric utility poles.the initial fee in the renewal of the agreement provided that time warner pay per pole.after electric terminated that agreement in,it demanded an increase to per pole as a condition of any new agreement.
claiming that the proposed new rate was unreasonable and discriminatory,time warner refused to enter into a new agreement.instead,it commenced this diversity action,requesting a declaratory judgment that electric,in charging excessive and discriminatory rent for pole attachments,violated a statutory duty imposed on electric cooperatives in north carolina to charge only reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates,see,and a common law duty as an electric utility to charge only reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates,see salisbury spencer ry.southern power.the district court granted electric motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b as to both claims,and time warner appealed the district court ruling,but only as to its common law claim.
because the common law duty requiring an electric public utility to charge reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates for electric service does not clearly apply to agreements and we are not free to extend north carolina common law to hold that it does,we affirm.
electric,organized as an electric cooperative under chapter of north carolina general statutes,provides electric service to customers in carteret,craven,jones,and onslow counties on the southeastern coast of north carolina.for many years,electric leased excess space on its utility poles to time warner pursuant to a negotiated license agreement between them.in the renewal of their agreement,time warner agreed to pay per pole for the first months of the contract,thereafter to be adjusted by an amount equal to the annual percentage change in the index of public utilities,bulletin,southeastern region,account,poles,towers,fixtures 
in july,electric legally terminated the agreement and proposed a new license agreement,with a rate of per pole.it stated that it calculated this figure by applying the federal communications commission formula for determining the proper rental rate for pole attachments charged by federally regulated utilities to telecommunications service companies.when time warner objected to the new rate as too high and pointed out that electric application of the fcc formula was erroneous and that the properly calculated fcc rate was actually per pole,electric declared that it intended nonetheless to charge the rate.
following an impasse in negotiations,time warner commenced this action.in its complaint,it alleged that the rate far exceeded electric cost in making pole space available and that it far eclips ed the rates that would be obtained by use of rate methodologies used by the fcc or other state utility commissions.it also alleged that the rate exceeded the rates paid by time warner under agreements with other utilities in north carolina.finally,it alleged that on information and belief,electric charge d a attaching entity,sprint corporation,a rental rate of less than per pole.time warner grounded count i of its complaint on electric statutory duty under north carolina general statutes,and requiring an electric cooperative to charge reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates for its service to customers,and it grounded count ii on electric common law duty,as it articulated the duty,to offer its members reasonable,nondiscriminatory rates for electric power and any other goods or services that it provides by way of its property which is devoted to the public use.
the district court granted electric motion to dismiss,concluding,with respect to the statutory claim,that entering into a license agreement with a cable company to provide space on its poles does not constitute a service or services as defined in chapter north carolina general statutes,and and do not provide authority for this court to conclude that defendant may assess only a reasonable and rate.the court concluded,with respect to time warner common law claim,that it could not locate any case interpreting north carolina law to extend the common law prohibition against discriminatory rates to include negotiated prices for business agreements that are unrelated to the basic statutory purpose of an entity such as electric,and that it should not create or expand north carolina common law.
from the district court order dated august,time warner appealed,but only with respect to its common law claim.time warner contends on appeal that the common law duty imposed on utilities in north carolina to charge only reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates for service also applies to electric rate under the agreement and that the amount electric seeks to charge for pole attachments is in fact unreasonable and discriminatory.
resting upon the north carolina common law principle that a public utility must render its service at uniform and reasonable rates and without discrimination,see.carolina,time warner argues that a public utility also has a duty to charge reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates for use of its property used in providing its service.thus,time warner claims that electric must lease the excess space on its utility poles at reasonable and nondiscriminatory rental rates and that electric is violating this common law duty because the rate that it proposes is both unreasonable and discriminatory.the proposed per pole rate is more than three times the rate that had been established in the prior contract it is virtually double the rate calculated under the federal pole attachment act and it far exceeds the rate that time warner has to pay other utilities in north carolina.moreover,as time warner alleges in its complaint,this rate is discriminatory in that electric only charges sprint corporation,which time warner claims is a similarly situated attaching entity,per pole to string its telephone lines,approximately one half of what it proposes to charge time warner.
electric agrees with time warner that public utilities have a common law duty to sell their service to customers at reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates.it argues,however,that it is an electric utility and is not in the business of providing public access to excess space on its utility poles or on any other property it owns.it asserts,there is simply no basis for finding a common law duty of or reasonableness for an electric membership corporation with respect to anything other than its sales of electric energy.
the governing principles are not in dispute.public utility companies,such as those in the business of transmitting electricity locally to consumers,are natural monopolies created by the economic forces of high threshold capital requirements and virtually unlimited economy of scale.see jackson metro.edison,d.it would make little economic sense for competitors to invest in duplicative sets of electrical poles and transmission lines.because of the impracticalities of competition,regulation is necessary as a substitute for competition.id.at.with regulation,public utilities are precluded from extracting monopoly premiums for their vital services.
electric is not a typical utility,however,but rather an electric cooperative organized under chapter of north carolina general statutes,which authorizes the creation and operation of electric membership corporations corporations owned and operated by their members.north carolina law authorizes such corporations to be formed by persons residing in communities not served,or inadequately served,with electric energy and to operate for the purpose of promoting and encouraging the fullest possible use of electric energy in the rural section of the state by making electric energy available to inhabitants of the state at the lowest cost consistent with sound economy and prudent management of the business of such corporations.they are nonprofit corporations created,operated,and owned by their members who are the persons using the energy supplied by the corporation.see id.the members elect a board of directors who in turn elect a president and a secretary to operate the corporation.accordingly,the customers of electric cooperatives in north carolina ultimately have the power to determine the rates that they themselves pay for electric energy.likewise,they have the authority to decide whether to lease excess space on their utility poles and the rate at which they charge for that space.see id.
even though the members of electric cooperatives have the ultimate power over rates,statutes nonetheless prohibit electric cooperatives from charging other than reasonable and uniform rates for service.see id.but even as statutes require that electric service be provided at reasonable and uniform rates,no statute imposes any restriction on the amount that an electric cooperative may charge t o sell,lease,mortgage or otherwise encumber or dispose of all or any part of its property.id.more particularly,no statute imposes a restriction on whether an electric cooperative can lease excess pole space or establishes the rate that it can charge for that space.the only relevant statutory provision simply authorizes the cooperative to sell or lease its property as necessary or convenient for carrying out the purpose for which it was formed.id.
at the federal level,congress has enacted the pole attachment act of to regulate the rates that utilities can charge for pole attachments.see b.the act,however,specifically exempts any person who is cooperatively organized.see id.a.indeed,the act was enacted specifically for the purpose sought to be attained by time warner in this regulate the agreements of public utilities,which are unquestionably in a position to extract monopoly rents from cable television systems in the form of unreasonably high pole attachment rates,at,as reprinted in,internal citations omitted.but congress recognized that cooperatives do not present the same danger.as the senate report explained 
cooperatively owned utilities,by and large,are located in rural areas where often television service is poor.thus the customers of these utilities have an added incentive to foster the growth of cable television in their areas.
id.at,as reprinted in.moreover,cooperatively owned utilities have a check against abuses b ecause the pole rates charged by municipally owned and cooperative utilities are already subject to a decisionmaking process based upon constituent needs and interests.id.
thus,no federal statute regulates electric cooperatives,and,unless the provision of excess pole space to the public is a service that is thought to be provided to customers by electric cooperatives,no north carolina statutory regulation applies to regulate rates charged by electric cooperatives in north carolina.
time warner initially contended in this case that providing excess pole space was a service,as regulated by and of the north carolina general statutes.the district court,however,dismissed that claim as failing to state a cause of action,concluding 
h aving considered the statute,the commission lack of regulatory activity,and cases from other states,the court concludes that section and section do not provide authority for this court to conclude that defendant may assess only a reasonable and rate.relatedly,the court concludes that defendant entering into a license agreement with a cable company to provide space on its poles does not constitute a service or services as defined in chapter.
time warner does not challenge this conclusion on appeal.rather,it limits its contention to the claim that even though no statute regulates rates that may be charged by electric cooperatives in north carolina,the common law of north carolina does.
before the district court,time warner relied principally on the case of salisbury spencer railway southern power salisbury i.it argued that under salisbury i,public utilities have a common law duty to charge reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates for use of their property used in providing their service.in essence,it argued that the common law regulation of a public utility service rates includes the regulation of rates charged for use of its property used to provide that service.the district court,however,rejected this argument,concluding 
this court has not located any case interpreting north carolina law to extend the common law prohibition against discriminatory rates to include negotiated prices for business agreements that are unrelated to the basic statutory purpose of an entity such as electric.likewise,this court has not located any case applying north carolina common law to regulate agreements in any manner whatsoever while appreciative of plaintiff invitation to be the first,this court will not undertake such an expansion of north carolina public policy.
on appeal,time warner contends that the district court erred in adopting so limited a view of the services of an electric cooperative that are subject to the common law requirements of reasonableness and nondiscrimination.arguing that the district court holding was an inappropriately crabbed view of the common law duty owed of utilities,time warner asserts that because utility poles are facilities devoted to the public use by extending electric lines to customers,the utility has a duty to license pole attachments to customers at reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates.
because of the importance of the services provided by utility companies and their status as natural monopolies,both before and even after the extensive statutory regulation of utilities came about,a body of common law developed under which natural monopolies,such as electric companies,were required to deal in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner when selling their service to their customers.this is true under the common law of north carolina,as elsewhere.time warner argues that because an electric utility monopoly includes the right to place and own utility poles,the common law must also impose a duty of reasonableness and nondiscrimination with respect to leasing access to those poles.to make this argument,it relies principally on salisbury i.
in salisbury i,the defendant was a public utility corporation subject to the laws governing public utilities in north carolina.see at.the utility sold electric power to the plaintiff,another public utility,which in turn resold the power to consumers.id.the defendant public utility corporation,however,charged its own subsidiary far less for power than it charged the plaintiff and other customers.id.rejecting the defendant public utility argument that it had a right to discriminate among consumers,the supreme court of north carolina held that i t is well settled that the obligation of equal and undiscriminating service clearly requires the same charges shall be made to all consumers for the rendering of similar service.id.at.
this holding,however,does not advance time warner argument for an extension of the common law duty.the north carolina court found a duty of reasonableness and nondiscrimination to apply to the defendant utility electric energy sales,the very service that was the basis for the defendant to be subject to regulation as a public utility.explaining the need for nondiscrimination in the sale of electric energy,the north carolina court stated that such discrimination would leave salisbury and spencer two towns served by the plaintiff resale of electricity without lights for the homes and places of business of its people and without power for the operation of their industrial plants or any means of operating the street railway.at.
in contrast to salisbury i,the case before us does not involve the utility function that electric was formed to provide.electric public responsibility extends to promoting and encouraging the fullest possible use of electric energy in the rural section of the state.emphasis added.although cable services have grown to become important also,electric was not created to provide such service.moreover,electric was not created to sell,lease,or dispose of its property.while it has those rights,they were given as ancillary to electric business of providing electric energy to its customers.
