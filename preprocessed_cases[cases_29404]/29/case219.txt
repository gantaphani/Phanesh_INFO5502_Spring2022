this appeal presents two issues arising from a petition to compel arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement between the international alliance of theatrical stage employees and moving picture technicians,artists,and allied crafts of the united states,its territories and canada and its trusteed local las vegas,nevada iatse and insync show productions,insync.it is undisputed that iatse and insync agreed to a collective bargaining agreement containing both a grievance and arbitration procedure and a provision governing the length of the agreement life.after the parties unsuccessfully negotiated regarding a potential successor agreement,iatse filed a petition to compel arbitration in federal court.the district court granted iatse petition to compel arbitration pursuant to the parties initial agreement and stayed the case.we must decide whether we have jurisdiction over insync appeal from the order compelling arbitration and,if so,whether the district court properly compelled arbitration.we conclude that the district court arbitration order was final under because the stay lacked any legal or practical effect.we therefore exercise jurisdiction to review the order compelling arbitration,and we affirm.
background 
insync and iatse entered into a collective bargaining agreement the cba in january.article of the cba,which governs the term of the agreement,contains an evergreen clause.article stated 
except as otherwise provided for herein,this agreement shall become effective on the day of january,and shall continue in full force and effect to and including december,and from year to year thereafter.the employer agrees to live by the applicable wages,terms and conditions for additional projects in the future.
emphasis added.
article of the cba includes a grievance and arbitration procedure.that provision defines a grievance as a claim or allegation by an employee in the bargaining unit or by the union that the employer has violated or is violating the provisions of this agreement.if the parties proceed to arbitration,t he arbitrator award shall be based solely upon his interpretation of the meaning or application of the provisions of this agreement.
on october,iatse informed insync that iatse was interested in changing the terms of the cba.insync responded on november with a letter,explaining that insync did not intend to renew the cba.iatse wrote back on november,stating that the national labor relations act nlra,et,required the parties to bargain in good faith.iatse included a proposed extension agreement,the cba,that insync indicated would extend the terms of the cba.insync did not sign the cba.on december,iatse reminded insync of the requirement to bargain in good faith.the record does not reflect further communication until august.
between august,and february,insync and iatse corresponded about a possible successor collective bargaining agreement.on february,insync wrote to iatse,stating that the parties had reached impasse in bargaining and insync reserved the right to implement any or all of the terms and conditions set forth in the company previously sent december,proposal.shortly thereafter,on february,insync sent and invited a response to its last,best and final offer.on march and,iatse sent a counterproposal,and insync reiterated its position without accepting that counterproposal.the parties did not reach an agreement.
on august,iatse invoked the parties grievance and arbitration procedure and requested a meeting.two weeks later,insync responded that the parties had bargained to impasse between and,no extension agreement had been signed,and the statute of limitations under section b of the nlra barred any legal actions based on the negotiations during.
on september,iatse wrote to insync,asserting its position that insync was bound by provisions in the cba that rendered the proposed cba effective.the cba had terms identical to those in the cba.on october,insync informed iatse that it believed that a refusal to bargain charge under section a of the nlra was time barred,and a grievance under article of the collective bargaining agreement was also time barred.on october,iatse responded with a letter,stating that the letter serve d as the union grievance filed pursuant to article,because the employer is violating each and every section of the collective bargaining agreement insofar as the employer is operating on a completely basis and ignoring the contract completely.insync responded on november,reiterating its views on timeliness,and concluding the best i can tell you is do what you have to do.
on february,iatse filed a petition to compel arbitration in the district court.iatse argued that the cba,with terms identical to those in the cba,was enforceable as a result of the cba evergreen clause.insync responded by filing a motion to dismiss,or,alternatively,for summary judgment,on grounds that the nlra preempted iatse action and that the district court lacked jurisdiction.
the district court rejected iatse position that the cba binds the parties,reasoning that such a position apparently read out the portion of the evergreen clause that states that the cba would continue in effect from year to year after its expiration,not in block chunks of periods.instead,the court considered the text of the cba and declined to reach the merits of insync argument that insync had cancelled the cba evergreen clause.the court took no position on the merits of insync argument and decide d that because the argument requires interpretation of the cba and a determination of whether it was cancelled,the argument is better left for an arbitrator to decide pursuant to the arbitration clause and iatse grievance process.the court granted iatse petition to compel arbitration,denied insync motion,and ordered that this case shall be stayed pending the completion of arbitration.
ii.jurisdiction 
we turn first to whether we have jurisdiction to entertain insync appeal.iatse argues that appellate jurisdiction does not exist because the district court order compelling arbitration and staying the case did not constitute a final order under.as we explain below,we conclude that we have jurisdiction and that we may address the merits of insync appeal.
federal courts have only the power that is authorized by article iii of the constitution and the statutes enacted by congress pursuant thereto.couch telescope,cir quoting bender williamsport area sch.dist.generally,this court ha s jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.appeal gives the upper court a power of review,not one of intervention.so long as the matter remains open,unfinished or inconclusive,there may be no intrusion by appeal.cohen beneficial indus.loan.
under goodall sanford united textile workers of america.local,we have jurisdiction over insync appeal of the order compelling arbitration.in goodall sanford,a union brought a suit in federal district court under a of the labor management relations act lmra,a,and sought to compel specific performance of a grievance arbitration provision of a collective bargaining agreement.goodall sanford,at.the union sought no other relief.see id.the district court ordered arbitration,and on appeal,the first circuit affirmed.id.at.subsequently,the supreme court also affirmed.id.in affirming,the court held that appellate jurisdiction existed,explaining that a rbitration wa s not merely a step in judicial enforcement of a claim nor auxiliary to a main proceeding,but the full relief sought.id.a decree under a ordering enforcement of an arbitration provision in a collective bargaining agreement is,therefore,a final decision within the meaning of.id.at.
we have held that goodall sanford permits review of appeals from orders compelling arbitration as the full relief sought in cases.see united food commercial workers union,locals,alpha beta,cir citing goodall sanford and stating because the district court granting of a petition to compel arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement is a final decision under we have jurisdiction over this appeal see also abernathy cal.edison,cir noting that the immediate appealability of orders compelling arbitration under goodall sanford is inconsistent with the policies underlying the arbitration process,but explaining that until the supreme court or congress acts,the final judgment cases require such an outcome 
here,the district court reviewed the relevant evergreen and arbitration provisions,determined that interpretation of the evergreen clause in the cba should be decided by an arbitrator,and entered an order compelling arbitration.notably,the only claim that iatse alleged in its petition was that it was entitled to enforcement of the grievance and arbitration procedure in the cba with terms identical to those in the cba.thus,in ordering arbitration,the district court granted the full relief iatse sought,see goodall sanford,at,and thereby terminated the litigation.as part of the order,the court stayed the case pending arbitration,but the court did not explain why it ordered the stay nor specify on what basis it did so.the entry of the stay,in these circumstances,had no legal or practical effect.thus,under goodall sanford,we have jurisdiction over insync appeal of the order compelling arbitration.
iatse also invoked the federal arbitration act faa,et,as a statutory basis for its petition to compel arbitration.iatse argues that the faa applies to the parties collective bargaining agreement and precludes appellate jurisdiction because the district court stayed this case pending arbitration.see,b under the faa,generally,an appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order granting a stay of any action under section of this title b.and under,the district court in any proceeding where an issue is referable to arbitration under a written agreement shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
we need not decide,however,whether the faa applies in this case because we have jurisdiction to review the order compelling arbitration whether we apply the faa,or the lmra as interpreted by goodall sanford even reviewing this case and the district court stay as strictly a case,we properly could look to the faa for guidance.see united paperworkers int l union,afl cio misco,f ederal courts have often looked to the faa for guidance in labor arbitration cases,especially in the wake of the holding that empowers the federal courts to fashion rules of federal common law.
whether we apply the faa or look to it for guidance,we would reach the same result as applying the lmra and goodall sanford because the petition to compel arbitration was the only matter before the district court.see prudential ins.of am.lai,cir.under a,an appeal may be taken from a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.
the supreme court interpreted the phrase,final decision with respect to an arbitration,in green tree financial randolph.t he term final decision in a has the longstanding meaning of a decision that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.bushley credit suisse first boston,cir quoting green tree,at.in green tree,a plaintiff initially had alleged statutory claims against a lender,after which the lender brought a motion to compel arbitration as provided in the parties written agreement and to dismiss the plaintiff claims with prejudice.at.until that point,the federal courts had distinguished independent proceedings when a request to order arbitration is the sole issue before the court from embedded proceedings actions involving both a request for arbitration and other claims for relief to determine whether a final decision arose under a.id.at.the supreme court rejected this distinction as one at odds with the plain text in a.see id.at.green tree ultimately held that where the district court has ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration,and dismissed all the claims before it,that decision is final within the meaning of a,and therefore appealable.id.at.separately,in a footnote,the court noted a distinction not at issue in green tree had the district court entered a stay instead of a dismissal in this case,that order would not be appealable.id.at citing b.
when the only matter before a district court is a petition to compel arbitration and the district court grants the petition,appellate jurisdiction may attach regardless of whether the district court issues a stay.see lai,at.the limitation on appellate jurisdiction noted in green tree footnote does not apply here because in green tree,the lender moved to compel arbitration where the plaintiff had alleged substantive claims for relief in her complaint.see green tree,at.before the supreme court decided green tree,we had held that if the motion to compel arbitration in a given case is the only claim before the district court,a decision to compel arbitration is deemed to dispose of the entire case,and permit appellate review under a.lai,at green tree does not disturb our holding in lai,and it remains good law today.see circuit city stores,mantor,cir interactive flight,swissair swiss air transp,cir 
in sum,following case law under the lmra or faa leads to the same result a district court presented with a petition to compel arbitration and no other claims can not prevent appellate review of an order compelling arbitration by issuing a stay.thus,the order compelling arbitration in this case is a final decision over which we have jurisdiction.see.

iii.order compelling arbitration 
having determined that we may exercise jurisdiction over this appeal,we turn to the merits.we review de novo the district court order compelling arbitration.bushley,at.
we begin by recognizing some established principles regarding arbitration of disputes under a collective bargaining agreement.first,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.at t,commc ns workers of,quoting united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf nav,litton fin.printing div.nlrb.and except where the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,it is the court duty to interpret the agreement and to determine whether the parties intended to arbitrate grievances concerning a particular matter.granite rock int l of teamsters,citation omitted quoting at t,at.further,
where the contract contains an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that a n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.
