when music legend ray charles died,he left behind remarkable legacies in music and philanthropy.this appeal arises from the intersection of the two.seven of charles heirs purported to terminate copyright grants that charles conferred while he was alive.the ray charles foundation,the sole beneficiary of charles estate,filed suit to challenge the terminations.the district court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction,and the foundation now appeals.we reverse the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
charles copyright interests 
in the,ray charles robinson,young and early into his career,entered into several contracts with music publisher atlantic records and its subsidiary,progressive music publishing.the contracts indicated that charles was an employee of the publishers,who owned all copyright interests in charles work.under the contracts,charles was entitled to advance payments and future royalties.
by,charles had achieved considerable success and renown.that year,he renegotiated his copyright grants with progressive successor in interest.the renegotiation pertained to songs charles had previously conveyed to progressive,as well as published and unpublished works that he had not yet assigned to any publisher.the grant entitled charles to royalties and another advance payment.
charles founded a nonprofit corporation now known as the ray charles foundation.the foundation was established for scientific,educational,and charitable purposes.it provides research and scholarship grants for the benefit of deaf,blind,and underprivileged youths.
at the time of his death,charles had twelve adult children,seven of whom are involved in this case as defendants appellees in,charles informed all of his heirs that he would establish irrevocable trusts of for each of them if they agreed to waive further claims to his estate.each of the heirs,including all of the terminating heirs,signed a contract providing 
my father,ray charles robinson,has told me that he will set up an irrevocable trust for my benefit,to be funded with.this gift is my entire inheritance from him and i understand that i will not inherit anything further under my father estate plan and that i am waiving any right to make a claim against his estate.
charles passed away in.according to the complaint,charles will named the foundation as his sole beneficiary and devised all of charles rights in his works and rights under contracts,including the compositions that are the subject of this action,to the foundation.the foundation is precluded from accepting private donations.it relies on royalties from charles works to fulfill the wishes of ray charles and t he foundation purpose.
ii.relevant statutory provisions 
sections and of the copyright act of govern termination of copyright grants,c,d.the provisions were designed to safeguard authors against unremunerative transfers needed because of the unequal bargaining position of authors,resulting in part from the impossibility of determining a work value until it has been exploited,at see also melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright e b matthew bender,ed observing that the provisions were intended to protect authors and their spouses,children,and grandchildren against unremunerative transfers and improve their bargaining position.
section pertains to grants and transfers made after in the case of any work other than a work made for hire,the grant of any right under a copyright,executed by the author,otherwise than by will,is subject to termination under specified conditions.a emphasis added.under this statute,termination of a copyright grant may be effected at any time during a period,starting years after the execution of the grant.id.a.because the year period began with grants made in,opportunities to execute termination notices under started to accrue for the first time on january.copyright office,analysis of gap grants under the termination provisions of title at,available at.

c emphasis added.the subsection is a close but not exact counterpart of section.see,at.under c,terminations may be effected during a period starting years from the date the copyright was secured,or january,whichever is later.u.c.most existing case law on copyright termination pertains to c because opportunities to terminate copyright grants became ripe under this statute earlier than grants subject to 
the copyright office regulations provide 
a copy of the notice of termination shall be recorded in the copyright office before the effective date of termination,as a condition to its taking effect.however,the fact that the office has recorded the notice does not mean that it is otherwise sufficient under the law.recordation of a notice of termination by the copyright office is without prejudice to any party claiming that the legal and formal requirements for issuing a valid notice have not been met,including before a court of competent jurisdiction.

both and c are silent on who may challenge the validity of termination notices.
iii.the subject termination notices 
in march,the terminating heirs filed notices under and c to terminate pre and post grants authorized by charles.they served the notices on various parties,including music,progressive successor in interest.the notices served on pertain to the compositions at issue in this case.those works include some of charles greatest hits,such as i got a woman,a fool for you,blackjack,leave my woman alone,and hallelujah,i love her so.the notices have staggered effective dates,ranging from april,through september.each notice specifies a date on which it purports to terminate all rights tied to the copyright grants,at which point those rights will revert in proportionate shares to each of charles heirs.see b,c.the terminating heirs issued multiple termination notices for some of the compositions,thereby purporting to subject individual works to multiple termination dates.for example,three termination notices were issued for the song mary ann,each asserting a different termination date april,november,and may.
the copyright office recorded the termination notices in january.see copyright office,public catalog,recorded document nos.notices,notices see also harris cnty.of orange,cir we may take judicial notice of undisputed matters of public record.
iv.district court proceedings 
in march,the foundation brought suit to challenge the termination notices.its complaint asserts state law claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and a federal claim for declaratory and injunctive relief.the district court granted the terminating heirs motion to dismiss the state law claims under california statute,and the foundation does not appeal that ruling.
the federal claim is the only one at issue in this appeal.in it,the foundation requests a judicial determination of the validity and effectiveness of the termination notices and its rights and obligations.it also seeks a declaratory judgment establishing 
the compositions at issue are excluded from the termination provisions because they were works made for hire if the compositions were not works made for hire,then the agreement constituted a renegotiation of the transfer of most of the songs,satisfying the statutory right of termination the notices pertaining to unpublished works are invalid because the right of publication of those songs were not exercised within five years of the agreement the agreement constituted a new transfer and all termination deadlines should be calculated from that date and the court should determine which of the multiple termination notices for each composition is operative,if any.
further,the foundation seeks to enjoin the terminating heirs from claiming that they are,or will become,the rightful owners of the copyright interests entering any agreement that would transfer those interests and using the compositions in ways not permitted by parties who do not own copyright interests.
the terminating heirs moved to dismiss.they argued that the foundation lacked standing to bring its federal claim because it was really asserting the rights of,progressive successor in interest and the current copyright owner.the terminating heirs relied in part on the inalienable nature of termination rights,which can not be waived through contract.see a c b.they highlighted the fact that congress enacted the current statutory termination provisions when it extended copyright renewal terms because it intended to benefit authors and their statutory heirs,not grantees.see.at.in opposition,the foundation asserted that it alleges injury to itself,and that there is no authority supporting the terminating heirs position that copyright ownership is a prerequisite for challenging a termination notice.
during oral argument on the motion to dismiss,the foundation alternatively argued that even if the works were not created as works made for hire,the foundation is a beneficial with standing to sue for copyright infringement and that it should therefore have standing to challenge the termination notices.the terminating heirs argued that the concept of beneficial ownership is not relevant here because beneficial ownership pertains only to copyright infringement.after oral argument,the district court ordered supplemental briefing on two issues 
assuming that the works at issue were not works made for hire and the foundation is a beneficial owner of the copyrights,does the foundation have standing under the copyright act to challenge the termination notices under c and a as a grantee of an exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of any right under the copyrights 
given the allegations in the current complaint,can the foundation allege facts to support a claim that the works were not works made for hire consistent with rule 
after the parties filed their supplemental briefs,the district court issued an order granting the motion to dismiss,concluding that the foundation lacked standing to bring this action.the court first observed that the terminating heirs did not challenge the foundation constitutional standing and the foundation has at least plausibly alleged that it exists here.the court then moved to what it termed prudential standing.applying the test,the court concluded that the foundation asserted interests were not among those protected by and c.the court reasoned those sections do not define who may challenge termination notices,although,by their terms,they only contemplate that certain parties will be involved in the termination process.the court noted that the sections do not mention parties that acquire by bequest the right to receive future royalty streams.the district court concluded that this indicate s that only authors,statutory heirs owning a termination interest,and grantees of transfers and their successors fall within the zone of interests congress contemplated in enacting these provisions.
thus,the court reasoned that the foundation could only claim standing because it was only asserting interests in the termination notices,not its own.the district court did not address the foundation interest in the continued receipt of royalties.because the foundation did not show that it had a close relationship with,or that was incapable of protecting its own interests,the court concluded that the foundation did not have standing to challenge the termination notices.see powers ohio,we have recognized the right of litigants to bring actions on behalf of third parties,provided three important criteria are satisfied the litigant must have suffered an injury in fact thus giving him or her a sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of the issue in dispute the litigant must have a close relation to the third party and there must exist some hindrance to the third party ability to protect his or her own interests.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in response to the foundation alternative theory that it has standing as a beneficial owner of the copyright interests,the district court concluded that because the foundation complaint alleged that the compositions were created as works for hire,it was not a beneficial owner and thus did not have standing to challenge the termination notices the court denied leave to amend,pretermitting whether the foundation could amend its complaint to allege that the compositions were not works made for hire because in either event,the foundation interests did not fall within the termination provisions zone of interests,and the foundation lacked standing to assert the interests of.
the foundation timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse the district court decision.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court order dismissing a complaint for lack of jurisdiction under rule b.warren fox family worldwide,cir.at this stage,the foundation need only show that the facts alleged,if proved,would confer standing upon it.id.at.
there is no challenge to the foundation article iii standing.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing requires that the foundation suffer a concrete,particularized,and actual injury in fact there be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and a favorable decision will likely redress that injury.lujan defenders of wildlife.the foundation complaint satisfies these requirements it establishes that the foundation relies on royalties from the copyright grants the terminating heirs notices sought to terminate those grants the terminations,if valid,would deprive the foundation of its income stream and a declaration of the terminations invalidity would redress that deprivation.
although neither party argued ripeness,it is our duty to consider sua sponte whether a suit is ripe,because the question of ripeness goes to our subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case.haw.newspaper agency bronster,cir alteration omitted quoting shelter creek dev.city of oxnard,cir see also ctr.for biological diversity kempthorne,cir r ipeness is not waivable.
the foundation suit is ripe.the foundation claims pertain to termination notices for grants governing different works,executed in different contracts,at different times.termination notices do not automatically terminate grants the effective dates of termination depend on the date of each grant and the validity of the notices.see a,c.the terminating heirs issued the termination notices in march,the copyright office recorded the notices in january,and the earliest asserted termination date passed on april.that asserted date pertained to at least seven of charles works,including i got a woman,one of charles most famous songs.the foundation filed its complaint on march,and the district court granted the terminating heirs motion to dismiss on january.the asserted termination dates for of the works had passed by the time of the district court order,and the dates for a total of works have elapsed as of the issuance of this opinion.
the foundation alleges that the notices of termination immediately clouded its ability to assess its future income stream and to rely on the royalties.its complaint presents questions regarding the nature of the underlying works,such as whether they were works made for hire,and if so,when their respective termination dates would be effective.review of these questions does not require us to engage in abstract inquiries about speculative injuries.see wolfson brammer,cir the ripeness doctrine is peculiarly a question of timing,designed to separate matters that are premature for review because the injury is speculative and may never occur from those cases that are appropriate for federal court action.through avoidance of premature adjudication,the ripeness doctrine prevents courts from becoming entangled in abstract disagreements.alteration,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at identifying the question of ripeness as whether the issues presented are definite and concrete,not hypothetical or abstract quoting thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc.we accept as true the foundation allegation that the effects of the termination notices have been felt in a concrete way because the notices have created an enormous cloud over the future copyright ownership of the works and made it very difficult,if not impossible,to exploit the valuable copyrighted assets.the foundation complaint is therefore not premature.it would be an inefficient use of judicial resources to compel the foundation to file a different suit after each termination date has passed.
we recognize that,as in cases in which suits were found unripe for adjudication,the record contains no determination by the copyright office of the validity of the termination notices.see smith casey,cir.but the parties made clear in the district court that there i s nothing pending before the copyright office because the office does not typically hold proceedings to adjudicate the validity of termination notices.the copyright office has expressly stated it does not issue or enforce notices of termination,but only serves as an office of public record for such documents.compendium of copyright office practices iii.the fact that a document has been recorded is not a determination by the copyright office concerning the validity or the effect of that document.that determination can only be made by a court of law.id.emphasis added.and the fact that the copyright office has recorded the notice does not mean that it is otherwise sufficient under the law recordation is without prejudice to any party claiming that the legal and formal requirements for issuing a valid notice have not been met,including before a court of competent jurisdiction.f.
satisfied that this suit meets the threshold requirements of constitutional standing and ripeness,we proceed to the only remaining issue whether the foundation may sue to challenge the termination notices.
the foundation argues that it has standing to challenge the termination notices as a beneficial owner.it bases this argument on its status as the sole beneficiary of charles will the foundation reasons that because the copyright act accords standing to beneficial owners in the context of infringement,beneficial owners have standing in the context of termination.we disagree.the term beneficial owner comes from,which is titled infringement of copyright.subsection b provides that a beneficial owner is entitled to institute an action for any infringement.see also silvers sony pictures entm t,f d,cir en banc reasoning that only a legal or beneficial owner may sue for infringement.the district court relied in part on the concept of beneficial ownership when it granted the motion to dismiss,but the foundation claims are about termination of copyright grants,not copyright infringement.the argument that the foundation may be a beneficial owner lends no support to its claim to standing.
the terminating heirs argue that the foundation must satisfy the requirements for standing because the complaint actually asserts the interests of.the foundation argues that it is a real party in interest and that it is not asserting rights of a third party.we agree with the foundation.
historically,courts have treated the limitation on standing as a prudential principle that requires plaintiffs to assert their own legal rights.see erwin chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction ed.e ven when the plaintiff has alleged injury sufficient to meet the case or controversy requirement,th e supreme court has held that the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.warth seldin.this rule ensures that plaintiffs possess such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional or statutory questions.thinket ink info,sun microsystems,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
it is undisputed that copyright ownership lies with,but just as the termination notices affect ownership of copyrights,they also directly affect the foundation right to royalties.see b,c larry spier,bourne,cir.the foundation is the sole recipient of royalties flowing from charles copyright grants and effective termination would deprive it of the right to receive prospective royalties.see larry spier,at.we thus have little difficulty concluding that the foundation is litigating its own stake in this controversy.
this conclusion is buttressed by comparing the foundation interests to.the publisher interests will be prejudiced only if charles heirs are successful in their efforts to terminate the existing grants and then either agree to grant copyright ownership to another publisher,or renegotiate grants with on terms less favorable to the publisher than the terms of the existing grants.otherwise,it makes no difference to whether it continues to pay royalties to the foundation under the current grants,or to charles heirs under new grants.in their brief on appeal,the terminating heirs recognize that if they decide to renegotiate grants with,the publisher interests will be largely unaffected a terminated grantee may well be more interested in maintaining an amicable relationship with the terminating author or statutory heir to facilitate.indeed,the statutory termination provisions reflect interest in remaining friendly to the terminating heirs,by giving negotiating priority to terminated grantees 
a further grant,or agreement to make a further grant,of any right covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective date of the termination.as an exception,however,an agreement for such a further grant may be made between a majority of the statutory heirs and the original grantee or such grantee successor in title,after the notice of termination has been served as provided by clause of subsection a.
b.because interests are not necessarily at risk,it has diminished reason to litigate,particularly because challenging the terminating heirs might endanger its interests.
in this case,the party presenting the most concrete adverseness to the terminating heirs is the foundation.the foundation plainly asserts its own legal rights and interests,not those of another,thus making immaterial any question about the jurisdictional character of standing.see lifestyle,united states,citations omitted.
we now turn to the test,which looks to the statutory provisions at issue and asks whether congress authorized the plaintiff to sue under them.see lexmark int l,static control components.the crux of the foundation complaint is that and c do not apply to the underlying works because they are works made for hire.see a in the case of any work other than a work made for hire emphasis added,c in the case of any copyright subsisting in either its first or renewal term on january,other than a copyright in a work made for hire emphasis added.the terminating heirs argue that the foundation suit does not fall in the termination statutes zone of interests because the termination statutes were intended to benefit authors surviving spouses and heirs.but this ignores the central premise of the foundation suit,which is that the termination provisions do not apply at all.as the holder of legal rights and interests that will be truncated if the termination notices are valid,the foundation has standing to challenge whether the underlying works are subject to the termination provisions.if the compositions are works made for hire,the termination statutes do not apply.see a,c.further,as we explain below,even if we assume that the compositions are not works made f
