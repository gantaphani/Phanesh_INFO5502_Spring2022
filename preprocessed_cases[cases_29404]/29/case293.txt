this copyright action arises from a termination notice sent by the appellant to the appellee,seeking to recapture rights to various characters created by her grandfather,alan alexander milne,who authored the children books.milne originally granted various rights in those works to the appellee in.then,in,due to a change in copyright law in,milne heirs considered terminating the grant outright,but instead entered into a new agreement that revoked the original grant and rights in the works to the appellee.the appellant seeks to invalidate the agreement based on legislation.the legislation only authorizes the termination of copyright agreements executed before.because the revocation and were valid,we affirm the district court decision.
historical regulatory background 
as part of the enumerated powers vested in the federal government,the constitution provides congress with the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.const.art.i,cl.pursuant to this authority,congress enacts copyright legislation.
the first enactment of concern in this case is the copyright act.act of,ch,stat.this enactment responded to authors complaints that the existing protection term was inadequate because many authors were outliving the protection and thereby being denied the proper fruits of their labor.see arguments on,before the comms.on patents,sess.statement by samuel clemens mark twain asserting that the term of protection was not long enough.congress addressed those complaints by extending the renewal period from years to years,making copyright protection possible for a total of years.act of,ch,stat.
almost seven decades later,congress enacted the copyright act,which forms the foundation of current copyright law.the structure of a fixed term followed by a renewal term was eliminated.see copyright act of,stat.codified at.in its place,congress established a single term for all copyrights created after january,the maximum term under the act was replaced with a term of the author life plus years.a.works published or registered before january,would be protected for a maximum of years from the date of publication or years from the date of creation,whichever was less.
on october,president clinton signed into law the sonny bono copyright term extension act of ctea,stat.codified at.as its name suggests,the statute further expanded the term of copyright protection,extending the term of all existing and future copyrights by a period of years.specifically,congress broadened the term of copyright protection prospectively to works created after its effective date from the life of the author plus years to the life of the author plus years a,a b.the statute also enlarged the term of protection retroactively to previously granted copyrights,extending their term to a maximum of years.id.
one of the purposes of the ctea was to harmonize our copyright term with that of the european union because,without the change,authors would receive fewer years of protection than their european counterparts.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of orrin hatch see also cong.rec.daily ed,statement of carlos moorhead.this threatened to cost the united states vast amounts of revenue and its favorable position in the global market.see id.another reason behind the extension was to provide greater protections for authors and two succeeding generations of their heirs.orrin hatch,toward a principled approach to copyright legislation at the turn of the millennium,pitt.the end result is that works that otherwise would have entered the public domain,such as the works at issue in this litigation,were protected for an additional years.thus,it appears that no copyrighted work will enter the public domain for the next years or so,until january.
factual background 
in the,alan alexander milne the author created in his classic children books the characters of the boy christopher robin and his stuffed bear,as well as their friends eeyore,owl,piglet,rabbit,kanga,roo,and tigger.four of those works are involved in this action when we were very young now we are six and house at pooh corner collectively,pooh works.copyrights in the pooh works were registered between and,and renewed between and 
entranced by the published house at pooh corner,a new yorker by the name of stephen slesinger boarded a boat for england with the hope of persuading the author to let him license the rights to the pooh works for trade purposes back home.slesinger was a producer,creator of characters,and pioneer in the licensing of characters for children.
in,the author entered into an agreement with slesinger,granting slesinger exclusive merchandising and other rights based on the pooh works in the united states and canada for and during the respective periods of copyright and of any renewal thereof to be had under the copyright act.in return,the author received a share of royalty income earned by slesinger,ranging from three percent of wholesale sales to percent of slesinger receipts,as well as an advanced payment against those royalties.after the agreement execution,slesinger created stephen slesinger,ssi,to which he transferred his rights in the pooh works.
in,the author passed away and was survived by his widow and their son,christopher robin milne.the author will bequeathed all beneficial interests in the pooh works to a trust for the benefit of his widow during her lifetime milne trust,and,after her death,to other beneficiaries pooh properties trust,which included his son,christopher,and christopher daughter,clare.clare is the author sole grandchild and the in this case.
in,ssi granted exclusively to walt disney productions disney the rights it had acquired in the grant,and disney agreed to pay certain royalties to ssi.around the same time,disney also entered into a similar agreement with the author widow and the milne trust,granting disney exclusive rights,rights,and other exclusive rights in the pooh works in exchange for royalties.
in,the author widow passed away and,in,her beneficial interests under the milne trust were assigned to the pooh properties trust in accordance with the author will.this meant that the pooh properties trust would receive the author copyright interest in the pooh works plus the royalties payable under the agreement.
then came the copyright act and,with it,an extended renewal term of copyright protection,stat,a.most relevant to the pooh properties trust was the provision that gave the author or his heirs an opportunity to benefit from the extended renewal term.id.specifically,this new statute enabled an author or his heirs to terminate a grant of rights to a copyrighted work made by the author or his heirs to a third party prior to the statute effective date of january.c.
in,faced with the possibility that christopher might seek to terminate the rights disney had received in from ssi,disney proposed that the parties renegotiate the rights to the pooh works.christopher accepted disney proposal and,using the bargaining power conferred by his termination right,negotiated and signed on april,a more lucrative deal with ssi and disney that would benefit the pooh properties trust and its beneficiaries.
the new agreement acknowledged the grant and the assignment of rights to disney,and observed that although ownership of the copyrights had been transferred to the pooh properties trust,there were disputes which had existed.recognizing that the author heir,christopher,may well have a right of termination under the copyright act,the agreement declared that the parties were resolved to clarify certain aspects of their contractual arrangements and to settle revised agreements.christopher therefore agreed not to seek termination of the existing arrangements in return for executing the new agreement.the agreement then provided for the revocation of the and agreements in favor of the new agreement,followed by the on the same page of the rights in the pooh works to ssi in exchange for royalties,ssi turned around and granted disney the radio,television,and merchandising rights to those works.
one result of the agreement was an increase of the amounts that the pooh properties trust received over the sums that had been payable under the agreement.the pooh properties trust now received double ssi share of the royalties,compared to about half of ssi share before the agreement.thus,the renegotiations between the parties resulted,by some estimates,in a net gain of hundreds of millions of dollars to the pooh properties trust,which included clare as a prime beneficiary.
on november,motivated by the recent enactment of the ctea and its favorable treatment of authors heirs,clare set out to recapture the rights to the pooh works.toward that end,she served ssi with a notice of termination,which referenced november,as the effective date for termination of the grant of rights to ssi.the same day that she served the termination notice,clare entered into an agreement with disney,assigning the rights expected to revert to her in 
procedural background 
on november,the day after she served the termination notice,clare joined by disney,commenced this action in the district court,seeking a declaration that her termination notice was valid and effectively terminated ssi rights in the pooh works.thereafter,ssi filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings or,alternatively,for summary judgment.ssi asserted,inter alia,that clare termination notice was invalid because the grant of rights targeted by the termination notice had already been revoked under the agreement,and therefore was no longer in existence and not subject to statutory termination under the ctea.in turn,clare filed a for summary judgment,seeking a declaration that the termination notice was valid and that ssi rights in the pooh works would terminate on november.
on may,the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part ssi motion,and denying clare.in essence,the district court declared the termination notice to be invalid by ruling in ssi favor regarding clare claim 
clare subsequently moved the district court to enter a final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b because all claims related to her had been resolved.the district court eventually granted clare motion,and entered judgment as to clare on december.she filed a timely appeal from that judgment.see fed.app.a.
d.the district court may,order 
when considering the parties motions,the district court asked the question that lies at the very heart of the parties dispute should the ssi agreement be treated as a agreement to be governed by the ctea termination provisions of answering the question in the negative,the district court held that the parties agreement itself revoked the grant of rights under the agreement that clare notice sought to terminate,and that the grant made to ssi under the agreement was not subject to termination under the ctea.in reaching its ruling,the district court rejected clare argument that the agreement was merely an extension of the grant.the court further reasoned that the ctea termination provisions apply only to grants made prior to.the court also opined that the copyright acts did not alter the power of private parties to contract and that the agreement was created in order to protect ssi and disney from a termination of the rights granted to them.
in addition,the district court was not persuaded by clare argument that a grantee may not subvert the statutory rule against obtaining a new grant prior to termination of the original grant unless there is at least a moment of freedom when the grantor is bound under neither the prior nor the new grant.the court noted that although c and a provide that termination of a grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,s ection does not apply because this is a agreement,and does not apply because the grant in question was not made by the author quoting a,c.thus,the court concluded that the agreement was a new contract,effective after january,and that clare termination notice was invalid.

right of termination under the ctea 
clare argues that she properly terminated ssi rights in the pooh works.we hold that the district court contrary conclusion is correct.
in a copyright case,as in most cases,the language of the statute provides the starting point for our analysis.cmty.for creative reid,d mills music,snyder,d.the ctea provides in relevant part 
in the case of any copyright other than a work made for hire,subsisting in its renewal term on the effective date of the sonny bono copyright term extension act effective october,for which the termination right provided in subsection c of this section has expired by such date,where the author or owner of the termination right has not previously exercised such termination right,the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright or any right under it,executed before january,by any of the persons designated in subsection a c of this section,other than by will,is subject to termination 
d emphasis added.
although clare termination notice purports to terminate the grant under the ctea section d,that statute provides a termination right to only those transfers or licences executed before january.id.emphasis added.the only grant of rights to ssi,and the only grant to ssi specified in the termination notice,was the grant made by the author to slesinger.the grant,however,was terminated by the beneficiaries of the pooh properties trust upon the execution of the agreement.accordingly,there was no grant of rights to ssi in existence when congress enacted the ctea in.
the sole grant of rights to ssi,either at the time of the ctea enactment or when clare served her termination notice,was the grant of rights embodied in the agreement.as the district court correctly explained,however,this grant is not subject to termination under section d because it was not executed before january,as the statute expressly requires.d.
agreement to the contrary 
faced with the reality that she is dealing with a agreement,clare attempts to circumvent the agreement by claiming that another provision of the ctea,c,requires this court to regard the agreement as an agreement to the contrary that does not prevent her from terminating ssi rights to the pooh works.section c states that a t ermination may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,including any agreement to make a will or to make any future grant.c.
the statute does not define the phrase agreement to the contrary,although it does provide two examples of agreements that would constitute an agreement to the contrary an agreement to make a will and an agreement to make any future grant.id.the undisputed fact that the agreement does not fall into either category supports the district court finding that the agreement is not an agreement to the contrary.see sutton providence joseph med,cir when a statute contains specific items and a general item,we usually deem the general item to be of the same category or class as the more specifically enumerated items.
to support her theory that the agreement falls under the category of an agreement to the contrary,clare reads the supreme court decision in stewart abend,d,as holding that congress intended to make the termination right inalienable for authors and their families.stewart,however,did not interpret the agreement to the contrary language of section c or its counterpart under section a in fact,the only discussion in stewart pertaining to inalienability is the court relatively brief portrayal of the evolution of copyright law,beginning with the copyright act of and ending with the copyright act.see at.noting only that t he copyright act provides a single,fixed term,but provides an inalienable termination right citing.accordingly,stewart does not support the broad plain meaning that clare attributes to section c.
clare also relies on the second circuit decision in marvel characters,simon,cir,to support her claim that the agreement is an agreement to the contrary under section c.the contract at issue there was a settlement agreement between the parties,which ended a series of lawsuits filed in the by the creator of a copyrighted work.id.at.the creator argued that the settlement agreement should not be given effect because it contractually changed the nature of the copyrighted work,labeling it as a work made for hire many years after its creation.id.at.the effects of this label were to make the creator an employee for hire rather than the author of the copyrighted work,and to foreclose his right to terminate the grant he had made in the copyrighted work.id.at.thus,unlike the issue presented in the case at bar,the issue facing the second circuit was whether c phrase any agreement to the contrary includes a settlement agreement stating that a work was created for hire.id.at quoting c.
after examining the legislative history and considering the purpose of section c,the court concluded that an agreement made subsequent to a work creation which retroactively deems it a work for hire constitutes an agreement to the contrary under c of the act.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the second circuit held that an employer can not contractually transform a creator or author of a copyrighted work into an employee for hire.id.the court expressed concern that if it held otherwise,works not satisfying the for hire test could be coerced by agreements that designate such works to be something they are not works for hire.id.at.
the facts,reasoning,and holding of marvel have little relevance to this case because,here,there is no attempt to recharacterize the work or a prior agreement.instead,the agreement involves contractual provisions that operated prospectively through the revocation of an existing grant and the making of a new one.as the district court recognized,t he parties in the a greement did not attempt to change or modify the nature of their association with one another,or alter the character of their relationship.
reinforcing this reasoning are the undisputed facts that the grant was expressly revoked by the pooh properties trust,which made a new grant of rights to ssi that,inter alia,was more lucrative for the author heirs.the fact that the agreement was meant to protect the continuing viability of the author grant of rights to ssi is evident from the agreement itself.in that vein,it is important to note that the parties describe their agreement as a new agreement for the future which the parties believe would not be subject to any right of termination under or c emphasis added.
neither marvel nor any other of clare cited authority supplies a basis for us to question the district court decision or to undo the agreement,which was freely and intelligently entered into by the parties the beneficiaries of the pooh properties trust were able to obtain considerably more money as a result of the bargaining power wielded by the author son,christopher,who was believed to own a statutory right to terminate the grant under section c of the copyright act.although christopher presumably could have served a termination notice,he elected instead to use his leverage to obtain a better deal for the pooh properties trust.his daughter,clare,was a beneficiary of this new arrangement,and her current dissatisfaction provides no reason to discredit the validity of the agreement and the rights conferred thereby.
legislative history of section c 
the district court stated there was nothing wrong with the fact that the a greement was created in order to protect ssi and disney from a termination of the rights granted to them.relying on legislative history,the district court read the house report for the copyright act as confirming the rule that n othing in the copyright acts has altered the power of private parties to contract,sess,reprinted in.
clare criticizes the district court approach to statutory construction,arguing that section c meaning is clear on its face and that there was no need for the district court to consider legislative history.she maintains that the district court used legislative history to override the statute itself.
we disagree.section c states that t ermination may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant.c.as we have noted,the phrase agreement to the contrary is unclear.even clare agrees that the phrase is not defined by the statute,and the second circuit has expressly found the phrase ambiguous and that an analysis of legislative history is required to glean its meaning.marvel,at accord walthal rusk,cir reviewing legislative history upon concluding that section c counterpart termination provision under section is not perfectly clear.this court has recognized that when a statute terminology is not clear on its face,it is appropriate to seek guidance in the legislative history.in re bce west,cir see also united states buckland,cir where the language is not dispositive,we look to the congressional intent revealed in the history and purposes of the statutory scheme.internal quotation marks omitted.
as clare concedes,a review of the legislative history turns up nothing to support her contention that she may terminate ssi rights in the pooh works on the theory that the agreement is an agreement to the contrary.on the contrary,congress specifically stated that it did not intend for the statute to prevent the parties to a transfer or license from voluntarily agreeing at any time to terminate an existing grant and negotiating a new one.at,at congress further stated that nothing in this section or legislation is intended to change the existing state of the law of contracts concerning the circumstances in which an author may terminate a license,transfer or assignment.at,at.congress therefore anticipated that parties may contract,as an alternative to statutory termination,to revoke a prior grant by replacing it with a new one.indeed,congress explicitly endorsed the continued right of parties to a transfer or license to voluntarily agree at any time to terminate an existing grant and negotiat e a new one.at,at.
the rationale behind the legislation was to safeguard authors against unremunerative transfers and improve the bargaining position of authors by giving them a second chance to negotiate more advantageous grants in their works after the works had been sufficiently exploited to determine their value.at,at.congress sought to foster this purpose by permitting an author heirs to use the increased bargaining power conferred by the imminent threat of statutory termination to enter into new,more advantageous grants.this is exactly what christopher and the other beneficiaries of the pooh properties trust did in.
after more than years of advancement of the pooh works in the marketplace,their value was sufficiently demonstrated,and the copyright act provided christopher a window for termination.the pooh properties trust recognized the perceived right to terminate as a valuable bargaining chip,and used it to obtain an advantageous agreement that doubled its royalty share relative to ssi share.thus,the agreement exemplifies the increased bargaining power that congress intended to bestow on authors and their heirs by creating the termination right under the copyright act.as the agreement appears to be the type expressly contemplated and endorsed by congress,we do not consider it to be a prohibited agreement to the contrary under section c.
in addition,clare attempts to conjure up a proverbial parade of horrors that she believes would result were we to uphold the parties exercise of free will to enter into the contract.she argues that judicial recognition of the agreement would provide a blueprint by which publishers could effectively eliminate an author termination right quoting marvel,at.the strength of a proposed parade of horrors,however,lies in direct proportion to the certitude that the provision in question was meant to exclude the very evil represented by the imagined parade,and th
