right of publicity 
the right of publicity is defined as an appropriation of one name or likeness for the defendant advantage.carson here johnny portable toilets,cir.the purpose of this right is to protect the commercial interest of celebrities in their identities,id.at,as t he famous have an exclusive legal right during life to control and profit from the commercial use of their name and personality,id.quoting memphis dev.found.factors,cir.
the district court rejected plaintiffs claims of violation of their rights of publicity on the basis that depicting one without his or her permission did not constitute a violation of the right of publicity under michigan law.see,district court opinion and order of february.at the time of this ruling,the michigan supreme court had not addressed this tort,and the lower michigan courts had only noted that it was among the types of invasion of privacy rights recognized under michigan law.in drawing this conclusion,the district court relied in part on the restatement third of unfair competition which noted in that use of identity for the purposes of trade does not ordinarily include the use of a person identity in news reporting,commentary,entertainment,works of fiction or nonfiction,or in advertising that is incidental to such uses.
the district court also focused on matthews wozencraft,cir,in which an alleged misappropriation of his name and likeness by his and a movie studio when events of his life as a police officer,some of which were fictionalized,were sold as movie rights.his claim for violation of his right of publicity was denied by the fifth circuit which held that the term likeness does not include general incidents from a person life,especially when fictionalized.the narrative of an individual life,standing alone,lacks the value of a name or likeness that the misappropriation tort projects.id.at.a similar claim brought by a former black panther against the producers of a film depicting a fictionalized account of his life story was rejected in seale gramercy pictures.
plaintiffs argue that the district court misinterprets their position and has reduced their claims to the narrow notion that the defendants only depicted their life stories without their consent.they allege that their life stories were not told in the,but instead their identities were used as colorful props to make otis williams life story more entertaining and appealing.plaintiffs state that this court holding in carson here johnny portable toilets,provides them with relief,and that the district court erred by dismissing their claims for failure to state a cause of action.
defendants assert that the first amendment defeats plaintiffs right of publicity claims because the is a movie concerning a musical group where there is public interest,and is not a commercial advertisement for the sale of goods.defendants argue that the first amendment bars claims for right of publicity where the publication is a matter of public interest,and that it has long been settled that motion pictures are a form of expression protected by the first amendment.rogers grimald
