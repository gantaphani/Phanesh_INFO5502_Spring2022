the domestic box office receipts for the picture,as reported by daily variety,never reached million.the picture never reached cash breakeven.as a result,new line never paid prelude any participation fee under the new line agreement.
procedural background 
melchior filed this action against new line and prelude for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of fiduciary duty,constructive fraud,conversion,constructive trust and negligence.a first amended complaint contained the same causes of action.a second amended complaint added koch and entertainment as defendants.it contained causes of action for breach of contract,declaratory relief,accounting,constructive trust,fraud and conspiracy,intentional interference with contractual relations,and money had and received.
new line filed a demurrer to the second amended complaint.the trial court overruled the demurrer as to melchior causes of action for declaratory relief and accounting.it sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to melchior causes of action for constructive trust,fraud and conspiracy,and intentional interference with contractual relations.it sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the cause of action for money had and received 
melchior filed a third amended complaint containing causes of action against new line for breach of contract,declaratory relief,accounting,intentional interference with contractual relations,conversion,unjust enrichment,negligent misrepresentation,intentional misrepresentation,and conspiracy.new line filed a demurrer as to the causes of action for intentional interference with contractual relations,negligent misrepresentation,intentional misrepresentation and conspiracy.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,leaving as the only causes of action against new line breach of contract,declaratory relief,accounting,conversion and unjust enrichment.
melchior filed a number of discovery motions and sought to compel new line to produce further information.on july,the trial court deferred ruling on melchior last two motions until august.two days later,new line moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.on august,melchior filed opposition to the summary judgment motion and requested a continuance of the motion.
the trial court heard new line summary judgment motion on august.it found melchior breach of contract cause of action had no merit as a matter of law,in that melchior could not meet his burden of establishing a contract with new line,which new line breached to melchior detriment.it found melchior causes of action for declaratory relief and accounting had no merit as a matter of law,since they were based upon the existence of a valid contract with new line.the trial court found melchior causes of action for conversion and unjust enrichment had no merit as a matter of law,in that they were preempted by the copyright act et and barred by the releases in the release agreement.additionally,unjust enrichment is not a valid cause of action under california law.the trial court accordingly granted the summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of new line.
contentions 
melchior contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to his causes of action for breach of contract,declaratory relief and accounting.specifically,he claims that by law,when new line accepted the benefits of the release agreement,it also assumed the obligations of the agreement,including the obligations to pay melchior the amounts due under the agreement.we agree that,by law,new line assumed the obligations of the release agreement.the trial court therefore erred in adjudicating summarily these causes of action.
melchior also contends that the parol evidence rule could not be used to exclude consideration of the release agreement when interpreting new line obligations under the new line agreement.inasmuch as the summary judgment must be reversed as to the causes of action based on the agreements,we need not address this contention.
melchior asserts the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his causes of action for conversion and unjust enrichment,in that they are not preempted by the copyright act.he also argues that california law does not preclude his cause of action for unjust enrichment.we conclude his conversion cause of action is preempted by copyright law.in addition,melchior has no cause of action for unjust enrichment under california law.the trial court thus did not err in adjudicating summarily these causes of action.
melchior further asserts that his civil code section release,which precludes him from pursuing his cause of action for conversion,is void as against public policy and was not relied upon by the trial court.we need not address this assertion.
finally,melchior contends that,alternatively,the trial court should have granted his request to continue the hearing on the summary judgment motion,in that he was prevented from presenting evidence due to defendant refusal to provide discovery.again,we need not address this contention.
discussion 
standard of review 
the trial court properly grants summary judgment or adjudication if there is no question of fact and the issues raised by the pleadings may be decided as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.to secure summary judgment or adjudication,a moving defendant may show that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.code civ,subd.o aguilar,supra,at,d.once the moving defendant has met its burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to the cause of action or the defense thereto.code civ,subd.o aguilar,supra,at,d.

breach of contract,declaratory relief and accounting 
the release agreement contained three major monetary provisions which took effect i f the picture gets made in association with prelude.these were the right to receive thousand dollars as a production bonus payable out of the budget of the picture two percent of prelude gross receipts,if any,from the picture and employment for a period of a minimum of ten weeks during production of the picture at a salary of per week.melchior received the production bonus and weeks employment at.he did not receive a sum representing what would have been two percent of prelude gross receipts,which became the basis of his lawsuit.
the subsequent new line agreement provided for new line to pay to prelude a participation fee,payable at such time,if ever,as the domestic box office receipts for the picture reached million or as the picture reached cash breakeven.it also provided that prelude retains the obligation to make all payments required to be made to ib melchior pursuant to such agreement i a production bonus if the picture is produced,ii of seller gross receipts from the picture,and iii a special advisor fee of per week for a minimum of ten weeks during production of the picture,although it gave new line the right upon notice to prelude to make any of the foregoing payments directly to ib melchior and to offset such payments against monies payable to prelude hereunder.
melchior argues that the new line agreement improperly modified the release agreement by reducing the amount of receipts he was to receive from two percent of what would have been prelude gross receipts to two percent of prelude participation fee in the picture without his written agreement to the modification.he also claims that by accepting assignment of the benefits of the release agreement,new line by law was required to accept the obligations of the release agreement,namely,the obligation to pay him the amount to which he was entitled under the release agreement.
melchior relies on civil code section for the proposition that by accepting the benefits of the assignment of the release agreement,new line also accepted the obligation under the agreement.that section provides a voluntary acceptance of the benefit of a transaction is equivalent to a consent to all the obligations arising from it,so far as the facts are known,or ought to be known,to the person accepting.ibid since new line voluntarily accepted the benefit of the release agreement,by law it consented to the obligations arising under the release agreement.
fanning yoland productions,d,is directly on point.in fanning,actor ronald colman entered into a contract to provide services to yoland productions in the production of a motion picture.for his services,yoland agreed to pay colman a certain percentage of the picture gross proceeds after had been paid to the producer.colman was to receive not less than one week after the start of principal photography and a guaranteed minimum of from the gross proceeds of the picture.id.at.
yoland assigned colman contract to producer cardinal pictures.under the assignment agreement,cardinal agreed to perform all of yoland obligations under the contract except payment of the minimum of from the gross proceeds of the picture.yoland agreed to remain liable for that obligation.the assignment agreement also made provision for payment of a portion of the net profits from the picture to yoland.colman consented to the assignment,although he was unaware that yoland retained the obligation to pay him the minimum.fanning yoland productions,supra,d at.
colman fully performed his part of the contract.cardinal paid him the first due under the contract.the picture was released.it did not have in gross proceeds.neither cardinal nor yoland paid colman his.colman assigned to plaintiff his rights under the contract.fanning yoland productions,supra,d at.
plaintiff sued yoland and cardinal.the trial court found that cardinal,as assignee of colman employment contract,accepted the burdens of that contract as well as its benefits.it was estopped to set up as a defense the provisions of the assignment agreement excepting the obligation to pay the minimum.fanning yoland productions,supra,d at.
on appeal,cardinal contended it was not liable for payment of the minimum as a matter of law,in that the assignment agreement expressly provided it would not assume that obligation,and neither it nor yoland intended that it would be liable for the payment.the court acknowledged that under the provisions of the assignment agreement,cardinal did not assume the obligation to pay the and yoland agreed to retain the obligation.fanning yoland productions,supra,d at.it also acknowledged the general rule that the mere assignment of rights under an executory contract does not cast upon the assignee any of the personal liabilities imposed by the contract upon the assignor.ibid.
the court then noted the exception to the general rule set forth in civil code sections and fan
