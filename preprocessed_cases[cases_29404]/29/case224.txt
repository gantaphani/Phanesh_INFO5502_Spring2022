this case concerns the licensing rights for several early musical recordings by reggae legends bob marley and the wailers.when the music was initially recorded in jamaica in the,record keeping was not a primary concern.the absence of legal documentation has led to confusion in the marketplace as to which entities own licensing rights for these recordings.
defendants universal music group,umg recordings,and universal music group international,collectively,umg successfully invoked this lack of documentation in the district court to obtain summary judgment on plaintiff rock river communications,rock river claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.rock river lawsuit alleged that umg inappropriately blocked rock river from distributing its album of marley remixes by wrongfully threatening to sue rock river distributors.umg persuaded the district court that unless rock river had proof that its chain of licensing rights was valid dating all the way back to the initial musicians and producers then umg could not be liable,because there is no liability for interference with an invalid business expectancy.
umg is only half right.although there can be no liability for interfering with a business expectancy that is invalid or illegal,the defendant has the burden to prove the invalidity or illegality of the business expectancy.umg can not obtain summary judgment based on the holes in rock river claim to a valid license when the validity of umg own licensing rights is equally spotty.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for trial.we also reject umg argument that we should affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the alternative basis of noerr pennington immunity.
factual background 
rock river is a producer,seller and distributor of music records.in,rock river entered into a licensing agreement with san juan music group,san juan,whereby san juan,in exchange for a licensing fee,granted rock river a nonexclusive license to sample or interpolate musical recordings the recordings performed by bob marley and the wailers marley.san juan is a music licensing company that,since,has been licensing recordings by marley through an agreement with lee perry,the producer of many of marley early recordings.
rock river invested its time and creativity into creating new remixes of the recordings the remixes,and it registered copyrights for the remixes.rock river partnered with an independent record label and created an album called roots,rock,remixed that included of the remixes.rock river secured digital distribution of the album on itunes and distribution of physical albums in stores.rock river also had plans with relativity media to use one of the remixes a remix of the song lively up yourself in the dear john motion picture and soundtrack.at this time,rock river was unaware that san juan authority to license the recordings was disputed by any entity.
in october,however,umg sent a letter to rock river claiming that umg owned exclusive licensing rights to all the recordings remixed on the album roots,rock,remixed and that rock river therefore could not release its album without a license from umg.umg,the largest record company in the world,claimed to have purchased the exclusive licensing rights from a company called jad records in.umg also began calling and sending letters to rock river business partners asserting that rock river album violated umg exclusive licensing rights to the recordings 
umg sent a letter to apple requesting that apple remove the album from the itunes store within seven days.the letter referred to previous phone calls to the same effect.
umg threatened to sue relativity if it used rock river remix of lively up yourself in the dear john film or soundtrack without licensing it from umg.
umg instructed rock river distributer,fontana a subsidiary of umg,to stop distributing physical copies of rock river album.
umg urged emi music group to withdraw from negotiations with rock river to distribute the album outside of north america.
as a result of these letters and phone calls,relativity decided not to use lively up yourself in the dear john film and soundtrack,apple pulled roots,rock,remixed from the itunes store and rock river distributors ceased distribution of the album.
ii.procedural background 
in january,rock river sued umg for wrongfully disrupting rock river efforts to make money from its album of remixes by falsely claiming to own exclusive licensing rights to the recordings.the district court dismissed rock river first few pleading attempts under the noerr pennington doctrine but after the district court permitted limited discovery,rock river was able to survive umg motions to dismiss the operative complaint alleged violations of the sherman act,and the clayton act,intentional interference with contract,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage iipea and misrepresentation in violation of f.on umg first motion for summary judgment,the district court dismissed all of rock river claims except for its iipea claim.
as the parties prepared for trial on the one remaining claim,umg used its motions in limine to pursue the following theory as part of its,rock river was required to prove that its business expectancy was valid in other words,rock river had to prove it was legally authorized to use all of the music on its album if san juan did not have the right to license one or more of the recordings,then its attempt to license such recording to rock river was invalid and thus,if san juan did not have licensing rights for all the recordings,then rock river use of the recordings was unauthorized by law,rock river had no right to distribute its album,and rock river lacked a lawful business expectancy with which umg could have interfered.in short,umg argued it can not be held liable for interfering with an illegal business expectancy,such as album sales of an album that violates copyright law.the ingenuity of this theory,although we ultimately reject it,is that it seeks to allow umg to prevail without requiring umg to actually establish that rock river album infringed on anyone licensing rights.instead,it casts the licensing rights issue as an essential part of rock river.
for nine of the tracks on rock river album,rock river proffered evidence directly supporting its claim that san juan obtained licensing rights from lee perry,the original producer of the recordings.for the other three tracks the three tracks,rock river could not uncover any documents directly illustrating how san juan obtained the right to license the recordings.rock river position is that san juan obtained a nonexclusive right to license the three tracks through an oral licensing agreement between san juan and lee perry.but on umg motion,the district court excluded as hearsay the testimony of san juan current president,michael chernow,who planned to testify that his father,now deceased,told him of a conversation with lee perry where the oral license agreement took place.
with the exclusion of this evidence,the district court held that rock river had no evidence that san juan was authorized to license the three tracks therefore,rock river had no evidence that it was legally authorized to distribute its album as a whole and thus,rock river did not have a valid,legal business expectancy with which umg could have tortiously interfered.the district court invited umg to file a second motion for summary judgment on this ground,which the district court granted.rock river filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.the district court then entered judgment for umg,but exercised its discretion not to award umg its costs as prevailing party.both sides timely appealed.
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see oswalt resolute,cir.
iv.discussion 
intentional interference with prospective economic advantage 
umg moved for summary judgment on the theory that rock river lacked admissible evidence to support each element of its iipea claim.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment on this basis.thus,our analysis begins with a determination of what elements constitute an iipea claim under california law.
to prevail on an iipea claim in california,the plaintiff must prove the following elements 
the plaintiff and a third party were in an economic relationship that probably would have resulted in an economic benefit to the plaintiff 
the defendant knew of the relationship 
the defendant intended to disrupt the relationship 
the defendant engaged in wrongful conduct 
the relationship was disrupted 
the plaintiff was harmed and 
the defendant wrongful conduct was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff harm.
judicial council of california civil jury instructions caci.umg argues that iipea claims also require proof of an additional element the validity or legality of the plaintiff business expectancy.we hold that this is not an element of an iipea claim.rather,the illegality of the expectancy is an affirmative defense that must be pled and proved by the defendant.
neither the california supreme court nor the california judicial council nor the leading treatise on california law requires a plaintiff to prove the validity of his expectancy as part of his.see pg e bear stearns,cal listing elements for iipea claims in california caci same witkin,summary of california law,torts ed supp.same.umg argument for the additional element relies primarily on steinberg moorad dunn,dunn,no.cv,wl.steinberg,an unpublished district court opinion,which discussed both an iipea claim and an intentional interference with contract claim under california law,stated that the interference claims required t he existence of a valid contract or economic relationship between plaintiff and the third party.wl,at emphasis added.the court listed the elements from ramona manor convalescent hospital care enterprises,which also discussed both iipea claims and intentional interference with contract claims.for the contract claim,ramona manor noted that the plaintiff had to establish a valid contract.see id.but ramona manor did not require the plaintiff to prove a valid or legal business expectancy for the iipea claim.see id.therefore,steinberg did not add an extra element.rather,discussing both iipea claims and intentional interference with contract claims,it simply acknowledged that the contract claim required a valid contract and the iipea claim required an economic relationship between plaintiff and the third party.wl,at.thus,the california state cases are in accord that the validity and legality of the expectancy are not elements that must be proved by the plaintiff.
to be clear,a plaintiff can not prevail on an iipea claim if its business expectancy is,in fact,unlawful.see restatement second of torts one who causes the nonperformance of an illegal agreement or an agreement having a purpose or effect in violation of an established public policy is not liable for pecuniary harm resulting from the nonperformance.but the burden of proving such unlawfulness rests on the party alleging illegality.both california and federal law assume that people act lawfully unless proven otherwise.federal rule of civil procedure provides that illegality is an affirmative defense to be pled in the defendant answer.see.in responding to a pleading,a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense,including illegality.and under california law,the validity,fairness and legality of private transactions are maxims of jurisprudence.see cal,see also mason peaslee,holding that despite some evidence that the contract was invalid,the presumption is that plaintiff acted lawfully and t he court was obligated to give plaintiff the benefit of these presumptions and could not draw the inference that plaintiff work was done in contravention of law.
in the analogous situation of contract disputes,the party who asserts the illegality of a contract bears the burden of proof on that point.see.capitols basketball club,barry,cir applying california law and holding that because the alleged illegality of the contract was not evident from the face of the contract,illegality is an affirmative defense and defendants have the burden of pleading and proof morey paladini,cal any one sued upon a contract may set up a defense that it is a violation of an act of congress,and if it is found to be so,that fact will constitute a good defense to the action.the burden ordinarily rests upon the party asserting the invalidity of the contract to show how and why it is unlawful citation omitted 
here,it is not at all clear that umg or any other entity holds exclusive rights to the marley recordings,such that rock river attempt to distribute and license its remixes would be an unlawful pursuit.although the lack of documentation may make it difficult for rock river to support its position that its chain of licensing rights from lee perry to san juan to rock river is valid,its iipea claim can not be defeated based on the alleged illegality of the expectancy unless umg affirmatively establishes that illegality.
we also disagree with umg contention that rock river had no evidence that san juan received a nonexclusive oral license for the three tracks from lee perry the district court properly excluded as hearsay the proffered testimony of san juan president michael chernow.but the affidavits from lee perry and san juan long history of openly licensing the three tracks provide at least some evidence that san juan was authorized to license all the recordings used on rock river album.the lee perry affidavits attest to a licensing agreement and a good relationship between perry and san juan.although the perry affidavits do not include the three tracks in their lists of recordings for which san juan was given a license,the affidavits refer to other recordings with marley,which,read in the light most favorable to rock river,could include the three tracks.and san juan has been openly licensing the marley recordings,including the three tracks,for years.during this time,san juan has licensed one of the disputed three tracks,trenchtown rock,to roughly companies,including to divisions of umg.san juan has never been sued for licensing the three tracks.
between the perry affidavits and san juan uninterrupted history of licensing the three tracks and accounting for them to perry,rock river has produced evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that perry gave san juan nonexclusive licensing rights for the three tracks.indeed,in light of the somewhat muddied history of licensing rights for the recordings at issue,the history and course of conduct of the relevant players could be the most reliable evidence,particularly where the documents are inconclusive.
it has not yet been established that rock river album roots,rock,remixed violated the exclusive licensing rights of umg or any other entity.and there remains a triable issue as to whether san juan has licensing rights to all of the underlying recordings or whether umg has the exclusive licensing rights to one or more of the recordings we therefore remand rock river iipea claim for trial.
noerr pennington doctrine 
in the alternative,umg argues that we should affirm the grant of summary judgment for a different reason immunity under the noerr pennington doctrine.the district court,however,found that triable issues of fact prevented summary adjudication of the noerr pennington defense,and we agree.
rock river iipea claim seeks to hold umg liable based on the letters and threats of litigation umg made to rock river business partners.under the noerr pennington doctrine,such material is immune from suit unles
