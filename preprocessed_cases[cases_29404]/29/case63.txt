this dispute over the concept for a television show presents the question of the extent to which the copyright act,et,preempts contract claims involving copyrightable property.plaintiffs appellants forest park pictures,hayden christensen,and tove christensen collectively,forest park developed an idea for a television series and created a writing that embodied it,known in the industry as a series treatment.forest park submitted its idea,first by mail and then in person,to defendant appellee usa network,a division of universal television network,usa network.forest park alleges an implied promise by usa network to pay reasonable compensation if the idea were used.the district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge held that the copyright act preempted a breach of contract claim based on idea submission,and granted usa network motion to dismiss.we reach a different conclusion.forest park adequately alleged the breach of a contract that included an implied promise to pay.because this claim is based on rights that are not the equivalent of those protected by the copyright act,it is not preempted.
background 
because forest park appeals from an order dismissing the complaint on the pleadings,we accept as true the facts alleged in the third amended complaint complaint.see hutchison deutsche bank sec,cir.in,forest park formulated a concept for a television show called housecall,in which a doctor,after being expelled from the medical community for treating patients who could not pay,moved to malibu,california,and became a concierge doctor to the rich and famous.forest park created a written series treatment for the idea,including character biographies,themes,and storylines.it mailed this written material to alex sepiol,who worked for usa network.
after sending the written materials,forest park requested a meeting between its representatives and sepiol.sepiol scheduled the meeting for the express purpose of hearing plaintiffs pitch their show.complaint.at the time,sepiol and usa network knew that o rs pitch creative ideas to prospective purchasers with the object of selling those ideas for compensation and that it was standard in the entertainment industry for ideas to be pitched with the expectation of compensation in the event of use.id.and,at the meeting,i t was understood that plaintiffs were pitching those ideas with the object of persuading usa network to purchase those ideas for commercial development.id.sepiol said that prior to hearing the idea for housecall,he had never heard of concierge doctors,or doctors who make house calls for wealthy patients,and thought it was a fascinating concept for a television show.id.over the course of the following week,sepiol and forest park exchanged further communications however,discussions soon ceased and no further contact between the parties ensued.
a little less than four years later,usa network produced and aired a television show called royal pains,in which a doctor,after being expelled from the medical community for treating patients who could not pay,became a concierge doctor to the rich and famous in the hamptons.forest park had no prior knowledge of royal pains,did not consent to its production,and received no compensation from usa network for the use of its idea for the show.
prior proceedings 
forest park pictures,located in california,and the christensens,residents of california and toronto,canada,brought a diversity action against usa network and universal television network,a new york corporation,for breach of contract.usa network moved under federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the copyright act preempted the claim and that the contract was too vague to be enforced.the district court held the claim preempted and dismissed the complaint without addressing the vagueness argument.forest park pictures universal television network,civ.cm,wl,at,dist.lexis,at may.forest park timely appealed the dismissal.
discussion 
this appeal presents two questions first,whether forest park breach of implied contract claim is preempted by the copyright act and second,if such a claim is not preempted,whether forest park adequately pleaded a claim under state law.we hold that forest park claim is not preempted and that the complaint pleads an enforceable contract under state law that survives a motion to dismiss.

preemption 
we first turn to usa network argument that forest park claim is preempted.section of the copyright act expressly preempts a state law claim only if i the work at issue come s within the subject matter of copyright and ii the right being asserted is equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright.b see barclays capital,cir.
subject matter requirement 
in order to be preempted,a claim must involve a work within the subject matter of copyright.a.copyright protection exists for original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression,but does not extend to an idea,regardless of the form in which it is described,explained,illustrated,or embodied.a,b.we have held,however,that works may fall within the subject matter of copyright,and thus be subject to preemption,even if they contain material that is uncopyrightable under section.see barclays capital,at basketball ass motorola,nba,cir harper row,publishers,nation,cir,rev on other grounds,d.see generally melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a b.in harper row,for example,the work at issue,president ford memoirs,contained uncopyrightable facts.at.nevertheless,we held that the factual content of the book did not remove the work as a whole indisputably a literary work of authorship,see a from the subject matter of copyright.harper row,at see also barclays capital,at.similarly,in briarpatch phoenix pictures,cir,we held that a novel fell within the broad ambit of the subject matter categories listed in section a despite containing uncopyrightable ideas.id.at.the scope of copyright for preemption purposes,then,extends beyond the scope of available copyright protection.
the reason for our broad interpretation of the scope of copyright preemption is that congress,in enacting section,created a regime in which some types of works are copyrightable and others fall into the public domain.see nba,at.in preempting certain state causes of action,congress deprived the states of the power to vest exclusive rights in material that congress intended to be in the public domain.see also harper row,at recognizing that it would run directly afoul of one of the act central purposes to allow the states to expand copyright protection to works congress deemed uncopyrightable.section preemption scheme functions properly only if the subject matter of copyright includes all works of a type covered by sections and,even if federal law does not afford protection to them.nba,at quoting procd,zeidenberg,cir.
the work at issue in this case is forest park idea for housecall,manifested in the series treatment comprising character biographies,themes,and storylines.this treatment and associated written materials are works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium.a.although forest park complaint does not allege that usa network took its actual scripts or biographies,the subject matter requirement is met because the complaint alleges that usa network used the ideas embodied in those written works.that the work contains within it some uncopyrightable ideas does not remove it from the subject matter of copyright.see briarpatch,at.moreover,because the ideas that are the subject of the claim were fixed in writing whether or not the writing itself is at issue the claim is within the subject matter of copyright.see nba,at see also montz pilgrim films television,cir en banc holding that an idea for a television show,once fixed in a tangible medium,fell within the subject matter of copyright wrench llc taco bell,cir holding that an idea for a character,conveyed in storyboards,scripts,and drawings,was within the subject matter of copyright.therefore,the first requirement for preemption is met.
equivalency requirement 
in order to establish preemption,usa network must also demonstrate that the complaint seeks to vindicate a legal or equitable right that is equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section.a.section gives copyright owners the exclusive rights,among other things,to reproduce a copyrighted work,to prepare derivative works,to distribute copies of the work to the public,and to display the work publicly.a state law right is equivalent to one of the exclusive rights of copyright if it may be abridged by an act which,in and of itself,would infringe one of the exclusive rights.harper row,at.but if an extra element is required instead of or in addition to the acts of reproduction,performance,distribution or display,in order to constitute a cause of action,there is no preemption.computer assocs.int l,altai,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
applying this extra element test,we have held numerous categories of claims to be not preempted,including trade secret claims,in which the plaintiff must show the defendant breached a duty of trust through improper disclosure of confidential material,id.at certain hot news misappropriation claims,because the plaintiff must show factual information,by the defendant,and a threat to the very existence of the plaintiff product,nba,at and breach of confidential relationship,in which the plaintiff must show an obligation not to disclose ideas revealed in confidence,smith weinstein,aff without opinion,cir.see also harper row,at in dictum,suggesting that conversion based on physical possession and control of a copyrighted work may not be preempted because such a tort involves acts qualitatively different from those proscribed by copyright law.by contrast,we have found a state law claim preempted when the extra element changes the scope but not the fundamental nature of the right.see,briarpatch,at holding an unjust enrichment claim preempted because,although plaintiff must prove enrichment,the essential nature of the claim remained the unauthorized use of a work fin,moody investors,cir holding that a misappropriation claim was preempted because the element of commercial immorality did not change qualitative nature of the right harper row,at holding that a claim of conversion based on unauthorized publication of a work was preempted because it is coextensive with an exclusive right already safeguarded by the act.
in this case,the issue is whether a particular breach of contract claim survives preemption.more specifically,forest park alleges that it entered into an agreement with usa network that required usa network to pay forest park for the use of its idea.see complaint.there are several qualitative differences between such a contract claim and a copyright violation claim.first,the copyright act does not provide an express right for the copyright owner to receive payment for the use of a work.it simply gives the copyright owner the right to prevent distribution,copying,or the creation of derivative works though,of course,the copyright owner may cede or all part of these rights for payment.see.second,a plaintiff suing for failure to pay under a contract must prove extra elements beyond use or copying,including mutual assent and valid consideration.third,a breach of contract claim asserts rights only against the contractual counterparty,not the public at large.as the seventh circuit explained in procd,a copyright is a right against the world.contracts,by contrast,generally affect only their parties strangers may do as they please,so contracts do not create exclusive rights.at.
a number of our sister circuits have accordingly concluded that at least some contract claims involving the subject matter of copyright do not contest rights that are the equivalent of rights under the copyright act,and thus are not preempted.see montz,at contract utopia provider,pro med clinical,cir express contract bowers baystate,applying first circuit law to an express contract in a software license wrench,at contract procd,at express contract in a software license car rental,computer assocs.int l,cir express licensing agreement taquino teledyne monarch rubber,cir express contract acorn structures,swantz,cir per curiam express contract see also nimmer c as a general rule,contract claims require proof of a significant extra element the existence of an actual agreement between plaintiff and defendant involving a promise to pay for use of disclosed ideas.that conclusion is the same,regardless of whether the particular claim at issue is labeled express contract or contract footnotes omitted.of course,preemption can not be avoided simply by labeling a claim breach of contract.a plaintiff must actually allege the elements of an enforceable contract whether express or,including offer,acceptance,and consideration,in addition to adequately alleging the defendant breach of the contract.
as long as the elements of a contract are properly pleaded,there is no difference for preemption purposes between an express contract and an contract.see,leibowitz cornell,cir under new york law,proof of an contract requires proof of the same elements as an express contract warner.int l television distribution golden channels,cir same under california law.there is,however,a significant difference for preemption purposes between contracts and contracts.theories of contract,or unjust enrichment differ significantly from breach of contract because the plaintiff need not allege the existence of an actual agreement between the parties.see corbin on contracts a contract implied in law is a fictitious contract a contract implied in fact is a true contract that arises from the tacit agreement of the parties.under these theories,the plaintiff need only prove that the defendant was unjustly enriched through the use of her idea or work.such a claim is not materially different from a claim for copyright infringement that requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant used,reproduced,copied,or displayed a copyrighted work.see briarpatch,at finding no extra element in an unjust enrichment claim see also wrench,at noting that there is a crucial difference between contracts and contracts because the latter depend on nothing more than the unauthorized use of the work nimmer b,unjust enrichment and preempted.
in this case,we need not address whether preemption is precluded whenever there is a contract claim,or only when the contract claim includes a promise to pay.compare montz,at holding that the element of mutual assent in a contract claim can by itself provide the extra element,with wrench,at holding that the promise of payment in a contract claim provides the extra element.see also nimmer c suggesting that a contract that does not purport to give the plaintiff any protection beyond that provided by copyright law itself would be preempted.here the complaint specifically alleges that the contract includes by implication a promise to pay for the use of forest park idea.see complaint alleging that it was understood when forest park met with sepiol they were pitching ideas with the object of persuading usa network to purchase those ideas for commercial development emphasis added id.usa network voluntarily accepted plaintiffs ideas knowing full well that plaintiffs had submitted those ideas in confidence and for economic gain,and with the clear expectation of payment in the event those ideas were utilized by usa network emphasis added.the alleged contract does not simply require usa network to honor forest park exclusive rights under the copyright act assuming the material at issue to be copyrightable it requires usa network to pay for the use of forest park ideas.a cla
