in march,los angeles magazine lam published the fabulous hollywood issue an article from this issue entitled grand illusions used computer technology to alter famous film stills to make it appear that the actors were wearing spring fashions.the sixteen familiar scenes included movies and actors such as north by northwest cary grant,saturday night fever john travolta,rear window grace kelly and jimmy stewart,gone with the wind vivian leigh and hattie mcdaniel,jailhouse rock elvis presley,the seven year itch marilyn monroe,thelma and louise susan sarandon and geena davis,and even the creature from the black lagoon with the creature in nike shoes.the final shot was the tootsie still.the american flag and hoffman head remained as they appeared in the original,but hoffman body and his red sequined dress were replaced by the body of a male model in the same pose,wearing a,silk evening dress and sandals.lam omitted the original caption.the text on the page identified the still as from the movie tootsie,and read,dustin hoffman is a drag in a silk gown by richard tyler and ralph lauren heels.
lam did not ask hoffman for permission to publish the altered photograph.nor did lam secure permission from columbia pictures,the copyright holder.in april,hoffman filed a complaint in california state court against lam parent company,capital,now abc,or abc.the complaint alleged that lam publication of the altered photograph misappropriated hoffman name and likeness in violation of the california common law right of publicity the california statutory right of publicity,civil code the california unfair competition statute,business and professions code and the federal lanham act,a.

lam replies that its challenged use of the tootsie photo is protected under the first amendment.we evaluate this defense aware of the careful balance that courts have gradually constructed between the right of publicity and the first amendment and federal intellectual property laws.landham lewis galoob toys,cir.
lam argues that the grand illusions article and the altered tootsie photograph contained therein are an expression of editorial opinion,entitled to protection under the first amendment.hoffman,a public figure must therefore show that lam,a media defendant,acted with actual malice,that is,with knowledge that the photograph was false,or with reckless disregard for its falsity.see new york times sullivan,d.because hoffman did not produce clear and convincing evidence that lam acted with actual malice,lam contends that all hoffman claims are barred by the first amendment.
the district court rejected this argument.first,it concluded that the magazine article was commercial speech not entitled to constitutional protection t he first amendment does not protect the exploitative commercial use of hoffman name and likeness.hoffman,d at.second,the court found that lam acted with actual malice,and the first amendment does not protect knowingly false speech.id.at 
commercial speech 
the district court concluded that lam alteration of the tootsie photograph was an exploitative commercial use not entitled to first amendment protection.we disagree.
commercial speech has special meaning in the first amendment context.although the boundary between commercial and noncommercial speech has yet to be clearly delineated,the core notion of commercial speech is that it does no more than propose a commercial transaction.bolger youngs drug prods,d quotations omitted.such speech is entitled to a measure of first amendment protection.see,greater new orleans broad.ass n,united states,d setting out test to evaluate constitutionality of governmental regulation of speech that is commercial in nature.commercial messages,however,do not receive the same level of constitutional protection as other types of protected expression.see liquormart,rhode island,d.false or misleading commercial speech is not protected.see florida bar went for it,d commercial speech receives limited amount of protection compared to speech at core of first amendment and may freely be regulated if it is misleading.when speech is properly classified as commercial,a public figure plaintiff does not have to show that the speaker acted with actual malice.see procter gamble amway,cir supreme court precedent prevents us from importing the standard into cases involving false commercial speech.
in many right of publicity cases,the question of actual malice does not arise,because the challenged use of the celebrity identity occurs in an advertisement that does no more than propose a commercial transaction and is clearly commercial speech.see,newcombe adolf coors,cir use of pitcher image in printed beer advertisement motors,cir use of basketball star former name in television car commercial waits,at use of imitation of singer voice in radio commercial white samsung elecs,cir as amended use of hostess identity in print advertisements for electronic products midler ford motor,cir use in television car commercial of rendition of song singer had recorded.in all these cases,the defendant used an aspect of the celebrity identity entirely and directly for the purpose of selling a product.such uses do not implicate the first amendment protection of expressions of editorial opinion.white,at advertisement in which spoof is entirely subservient to primary message to buy identified product not protected by first amendment.
hoffman points out that the body double in the tootsie photograph was identified as wearing ralph lauren shoes and that there was a ralph lauren advertisement which does not feature shoes elsewhere in the magazine.insofar as the record shows,richard tyler,the designer of the gown,had never advertised in lam.hoffman also points to the shopper guide in the back of the magazine,which provided stores and prices for the shoes and gown.
these facts are not enough to make the tootsie photograph pure commercial speech.if the altered photograph had appeared in a ralph lauren advertisement,then we would be facing a case much like those cited above.but lam did not use hoffman image in a traditional advertisement printed merely for the purpose of selling a particular product.insofar as the record shows,lam did not receive any consideration from the designers for featuring their clothing in the fashion article containing the altered movie stills.nor did the article simply advance a commercial message.grand illusions appears as a feature article on the cover of the magazine and in the table of contents.it is a complement to and a part of the issue focus on hollywood past and present.viewed in context,the article as a whole is a
