while answering a casting call for a amateur film does often lead to stardom,it also rarely turns an aspiring actress into the subject of a fatwa.but that exactly what happened to cindy lee garcia when she agreed to act in a film with the working title desert warrior.
the film writer and producer,mark basseley youssef who also goes by the names nakoula basseley nakoula and sam bacile cast garcia in a minor role.garcia was given the four pages of the script in which her character appeared and paid approximately for three and a half days of filming.desert warrior never materialized.instead,garcia scene was used in an film titled innocence of muslims.garcia first saw innocence of muslims after it was uploaded to and she discovered that her brief performance had been partially dubbed over so that she appeared to be asking,is your mohammed a child molester 
these,of course,are fighting words to many faithful muslims and,after the film aired on egyptian television,there were protests that generated worldwide news coverage.an egyptian cleric issued a fatwa,calling for the killing of everyone involved with the film,and garcia soon began receiving death threats.she responded by taking a number of security precautions and asking that google remove the video from youtube.
in all,garcia filed eight takedown notices under the digital millenium copyright act.see generally.when google resisted,she supplied substantive explanations as to why the film should be taken down.google still refused to act,so garcia applied for a temporary restraining order seeking removal of the film from youtube,claiming that the posting of the video infringed her copyright in her performance the district court treated the application as a motion for a preliminary injunction,and denied it because garcia had delayed in bringing the action,had failed to demonstrate that the requested preliminary relief would prevent any alleged harm and was unlikely to succeed on the merits because she granted youssef an implied license to use her performance in the film.
discussion 
while we review the denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,alliance for the wild rockies cottrell,cir,the legal premises underlying a preliminary injunction are reviewed de novo.a m records,napster,cir.in granting or denying a preliminary injunction,the district court must consider four factors a plaintiff likely success on the merits,the likelihood that irreparable harm will result if an injunction does issue,the balance of equities and the public interest.winter natural res.def.council,d.the district court found against garcia on the first two factors and did consider the last two 
likelihood of success on the merits 
garcia does claim a copyright interest in innocence of muslims itself far from it.instead,she claims that her performance within the film is independently copyrightable and that she retained an interest in that copyright.to succeed on this claim,garcia must prove not only that she likely has an independent interest in her performance but that youssef does own any such interest as a work for hire and that he does have an implied license to use her performance.
an independent copyright interest 
a film is typically conceived of as a joint work consisting of a number of contributions by different authors.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright at.garcia argues that she never intended her performance to be part of a joint work,and under our precedent she does qualify as a joint author.see aalmuhammed lee,cir.but just because garcia is a joint author of innocence of muslims does mean she does have a copyright interest in her own performance within the film 
whether an individual who makes an independently copyrightable contribution to a joint work can retain a copyright interest in that contribution is a rarely litigated question.see thomson larson,cir dismissing similar argument on procedural grounds see also david nimmer,address,copyright in the dead sea scrolls authorship and originality,hous.but nothing in the copyright act suggests that a copyright interest in a creative contribution to a work simply disappears because the contributor does qualify as a joint author of the entire work.a copyright protection subsists in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium.where,as here,the artistic contribution is fixed,the key question remains whether it sufficiently creative to be protectible 
google argues that garcia did make a protectible contribution to the film because youssef wrote the dialogue she spoke,managed all aspects of the production and later dubbed over a portion of her scene.but an actor does far more than speak words on a page he must live his part inwardly,and then give to his experience an external embodiment.constantin stanislavski,an actor prepares,elizabeth reynolds hapgood.that embodiment includes body language,facial expression and reactions to other actors and elements of a scene.id.at.otherwise,every shmuck is an actor because everyone knows how to read.sanford meisner dennis longwell,sanford meisner on acting.
an actor performance,when fixed,is copyrightable if it evinces some minimal degree of creativity no matter how crude,humble or obvious it might be.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d quoting nimmer on copyright c.that is true whether the actor speaks,is dubbed over or,like buster keaton,performs without any words at all.a noting pantomimes and choreographic works are eligible for copyright protection.it clear that garcia performance meets these minimum requirements.
aalmuhammed is to the contrary because it does not,as the dissent would have it,articulate general principles of authorship.dissent.aalmuhammed only discusses what is required for a contributor to a work to assert joint ownership over the entire work we hold that authorship is required under the statutory definition of a joint work,and that authorship is not the same thing as making a valuable and copyrightable contribution.at.aalmuhammed plainly contemplates that an individual can make a copyrightable contribution and yet not become a joint author of the whole work.id.for example,the author of a single poem does not necessarily become a of the anthology in which the poem is published.it makes sense to impose heightened requirements on those who would leverage their individual contribution into ownership of a greater whole,but those requirements do apply to the copyrightability of all creative works,for which only a minimal creative spark is required by the copyright act and the constitution.feist publ ns,at 
nor does midler ford motor,cir,speak to the problem before us.first,of course,midler is a copyright case at all it a right of publicity case that happens to discuss copyright in the context of preemption,not infringement.second,midler discusses the copyrightability of a performer voice not her performance.see at.a performer voice is analogous to her image,which we said is not a work of authorship under the copyright act.downing abercrombie fitch,cir.but that does answer the question of whether the artist creativity,expressed through her voice or image,is protected by copyright.just because someone voice its particular timber and quality ca be copyrighted,does mean that a performance made using that voice can never be protected.in fact,many vocal performances are copyrighted.see,laws sony music entm t,cir.
recognizing that garcia may have a copyright interest in her performance is the end of the inquiry.a screenplay is itself a copyrightable creative work and a film is a derivative work of the screenplay on which it is based.see gilliam am.broad,cir see also nimmer on copyright a.where,as here,an actor performance is based on a script,the performance is likewise derivative of the script,such that the actor might be considered to have infringed the screenwriter copyright.and an infringing derivative work is entitled to copyright protection.see a see also auto parts network,parts geek,llc,cir.
of course,by hiring garcia,giving her the script and turning a camera on her,youssef implicitly granted her a license to perform his screenplay.see effects,cohen,cir.this does mean that garcia owns a copyright interest in the entire scene she can claim copyright in her own contribution but not in preexisting material such as the words or actions spelled out in the underlying script.b see also auto parts network,at.garcia may assert a copyright interest only in the portion of innocence of muslims that represents her individual creativity,but even if her contribution is relatively minor,it is de minimis.see feist,at.we need not and do not decide whether every actor has a copyright in his performance within a movie.it suffices for now to hold that,while the matter is fairly debatable,garcia is likely to prevail.
as the above discussion makes clear,any analysis of the rights that might attach to the numerous creative contributions that make up a film can quickly become entangled in an impenetrable thicket of copyright.but it rarely comes to that because copyright interests in the vast majority of films are covered by contract,the work for hire doctrine or implied licenses.see jay dougherty,not a spike lee joint issues in the authorship of motion pictures under copyright law,ucla.here,google argues that garcia performance was a work made for hire or,alternatively,that she granted youssef an implied license to use her performance in innocence of muslims.
work for hire 
under the work for hire doctrine,the rights to garcia performance vested in youssef if garcia was youssef employee and acted in her employment capacity or was an independent contractor who transferred her interests in writing.see,b see also cmty.for creative non violence reid,d.
the term employee refers to a hired party in a conventional employment relationship,and the question of employment is analyzed under traditional principles of agency.reid,at.garcia case is a good example of why it is difficult to categorize an actor,particularly one in a small role,as a conventional employee.youssef hired garcia for a specific task,she only worked for three days and she claims she received no health or other traditional employment benefits.see id.at.as we recognized,this difficulty is why.specifically addresses the movie industr y,affording moviemakers a simple,straightforward way of obtaining ownership of the copyright in a creative contribution namely,a written agreement.effects,at.youssef did obtain a written agreement and garcia simply does qualify as a traditional employee on this record.
the dissent believes garcia was an employee primarily because youssef controll ed both the manner and means of making the film,including the scenes featuring garcia and youssef was engaged in the business of film making at the time.dissent.but there no evidence in the record that youssef directed the film or that he controlled the manner in which any part of the film much less garcia scene was shot.in fact,youssef has claimed only that he wrote the screenplay.
there nothing in the record to suggest that youssef was in the regular business of making films.reid,at.he held many jobs,but there no indication he ever worked in the film industry.and there no evidence he had any union contracts,relationships with prop houses or other film suppliers,leases of studio space or distribution agreements.the dissent would hold that youssef was in the regular business of filmmaking simply because he made innocence of muslims.but if shooting a single amateur film amounts to the regular business of filmmaking,every schmuck with a videocamera becomes a movie mogul.
implied license 
a license may be implied from conduct and arises where a plaintiff create s a work at defendant request and hand s it over,intending that defendant copy and distribute it.effects,at.we found an implied license where the plaintiff contribution to a film or other work would otherwise be worthless or of minimal value.id.at see also oddo ries,cir.that is the case here.garcia auditioned for a role in a particular film,was paid for her performance and had every reason to believe youssef would eventually release the film.without an implied license,the performance for which she was paid would be unusable.therefore,we agree with google that garcia granted youssef an implied license.
any such license must be construed broadly.if the scope of an implied license was exceeded merely because a film did meet the ex ante expectation of an actor,that license would be virtually meaningless.see foad consulting,azzalino,cir kozinski,concurring.a narrow,easily exceeded license could allow an actor to force the film author to the film in violation of the author exclusive right to prepare derivative works.see.or the actor could prevent the film author from exercising his exclusive right to show the work to the public.see.in other words,unless these types of implied licenses are construed very broadly,actors could leverage their individual contributions into de facto authorial control over the film 
nevertheless,even a broad implied license is unlimited.see oddo,at.garcia was told she be acting in an adventure film set in ancient arabia.were she now to complain that the film has a different title,that its historical depictions are inaccurate,that her scene is poorly edited or that the quality of the film is as she imagined,she would have a viable claim that her implied license had been exceeded.but the license garcia granted youssef was so broad as to cover the use of her performance in any project.here,the problem is that innocence of muslims is not an arabian adventure movie it that the film is intended to entertain at all.the film differs so radically from anything garcia could have imagined when she was cast that it ca possibly be authorized by any implied license she granted youssef.
a clear sign that youssef exceeded the bounds of any license is that he lied to garcia in order to secure her participation,and she agreed to perform in reliance on that lie.youssef fraud alone is likely enough to void any agreement he had with garcia.see samuel williston richard lord,a treatise on the law of contracts ed.but even if it not,it clear evidence that his inclusion of her performance in innocence of muslims exceeded the scope of the implied license and was,therefore,an unauthorized,infringing use.
the situation in which a filmmaker uses a performance in a way that exceeds the bounds of the broad implied license granted by an actor will be extraordinarily rare.but this is such a case.because it is,garcia has demonstrated that she likely to succeed on the merits of her claim.winter,at.
irreparable harm 
garcia argues that she suffers irreparable harm both because of the ongoing infringement of her copyright and because that infringement subjects her to continuing,credible death threats.irreparable harm is presumed in copyright cases.perfect,google,cir.therefore,garcia must show that the damage to her reputation and threats against her life constitute irreparable harm.
the district court found that garcia failed to make this required showing,primarily because she did bring suit until several months after innocence of muslims was uploaded to youtube.it true that a long delay before seeking a preliminary injunction implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.oakland tribune,chronicle publ g,cir.but this is so because a preliminary injunction is based upon the theory that there is an urgent need for speedy action and by sleeping on its rights a plaintiff demonstrates a lack of urgency.lydo,city of las vegas,cir quoting gillette ed pinaud.there no dispute that,here,garcia took legal action as soon as the film received worldwide attention and she began receiving death threats in other words,as soon as there was a need for speedy action.id.because the need for immediate action did arise until she was threatened,garcia was dilatory in bringing the lawsuit.
the harm garcia complains of is real and immediate.see city of lyons,d.she has provided unrefuted evidence that the threats against her are ongoing and serious,she has already been forced to take significant security precautions when traveling and she moved to a new home and relocated her business as a safety measure.although past injuries are sufficient to establish irreparable harm for purposes of an injunction,id.at,garcia has amply demonstrated that,absent an injunction,she continue to suffer concrete harms whether in the form of ongoing security requirements or actual harm to her person.
beyond establishing that she faces an imminent harm,garcia must show a sufficient causal connection between that harm and the conduct she seeks to enjoin such that the injunction would effectively curb the risk of injury.perfect,at.despite her understandable focus on the threats against her life,garcia has brought a copyright action.therefore,she needs to show that the harm she alleges is causally related to the infringement of her copyright.
she made such a showing.youssef unauthorized inclusion of her performance in innocence of muslims undisputedly led to the threats against garcia.google argues that any harm arises solely out of garcia participation in innocence of muslims and not out of youtube continued hosting of the film.but garcia has shown that removing the film from youtube will help disassociate her from the film message and that such disassociation will keep her from suffering future threats and physical harm.although google asserts that the film is so widespread that removing it from youtube will have no effect,it has provided no evidence to support this point taking down the film from youtube will remove it from a prominent online platform the platform on which it was first displayed and will curb the harms of which garcia complains.
it is not irrelevant that the harm garcia complains of is death or serious bodily harm,which the dissent fails to mention.death is an irremediable and unfathomable harm,ford wainwright,d,and bodily injury is not far behind.to the extent the irreparable harm inquiry is at all a close question,we think it best to err on the side of life.
balance of the equities and the public interest 
youssef lied to garcia about the project in which she was participating.her performance was used in a way that she found abhorrent and her appearance in the film subjected her to threats of physical harm and even death.despite these harms,and despite garcia viable copyright claim,google refused to remove the film from youtube.it hard to see how google can defend its refusal on equitable grounds and,indeed,it does really try.instead,it argues that an injunction would be inequitable because of the overwhelming public interest in the continued hosting of innocence of muslims on youtube.
the problem with google position is that it rests entirely on the assertion that garcia proposed injunction is an unconstitutional prior restraint of speech.but the first amendment does protect copyright infringement.eldred ashcroft,d.because garcia has demonstrated a likelihood of success on her claim that innocence of muslims infringes her copyright,google argument fails.the balance of equities therefore clearly favors garcia and,to the extent the public interest is implicated at all,it,too,tips in garcia direction.
this is a troubling case.garcia was duped into providing an artistic performance that was used in a way she never could have foreseen.her unwitting and unwilling inclusion in innocence of muslims led to serious threats against her life.it disappointing,though perhaps not surprising,that garcia needed to sue in order to protect herself and her rights.
but she has sued and,more than that,she shown that she is likely to succeed on her copyright claim,that she faces irreparable harm absent an injunction and that the balance of equities and the public interest favor her position.the district court abused its discretion in finding otherwise.
reversed and 
because the facts and law do not clearly favor issuing a preliminary injunction to garcia,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying garcia requested relief.as a result,i must dissent.
standard of review 
the majority opinion omits applying the requisite standard of review that is especially pertinent to garcia requested relief.mandatory preliminary injunctions,similar to the one issued today,are particularly disfavored.stanley of,cir.
different from the usual prohibitory injunction,a mandatory injunction goes well beyond simply maintaining the status quo pendente lite.id.internal quotation marks omitted.as an example,requiring a university to reappoint a faculty member whose contract had expired constitutes a mandatory injunction.see also,marlyn nutraceuticals,mucos pharma gmbh,cir t he affirmative step of recalling a product is also a mandatory injunction.in the instant dispute,garcia requests relief through a mandatory injunction.rather than asking to maintain the status quo pending litigation,garcia demands google immediately remove a film from youtube.therefore,her request must be subject to a higher degree of scrutiny because such relief is particularly disfavored under the law of this circuit.stanley,at.this higher degree of scrutiny requires courts to be extremely cautious and deny such relief unless the facts and law clearly favor the moving party.id.at internal quotation marks omitted,emphasis added.indeed,mandatory injunctions are not issued in doubtful cases.anderson united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
this standard importance must be appreciated in conjunction with the general standard with which this court reviews a district court decision to deny preliminary injunctive relief abuse of discretion.alliance for the wild rockies cottrell,cir.as a result,the majority may only reverse if it were illogical or implausible,united states hinkson,cir,for the district court to conclude that the law and facts did not clearly favor garcia,stanley,at 
given this standard,the majority errs in requiring google to pull the film from youtube at this stage of the litigation.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the law and facts did not clearly favor garcia.instead,the majority makes new law in this circuit in order to reach the result it seeks.we have never held that an actress performance could be copyrightable.indeed,t here is little case law or statutory authority as to the position of performers as authors of an audiovisual work under law.jay dougherty,not a spike lee joint issues in the authorship of motion pictures under copyright law,ucla.
ii.application of the winter factors 
garcia likely success on the merits of her copyright claim 
the district court concluded that it was unclear whether garcia had a copyright interest in her acting performance.the district court discretionary conclusion hardly appears illogical or implausible.
copyright interest 
a protected interest under the copyright act must be an original work of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression a.garcia does not clearly have a copyright interest in her acting performance,because her acting performance is not a work,she is not an author,and her acting performance is too personal to be fixed 
to be protected,garcia acting performance must be a work.id.congress has listed examples of copyrightable works,like architectural works,motion pictures,literary works,and pictorial or sculptural works.id.the nature of these works is significantly different from an actress individual performance in a film,casting doubt on the conclusion that the latter can constitute a work.see microsoft,cir the doctrine of noscitur a sociis counsels that words should be understood by the company they keep.
section of the act is also instructive,because it differentiates a work from the performance of it.it defines perform a work to mean to recite,render,play,dance or act it.emphasis added.given this provision,it is difficult to understand how congress intended to extend copyright protection to this acting performance.while congress distinguishes the performance from the work itself,the majority blurs this line.its position contemplates something very different from amalgamating independently copyrightable interests into a derivative work.see id.at b.
consistent with section,section b outlines that which is not given copyright protection.it states in no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea,procedure,process,system,method of operation,concept,principle,or discovery,regardless of the form in which it is described,explained,illustrated,or embodied in such work.id.at b.an acting performance resembles the procedure or process by which an original work is performed.id.therefore,i n no case does copyright protection extend to an acting performance,regardless of the form in which it is described,illustrated,or embodied in the original work.id.
in sum,a motion picture is a work.id.at a.a segment independently produced and then incorporated into a motion picture is also a work.see,effects,cohen,cir.however,the copyright act does not clearly place an acting performance within its sphere of copyrightable works.as a result,the law and facts do not clearly favor finding a copyrightable interest in garcia acting performance.
authorship 
like the work requirement,the copyright act also premises copyright protection on authorship.a.authorship is also a constitutional copyright requirement.see const.art.i,cl.burrow giles lithographic sarony.aalmuhammed lee is the most relevant case in this circuit on the question of authorship.cir.though the aalmuhammed court discussed authorship in the context of joint authors of a film which garcia does not claim to be,it articulated general principles of authorship that assist in analyzing garcia interest in her acting performance 
the aalmuhammed court explained that t he word author is traditionally used to mean the originator or the person who causes something to come into being.id.at.in other words,the author is the person with creative control.id.thus,an author superintends the work by exercising control.id.at quoting burrow giles,at alteration omitted.another framing by the court defined an author as he to whom anything owes its origin.id.at quoting burrow giles,at.an author might also be the inventive or master mind who creates,or gives effect to the idea.id.at quoting burrow giles,at.indeed,authorship requires more than a minimal creative or original contribution to the work.id.at citing burrow giles,at emphasis added these principles comport with the general rule,that the author is the party who actually creates the work,that is,the person who translates an idea into a fixed,tangible expression entitled to copyright protection.commty.for creative non violence reid,d.
in concluding that aalmuhammed was not a joint author of the film,malcolm x,the court found that he did not at any time have superintendence of the work,was not the person who actually formed the picture by putting the persons in position,and arranging the place,could not benefit the work in the slightest unless the director chose to accept his recommendations,and made valuable contributions to the movie,but that alone was not enough for of a joint work.aalmuhammed,at.
garcia contribution is less significant than aalmuhammed.she conceded in her complaint and affidavit that she had no creative control over the script or her performance.youssef provided the script,the equipment,and the direction.as a result,garcia was not the originator of ideas or concepts.she simply acted out others ideas or script.her brief appearance in the film,even if a valuable contribution to the film,does not make her an author.indeed,it is difficult to understand how she can be considered an inventive or master mind of her performance under these facts.
the majority dismisses aalmuhammed as inapposite,instead bolstering its conclusion with reference to acting manuals and treatises.see op.at.in so doing,it goes too far in attempting to distinguish aalmuhammed.first,the aalmuhammed court articulated general principles of authorship that it pulled from the supreme court case,burrow giles lithographic sarony.see,aalmuhammed,at burrow giles is still good law.burrow giles has nothing to do with joint works instead,the court interpreted author as featured in article i,section,clause of the constitution.see at.second,the majority one quotation from aalmuhammed,op.at,is taken out of context.the very next line in that opinion makes clear that copyright protection is premised on authorship,whether the work is joint or otherwise 
we hold that authorship is required under the statutory definition of a joint work,and that authorship is not the same thing as making a valuable and copyrightable contribution.we recognize that a contributor of an expression may be deemed to be the author of that expression for purposes of determining whether it is independently copyrightable.
aalmuhammed,at.finally,section a of the copyright act and article i,section,clause of the constitution both premise copyright protection on authorship.therefore,not only does the majority decline to apply the most relevant precedent in this circuit on the question before it,it also reads the authorship requirement out of the copyright act and the constitution 
even the commentators agree that aalmuhammed not only applies to garcia claim,but also forecloses her realization of a copyrightable interest in her acting performance.see,dougherty,not a spike lee joint,ucla.at under the judicially enhanced joint work requirements,an actress performance would be physically inseparable from other cinematic contributions.citing aalmuhammed,at lee,entertainment and intellectual property law under aalmuhammed,individual contributors will rarely qualify as joint authors.
the majority lauds an actress creative role in a film,op.at,but the practical impact of its decision must not be ignored.garcia role in the film is minimal.yet the majority concludes that she somehow created a work congress intended to protect under the copyright act.considering the number of contributors who inject the same or a greater amount of creativity into a film,the majority omission of any inquiry into authorship indeed creates an impenetrable thicket of copyright.op.at.meanwhile,though aalmuhammed interpretation of the copyright act has been debated in academic circles,it adopts a standard that promotes clarity in the motion picture industry.lee,entertainment and intellectual property law.
because garcia does not qualify as an author under aalmuhammed,the law and facts do not clearly favor protecting her acting performance under the copyright act.
lastly,the subject matter protected by the copyright act must also be fixed in a tangible medium of expression a.copyright preemption cases are instructive on the question of fixation.
for preemption purposes,the courts generally agree that the scope of the subject matter of copyright law is broader than the protection it affords.montz pilgrim films television,cir en banc see ex rel berge bd.of trs.of of,cir.in other words,the subject matter underlying a state law claim preempted by the copyright act may nevertheless not be protected by the copyright act.by implication,subject matter supporting a state law claim is definitely not protected by the copyright act.a number of cases from this circuit discuss subject matter akin to an acting performance and prove useful on the question of fixation 
in midler ford motor,bette midler sued ford for misappropriating her voice in a commercial,cir.although ford properly had a license from the song copyright holder,it paid someone to imitate midler in singing the song midler made famous.id.although ultimately holding for ford,the court rejected its argument that midler claim was preempted by copyright law.a voice is not copyrightable.the sounds are not fixed.what is put forward here is more personal than any work of authorship.see also sinatra goodyear tire rubber,cir.
in laws sony music entertainment,we distinguished midler from its facts in holding that the plaintiff claim was preempted by the copyright act,because sony was not imitating very special as the plaintiff might have sung it.rather,it used a portion of very special as sung by the plaintiff,cir.where sony had a license to the entire song,its use of a portion of it under that license could not be attacked outside the copyright laws.id.
