in hollywood,actors,directors,and writers,the jimmy stewarts,frank capras,and billy wilders who enrich our daily cultural represented by two groups of people agents and managers.agents procure roles they put artists on the screen,on the stage,behind the camera indeed,by law,only they may do so.managers coordinate everything else they counsel and advise,take care of business arrangements,and chart the course of an artist career.
this division largely exists only in theory.the reality is not nearly so neat.the line dividing the functions of agents,who must be licensed,and of managers,who need not be,is often blurred and sometimes crossed.agents sometimes counsel and advise managers sometimes procure work.indeed,the occasional procurement of employment opportunities may be standard operating procedure for many managers and an understood goal when talents,lacking access to the few licensed agents in hollywood,hire managers to promote their careers 
we must decide what legal consequences befall a manager who steps across the line and solicits or procures employment without a talent agency license.we hold that contrary to the arguments of personal manager marathon entertainment,marathon,the strictures of the talent agencies act,et act apply to managers as well as agents contrary to the arguments of actress rosa blasi blasi,while the labor commissioner has the authority to void contracts ab initio for unlawful procurement,she also has discretion to apply the doctrine of severability to partially enforce these contracts and in this case,a genuine dispute of material fact exists over whether severability might apply to allow partial enforcement of the parties contract.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
in,marathon and blasi entered into an oral contract for marathon to serve as blasi personal manager.marathon was to counsel blasi and promote her career in exchange,blasi was to pay marathon percent of her earnings from entertainment employment obtained during the course of the contract.during the ensuing three years,blasi professional appearances included a role in a film,noriega god favorite industry entertainment,and a lead role as luisa delgado on the television series strong medicine.
according to marathon,blasi reneged on her agreement to pay marathon its percent commission from her strong medicine employment contract.in the summer of,she unilaterally reduced payments to percent.later that year,she ceased payment altogether and terminated her marathon contract,stating that her licensed talent agent,john kelly,who had served as her agent throughout the term of the management contract with marathon,was going to become her new personal manager.
marathon sued blasi for breach of oral contract,quantum meruit,false promise,and unfair business practices,seeking to recover unpaid strong medicine commissions.marathon alleged that it had provided blasi with lawful personal manager services by providing the downpayment on her home,paying the salary of her business manager,providing her with professional and personal advice,and paying her travel expenses.
after obtaining a stay of the action,blasi filed a petition with the labor commissioner alleging that marathon had violated the act by soliciting and procuring employment for blasi without a talent agency license the labor commissioner agreed.the commissioner found marathon had procured various engagements for blasi,including a role in the television series strong medicine.concluding that one or more acts of solicitation and procurement by marathon violated the act,the commissioner voided the parties contract ab initio and barred marathon from recovery.
marathon appealed the labor commissioner ruling to the superior court for a trial de novo.see,subd.a buchwald katz cal d.it also amended its complaint to include declaratory relief claims challenging the constitutionality of the act.marathon alleged that the act enforcement mechanisms,including the sanction of invalidating the contracts of personal managers that solicit or procure employment for artists without a talent agency license,violated the managers rights under the due process,equal protection,and free speech guarantees of the state and federal constitutions.
blasi moved for summary judgment on the theory that marathon licensing violation had invalidated the entire personal management contract.blasi submitted excerpts from the labor commissioner hearing transcript as evidence that marathon had violated the act by soliciting or procuring employment for her without a talent agency license.blasi did not specifically argue or produce evidence that marathon had illegally procured the strong medicine employment contract.
the trial court granted blasi motion for summary judgment and invalidated marathon personal management contract as an illegal contract for unlicensed talent agency services in violation of the act,denied marathon motion for summary adjudication of the act constitutionality,and entered judgment for blasi.
the court of appeal reversed in part.it agreed with the trial court that the act applied to personal managers.however,it concluded that under the law of severability of contracts,because the parties agreement had the lawful purpose of providing personal management services that are unregulated by the act,and because blasi had not established that her strong medicine employment contract was procured illegally,the possibility existed that blasi obligation to pay marathon a commission on that contract could be severed from any unlawful parts of the parties management agreement.in reaching this conclusion,the court of appeal distinguished prior cases that had voided management contracts in their entirety yoo robi th,d waisbren peppercorn productions,th,d and in some cases expressly refused to sever the contracts yoo,at,d.
we granted review to address the applicability of the act to personal managers and the availability of severance under the act.
discussion 
background agents and managers 
in hollywood,talent agents act as intermediaries between the buyers and sellers of talent.regulation of attorneys,supra,cal.at.while formally artists are agents clients,in practice a talent agent livelihood depends on cultivating valuable connections on both sides of the artistic labor market.birdthistle,a contested ascendancy problems with personal managers acting as producers loyola ent,hereafter contested ascendancy regulation of attorneys,at.generally speaking,an agent focus is on the deal on negotiating numerous,engagements between buyers and sellers.conflicts in the new hollywood,supra.at.

personal managers,in contrast,are not franchised by the guilds.conflicts in the new hollywood,supra.at contested ascendancy,supra,loyola ent.at.they typically accept a higher risk clientele and offer a much broader range of services,focusing on advising and counseling each artist with an eye to making the artist as marketable and attractive to talent buyers as possible,as well as managing the artist personal and professional life in a way that allows the artist to focus on creative productivity.waisbren peppercorn productions,supra,th at,d cal.entertainment,hereafter entertainment commission report regulation of attorneys,supra,cal.at.personal managers primarily advise,counsel,direct,and coordinate the development of the artist career.they advise in both business and personal matters,frequently lend money to young artists,and serve as spokespersons for the artists.park deftones th,d.given this greater degree of involvement and risk,managers typically have a smaller client base and charge higher commissions than agents as they may,in the absence of guild price caps managers may also produce their clients work and thus receive compensation in that fashion.conflicts in the new hollywood,at talent agencies act,supra,pepperdine.at contested ascendancy,at,regulation of attorneys,at.
b.the talent agencies act 
aside from guild regulation,the representation of artists is principally governed by the act.the act roots extend back to,when the legislature passed the private employment agencies law and imposed the first licensing requirements for employment agents.buchwald superior court d.talent agencies act,supra,pepperdine.at regulation of attorneys,supra,cal.at.from an early time,the legislature was concerned that those representing aspiring artists might take advantage of them,whether by concealing conflicts of interest when agents split fees with the venues where they booked their clients,or by sending clients to houses of under the guise of providing employment opportunities.see stats,ch,prohibiting agents from,sending artists to house s of ill fame or saloons,or allowing persons of bad character to frequent their establishments talent agencies act,at regulation of attorneys,at.exploitation of artists by representatives has remained the act central concern through subsequent incarnations to the present day.see styne stevens,supra,cal th at,d.
in,the legislature considered establishing a separate licensing scheme for personal managers.see assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,assem.com.on labor,employment consumer affairs,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,entertainment com,supra,at.unable to reach agreement,the legislature eventually abandoned separate licensing of personal managers and settled for minor changes in the statutory regime,shifting regulation of musician booking agents to the labor commissioner and renaming the artists managers act the talent agencies act.stats,ch.
in,the legislature provisionally amended the act to impose a statute of limitations,eliminate criminal sanctions for violations of the act,and establish a safe harbor for managers to procure employment if they did so in conjunction with a licensed agent.former,as enacted by stats,ch,entertainment com,supra,at.it subjected these changes to a sunset provision and established the california entertainment commission entertainment commission,consisting of agents,managers,artists,and the labor commissioner,to evaluate the act and recommend to the legislature a model bill.former,added by stats,ch,repealed by its own terms.in,after receiving the entertainment commission report,the legislature adopted its recommendations,which included making the changes permanent and enacting a modest series of other changes.stats,ch,entertainment com,at com.on industrial relations,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,bill would implement entertainment commission recommendations in full.so the act has stood,with minor modifications,for the last years.
in its present incarnation,the act requires anyone who solicits or procures artistic employment or engagements for artists to obtain a talent agency license.in turn,the act establishes detailed requirements for how licensed talent agencies conduct their business,including a code of conduct,submission of contracts and fee schedules to the state,maintenance of a client trust account,posting of a bond,and prohibitions against discrimination,kickbacks,and certain conflicts of interest.no separate analogous licensing or regulatory scheme extends to personal managers.waisbren peppercorn productions,supra,th at,d.
with this background in mind,we turn to two questions not previously addressed by this court whether the act in fact applies to personal managers,as the courts of appeal and labor commissioner have long assumed,and if so,how.
ii.the scope of the talent agencies act application to managers 
marathon contends that personal managers are categorically exempt from regulation under the act.we disagree as we shall explain,the text of the act and persuasive interpretations of it by the courts of appeal and the labor commissioner demonstrate otherwise.
we begin with the language of the act.elsner uveges cal th,d.section provides in relevant part no person shall engage in or carry on the occupation of a talent agency without first procuring a license therefor from the labor commissioner.italics added.in turn,person is expressly defined to include any individual,company,society,firm,partnership,association,corporation,limited liability company,manager,or their agents or employees,italics added,and t alent agency means a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring,offering,promising,or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists other than recording contracts,subd.a.
the act establishes its scope through a functional,not a titular,definition.it regulates conduct,not labels it is the act of procuring or soliciting,not the title of one business,that qualifies one as a talent agency and subjects one to the act licensure and related requirements,subd.a.any person who procures individual,any corporation,any a talent agency subject to regulation,subd.a.consequently,as the courts of appeal have unanimously held,a personal manager who solicits or procures employment for his is subject to and must abide by the act.park deftones,supra,th at,d waisbren peppercorn productions,supra,th at,d see also buchwald superior court,supra,d at.deciding same issue under the act predecessor,the artists managers act.the labor commissioner,whose interpretations of the act we may look to for guidance see styne stevens,supra,cal th at,d,yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,has similarly uniformly applied the act to personal managers.see,sheridan yoches,tac,jones la roda group,tac,hall x management,tac.
as to the further question whether even a single act of procurement suffices to bring a manager under the act,we note that the act references the occupation of procuring employment and serving as a talent agency,subd.a.considering this in isolation,one might interpret the statute as applying only to those who regularly,and not merely occasionally,procure employment.see wachs curry th,d act applies only when the agent employment procurement function constitutes a significant part of the agent business as a whole.however,as we have previously acknowledged in dicta,t he weight of authority is that even the incidental or occasional provision of such services requires licensure.styne stevens,supra,cal th at,d,citing park deftones,supra,th,d,and waisbren peppercorn productions,supra,th,d.in agreement with these decisions,the labor commissioner has uniformly interpreted the act as extending to incidental procurement.see,gittelman karolat,july,tac,kilcher vainshtein,may,tac,damon emler,tac.the labor commissioner views are entitled to substantial weight if not clearly erroneous styne stevens,at,d,accordingly,we likewise conclude the act extends to individual incidents of procurement.
marathon offers two main arguments against the conclusion that it is subject to the act whenever it solicits or procures employment.first,it objects that the act title and contents reference only talent agencies and thus only talent agencies may be regulated under the act.see cal,art.iv,brunson city of santa monica,act whose title limits its scope to public officer liability may not constitutionally be interpreted to alter public municipal corporation liability.article iv,section sets out this state rule and,as relevant here,requires a statute shall embrace but one subject,which shall be expressed in its title.if a statute embraces a subject not in its title,only the part not expressed is void.from this,marathon reasons that the act title omits reference to regulation of personal managers,and to the extent it purports to regulate personal managers,it is thus void.
this is a misreading of the constitutional provision and the legislation.the rule is intended to prevent by the legislature,combining several proposals in a single bill so that legislators,by combining their votes,obtain a majority for a measure which would not have been approved if divided into separate bills.harbor deukmejian cal d.in turn,the requirement that the single subject of a bill shall be expressed in its title is to prevent misleading or inaccurate titles so that legislators and the public are afforded reasonable notice of the contents of a statute.see also homan gomez th,d rule intended to prevent unrelated provisions from sliding through unnoticed and unchallenged planned parenthood affiliates swoap d.rule intended to prevent legislators and the public from being entrapped by misleading titles to bills whereby legislation relating to one subject might be obtained under the title of another.
however,the rule is to be liberally construed to uphold proper legislation and not used to invalidate legitimate legislation.san joaquin helicopters department of forestry th,d accord,harbor deukmejian,supra,cal d at,metropolitan water dist.marquardt cal d,evans superior court cal.the legislature may combine in a single act numerous provisions governing projects so related and interdependent as to constitute a single scheme,and provisions auxiliary to the scheme execution may be adopted as part of that single package.harbor,at,quoting evans,at.the act title need not contain either an index or an abstract of its provisions.the constitutional mandate citation is satisfied if the provisions themselves are cognate and germane to the subject matter designated by the title,and if the title intelligently refers the reader to the subject to which the act applies,and suggests the field of legislation which the text includes.powers farms,consolidated irr.dist.cal d,see also city of whittier dixon cal d,to satisfy the constitution,title need only contain a reasonably intelligible reference to the subject to which the legislation is addressed lyons municipal court d.
here,the legislation and its title satisfy the california constitution.the legislation provisions pertain to a single subject,the comprehensive regulation of persons and entities that provide talent agency services.the title,quoted in full in the margin,identifies that subject and specifically references the existing comprehensive regulations that are to be modified the legislation defines talent agencies as those that engage in particular conduct thus,to the extent personal managers engage in that conduct,they fit within the legislation title and subject matter and may be regulated by its provisions.
second,marathon correctly notes that in,after much deliberation,the legislature decided not to add separate licensing and regulation of personal managers to the legislation.see assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,deleting new licensure provisions.the consequence of this conscious omission is not,as marathon contends,that personal managers are therefore exempt from regulation.rather,they remain exempt from regulation insofar as they do those things that personal managers do,but they are regulated under the act to the extent they stray into doing the things that make one a talent agency under the act 
iii.sanctions for solicitation and procurement under the act 
marathon procurement 
we note we are not called on to decide,and do not decide,what precisely constitutes procurement under the act.the act contains no definition,and the labor commissioner has struggled over time to better delineate which actions involve mere general assistance to an artist career and which stray across the line to illicit procurement.here,however,the labor commissioner concluded marathon had engaged in various instances of procurement,the trial court concluded there was no material dispute that marathon had done so,and marathon has not further challenged that conclusion.we thus take it as a given that marathon has engaged in one or more acts of procurement and that as the parties also agree marathon has no talent agency license to do so.
we also take as a given,at least at this stage,that marathon unlicensed procurement did not include the procurement specifically of blasi strong medicine role.blasi takes issue with this point,correctly pointing out that the labor commissioner found to the contrary,but under the act statutorily guaranteed trial de novo procedure,the labor commissioner findings carry no weight buchwald katz,supra,cal d at,and neither blasi separate statement of undisputed material facts nor the evidence supporting it establish that marathon procured the strong medicine role.thus,for present purposes we presume marathon did not procure that role for blasi.
finally,although marathon argued below that it fell within section,subdivision d safe harbor for procurement done in conjunction with a licensed talent agency,it has not preserved that argument here.accordingly,we assume for present purposes that the safe harbor provision does not apply.
b.the applicability of the doctrine of severability to contracts 
we turn to the key question in blasi appeal what is the artist remedy for a violation of the act in particular,when a manager has engaged in unlawful procurement,is the manager always barred from any recovery of outstanding fees from the artist or may the court or labor commissioner apply the doctrine of severability,to allow partial recovery of fees owed for legally provided services 
again,we begin with the language of the act.on this question,it offers no assistance.the act is the subject of the proper remedy for illegal procurement.
on the other hand,the text of civil code section is clear.adopted in,it codifies the common law doctrine of severability of contracts where a contract has several distinct objects,of which one at least is lawful,and one at least is unlawful,in whole or in part,the contract is void as to the latter and valid as to the rest.ibid.by its terms,it applies,the parties have contracted,in part,for something illegal.notwithstanding any such illegality,it preserves and enforces any lawful portion of a parties contract that feasibly may be severed 
under ordinary rules of interpretation,we must read civil code section and the act so as to,to the extent possible,give effect to both.see department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.cal th,fn,d,people garcia cal th,d.the two are not in conflict.the act defines conduct,and hence contractual arrangements,that are illegal an unlicensed talent agency may not contract with talent to provide procurement services,subd.a.the act provides no remedy for its violation,but neither does it repudiate the generally applicable and rule of severability.hence,that rule applies absent other persuasive evidence that the legislature intended to reject the rule in disputes under the act.
the conclusion that the rule applies is consistent with those of the labor commissioner decisions that recognize severability principles may apply to disputes under the act.in almendarez unico talent management,tac,a radio personality sought a determination that his personal manager had acted as an unlicensed talent agency.the labor commissioner concluded the manager had engaged in unlawful,that procuring employment was the manager primary role id.at,but stopped short of voiding all agreements between the parties in their entirety.citing and applying civil code section,the labor commissioner concluded that a agreement between the parties had both a lawful purpose repayment of personal expenses the manager had fronted for almendarez and an unlawful purpose payment of commissions for unlawful procurement services and should be partially enforced.almendarez,at.on numerous other occasions,the labor commissioner has severed contracts and allowed managers to retain or seek commissions based on severability principles without expressly citing civil code section 
until two years ago,court of appeal decisions under the act had neither accepted nor repudiated the general applicability of the severability doctrine in,in yoo robi,supra,th,d,however,the court of appeal considered whether to apply civil code section to allow a personal manager to seek commissions for lawfully provided services.it noted,correctly,that severance is not mandatory and its application in an individual case must be informed by equitable considerations.yoo,at,d.civil code section grants courts the power,not the duty,to sever contracts in order to avoid an inequitable windfall or preserve a contractual relationship where doing so would not condone illegality.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d.the yoo court of appeal concluded the windfall for the artist,robi,was not so great as to warrant severance.
in chiba greenwald th,d,the court of appeal also considered whether severance was available for an unlicensed who in that case alleged she had had a marvin agreement with her deceased musician.acknowledging she had acted without a license,the manager relinquished any claim to commissions,and the court of appeal thus was not presented with the question whether severance might apply to any management services that required no license.in light of the facts as pleaded,the court of appeal concluded equity did not require severance of any lawful portions of the marvin agreement from the unlawful agreement to provide unlicensed talent agency services.chiba,at,d.
neither chiba nor yoo robi,supra,th,d,stands for the proposition that severance is never available under the act.in contrast,the court of appeal here expressly concluded,as we do,that it is available.
more generally,the conclusion that severance is available is consistent with a wide range of cases that have applied the doctrine to partially enforce contracts involving unlicensed services.thus,for example,in birbrower,montalbano,condon frank superior court cal th,d,birbrower,a law firm licensed in new york,but not california,provided legal services in both states.the trial court and court of appeal invalidated the entire attorney fee agreement,but we reversed in part,explaining that under the doctrine of severability the firm might be able to recover the fees it had lawfully earned by providing services in new york,notwithstanding its unlicensed provision of services in california.id.at,d.likewise,in lindenstadt staff builders,th,d,an individual assisted a company in finding home health care businesses to acquire.the individual may have acted only as a finder with regard to some businesses,but may have crossed the line into providing broker services without a real estate broker license in other instances.the court of appeal explained that the provision of unlicensed services did not bar all relief on remand,the unlicensed individual could still recover for those services that did not require a broker license.id.at,d see also levison boas cal,severance doctrine applies to contract with unlicensed pawnbroker broffman newman d.unlicensed real estate broker may defend entitlement to compensation for services for which no license is required southfield barrett d.under equitable principles,unlicensed commission merchant entitled to partial recovery under contract.
blasi contends that even if severability may generally apply to disputes under the act,we should announce a rule categorically precluding its use to recover for artist advice and counseling services.she relies on three sources in support of this rule the legislative history,case law interpreting the act,and decisions of the labor commissioner.none persuades us that the legislature intended to foreclose the application of severability,as codified in civil code sections and,to contracts that involve illegal procurement,either generally or with regard to recovery specifically for personal manager services.
for legislative history,blasi relies on a portion of the entertainment commission report to the legislature.addressing whether criminal sanctions for violations of the act,temporarily suspended in,should be reinstated,the entertainment commission said the majority of the commission believes that existing civil remedies,which are available by legal action in the civil courts,to anyone who has been injured by breach of the act,are sufficient to serve the purposes of deterring violations of the act and punishing breaches.these remedies include actions for breach of contract,fraud and misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty,interference with business opportunity,defamation,infliction of emotional distress,and the like.perhaps the most effective weapon for assuring compliance with the act is the power of the labor commissioner,at a hearing on a petition to determine controversy,to find that a personal manager or anyone has acted as an unlicensed talent agent and,having so found,declare any contract entered into between the parties void from the inception and order the restitution to the artist,for the period of the statute of limitations,of all fees paid by the artist and the forfeiture of all expenses advanced to the artist.if no fees have been paid,the labor commissioner is empowered to declare that no fees are due and owing,regardless of the services which the unlicensed talent agent may have performed on behalf of the artist.these civil and administrative remedies for violation of the act continue to be available and should serve adequately to assure compliance with the act.entertainment com,supra,at.according to blasi,this passage demonstrates the entertainment commission endorsed voiding of contracts in all instances,and the legislature necessarily embraced this view because it adopted all of the commission proposals when it amended the act in.
we are not persuaded.the passage acknowledges what all parties the labor commissioner has the power to void contracts,that she is empowered to deny all recovery for services where the act has been violated,and that these remedies are available.but the power to so rule does not suggest a duty to do so in all instances.the labor commissioner is empowered to void contracts in their entirety,but nothing in the entertainment commission description of the available remedies suggests she is obligated to do so,or that the labor commissioner power is untempered by the ability to apply equitable doctrines such as severance to achieve a more measured and appropriate remedy where the facts so warrant.thus,we need not consider at length blasi further contention that these two paragraphs in the entertainment commission report accurately reflect the views of the legislature as a whole.even if so,they do not connote an intent that managers in proceedings under the act be deprived of the opportunity even to raise severability.
second,blasi relies on those court of appeal decisions that have voided contracts in their entirety,chiba greenwald,supra,th,d yoo robi,supra,th,d park deftones,supra,th,d waisbren peppercorn productions,supra,th,d.with the exception of chiba and yoo,discussed above,however,the decisions do not touch on when or whether the doctrine of severability should apply under the act as such,they offer no persuasive arguments in favor of reading the act as precluding application of civil code section 
finally,blasi relies on a long line of labor commissioner decisions that have denied personal managers any right to recover commissions where they engaged in unlicensed solicitation or procurement.see,cher sammeth,july,tac,sevano artistic productions,tac.but the fact this remedy is often,or even almost always,appropriate,does not support the position that it is always proper.the labor commissioner decisions cited above see ante,at suggest the labor commissioner historically has recognized she has the author
