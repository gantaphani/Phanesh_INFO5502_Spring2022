introduction 
this appeal requires us to determine whether appellant live gold operations,was a prevailing party entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees,pursuant to b,in view of the relief it obtained in its lawsuit to restrain the attorney general of the state of new jersey from her allegedly unconstitutional enforcement of the new jersey deceptive practices in musical performances statute truth in music act,stat.ann.to.at the tro hearing,the district court determined that live gold was likely to succeed on the merits of its constitutional claims and issued a temporary restraining order against the state.at the subsequent preliminary injunction hearing,the district court persuaded the state to adopt live gold interpretation,bound the state to its new position,and vacated the tro without granting further relief.later,the court granted the state motion to dismiss,concluding that live gold constitutional claims were moot in view of the parties agreement that t he constitutional disagreements in this case were resolved at the preliminary injunction hearing.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court erred in holding that live gold was not a prevailing party because it voluntar ily changed its interpretation of the truth in music act.accordingly,we will vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case for an order awarding reasonable attorney fees and costs and for the calculation thereof.
ii.factual background and procedural history 
live manages and promotes the music recording and performing groups known as the platters and the cornell gunter coasters,pursuant to licenses of unregistered trademarks by the same names.in august,the state learned that live gold had scheduled a concert of the platters and coasters groups at the hilton hotel in atlantic city,to begin on august.the state contacted live gold and informed it that its use of the trademarks the platters and the cornell gunter coasters might violate the truth in music act,which provides 
a person shall not advertise or conduct a live musical performance or production through the use of an affiliation,connection or association between the performing group and the recording group unless 
a the performing group is the authorized registrant and owner of a federal service mark for the group registered in the united states patent and trademark office or 
b at least one member of the performing group was a member of the recording group and has a legal right by virtue of use or operation under the group name without having abandoned the name or affiliation of the group or 
c the live musical performance or production is identified in all advertising and promotion as a salute or tribute or 
d the advertising does not relate to a live musical performance or production taking place in this state or 
e the performance or production is expressly authorized by the recording group.
live gold responded by providing the state with evidence of its ownership of common law unregistered trademarks in the groups names,asserting that the unregistered trademarks should be considered express authorizations under subsection e of the truth in music act.not satisfied that ownership of an unregistered trademark could comply with the truth in music act,the state advised the hilton that it could avoid liability under the truth in music act by ticketing and advertising the concert as a tribute or salute to the platters and coasters groups.the hilton complied.
on august,the day before the first hilton concert,live gold sued the state,seeking a tro and injunctive relief against its enforcement of the truth in music act.live gold argued,inter alia,that the state enforcement of the truth in music act conflicted with the lanham act,and violated live gold civil rights.
at the tro hearing,live gold explained that it had the right to conduct performances using its unregistered trademarks,and objected that the state actions caused the hilton to label their groups inaccurately as tributes or salutes.in response,the state argued that,because live gold unregistered trademarks did not constitute express authorizations under the act,the hilton concert must be billed as a tribute or salute.the district court found the state position to present a very serious problem,and explained 
that is not what live gold groups want to do.that is not what they say accurately describes them.so,in effect,the state is telling the hilton to advertise or publicize this event in a way which is not in accordance with the description which these promoters of the events say is accurate.
i think there is sufficient problem with the state position so that is a likelihood of success on the merits in this particular case.
t here may be substantial federal rights being impaired by the action of the state in this case,generally,under the statute important federal rights are at issue,both freedom of speech rights under the lanham act and private rights to nonregistered name.consequently,the temporary restraining order will issue.
that tro temporarily restrained and enjoined the state from interfering in any way with the hilton concert,and the marketing and promotion thereof.the hilton then resumed advertising and ticket sales without identifying the concert as a tribute.
on september,the parties returned to the district court for a hearing on the preliminary injunction.in its written submission prior to the hearing,the state argued that an unregistered trademark satisfied the truth in music act only if the performing group obtained express authorization from an original group member,included an original member,or denominated itself as a tribute or salute.the state contended that its interpretation of the act was consistent with the lanham act,the first amendment,and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.it also objected to live gold suit on jurisdictional grounds.
the district court began the preliminary injunction hearing by asking the state why it insisted on distinguishing between registered and unregistered trademarks why should they proceed on an equal basis,two valid trademarks in response,the state argued that because the lanham act accorded a rebuttable presumption of validity to registered trademarks,the state discrimination against unregistered trademarks was consistent with federal law.the district court repeatedly rejected this argument,explaining that the differences under federal law between registered and unregistered trademarks for purposes of validity did not authorize the state to discriminate against an unregistered trademark,once proven valid.there no reason for it,the court declared.nevertheless,the state continued to press its interpretation of the truth in music act.the district court again rejected the state position,stating,w ell,i fail to see it.
after rejecting the state arguments,the district court suggested that the state reconcile the truth in music act with the lanham act by interpreting subsection e to permit unregistered trademark holders to perform under their group names,without any additional requirements.the state capitulated,effectively adopting live gold interpretation of the act.incredulous,live gold objected that the state had made a degree shift in position.the court agreed,telling the state that the position in its brief was contrary to what i just understood you to say.in response,the state explained that its previous position was inadvertently put into the brief.the court then declared that the state would be bound by its new interpretation of the act.
live gold then moved for summary disposition,contending that it should win because the state had admitt ed the allegations in the complaint.the court demurred,observing that the state new position resolved the basic legal problem,which was an equal protection problem,a first amendment problem,and a due process problem.the court again took note of the state evolved position,but saw no need to go any further.the court then announced 
we have a statement by the state of new jersey as to what the meaning of this statute is insofar as it relates to common law trademarks,and i think we stated it.if there a valid common law trademark under the lanham act,and if whoever has possession of it can establish a right to that possession,he is to be she is to be treated in the same way as the holder of a registered trademark.now,no necessity say or give any tribute to anybody.so we have an agreement on that.
the court then vacated the tro,which had already expired by its own term s after days,and was directed primarily to the august performance at the hilton.having secured the state position going forward,the district court left open the option of continuing the consideration of the preliminary injunction but found no need to convert the tro to a preliminary injunction at that time.
by letter dated september,pryor cashman llp sought leave to move for an award of its attorney fees and costs incurred in representing live gold.the application was referred to a magistrate judge,who converted it to a letter motion.on december,the magistrate judge denied pryor cashman application,concluding that live gold was not a prevailing party under b because the state had voluntarily changed its position on the meaning of the truth in music act.
on january,plaintiffs appealed the magistrate judge order to the district court.on january,the state filed a motion to dismiss.the court addressed both issues in a hearing on march.
at the march hearing,the court first addressed the state motion to dismiss.seeking to identify any unresolved constitutional issues,the district court asked the state to confirm that e ven though literally,the truth in music act might be interpreted to exclude performing groups holding unregistered trademarks,it does really do so and you not interpreting it to do so.the state concurred,stating,t he position we took on september,in this courtroom,is the position we taking now.the court then obtained the agreement of all parties that the preliminary injunction hearing resolved live gold constitutional claims,and asked w hy should live gold complaint be dismissed,other than pryor cashman application for attorney fees after hearing live gold arguments,the court remained unpersuaded,explaining i just do know what else there is to address in effect,live gold won the case.
the court then turned to pryor cashman application for attorney fees.after hearing from live gold,the court asked,state,why should you be responsible for attorney fees in response,the state contended that a fee award was inappropriate because there was no past enforcement action and because it had never taken any position on the truth in music act.the court disagreed with the latter contention,reminding the state that it made a degree change in position because it came in negating everything that live gold was urging,and in effect conceded live gold was right,and permitted everything to go forward.the state again distanced itself from its initial arguments,explaining that they were not as clear as they could have been because the state was rushed in responding to the tro application.the court took the matter under advisement.
on april,the district court entered an order affirming the magistrate order denying live gold attorney fees and granting the state motion to dismiss.in its order,the district court held that live gold was not a prevailing party because the district court did not enter a preliminary injunction or any other order on the merits of the case.the district court also concluded that the state voluntarily changed its position,stating that,w hile it may be true that this court involvement aided in the resolution of the constitutional issues between the parties,the fact remains that the issues were not resolved as the result of a court order.the court additionally granted the state motion to dismiss,concluding that live gold claims were moot in light of the parties agreement that the preliminary injunction hearing had resolved all of live gold constitutional claims.in this appeal,live gold challenges only the district court denial of attorney fees.
iii.discussion 
pursuant to b,courts may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs in civil rights cases.notwithstanding the permissive language of the statute,this court has held that a prevailing party should recover an award of attorney fees,absent special circumstances.truesdell phila.hous,cir.we exercise plenary review over the question of whether a party was a prevailing party.id.
plaintiffs who succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit may be considered prevailing parties.hensley eckerhart,quoting nadeau helgemoe,cir.although the litigation need not progress to a final judgment on the merits,a party seeking prevailing party status must demonstrate a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human.a voluntary change in conduct lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.id.in other words,a plaintiff does not become a prevailing party solely because his lawsuit causes a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.people against police violence city of pittsburgh,cir.rather,the change in the parties legal relationship must be the product of judicial action.see buckhannon,at.
the crux of this appeal is whether the change in the legal relationship of the parties was brought about through action of the district court or through the voluntary conduct of the state.the state argues,and the district court agreed,that its change in position was voluntary.we conclude that the district court erred in reaching this determination.
at the tro hearing,the district court heard argument with respect to live gold claim that the state was enforcing the truth in music act in violation of its constitutional rights.the district court saw a very serious problem with the state interpretation of the act,which required holders of unregistered trademarks to identify their performing groups as tributes or salutes,and noted that the state position threatened to impair live gold substantial federal rights.after hearing argument from both sides,the district court found a likelihood of success on the merits and entered the tro.
at the subsequent preliminary injunction hearing,the state held fast to its original position that the truth in music act required holders of unregistered trademarks to obtain some form of express authorization to perform under their trademarked names.it was not until after the district court had rejected all of the state arguments and a preliminary injunction was imminent that the state made an in position,adopted live gold position,and was declared by the court to be bound by it.
in light of these facts,we hold that live gold obtained judicially sanctioned relief on the merits so that it was a prevailing party within the meaning of buckhannon,at.by virtue of the tro,the state was prohibited from enforcing its interpretation of the truth in music act,and live gold groups were able to perform without having to identify themselves as tribute groups.this alone may have been enough to confer prevailing party status,as the tro did more than preserve the status quo and arguably afforded live gold all the relief it sought.see lso,stroh,cir plaintiff became a prevailing party by obtaining a tro that did more than preserve the status quo by allowing the plaintiff convention and art exhibition to take place john.cnty.intermediate unit,cir a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo during the course of idea proceedings did not make the plaintiff a prevailing party.
yet the court involvement went far beyond its issuance of the tro.at the preliminary injunction hearing,the state initially persisted in its view that an unregistered trademark was insufficient to satisfy the truth in music act,absent additional authorization the court candidly disagreed,repeatedly rejecting the state argument that the act could constitutionally distinguish between registered and unregistered trademarks.against the court inimical questioning,and after spending several transcript pages defending its position,the state eventually acquiesced in live gold interpretation of the act.at the court request,the state agreed for the first time that a valid unregistered trademark constituted express authorization under subsection e,without any further requirement.the court then declared that the state would be bound by its new interpretation,which resolved the basic legal problem.later,when considering the state motion to dismiss,the court commented that live gold i n effect,won the case,as a result of the events at the preliminary injunction hearing.
here,live gold did not obtain relief solely because it filed a lawsuit,buckhannon,at,nor because the district court entered a tro that merely preserved the status quo,see john,at.in our view,the court effected a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties,buckhannon,at,by entering the tro,and later rejecting the state position on the merits,persuading the state to abandon that position,and declaring that the state was bound by its new interpretation of the act.the court active involvement impelled the state to make,in the court words,a degree change in position because it came in negating everything that live gold was urging,and in effect conceded they were right.in our view,the state change in position was a direct result of the legal process,people against police violence,at,wherein the district court examined both parties arguments and placed its judicial imprimatur on live gold interpretation of the act,buckhannon,at.see also palmetto,cnty.of dupage,cir where the defendant county repealed an ordinance only after and presumably because of the district court determination that the ordinance was unconstitutional,that repeal was exhibiting judicial imprimatur.based on these circumstances,we must reject the district court conclusion that the state change of heart was voluntary.
we also reject the district court conclusion that live gold obtained no relief on the merits.the district court issued the tro after determining that live gold had a likelihood of success on its underlying constitutional claims.live gold success was all but assured when the district court rejected the state interpretation of the truth in music act as inconsistent with federal law.only then did the state change its position,mooting live gold claim for a preliminary injunction by agreeing for the first time that an unregistered trademark could satisfy the act.given this sequence of events,we must reject the district court conclusion that live gold is not a prevailing party simply because a preliminary injunction never issued.see people against police violence,at the fact that plaintiffs achieved their success by litigating and enforcing a preliminary injunction rather than by proceeding to final judgment on the merits does not diminish the substance of their litigated victories.palmetto,at it would defy reason and contradict the definition of prevailing party under buckhannon to hold that simply because the district court abstained from entering a final order plaintiff somehow did not obtain a judicially sanctioned change.walker city of mesquite,cir plaintiffs received judicial relief entitling them to prevailing party status because,a lthough the permanent injunction sought by the plaintiffs was never granted,the appellate court ruled as a matter of law,that the remedial order was unconstitutional for precisely the reasons argued by the plaintiffs.although live gold did not obtain a preliminary injunction,it undeniably receive d at least some relief on the merits,buckhannon,at,when the district court sustained its interpretation of the act and bound the state to that interpretation.to conclude otherwise would profoundly elevate form over substance.
finally,we observe that,as a practical matter,the state unilateral actions mooted live gold claims just when it appeared that the district court would enter an order in live gold favor.however,even without such an order,in view of the concession that the district court finally obtained from the state on its interpretation of the truth in music act,we find it very clear that in the future the state will not treat holders of unregistered trade marks differently than it treats holders of registered trademarks.thus,even without the order,the court actions memorialized on the record the interpretation that the state will give to the complete relief that live gold sought.on these facts,we deem the state belated change of position insufficient to prevent an award of prevailing party attorney fees to live gold.
iv.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we conclude that buckhannon permits us to award b attorney fees under the circumstances of this case.accordingly,we will vacate the order of the district court and remand for entry of an order awarding fees and costs to pryor cashman and for the calculation of these fees and costs in a reasonable amount.
the issue in this case is whether a party has prevailed within the meaning of if that party obtains a temporary restraining order the day after it files suit after a hearing but before briefing from the opposing side,but days later is denied a preliminary injunction because the opposing party voluntary change of position moots the case.my colleagues say yes.because i believe that supreme court precedent requires us to answer no,i respectfully dissent 
governing precedent 
to be eligible to make a claim under,the plaintiff must,at a minimum,be able to point to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant.texas state teachers ass garland indep.sch,the supreme court so far has identified two such resolutions judgments on the merits,and consent decrees including settlement agreements enforced through consent decrees.buckhannon bd.care home,dep t of health human.
the first resolution contains two independent requirements a judgment that was on the merits 
a.the judgment requirement 
a grant of summary judgment or a trial verdict in favor of the plaintiff is no doubt a judgment.in contrast,a court judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the constitution does not create the requisite material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties until the plaintiff becomes entitled to enforce a judgment.farrar hobby.
thus,when an appellate court,in reversing the district court dismissal of the plaintiff claim,ruled that the plaintiff constitutional rights were violated,the supreme court held that the plaintiff had not prevailed because there was no enforceable judgment.hewitt helms.the only relief to the plaintiff from this appellate victory was the moral satisfaction of knowing that a federal court concluded that his rights had been violated.id.at.
b.the merits requirement 
any judgment must also be on the merits.as recognized by the supreme court shortly after was amended to allow attorney fees,congress intended to permit the interim award of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims.hanrahan hampton,per curiam emphases added see also id.at i t seems clearly to have been the intent of congress to permit such an interlocutory award only to a party who has established his entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims,either in the trial court or on appeal.similarly,the supreme court has observed that r espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail.hewitt,at citing hanrahan,at.
indeed,in an area of the law that has been framed in various ways,hensley,at,the requirement established in hanrahan and hewitt has been consistently repeated throughout the court prevailing party jurisprudence.see sole wyner,buckhannon,at,farrar,at garland,at.we thus have followed suit to hold that,to be entitled to prevailing party fees based on interim relief,relief must be derived from some determination on the merits.orange twp.bd.of,cir.
ii.live gold did not receive a judgment on the merits,and therefore was not a prevailing party 
a.the temporary restraining order was not issued on the merits 
in this case,we have one temporary restraining order.in people against police violence city of pittsburgh,f d cir papv,we held that injunctive relief can,under appropriate circumstances,render a party prevailing.id.at.
however,the merits requirement is difficult to meet in the context of tros and injunctions,as the plaintiff needs only to show a likelihood of success on the merits to be granted relief.because of this,we have held that a court finding of reasonable probability of success on the merits is not a resolution of any issue.john.county,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as this probability ruling is usually the only legal determination made when courts grant tros and preliminary injunctions,it follows that parties will not often prevail based solely on those judgments.
our decision in papv provides an example of that rare situation where a determination is made at the injunction stage.there,a rally organizer challenged the constitutionality of an ordinance that required groups to prepay police protection costs before they could receive a permit for parades and rallies.papv,at.at the first hearing in the case,the district court granted the requested tro after concluding that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional,and that,even if the city voluntarily did not enforce the ordinance as it had offered to do,a permit regime devoid of any prescribed process would also be unconstitutional.id.therefore,the court enjoined the city from enforcing the law,imposed its own temporary procedures governing permits,and directed the parties to meet and confer concerning a new proposal.id.at.the city later proposed a revised ordinance,but the court found it problematic,converted the tro to a preliminary injunction,and requested further briefing.id.at.
the city submitted a second revised ordinance,and in the meantime formally repealed the unconstitutional provision.id.after this repeal,the city moved to dismiss the suit.id.the court denied the motion because no new procedures had taken the ordinance place,and a lack of guidelines was itself unconstitutional.id.the injunction remained in effect for over two years until a new ordinance that satisfied the plaintiffs concerns was enacted.id.only at that point did the court lift the injunction and close the case with the parties agreement.id.
as this summary makes clear,the legal victories in papv are far from the events in the current case.the district court here never ruled,as did the papv court,that the challenged law or application of the law was unconstitutional.id.at.instead,the tro was based only on a likelihood of success on the merits.app.in papv,the tro prohibited enforcement of the challenged ordinance and affirmatively created new procedures to govern the city in the meantime.the tro in our case merely enjoined the state of new jersey from interfering in any way with live performances by plaintiffs respective groups at the hilton hotel in atlantic city,new jersey,and the marketing and promotion thereof.app.the state remained free to enforce the truth in music act so long as it did not interfere with the hilton performances.
therefore,the tro here was not.as such,it does not confer eligibility for prevailing party status.we must determine if anything occurred after the tro to resolve the controversy on the merits and render live gold the prevailing party under.
b.the state actions after the tro issued were voluntary,and no judgment was issued 
there was no judgment in this case except the tro because the state mooted the case at the preliminary injunction hearing by agreeing with live gold position.as noted,the supreme court has identified two formal resolutions that make a winning attorney eligible for a fee award enforceable judgments on the merits,and consent decrees.buckhannon,at.buckhannon characterized these two resolutions as examples of decisions that create the necessary material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.thus,there may be resolutions other than the two identified in buckhannon that warrant prevailing party status although the supreme court has yet to identify any.but even if they are merely examples,buckhannon precludes the events in this case from qualifying as a third form of resolution that can support prevailing party status.
under buckhannon,the state voluntary change of position does not make live gold a prevailing party 
some background is useful to understand the sea change caused by buckhannon in this area of the law.prior to that decision,the rule in most circuits was that a plaintiff was a prevailing party if it achieve d the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.id.at.this became known as the catalyst theory.id.
for example,we held that a plaintiff who could prove that the existence of the lawsuit accomplished the original objectives of the lawsuit without a formal judgment c ould be a prevailing party.baumgartner harrisburg hous,cir,overruled by buckhannon,at.we applied the catalyst theory to allow attorney fees when defendants voluntarily changed their behavior to eliminate the conduct.id.at.to support this theory,we relied in part on the policy consideration that if defendants could deprive plaintiffs of attorney fees by unilaterally mooting the underlying case by conceding to plaintiffs demands,attorneys might be more hesitant about bringing these civil rights suits,a result inconsistent with congress intent in enacting section.id.at.thus,we held that plaintiffs could be prevailing parties notwithstanding the absence of a judgment or consent decree so long as they accomplished the original objectives of the lawsuit.id.at.
were this the law governing us today,i would join my colleagues,as live gold accomplished its objectives by filing a lawsuit that catalyzed the state to change its position voluntarily.that there was no judgment or consent decree did not matter under baumgarter,and because the existence of the lawsuit accomplished the original objectives of the lawsuit,attorney fees would be warranted.id.at.
but buckhannon overruled baumgartner,and the latter is no longer the law.in buckhannon,the supreme court reiterated that theretofore it had only awarded attorney fees when the plaintiff obtained a judgment on the merits or a consent decree.at.it had not awarded attorney fees under the following circumstances where the plaintiff acquired a judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the constitution unaccompanied by judicial relief,id.at quoting hewitt,at emphasis in original where the plaintiff secured the reversal of a directed verdict,id.at citing hanrahan,at or where there was a nonjudicial alteration of actual circumstances,id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the catalyst theory was added to this list,as there is no judicially sanctioned change in the parties legal relationship.id.at.a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.id.
in so holding,the court considered the same policy argument we raised in without the catalyst theory defendants could unilaterally moot an action before judgment in an effort to avoid an award of attorney fees but was not swayed.buckhannon,at.thus,however persuasive that argument may seem,it can not influence our decision here.
to repeat,live gold obtained no judgment other than the initial tro,which was plainly not on the merits.at the preliminary injunction hearing,the state faced a highly skeptical district court.partway through that hearing,the state chose to agree with the position pressed by the plaintiff and,it appears,favored by the district court.as that agreement resolved the constitutional issues,the case was mooted.even if there are circumstances where a judgment on the merits or a consent decree is not required for status,buckhannon prevents the events in this case from qualifying.were i writing for the majority,my analysis would stop here.
the majority attempt to circumvent buckhannon 
my colleagues recognize that the state unilateral actions mooted live gold claims.op.at.this should end the analysis buckhannon holds that if the plaintiff achieves the desir
