this appeal presents the question,inter alia,of whether the lanham act and california common law right of publicity apply to events occurring in great britain.under the circumstances presented by this case,we conclude that such claims are not viable,and we affirm the judgments entered by the district court.
in,founding beach boy member brian wilson,who had written or most of the iconic beach boy hits,released a solo album called smile.wilson mounted a tour,with backup band,to support the album.it had been years since brian wilson had toured regularly with the beach boys.as part of settlement of earlier litigation,mike love,also a founding member of the beach boys,had acquired the right to use the beach boys trademark in live performances.he continued to tour as the beach boys with a varying lineup,playing hundreds of shows a year.
as part of a promotion campaign,the british newspaper the mail on sunday distributed a compact disc,consisting of brian wilson solo versions of beach boy songs,along with of his solo work,with approximately million copies of the paper.the cds were distributed in the united kingdom and ireland.approximately copies of that edition of the mail were distributed in the united states without the cd,including in california.
the cover of the distributed compact disc,entitled good vibrations,featured brian wilson,along with three smaller photographs of the beach boys.the small photographs of the group included a picture of mike love.the front page of the mail on sunday advertised the cd prominently,and included an image of the cd cover.in addition to sound recordings,the cd contained two videos of live performances by wilson band.
love was concerned that a second british invasion and wilson return to touring and recording would dampen ticket sales for the live performances of his touring group.thus,in response to the english promotion,love sued a variety of parties for their involvement in the promotion campaign.he sued wilson associated newspapers limited anl,the publisher of mail on sunday,a british company that licensed and recorded the compact disc sanctuary records group,the entity that owned the rights to the brian wilson recordings relevant to this case,as well as sanctuary records group ny,sanctuary music management,and sanctuary music productions,the sanctuary defendants jean sievers,the lippin group,and soop lcc,wilson managers and publicist david leaf,a writer and producer for wilson and melinda wilson,wilson wife.
the district court dismissed the complaint against and anl for lack of personal jurisdiction,and awarded sanctions to.it dismissed with prejudice three of the sanctuary defendants sanctuary records group ny,sanctuary music management,and sanctuary music productions,on the basis of their unopposed motion asserting that they had nothing whatsoever to do with the case.the court dismissed melinda wilson from the suit with prejudice,as love had not been given permission to add her as a defendant,and because the complaint alleged no facts that would support keeping her in the lawsuit.
the district court dismissed the claims for violation of california statutory and common law rights of publicity after holding that english law,which does not recognize a right of publicity,governed.it dismissed three lanham act claims,two for lack of standing,and one after finding that the reach of the statute did not encompass the claims.
the district court also dismissed four claims raised only against wilson,four claims against various defendants for interference with contractual relations and prospective economic advantage,and three copyright claims.because love claim of violation of california fair business practices law depended on the survival of the lanham act claims,and because his civil conspiracy allegation depended on the survival of at least one other claim,and that love had failed to allege acts that would constitute conspiracy,the district court dismissed those two claims as well.
over the course of the proceedings,love filed three complaints.in his first amended complaint,he alleged that he was domiciled in nevada.in his second amended complaint,he removed that line,and claimed to be an individual with a residence in california.the district court strongly admonishe d love for alleging to have a residence in california and,based on this legal nullity,claiming in papers that love is a california resident.emphasis in original.
love responded to criticism by the district court that he had failed to introduce any evidence that good vibrations had ever entered the market by filing a declaration by steven surrey that surrey had bought a copy of good vibrations on ebay because he thought it was an official beach boys product surrey affidavit.because of uncontested evidence that surrey was a close associate of love attorney and had fabricated his allegation that he was confused by the labeling of good vibrations,the district court never considered the surrey affidavit to have any evidentiary value,and entered sanctions against love counsel.
in response to some confusion as to whether and when a final and appealable judgment had been issued,the district court entered a stipulated final judgment on june.love timely filed a notice of appeal on july.on september,the district court granted the motions for attorney fees filed by eight defendants,including the sanctuary defendants.love appealed the attorney fees award on october.the two appeals have been consolidated.
after reaching settlement with many of the defendants in this case love continues to appeal the following issues dismissal of dismissal of the right of publicity claims dismissal of the conspiracy claim dismissal of the three lanham act claims and the related california unfair business practices claim and the award of attorney fees to the sanctuary defendants 
the central issue before us is whether american claims for relief can be asserted on the basis of conduct that only occurred in great britain.the defendants think not.love wishes they all could be california torts.
the district court dismissed from the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction,a decision we review de novo.schwarzenegger fred marin motor,cir.the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction is appropriate.id.where,as here,a motion to dismiss is based on written materials rather than an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts.id.uncontroverted allegations in the complaint must be taken as true,and conflicts over statements contained in affidavits must be resolved in the love favor.id.
where there is no applicable federal statute governing personal jurisdiction,the district court applies the law of the state in which it sits.la ligue contre le racisme,cir en banc california jurisdictional statute is coextensive with federal due process requirements.civ.pro.thus,the district court was permitted to exercise personal jurisdiction over only if had certain minimum contacts with california such that the maintenance of the suit d id not offend the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the parties agree that we should use the purposeful direction or effects test in this case.the effects test is satisfied if the defendant committed an intentional act the act was expressly aimed at the forum state and the act caused harm that the defendant knew was likely to be suffered in the forum state.id.at.where a defendant express aim was local,the fact that it caused harm to the plaintiff in the forum state,even if the defendant knew that the plaintiff lived in the forum state,is insufficient to satisfy the effects test.schwarzenegger,at.
here,did contact people in california regarding the promotion that would eventually lead to this law suit.however,those discussions did not enable or contribute to the promotion activities that actually gave rise to the law suit.the intentional acts that allegedly harmed licensing of the recordings and promotion of good vibrations on television and the directed entirely at markets in the united kingdom and ireland,and love does not argue differently see sinatra enquirer,cir finding jurisdiction because the misappropriation of sinatra name was one component of a series of ongoing efforts by the defendant to avail itself of the benefits of the california market.
because did not purposefully direct any of the relevant intentional acts at california,it was not subject to the jurisdiction of a court in that state.
the district court correctly dismissed love right of publicity claims using a choice of law analysis,an analysis we review de novo.apl.uk aerosols,cir.we also review the district court interpretation of state law de novo.evanston ins.oea,cir.we apply the clearly erroneous standard to factual findings that underlie the choice of law determination.downing abercrombie fitch,cir.
federal courts must apply state substantive law to state law claims,including the forum state choice of law rules.id.at.california applies the governmental interest approach to conflicts issues,including those involving right of publicity claims.id.under this approach,
the court examines the substantive laws of each jurisdiction to determine whether the laws differ as applied to the relevant transaction,if the laws do differ,the court must determine whether a true conflict exists in that each of the relevant jurisdictions has an interest in having its law applied,and if more than one jurisdiction has a legitimate interest the court must identify and apply the law of the jurisdiction whose interest would be more impaired if its law were not applied.only if both jurisdictions have a legitimate but conflicting interest in applying its own law will the court be confronted with a true conflict case.

although california recognizes both a statutory and common law right of publicity,and england recognizes neither,this is not a case of true conflict.see,bruce miner,cir citing tolley fry,gionfriddo major league baseball.california has no interest in applying its law to the conduct in question.none of the parties remaining in this suit is a citizen of california.the misappropriation in this suit occurred almost exclusively in the united kingdom and ireland,where millions of copies of the mail on sunday and good vibrations were distributed.see downing,at explaining that any misappropriation of the names and likenesses of hawaiian surfers occurred in california,where the catalogue containing their photos was distributed.at most,de minimus conduct occurred in california when a handful of copies of the paper were delivered without the cd,and a handful of copies of good vibrations were sent to wilson attorney in california.
love asserts that he is not an plaintiff because he owns property in california and has other commercial interests there.california right of publicity permit s celebrities to control the commercial exploitation of the celebrity likeness.comedy iii productions,gary saderup,cal see also lugosi universal pictures,cal bird,dissenting the right of publicity protects the intangible proprietary interest in the commercial value in one identity.california interest in applying the right of publicity extraterritorially is based on its interest safeguarding its citizens from the diminution in value of their names and likenesses.sinatra,at.brand menlove dodge,cir s tates have a strong interest in protecting their own citizens.love cites no case where california has recognized that injury relevant to a analysis is suffered anywhere other than the domicile of the celebrity or the location where the image is exploited 
even if love commercial interests in california did create a true conflict,england interests would be much more greatly impaired by a failure to apply english law.
in making its comparative impairment analysis,the trial court must determine the relative commitment of the respective states to the laws involved and consider the history and current status of the states laws and the function and purpose of those laws.mutual bank,fa,cal internal quotation marks omitted.o ne of the goals of that analysis is the maximum attainment of underlying purpose by all governmental entities.kearney salomon smith barney,cal internal quotation marks omitted.
although england does not recognize a right of publicity,it does provide celebrities with certain other limited protections against commercial misappropriation,including copyright,trademark,and the tort of passing off.alain lapter,how the other half lives revisited twenty years since midler global perspective on the right of publicity.intell.prop.see generally,julie king,the protection of personality rights for athletes and entertainers under english intellectual property law practical difficulties in relying on an action of passing off,sports law.additionally,while england does not recognize a right to privacy as such,it does provide stronger protections against defamation than the united states.see thomas mccarthy,rights of publicity and privacy ed explaining that england has never recognized a right to privacy raymond beauchamp,note,england chilling forecast the case for granting declaratory relief to prevent english defamation actions from chilling american speech,fordham,comparing american and english defamation law.thus,we agree with the first circuit that england has manifested a policy choice favoring unrestricted competition in the area of commercial exploitation of names and likenesses,at see also id.in the area of publicity rights,as in the areas of trademark,patent,and copyright,the law must balance the competing goals,on the one hand,of facilitating public access to valuable images,inventions and ideas and,on the other,rewarding individual effort.
even if california has an interest in protecting the right of an entertainer with economic ties to the state to exploit his image overseas,that interest is not nearly as significant as england interest in not regulating the distribution of millions of copies of a newspaper and millions of compact discs by a british paper primarily in the united kingdom.
love argues that the uniform single publication act uspa displaces the traditional analysis in media cases.as the california supreme court has explained,
t he rule was created to address the problem that arose with the advent of mass communication from the general rule in defamation cases that each time the defamatory statement is communicated to a third person the statement is said to have been published,giving rise to a separate cause of action.
christoff nestle usa,cal quoting shively bozanich,cal omission in christoff.the uspa advances the universal interest in avoiding a multiplicity of suits and assisting the orderly administration of justice motschenbacher reynolds tobacco,cir.but it does not displace the governmental interest test or have any other application to the conflict of laws question at issue in this case.see hartmann time,cir givens quinn,the single publication rule is not a rule.therefore,it has no application in the present context.
the district court correctly dismissed love lanham act claims.under the circumstances presented here,we conclude that the lanham act can not be applied extraterritorially to encompass acts committed in great britian.
as we have noted,love has the limited exclusive right to use the beach boys trademark in live performances.love has alleged that the use of the mark the beach boys on and to promote good vibrations,in conjunction with the inclusion of video recordings of live performances on the disc,infringed upon and diluted his interests in the trademark,and competed with his live band unfairly.sanctuary argues that because the creation,promotion,and distribution of good vibrations all occurred in europe,the lanham act does not apply in this case.we agree with sanctuary.
