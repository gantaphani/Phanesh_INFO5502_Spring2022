polygram holding,and several of its affiliates petition for review of an order of the federal trade commission holding polygram violated of the federal trade commission act.as detailed below,polygram entered into an agreement with warner communications,to distribute the recording of a concert to be given by the three tenors in.the two companies later entered into a separate agreement to suspend,for ten weeks,advertising and discounting of two earlier three tenors concert albums,one distributed by polygram and the other by warner.the commission held the latter agreement unlawful and prohibited polygram from entering into any similar agreement in the future.we agree with the commission that,although not a per se violation of antitrust law,the agreement was presumptively unlawful and polygram failed to rebut that presumption.we therefore deny polygram petition for review.
background 
here are the facts as found by the commission in its order and opinion of july.see in re polygram holding,docket ftc,wl,available at hereinafter,ftc op.the three carreras,placido domingo,and luciano on spectacular concerts coinciding with the world cup soccer finals in,and.polygram distributed the recording of the concert,which became one of the classical albums of all time.ftc op.at.warner distributed the concert album,which also met with great success.both albums remained on the classical list throughout,and.id.at.
in late polygram and warner agreed jointly to distribute the recording of the three tenors july concert.warner,which had the worldwide rights,retained the united states rights but licensed to polygram the exclusive right to distribute the album outside the united states,and the companies agreed to share equally the worldwide profit or loss on the project.ftc op.at.the agreement also obligated polygram and warner to consult with one another on all marketing and promotional activities for the concert album,but each company was free ultimately to pursue its own marketing strategy and to continue exploiting its earlier three tenors concert album without limitation.the agreement also provided that polygram and warner would collaborate on the distribution of any future three tenors album released through august.id.
representatives of polygram and warner first met in january to discuss marketing and operational issues.one of polygram representatives voiced concern about the effect of marketing the earlier three tenors albums upon the prospects for the concert album and suggested the two companies impose an advertising moratorium surrounding the release,which was scheduled for august.according to notes of their next meeting in march polygram and warner representatives agreed that a big push on the earlier albums should take place before november.after that meeting,each company instructed its affiliates to cease all promotion of the and three tenors albums for approximately six weeks,beginning in late july or early august.ftc op.at.
apparently warner overseas division did not get the message because in may it announced an aggressive marketing campaign,scheduled to run through december,to discount and to promote the album throughout europe.when polygram learned of this,it threatened to retaliate by cutting the price of its album.accusations then flew between the two companies about which had started the imminent price war.meanwhile,in june the promoter of the three tenors concert informed polygram and warner that the repertoire for the concert would substantially overlap those of the and concerts,which in the view of both polygram and warner executives jeopardized the commercial viability of the forthcoming concert album.ftc op.at.
by the time the three tenors performed in paris on july,polygram and warner had exchanged letters reaffirming their commitment to suspend advertising and discounting the and concert albums and agreeing the moratorium would run from august through october.about a week later,however,polygram senior marketing director,who had passed on the details of the agreement to polygram general counsel,sent a memorandum around the company stating,contrary to any previous suggestion,there has been no agreement with warner in relation to the pricing and marketing of the previous three tenors albums.warner followed suit on august,sending a letter to polygram repudiating any pricing or advertising restrictions relative to its album.at the same time,however,polygram and warner executives privately assured one another their respective companies intended to honor the agreement,and in fact the companies did substantially comply with the agreement through october.ftc op.at.
in the commission issued complaints against polygram and warner charging that,by entering into the moratorium agreement,the companies had engaged in an unfair method of competition in violation of of the ftc act.warner soon consented to an order barring it from making any similar agreement in the future.ftc op.at.polygram contested the charge and,after a trial,an administrative law judge ruled that polygram had violated and ordered polygram,like warner,to refrain from making any similar agreement in the future.
the commission affirmed the order of the alj.after first observing correctly that the analysis under of the ftc act is the same in this case as it would be under of the sherman act,ftc op.at,the commission revived the analytic framework it had first announced in re massachusetts board of optometry,which begins with the proposition that conduct inherently suspect as a restraint of is,conduct that appears likely,absent an efficiency justification,to restrict competition and decrease output is to be presumed unreasonable.ftc op.at.only if the competitive harm wrought by the restraint is not readily apparent from the nature of the restraint itself,or the charged party offers a plausible competitive justification for the restraint,must the commission,under this approach,engage in a more searching analysis of the market circumstances surrounding the restraint.id.at.
here the commission determined the agreement between polygram and warner to prohibit discounts and advertising for a time was indeed inherently suspect because such restraints by their nature tend to raise prices and to reduce output.ftc op.at.the commission then looked to polygram to identify some competitive justification for the restraint.id.at.polygram objected that the commission must first offer some evidence the agreement actually harmed competition.in any event,polygram argued,the agreement was justified because it prevented polygram and warner,as distributors of the and albums,respectively,from thereby other efforts to promote the album hence the restraints created an incentive for each company vigorously to promote the album and thereby increased output.the commission rejected that purported efficiency justification as legally insufficient.in the commission view,the moratorium agreement could not have had any such procompetitive effect but instead simply shielded the concert album from the competition of the two earlier albums.id.at.
observing that under the analytic framework of.board it could have stopped there,the commission nonetheless went on to rule that,even if polygram efficiency justification were cognizable,the facts simply did not support it,ftc op.at indeed,the commission found the moratorium had no effect upon the degree to which the companies promoted the album and did not make the joint venturers any more likely to release a future three tenors album.id.at.thus,upon closer inspection,the commission confirmed its initial conclusion that the moratorium agreement was an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of of the sherman act and,hence,an unfair method of competition in violation of of the ftc act.id.at.
ii.analysis 
polygram raises four objections to the decision of the commission first,the commission should not have rejected the justification as legally insufficient because the moratorium agreement had a legitimate,procompetitive purpose reasonably related to the joint venture.second,the commission was required to show the restraints actually harmed competition before it could require polygram to proffer a competitive justification.third,the commission findings concerning the competitive impact of the restraint were not supported by substantial evidence.finally,there is no danger the same conduct will recur,so the commission prohibitory remedy is unreasonable.
the commission findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.see c.the legal issues are for the courts to resolve,although even in considering such issues the courts are to give some deference to the commission informed judgment that a particular commercial practice is to be condemned as unfair.ftc.fed of dentists,d ifd.
the supreme court approach to evaluating a claim has gone through a transition over the last years,from a dichotomous categorical approach to a more nuanced and inquiry.in,just before the transition began,the court summarized its doctrine as follows 
there are two complementary categories of antitrust analysis.in the first category are agreements whose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their are illegal per se.in the second category are agreements whose competitive effect can only be evaluated by analyzing the facts particular to the business,the history of the restraint,and the reasons why it was imposed.
soc y of prof l eng rs ftc,d.
courts and commentators have recognized the inherent in each category.per se analysis,which requires courts to generalize about the utility of a challenged practice,reduces the cost of but correspondingly raises the total cost of error by making it more likely some practices will be held unlawful in circumstances where they are harmless or even procompetitive.see,arizona maricopa county med,d for the sake of business certainty and litigation efficiency,we have tolerated the invalidation of some agreements that a inquiry might have proved to be reasonable phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,ed observing that per se analysis dispenses with costly proof requirements,such as proof of market power,but consequently produces a certain number of false positives.the litigation cost but reduced cost of under the rule of reason,which requires an exhaustive inquiry into all the myriad factors bearing on whether the conduct is on balance anticompetitive or procompetitive.donald turner,the durability,relevance,and future of american antitrust policy,cal,see frank easterbrook,the limits of antitrust,when everything is relevant,nothing is dispositive litigation costs are the product of vague rules combined with high stakes,and nowhere is that combination more deadly than in antitrust litigation under the rule of reason.
since professional engineers the supreme court has steadily moved away from the dichotomous which every restraint of trade is either unlawful per se,and hence not susceptible to a procompetitive justification,or subject to one in which the extent of the inquiry is tailored to the suspect conduct in each particular case.for instance,the court did not hold unlawful per se an agreement limiting the number of football games each participating college could sell to television,which agreement was challenged in ncaa board of regents,d recognizing but declining to apply doctrine that h orizontal and output limitation are ordinarily condemned as a matter of law under an illegal per se approach or the refusal of an organization of dentists to provide to dental insurers,which was at issue in ifd,at.although this court has in the past stated that group boycotts are unlawful per se,we decline to resolve this case by forcing the federation policy into the boycott pigeonhole and invoking the per se rule citations omitted.compare,united states oil.per se unlawful and klor,stores,d group boycott per se unlawful.
at the same time,however,in ncaa and ifd the court did not insist upon the elaborate market analysis ordinarily required under the rule of reason to prove the defendant had market power and the restraint it imposed had an anticompetitive effect.see ncaa,at.rule of reason analysis unnecessary in light of district court finding price and output not responsive to demand ifd,at.while this is not price fixing as such,no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character of such an agreement.the court instead adopted an intermediate inquiry,since dubbed the quick look,to evaluate horizontal restraints of trade.see,areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law.
it would be somewhat misleading,however,to say the quick look is just a new category of analysis intermediate in complexity between per se condemnation and rule of reason treatment,for that would suggest the court has moved from a dichotomy to a trichotomy,when in fact it has backed away from any reliance upon fixed categories and toward a continuum.the court said as much in california dental association ftc 
the truth is that our categories of analysis of anticompetitive effect are less fixed than terms like per se,quick look,and rule of reason tend to make them appear.we have recognized,for example,that there is often no bright line separating per se from rule of reason analysis,since considerable inquiry into market conditions may be required before the application of any condemnation is justified.
rather than focusing upon the category to which a particular restraint should be assigned,therefore,the court emphasized the basic point that under the essential inquiry is whether the challenged restraint enhances competition.id.at.quoting ncaa,at.in order to make that determination,a court must make an enquiry meet for the case,looking to the circumstances,details,and logic of a restraint,id.at,which in some cases may not require a market analysis.the court continued 
the object is to see whether the experience of the market has been so clear,or necessarily will be,that a confident conclusion about the principle tendency of a restriction will follow from a quick or at least quicker look,in place of a more sedulous one.and of course what we see may vary over time,if analyses in case after case reach identical conclusions.
united states microsoft,declining to condemn per se tying arrangements involving platform software products because there was no close parallel in prior antitrust cases and simplistic application of per se tying rules carries a serious risk of harm.
in this case,as we have said,the commission analyzed polygram conduct under the legal framework it had devised in.board,which it maintains is consistent with the supreme court teaching of more than a decade later in california dental.ftc op.at.the.board analysis proceeds in several distinct steps first,the commission must determine whether it is obvious from the nature of the challenged conduct that it will likely harm consumers.if so,then the restraint is deemed inherently suspect and,unless the defendant comes forward with some plausible and legally cognizable competitive justification for the restraint,summarily condemned.such justifications,the commission explained,may consist of plausible reasons why practices that are competitively suspect as a general matter may not be expected to have adverse consequences in the context of the particular market in question,or they may consist of reasons why the practices are likely to have beneficial effects for consumers.id.at.
if the defendant does offer such an explanation,then the commission must address the justification in one of two ways.first,the commission may explain why it can confidently conclude,without adducing evidence,that the restraint very likely harmed consumers.id.at.alternatively,the commission may provide the tribunal with sufficient evidence to show that anticompetitive effects are in fact likely.id.at.if the commission succeeds in either way,then the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show the restraint in fact does not harm consumers or has procompetitive virtues that outweigh its burden upon consumers.id.at.
polygram argues the commission framework conflicts with supreme court precedent by condemning a restraint that is not per se illegal without the commission having to prove the restraint actua
