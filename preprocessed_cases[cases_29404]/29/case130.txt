facts and proceedings 
in june,mediasentry,a company retained by plaintiffs to investigate the infringement of their copyrights over the internet,identified an individual using a program to share digital audio files with other users of a network.the shared audio files included a number of plaintiffs copyrighted sound recordings.by tracing the user internet protocol address,plaintiffs ultimately identified harper as the individual responsible for the file sharing.
to ensure that each of the audio files was a downloadable file,mediasentry initiated a download of the entire group.the company captured screen shots showing all of the files that harper was sharing.it also captured the metadata associated with each file,which included the name of the artist and song.this information allowed plaintiffs to identify those sound recordings on which they held a copyright.mediasentry fully downloaded six of the audio files from harper shared folder.subsequent discovery indicated that harper had downloaded all of the files from the internet to the computer without paying for them,and that she had not copied,or ripped,any of the songs from compact discs that she had bought legally.
during discovery,plaintiffs examined harper computer.the examination showed that its operating system had been reinstalled in.as a result,most of the files present on the computer in,when mediasentry performed its investigation,had been overwritten.the forensic examination did show that three programs had been installed and used on the computer,including a program known as limewire,which had been used after the operating system was reinstalled.it also revealed a new cache of approximately recordings downloaded since the reinstallation.fifteen of the copyrights that plaintiffs second amended complaint alleged that harper infringed came from this newly discovered cache.
in august,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on their copyright claims for audio files.by agreement of the parties,the court also entered an injunction against harper.
the district court denied plaintiffs request for statutory damages.plaintiffs had requested the minimum damages of per infringed work set forth in c.harper asserted that her infringement was innocent under c,which provides that where the infringer sustains the burden of proving that she was not aware and had no reason to believe that her acts constituted an infringement of copyright,the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than.harper averred that she thought her actions were equivalent to listening to an internet radio station.the district court found that whether her infringement was innocent presented a disputed issue of material fact.
the district court denied each party motion for reconsideration.in doing so,it clarified its finding that harper infringed plaintiffs exclusive rights to both reproduce and distribute the songs on which they held a copyright.
reserving the right to appeal the district court legal conclusion on the innocent infringer issue if harper appealed,plaintiffs moved for entry of judgment in the amount of for each infringed minimum amount due from an innocent infringer.the court granted plaintiffs motion and entered judgment against harper.harper appealed,and plaintiffs.
harper argues that,for of the recordings,there was insufficient evidence of infringement because the audio files were not found on her computer.she also contends that she did not infringe plaintiffs copyrights by making available the audio files and that the copyright act statutory damages scheme violates due process.plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by failing to rule out the innocent infringer defense as a matter of law.

discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
harper argues that plaintiffs did not present sufficient evidence for the district court to find that of the audio files at issue existed on her computer.she does not contest the existence of the six audio files that mediasentry downloaded in full over the network in.she also can not contest the existence of the audio files that were part of the cache of approximately songs discovered on harper hard drive in.the issue,then,is whether plaintiffs made an undisputed showing that harper had downloaded the remaining audio files.
harper argument relies on the computer forensic expert inability to recover complete copies of the contested audio files when the expert searched her computer hard drive in.that inability was due to the reinstallation of the computer operating system,which overwrote most of the audio files present in.harper asserts that the forensic evidence is inconclusive and that a jury could find that the file remnants discovered in the examination were something other than downloaded audio files.
harper argument ignores the voluminous and undisputed evidence that she downloaded and shared the contested audio files.mediasentry screen shots of harper shared folder indicate that she was sharing the contested audio files from her computer in.mediasentry also initiated downloads of the audio files to verify their existence and recovered metadata from which it could identify the artist and song title of each file.
harper submitted no evidence that calls into question plaintiffs showing that she had downloaded the audio files.in her deposition,she did not deny that she had downloaded them.she also testified that she had not copied any of the recordings to her computer from compact discs that she purchased,and she acknowledged using a network and stated that she recognized some of the songs as music i listened to and may have downloaded to the computer.
the uncontroverted evidence is more than sufficient to compel a finding that harper had downloaded the files there was no evidence from which a could draw a reasonable inference that harper had not downloaded them or that they were something other than audio files.harper can not defeat a motion for summary judgment merely by claiming some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.thibodeaux vamos oil gas,cir quotation omitted.the district court properly rejected harper argument that the evidence of infringement was insufficient.
copyright infringement 
section of the copyright act grants copyright owners the exclusive right to do and to authorize,inter alia,the reproduction of the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords,the preparation of derivative works based upon the copyrighted work,and the distribution of copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership,or by rental,lease,or lending.plaintiffs second amended complaint contains one count,for copyright infringement.plaintiffs alleged that harper had violated their copyrights in two ways first,by reproducing the copyrighted audio files,and second,by making them available to others,which plaintiffs argue is tantamount to distribution.the district court found that the undisputed evidence showed harper had done both.
harper argues that making audio files available to others by placing them in a shared folder acces
