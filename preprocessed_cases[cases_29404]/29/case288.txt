the opinion filed may,is amended as follows 
on page of the slip opinion,at,after the sentence we hold that the contract is ambiguous regarding which party owns the right to exploit the citizen kane screenplay on home video,insert a footnote containing the following text 
in so holding,we do not adopt a presumption against applying a grant of rights in motion pictures to new technologies.instead,we simply interpret the written contract of the parties in this case,as our precedent instructs.see maljack,goodtimes home video,cir cohen,at see also boosey hawkes music publishers walt disney,cir holding that analysis should rely on neutral principles of contract interpretation and that the language of the contract governs.in some cases,a contract might permit the licensee to exploit the work in a new medium without a future technologies clause.for example,in maljack productions,we held that a licensee obtained the right to exploit certain music in a motion picture in a new medium when the license had no future technologies clause but granted the licensee any and all worldwide rights under copyright and otherwise to the music and musical composition recorded or contained upon the sound track of the picture.at alteration in original,internal quotation marks omitted.however,in this case,the production agreement,in addition to having no future technologies clause,granted rko only motion picture and television rights in the citizen kane screenplay while granting mercury broad,residual rights in the screenplay.it is thus not clear to us to whom the parties would have intended to grant the right to exploit the screenplay in new mediums.
with these amendments,the petition for rehearing is denied.no judge has requested a vote on the petition for rehearing en banc.the petition for rehearing en banc is denied.no further petitions will be entertained.
beatrice welles,the daughter of screenwriter,filmmaker,and actor orson welles,filed suit against turner entertainment,entertainment acquisition,and other persons not parties to this appeal collectively,the defendants,seeking a declaratory judgment that beatrice welles owns the copyright and home video rights to the motion picture citizen kane and seeking an accounting of the royalties she alleges she is owed from the profits of the motion picture.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.because there are triable issues of fact,we vacate in part and remand.
the district court disposed of this case by summary judgment,so we consider the facts in the light most favorable to beatrice welles.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
several separate contracts between orson welles,mercury productions,a production company owned by orson welles,and rko radio pictures,are integral to this case 
on july,orson welles,mercury,and rko signed two agreements.the first agreement,between mercury and rko the production agreement,provided that rko hereby engages mercury to produce,direct and write the screenplay for the two motion pictures hereinafter described,which are herein referred to as the pictures.
section of the production agreement determines who owns the fruits of the production agreement.that section begins 
rko shall own the negative and positive prints of each of the pictures and all rights of every kind and nature in and to each picture,and all parts thereof and all material,tangible and intangible,used therein,as soon as such rights come into existence,including,but not being limited to,the exclusive rights of distribution,exploitation,manufacture,recordation,broadcasting,televising other than in connection with the advertising or exploitation of a commercial product or service,and reproduction by any art or method,and the literary,dramatic,musical and other works included in such picture mercury agrees that it will have no interest of any kind in either of the pictures,except as in this agreement expressly provided.
section concludes with what the parties call the original story provision.the provision states 
in case of any original story written by mercury or any of its employees and used as the basis of either picture,however,rko shall acquire the motion picture and television rights in such story for such picture only.rko shall not remake any such picture unless mercury produces or directs the same or unless rko buys the remake rights from mercury at a price satisfactory to both parties.mercury shall own the publication,radio,dramatic and other rights in any such story but shall not use the same in any way to compete with or injure the distribution of the picture based on such story.
the second agreement entered into on july,between orson welles and rko the actor agreement,provided that orson welles would play the leading male role in the two motion pictures produced pursuant to the production agreement and that orson welles would receive compensation of plus a percentage of the net profits of the two motion pictures.
on december,orson welles and rko amended the actor agreement by providing that orson welles would act in a third film in addition to the two pictures already agreed upon.on january,mercury and rko entered into another supplemental agreement,providing that the first motion picture orson welles and mercury would make for rko would be based upon an original story,tentatively entitled citizen kane.
rko released citizen kane on may.by december,citizen kane had not turned a profit,the second film produced under the production agreement,entitled it all true,was not finished,and production had not commenced on the third film described in the supplemental agreement.to end their business relationship,mercury,orson welles,and rko entered into an agreement that terminated the production and actor agreements and their amendments the exit agreement.
signed on december,the exit agreement first outlined the prior agreements between the parties.it then stated 
all fixed compensation payable to mercury or welles for services in connection with the first two motion pictures has been paid in full.welles under the agreements of the parties is entitled,as contingent compensation,to twenty per cent of the net profits of the first two pictures as a unit.no net profits resulted from the sale and distribution of the first picture produced under the title citizen kane,and accordingly welles is entitled to no contingent compensation.
it is now the mutual desire of the parties to terminate and cancel each and all of the existing agreements between rko and mercury and between rko and welles,and to mutually release and discharge each party to each of said agreements from all rights,duties,liabilities and obligations thereunder and from all claims,demands and causes of action of every kind and nature of each party as against the other party.
the exit agreement also gave orson welles the option to purchase from rko for all of the film recorded for it all true.
beatrice welles complaint in this case asserted four claims.the first claim,seeking declaratory relief,alleged that the exit agreement restored to orson welles the copyright to the citizen kane motion picture and that,even if the exit agreement did not restore all of orson welles rights to citizen kane,the production agreement did not provide the defendants with the right to reproduce and distribute citizen kane on home video.the second claim,also seeking declaratory relief,asserted that the exit agreement only extinguished orson welles past claims against the defendants and did not extinguish orson welles right to collect of the profits from citizen kane in the future,and,alternatively,that the parties subsequently entered into a new agreement to share the income from citizen kane.the third and fourth claims sought damages for breach of contract and unfair business practices,respectively.
on december,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on beatrice welles first,second,and fourth claims,and for partial summary judgment on the third claim.on appeal,beatrice welles only argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her first a declaratory judgment that she owns the copyright and home video rights to the motion picture citizen on her second an accounting.
we review de novo the district court decision to grant summary judgment.olympic pipe line city of seattle,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.as noted above,in reviewing a motion for summary judgment,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and draw all justifiable inferences in favor of that party.anderson,at.
beatrice welles first argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact about who owns the right to distribute citizen kane on home video.before we address the merits of that argument,we must first decide whether beatrice welles claim of copyright ownership is barred by the statute of limitations.
a claim for copyright ownership is barred three years from the plain and express repudiation of copyright ownership.aalmuhammed lee,cir see b no civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.the defendants argue and the district court agreed that because beatrice welles knew since that the defendants were releasing a home video version of citizen kane,her complaint,which she filed in and in which she seeks a declaration that she owns the home video rights to citizen kane,is time barred.
however,the defendants point to no evidence that,before this litigation commenced,they plainly and expressly repudiated beatrice welles claim to ownership of the home video rights to citizen kane.the evidence the defendants cite as notice that they were exploiting home video rights in citizen kane is correspondence between the attorneys for the estate of orson welles and the defendants regarding the inclusion of the citizen kane screenplay in a home video collector edition gift set.while this might have informed beatrice welles that the defendants were distributing citizen kane on home video,it is not the plain and express repudiation of copyright ownership that our case law requires for the statute of limitations on a copyright ownership claim to begin running.see zuill shanahan,cir explaining that claims of copyright accrue when plain and express repudiation of is communicated to the claimant.beatrice welles claim is not time barred.
we next turn to the merits of beatrice welles claim that she owns the copyright to citizen kane on home video.her complaint sought a declaration that she alone owns all publication,radio,dramatic,home video and other rights in the story of citizen kane and that mercury did not grant to rko any right to exploit through home video devices sold to the public,the story of citizen kane as expressed in the screenplay and as embodied in the motion picture produced by mercury of the same name.citizen kane was an original story written by mercury.thus,whether rko or beatrice welles owns the home video rights to citizen kane turns on an interpretation of section of the production agreement.
because the production agreement contains a new york choice of law provision,we apply new york principles of contract interpretation in deciding this issue.while our task in a contract case is usually to give effect to terms of the contract as the parties understood them,see cromwell towers redevelopment city of yonkers,hartford accident indem.wesolowski,hopkins.life ins,in this case it is unlikely that,in,mercury or rko gave any thought to who would own the home video rights to citizen kane.in such a case,we look for the meaning that reasonable persons in the positions of the parties would have attached had they thought about the matter.see allen farnsworth,contracts ed.as one new york court has explained 
f aced with what may be a failure to anticipate the future situation which arose,a court is faced not so much with the function of interpreting language as the parties intended,for their intention was incomplete,but of construing the language to accord with what would have been the intention and the honorable agreement of the parties if their attention had been drawn to the possible events as they actually were to occur.

in interpreting the production agreement,we first determine whether its language is ambiguous or reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.if the language is unambiguous,we give effect to its plain meaning.nichols nichols.if the language is ambiguous,or susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,we may consider extrinsic evidence in interpreting the agreement.hartford accident indem,at.the interpretation of a contract is a question of law that we may decide unless the interpretation depends on the credibility of extrinsic evidence,in which case the interpretation of the contract is the task of the factfinder.mallad constr.county fed.savs.loan ass n.
to display publicly or distribute citizen kane,the defendants need two rights first,the defendants need the right to display the motion picture.second,because a motion picture is derived from its underlying screenplay,the defendants need the right to exploit the screenplay.
in this case,the first paragraph of section deals with the first right the defendants need to distribute citizen kane on home right to display the motion picture.section gives rko all rights of every kind and nature including,but not being limited to,the exclusive rights of distribution,exploitation,manufacture,recordation and reproduction by any art or method in the motion pictures produced under the production agreement.this tells us that,as a general matter,the defendants,as successors to rko,have the right to exploit in any manner the motion pictures produced pursuant to the production agreement,including citizen kane.
however,to distribute citizen kane on home video,the defendants still need the right to exploit the screenplay from which the citizen kane motion picture was derived.the original story provision deals with this issue.as noted above,the provision states that mercury retained the rights to any screenplay written by mercury or its employees.so,in order to allow rko to display motion pictures derived from those screenplays,the production agreement provided rko with certain rights in the original stories on which those motion pictures were based.specifically,rko acquired the motion picture and television rights in such stor ies for such picture s only,and mercury reserved ownership of the publication,radio,dramatic and other rights in those original stories.
thus,the question before us is whether the defendants motion picture and television rights in the citizen kane screenplay encompass the right to distribute the citizen kane screenplay on home video.on one hand,a reasonable argument can be made that distributing a motion picture on home video is simply an exploitation of the defendants motion picture rights in the citizen kane screenplay.on the other hand,such a broad interpretation would render the additional grant of television rights to the defendants superfluous because if motion picture rights encompassed home video rights,motion picture rights could also be argued to encompass the right to display citizen kane on television.thus,it seems to us unclear whether the parties would have intended rko motion picture and television rights in the citizen kane screenplay to include the right to exploit the citizen kane screenplay in home video form.
we dealt with a similar situation in cohen paramount pictures,cir.in that case,in,a composer granted a license to the producer of a motion picture to use the composer copyrighted music for a the exhibition of said motion picture to audiences in motion picture theatres and other places of public entertainment where motion pictures are customarily exhibited and b the
