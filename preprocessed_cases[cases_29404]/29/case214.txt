rodriguez claims under the act 
there have been several permutations of rodriguez claims against various sony entities premised on the provisions of the act.in his original class action complaint,rodriguez alleged that sony computer,as a video service provider,violated the act by maintaining and storing its customers personal information rather than destroying the information no later than one year after it was collected.rodriguez averred that,in,he was a registered user of sony playstation network,which provides online gaming and video services streamed to a customer television.rodriguez rented and purchased several video games and movies through the playstation network in,but did not purchase or rent any movies after sony modified its streaming system in april.according to rodriguez,sony continued to store his personal information relating to the movies that he had rented and purchased in violation of the act time limits for the storage of such information.based on these allegations,rodriguez sought statutory and punitive damages,as well as injunctive relief and attorneys fees.
sony sought dismissal of rodriguez complaint on the basis that rodriguez lacked standing to pursue his claims under the act,and failed to properly allege any.sony also maintained that rodriguez consented to sony retention of his information pursuant to sony terms of service and privacy policy.
in response,rodriguez filed a first amended class action complaint adding sony network as a defendant,and ten john doe defendants.rodriguez asserted that,subsequent to his registration as a playstation network customer,sony network assumed control over the playstation network and its related services.rodriguez alleged that sony computer and sony network violated the act when they impermissibly shared rodriguez personal information with each other during the change in sony operations.
rodriguez also alleged that sony network utilization of his personal information for marketing purposes and demographic studies demonstrated that his personal information had monetary value and that he never entered into an agreement permitting use of his personal information for these purposes.rodriguez sought damages and injunctive relief.
sony filed a motion to dismiss rodriguez first amended complaint,which the district court granted.the district court dismissed with prejudice rodriguez claim premised on retention of his personal information because the act does not provide a private right of action for retention of information.the district court also dismissed with prejudice rodriguez unlawful disclosure claim because the act permits disclosure of personal information between related corporate entities during the ordinary course of business.the district court held that the disclosures by sony computer and sony network were permitted because the disclosures occurred during the transfer of operations.the district court also concluded that rodriguez failed to allege any unlawful disclosures to the doe defendants.the district court dismissed rodriguez unlawful disclosure claim with prejudice as it related to sony computer and sony network,but granted leave to amend regarding the doe defendants.
despite the limitations imposed by the district court dismissal order,rodriguez filed a second amended class action complaint with significantly revamped claims.rodriguez alleged that,between and,he rented movies from sony computer,but had not rented or purchased any movies since august.rodriguez averred that,although sony network assumed management over the playstation network in,the change in management did not involve any transfer of ownership according to rodriguez,sony computer disclosure of his personal information occurred prior to the change in management.
rodriguez original claim based on violations of the act was restated as three claims premised on unlawful retention,unlawful disclosure,and a newly minted breach of contract claim.in support of his claim for unlawful retention,rodriguez alleged that sony computer and sony network retained his personal information for an indefinite period of time in violation of the act and lacked policies for the timely destruction of this information.rodriguez asserted that he was injured because the unlawful retention was a violation of his privacy rights and he suffered economic damages stemming from sony unauthorized use of his personal information.according to the complaint,rodriguez incurred monetary damages because a portion of the purchase price for each movie or video game was intended to pay for sony computer costs in timely destroying customers personal information rodriguez alleged that he overpaid for his movie purchases because the purchase or rental prices included costs associated with compliance with the act.rodriguez also asserted that he was entitled to relief pursuant to the stored communications act for sony willful and intentional violations.
for his unlawful disclosure claim,rodriguez alleged that sony computer disclosed without consent rodriguez personal information to sony network prior to the transfer of management in september.rodriguez stated that these disclosures deprived him of control over his personal information and his ability to market that information for his own financial gain.
in support of his breach of contract claim,rodriguez asserted that he entered into a binding contract with sony computer for the purchase and rental of video games and movies.according to rodriguez,sony computer and sony network breached this contract that incorporated the act retention requirements,resulting in actual damages.
the district court again granted sony motion to dismiss.the district court observed that,despite the prior dismissal of rodriguez unlawful retention claim with prejudice,rodriguez claim has resurfaced in a variety of different packages the district court determined that rodriguez could not reshape his dismissed unlawful retention claim as a breach of contract claim because he failed to identify any agreement memorializing the act requirements as contractual obligations.the district court also held that dismissal of rodriguez unlawful disclosure claim was warranted because leave to amend was granted only as to any unlawful disclosures made to the doe defendants.
rodriguez filed a timely notice of appeal.

iii.discussion 
private right of action for unlawful retention of personal information 
rodriguez maintains that the plain language of c provides a private right of action because it permits a civil action for violation of this section.
although we have not previously addressed this issue,the seventh circuit has rejected the same argument.in sterk i,the seventh circuit considered whether the plaintiff could pursue an unlawful retention claim stemming from redbox retention of personal information related to its rental services.see sterk i,at.the seventh circuit observed that,because was not well drafted,application of its statutory language posed several challenges.id.at.the seventh circuit emphasized that t he biggest interpretive problem stems from failure to specify the scope of relief afforded in c.id.the seventh circuit resolved the interpretive problem by reasoning that c created a private right of action only for unlawful disclosure of personal information and not for unlawful retention beyond the destruction provisions in the act.see id.the seventh circuit observed that 
if c appeared after all the prohibitions,which is to say after d and e as well as b,the natural inference would be that any violator of any of the prohibitions could be sued for damages.but instead c appears after just the first prohibition,the one in subsection b,prohibiting disclosure 
id.the seventh circuit acknowledged that the language placement could have been an accident of legislative drafting,but agreed with the sixth circuit that the more plausible interpretation is that it is limited to enforcing the prohibition of disclosure id.citing daniel cantrell,cir.
the seventh circuit further observed that awarding damages or other forms of relief would be illogical for unlawful retention because no injury would occur absent disclosure.as the seventh circuit articulated 
how could there be injury,unless the information,not having been destroyed,were disclosed if,though not timely destroyed,it remained secreted in the video service provider files until it was destroyed,there would be no injury.true,subsection c a allows in liquidated damages,without need to prove actual damages,but liquidated damages are intended to be an estimate of actual damages,and if failure of timely destruction results in no injury at all because there is never any disclosure,the only possible estimate of actual damages for violating subsection e would be zero 
id.internal quotation marks omitted.
although rodriguez contends that the seventh circuit opinion was wrongly decided,the seventh circuit approach to statutory interpretation was sound.the seventh circuit astutely noted the limited guidance provided by the statutory language.see id.the unlawful disclosure provision provides that a video tape service provider who knowingly discloses,to any person,personally identifiable information concerning any consumer of such provider shall be liable to the aggrieved person for the relief provided in subsection d.b.as discussed,d is a dead end for any damages remedy,as it merely precludes the introduction of personal information as evidence in any trial,hearing,arbitration,or other proceeding and does not otherwise provide for relief.d.
there are other notable distinctions between the unlawful disclosure and unlawful retention provisions.the unlawful disclosure provision explicitly provides for liability to the aggrieved person.c.however,the unlawful retention provision does not specify that a video service provider is liable for the knowing retention of personal information.that provision lacks any mens reas articulation and does not specify any form of available relief to an aggrieved party.see e.instead,the provision simply delineates a statutory duty for the d estruction of old records by the video service provider,and does not otherwise provide for civil liability.id 
generally,when the language of the statute is directed toward the entity being regulated,rather than the party seeking relief,we have not recognized a private right of action.see logan bank ass n,cir articulating that s tatutes containing general proscriptions of activities or focusing on the regulated party rather than the class of beneficiaries whose welfare congress intended to further do not indicate an intent to provide for private rights of action citations,alteration,and internal quotation marks omitted.faced with this drafting conundrum,the seventh circuit understandably considered the statute structure in resolving the private right of action issue.
courts must interpret the statute as a whole,giving effect to each word and making every effort not to interpret a provision in a manner that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent,meaningless or superfluous.united states neal,cir citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.additionally,particular phrases must be construed in light of the overall purpose and structure of the whole statutory scheme.id.citation,alteration,and internal quotation marks omitted.rather than focusing on the phrase in this section,as urged by rodriguez to support creating a right of action for all subsections,the seventh circuit employed accepted principles of statutory construction to interpret an imperfectly drafted statute.
the seventh circuit decision is consistent with the rationale utilized by the sixth circuit,the only other court to have addressed the act reach.in daniel,the plaintiff sued video store owners for disclosing personal information related to his video rentals.see at.affirming summary judgment in favor of the defendants,see id.at,the sixth circuit concluded that only the unlawful disclosure provision includes language related to liability.neither section d nor section e contains such language.id.at citation omitted.the sixth circuit explained that 
the structure of the statute makes it clear that a civil action may be brought based on only a violation of section b.immediately after section b,section c discusses the rules for bringing a civil action.after section c,sections d and e discuss receiving personal information into evidence and destruction of old records.if these later sections were to be a basis for liability,it would make sense that the section on civil actions would come at the end of the statute,rather than preceding these sections.
id.footnote reference and internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,the act legislative history does not evince any congressional intent to create a private right of action for a video service provider retention of a consumer personal information beyond the statutorily proscribed tim
