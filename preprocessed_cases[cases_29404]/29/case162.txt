amended opinion on rehearing 
the court issued an initial opinion in these consolidated cases on september.bridgeport music,dimension films,cir.through an order entered december,the full court denied the petition for rehearing en banc filed by no limit films and a panel rehearing was granted only with respect to the issues discussed in section ii of the opinion as amended.bridgeport music,dimension films,cir.after additional briefing and argument on rehearing,we adhere to our conclusions and amend the opinion to further clarify our reasoning.
plaintiffs,bridgeport music,westbound records,southfield music,and nine records,appeal from several of the district court findings with respect to the copyright infringement claims asserted against no limit films this action arises out of the use of a sample from the composition and sound recording get off your ass and jam get off in the rap song miles and runnin miles,which was included in the sound track of the movie i got the hook up hook up.specifically,westbound appeals from the district court decision to grant summary judgment to defendant on the grounds that the alleged infringement was de minimis and therefore not actionable.bridgeport,while not appealing from the summary judgment order,challenges instead the denial of its motion to amend the complaint to assert new claims of infringement based on a different song included in the sound track of hook up.finally,bridgeport,southfield,and nine records appeal from the decision to award attorney fees and costs totaling to no limit films under.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to no limit on westbound claim of infringement of its sound recording copyright,but affirm the decision of the district court as to the award of attorney fees and the denial of bridgeport motion to amend.
the claims at issue in this appeal were originally asserted in an action filed on may,by the related entities bridgeport music,southfield music,westbound records,and nine records,alleging nearly counts against approximately defendants for copyright infringement and various state law claims relating to the use of samples without permission in new rap recordings.in august,the district court severed that original complaint into separate actions,this being one of them,based on the allegedly infringing work and ordered that amended complaints be filed 
the claims in this case were brought by all four plaintiffs bridgeport and southfield,which are in the business of music publishing and exploiting musical composition copyrights,and westbound records and nine records,which are in the business of recording and distributing sound recordings.it was conceded at the time of summary judgment,however,that neither southfield music nor nine records had any ownership interest in the copyrights at issue in this case.as a result,the district court ordered that they be jointly and severally liable for of the attorney fees and costs awarded to no limit films.
bridgeport and westbound claim to own the musical composition and sound recording copyrights in get off your ass and jam by george clinton,and the funkadelics.we assume,as did the district court,that plaintiffs would be able to establish ownership in the copyrights they claim.there seems to be no dispute either that get off was digitally sampled or that the recording miles was included on the sound track of i got the hook up.defendant no limit films,in conjunction with priority records,released the movie to theaters on may.the movie was apparently also released on vhs,dvd,and cable television.fatal to bridgeport claims of infringement was the release and agreement it entered into with two of the original owners of the composition miles,ruthless attack muzick ram and dollarz n sense music dnsm,in december,granting a sample use license to ram,dnsm,and their licensees.finding that no limit films had previously been granted an oral synchronization license to use the composition miles in the sound track of hook up,the district court concluded bridgeport claims against no limit films were barred by the unambiguous terms of the release and agreement.bridgeport music,dimension films,d.although bridgeport does not appeal from this determination,it is relevant to the district court later decision to award attorney fees to no limit films.
westbound claims are for infringement of the sound recording get off.because defendant does not deny it,we assume that the sound track of hook up used portions of miles that included the allegedly infringing sample from get off.the recording get off opens with a combination solo guitar riff that lasts four seconds.according to one of plaintiffs experts,randy kling,the recording miles contains a sample from that guitar solo.specifically,a sample from the guitar solo was copied,the pitch was lowered,and the copied piece was looped and extended to beats.kling states that this sample appears in the sound recording miles in five places specifically,at,and.by the district court estimation,each looped segment lasted approximately seconds.as for the segment copied from get off,the district court described it as follows 
the portion of the song at issue here is an arpeggiated is,three notes that,if struck together,comprise a chord but instead are played one at a time in very quick is repeated several times at the opening of get off.the arpeggiated chord is played on an unaccompanied electric guitar.the rapidity of the notes and the way they are played produce a,whirling sound that captures the listener attention and creates anticipation of what is to follow.
bridgeport,d at.no limit films moved for summary judgment,arguing that the sample was not protected by copyright law because it was not original and that the sample was legally insubstantial and therefore does not amount to actionable copying under copyright law.
mindful of the limited number of notes and chords available to composers,the district court explained that the question turned not on the originality of the chord but,rather,on the use of and the aural effect produced by the way the notes and the chord are played,especially here where copying of the sound recording is at issue.id.citations omitted.the district court found,after carefully listening to the recording of get off,that a jury could reasonably conclude that the way the arpeggiated chord is used and memorialized in the get off sound recording is original and creative and therefore entitled to copyright protection.id.citing newton diamond,d,later affirmed on other grounds at cir.no limit films does not appeal from this determination.
turning then to the question of de minimis copying in the context of digital sampling,the district court concluded that,whether the sampling is examined under a de minimis analysis or under the fragmented literal similarity test,the sampling in this case did not rise to the level of a legally cognizable appropriation.d at.westbound argues that the district court erred both in its articulation of the applicable standards and its determination that there was no genuine issue of fact precluding summary judgment on this issue.
on october,the district court granted summary judgment to no limit films on the claims of bridgeport and westbound dismissed with prejudice the claims of southfield and nine records denied as moot the motion of bridgeport and westbound for partial summary judgment on the issue of copyright ownership and entered final judgment accordingly.bridgeport and westbound appealed.the facts relevant to the earlier denial of bridgeport motion to amend the complaint will be discussed below.no limit films filed a motion for attorney fees and costs,which the district court granted for the reasons set forth in its memorandum opinion and order of april.bridgeport,southfield music,and nine records appealed from that award.
the district court decision granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo.smith ameritech,cir.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.
in granting summary judgment to defendant,the district court looked to general de minimis principles and emphasized the paucity of case law on the issue of whether digital sampling amounts to copyright infringement.drawing on both the and fragmented literal similarity approaches,the district court found the de minimis analysis was a derivation of the substantial similarity element when a defendant claims that the literal copying of a small and insignificant portion of the copyrighted work should be allowed.after listening to the copied segment,the sample,and both songs,the district court found that no reasonable juror,even one familiar with the works of george clinton,would recognize the source of the sample without having been told of its source.this finding,coupled with findings concerning the quantitatively small amount of copying involved and the lack of qualitative similarity between the works,led the district court to conclude that westbound could not prevail on its claims for copyright infringement of the sound recording 
westbound does not challenge the district court characterization of either the segment copied from get off or the sample that appears in miles.nor does westbound argue that there is some genuine dispute as to any material fact concerning the nature of the protected material in the two works.the heart of westbound arguments is the claim that no substantial similarity or de minimis inquiry should be undertaken at all when the defendant has not disputed that it digitally sampled a copyrighted sound recording.we agree and accordingly must reverse the grant of summary judgment.
digital sampling of copyrighted sound recordings 
at the outset it is important to make clear the precise nature of our decision.our conclusions are as follows 
the analysis that is appropriate for determining infringement of a musical composition copyright,is not the analysis that is to be applied to determine infringement of a sound recording.we address this issue only as it pertains to sound recording copyrights 
since the district court decision essentially tracked the analysis that is made if a musical composition copyright were at issue,we depart from that analysis 
we agree with the district court analysis on the question of originality.on remand,we assume that westbound will be able to establish it has a copyright in the sound recording and that a digital sample from the copyrighted sound recording was used in this case.
this case involves digital sampling which is a term of art well understood by the parties to this litigation and the music industry in general.accordingly,we adopt the definition commonly accepted within the industry.
because of the court limited technological knowledge in this specialized field,our opinion is limited to an instance of digital sampling of a sound recording protected by a valid copyright.if by analogy it is possible to extend our analysis to other forms of sampling,we leave it to others to do so.
advances in technology coupled with the advent of the popularity of hip hop or rap music have made instances of digital sampling extremely common and have spawned a plethora of copyright disputes and litigation.
the music industry,as well as the courts,are best served if something approximating a test can be established.not necessarily a one size fits all test,but one that,at least,adds clarity to what constitutes actionable infringement with regard to the digital sampling of copyrighted sound recordings.
we do not set forth the arguments made by westbound since our analysis differs somewhat from that offered by the plaintiff.our analysis begins and largely ends with the applicable statute.section a of title of the united states code provides 
the exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording are limited to the rights specified by clauses,and of section,and do not include any right of performance under section.
section provides 
subject to sections through,the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following 
to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords 
to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work 
to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership,or by rental,lease,or lending 
in the case of literary,musical,dramatic,and choreographic works,pantomimes,and motion pictures and other audiovisual works to perform the copyrighted work publicly 
in the case of literary,musical,dramatic,and choreographic works,pantomimes,and pictorial,graphic,or sculptural works,including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work,to display the copyrighted work publicly and 
in the case of sound recordings,to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.
section b states 
b the exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause of section is limited to the right to duplicate the sound recording in the form of phonorecords or copies that directly or indirectly recapture the actual sounds fixed in the recording.the exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause of section is limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged,remixed,or otherwise altered in sequence or quality.the exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses and of section do not extend to the making or duplication of another sound recording that consists entirely of an independent fixation of other sounds,even though such sounds imitate or simulate those in the copyrighted sound recording.the exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clauses,and of section do not apply to sound recordings included in educational television and radio programs as defined in section of title distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting entities as defined by section g provided,that copies or phonorecords of said programs are not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting entities to the general public.
before discussing what we believe to be the import of the above quoted provisions of the statute,a little history is necessary.the copyright laws attempt to strike a balance between protecting original works and stifling further creativity.the provisions,for example,for compulsory licensing make it possible for creators to enjoy the fruits of their creations,but not to fence them off from the world at large.although musical compositions have always enjoyed copyright protection,it was not until that sound recordings were subject to a separate copyright.if one were to analogize to a book,it is not the book,the paper and binding,that is copyrightable,but its contents.there are probably any number of reasons why the decision was made by congress to treat a sound recording differently from a book even though both are the medium in which an original work is fixed rather than the creation itself.none the least of them certainly were advances in technology which made the pirating of sound recordings an easy task.the balance that was struck was to give sound recording copyright holders the exclusive right to duplicate the sound recording in the form of phonorecords or copies that directly or indirectly recapture the actual sounds fixed in the recording.b.this means that the world at large is free to imitate or simulate the creative work fixed in the recording so long as an actual copy of the sound recording itself is not made that leads us directly to the issue in this case.if you can not pirate the whole sound recording,can you lift or sample something less than the whole.our answer to that question is in the negative 
section b provides that t he exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause of section is limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged,remixed,or otherwise altered in sequence or quality.further,the rights of sound recording copyright holders under clauses and of section do not extend to the making or duplication of another sound recording that consists entirely of an independent fixation of other sounds,even though such sounds imitate or simulate those in the copyrighted sound recording.b emphasis added.the significance of this provision is amplified by the fact that the copyright act of added the word entirely to this language.compare sound recording act of,stat,adding subsection f to former does not extend to the making or duplication of another sound recording that is an independent fixation of other sounds.in other words,a sound recording owner has the exclusive right to sample his own recording.we find much to recommend this interpretation 
to begin with,there is ease of enforcement.get a license or do not sample.we do not see this as stifling creativity in any significant way.it must be remembered that if an artist wants to incorporate a riff from another work in his or her recording,he is free to duplicate the sound of that riff in the studio.second,the market will control the license price and keep it within bounds the sound recording copyright holder can not exact a license fee greater than what it would cost the person seeking the license to just duplicate the sample in the course of making the new recording.third,sampling is never accidental.it is not like the case of a composer who has a melody in his head,perhaps not even realizing that the reason he hears this melody is that it is the work of another which he had heard before.when you sample a sound recording you know you are taking another work product 
this analysis admittedly raises the question of why one should,without infringing,be able to take three notes from a musical composition,for example,but not three notes by way of sampling from a sound recording.why is there no de minimis taking or why should substantial similarity not enter the equation our first answer to this question is what we have earlier indicated.we think this result is dictated by the applicable statute.second,even when a small part of a sound recording is sampled,the part taken is something of value no further proof of that is necessary than the fact that the producer of the record or the artist on the record intentionally sampled because it would save costs,or add something to the new recording,or both.for the sound recording copyright holder,it is not the song but the sounds that are fixed in the medium of his choice.when those sounds are sampled they are taken directly from that fixed medium.it is a physical taking rather than an intellectual one.
this case also illustrates the kind of mental,musicological,and technological gymnastics that would have to be employed if one were to adopt a de minimis or substantial similarity analysis.the district judge did an excellent job of navigating these troubled waters,but not without dint of great effort.when one considers that he has hundreds of other cases all involving different samples from different songs,the value of a principled rule becomes apparent.we would want to emphasize,however,that considerations of judicial economy are not what drives this opinion.if any consideration of economy is involved it is that of the music industry.as this case and other companion cases make clear,it would appear to be cheaper to license than to litigate 
since our holding arguably sets forth a new rule,several other observations are in order.first,although there were no existing sound recording judicial precedents to follow we did not pull this interpretation out of thin air several law review and text writers,some of whom have been referenced in this opinion,have suggested that this is the proper interpretation of the copyright statute as it pertains to sound recordings since digital sampling has become so commonplace and rap music has become such a significant part of the record industry,it is not surprising that there are probably a hundred articles dealing with sampling and its ramifications.it is also not surprising that the viewpoint expressed in a number of these articles appears driven by whose ox is being gored.as is so often the case,where one stands depends on where one sits.for example,the sound recording copyright holders favor this interpretation as do the studio musicians and their labor organization.on the other hand,many of the hip hop artists may view this rule as stifling creativity.the record companies and performing artists are not all of one mind,however,since in many instances,today sampler is tomorrow samplee.the incidence of live and let live has been relatively high,which explains why so many instances of sampling go unprotested and why so many sampling controversies have been settled.
second,to pursue further the subject of stifling creativity,many artists and record companies have sought licenses as a matter of course since there is no record of those instances of sampling that either go unnoticed or are ignored,one can not come up with precise figures,but it is clear that a significant number of persons and companies have elected to go the licensing route.also there is a large body of sound recordings that is not subject to federal copyright protection additionally,just as many artists and companies choose to sample and take their chances,it is likely that will continue to be the case.
third,the record industry,including the recording artists,has the ability and to work out guidelines,including a fixed schedule of license fees,if they so choose.
fourth,we realize we are announcing a new rule and because it is new,it should not play any role in the assessment of concepts such as willful or intentional in cases that are currently before the courts or had their genesis before this decision was announced.
finally,and unfortunately,there is no rosetta stone for the interpretation of the copyright statute.we have taken a literal reading approach.the legislative history is of little help because digital sampling was being done in.if this is not what congress intended or is not what they would intend now,it is easy enough for the record industry,as they have done in the past,to go back to congress for a clarification or change in the law.this is the best place for the change to be made,rather than in the courts,because as this case demonstrates,the court is never aware of much more than the tip of the iceberg.to properly sort out this type of problem with its complex technical and business overtones,one needs the type of investigative resources as well as the ability to hold hearings that is possessed by congress.
these conclusions require us to reverse the entry of summary judgment entered in favor of no limit films on westbound claims of copyright infringement.since the district judge found no infringement,there was no necessity to consider the affirmative defense of fair use.on remand,the trial judge is free to consider this defense and we express no opinion on its applicability to these facts.

plaintiffs commenced this action in may,and filed an amended complaint in september.in november,the district court entered a scheduling order which required that any motion to amend pleadings be filed far enough in advance of april,to allow briefing to be completed by that date.discovery was to be completed by may.on march,the district court extended the time for amending pleadings with the proviso that it would have to be done in time to avoid extending discovery beyond may.
on april,plaintiffs counsel received a cue sheet for hook up that apparently alerted bridgeport to the presence of another song in which it held a copyright interest.specifically,bridgeport claims interest in the composition how ya do dat how ya under a release and agreement dated october,that granted permission to use a sample from the composition one of those funky things in how ya.while there was disagreement about whether discovery made available as early as october should have alerted bridgeport of this claim,there is no dispute that the presence of how ya was readily observable from watching the movie.in fact,the magistrate judge noted that the cue sheet appears to be a list of credits from the end of the film.
plaintiffs moved to amend on april,and no limit films opposed the motion in a response filed on april.on may,the magistrate judge recommended that the motion be denied.plaintiffs filed objections on may,and defendant responded on may.the discovery cutoff date,may,had passed,but the deadline for completing depositions had been extended to june.but,the deadline for filing dispositive motions continued to be june.no limit films filed its motion for summary judgment on that date.on august,the district court entered its order overruling plaintiffs objections,denying plaintiffs motion to amend,and denying plaintiffs further motion to certify the issue for appeal.
bridgeport maintains the district court abused its discretion by denying leave to amend on the grounds of unjustified delay and in the absence of a finding of prejudice to the defendant.it is true that,ordinarily,delay alone will not justify the denial of leave to amend the complaint.morse mcwhorter,cir.delay,however,will become undue at some point,placing an unwarranted burden on the court,or prejudicial,placing an unfair burden on the opposing party.morse,at citing adams gould,cir.
had the district court made an explicit finding of prejudice,very little would need to be said in affirming the denial of leave in this case.the district court order,although brief,touched on undue delay and prejudice,explaining 
the plaintiffs object to the magistrate judge conclusion that plaintiffs had not offered a sufficient reason for failing to amend their complaint to add claims and parties by the deadline set by the court.plaintiffs argue that this deadline was modified by subsequent order,and that the magistrate judge erred under sixth circuit law by not allowing the amendments in the interests of justice.the defendants respond that the magistrate judge correctly concluded that,under the circumstances of this case,amendment on the eve of the close of discovery would be prejudicial to defendants and unduly delay trial.
after careful consideration of the entire record,the court adopts and approves the magistrate judge report and recommendation.the plaintiffs objections are overruled.the interest of justice in this case requires that plaintiffs show good cause why the court should allow amendment of their complaint to add a claim and parties after the court deadline for such amendments,which the plaintiffs have failed to do.
to the extent that this brief discussion leaves doubt that a finding of prejudice was made,we may sustain a denial of leave to amend on grounds that are apparent from the record.morse,at.
defendant clearly argued that it would be unfairly prejudiced if required to respond to a distinct new claim of infringement with only a few weeks of discovery remaining.plaintiffs focus on the magistrate judge mistaken reliance on the april deadline for seeking leave to amend.nonetheless,as defendant argues,plaintiffs motion was not timely because the district court required that any amendments be sought in sufficient time that discovery could be completed before may.also,the record reflects that although there were extensions of discovery beyond that date,extensions were only granted to allow the completion of certain depositions and did not affect the deadline for filing dispositive motions.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of leave to raise new claims based on a different song,by a different artist,in the movie.
bridgeport,southfield music,and nine records appeal from the decision to award in attorney fees and costs to no limit films as a prevailing party under.apportioning the award between these plaintiffs,the district court ordered that southfield and nine records be held liable,jointly and severally,for of the total.the district court also found that no award was warranted against westbound records because its claims were objectively reasonable and based on a developing area of copyright law.as a result,the amount of fees reasonably incurred in defense of this action were reduced by.plaintiffs do not challenge the calculation of the fees or the inclusion of any particular item.

southfield and nine records,neither of which had an interest in get off or miles,argue that defendant did not truly prevail against them because they were inadvertently left in the amended complaint and they did not oppose dismissal in this case.they did not voluntarily dismiss their claims,however,as it was only in response to defendant dispositive motions that they acquiesced in dismissal.moreover,the inclusion of southfield and nine records in the amended complaint in this case was less inadvertent than a reflection of the plaintiffs failure to discriminate between defendants and claims.no limit films is a prevailing defendant as judgment was entered in its favor on all claims 
concluding that bridgeport claim was objectively unreasonable,the district court indicated that the factor weighed heavily in favor of awarding fees.the district court,relying on its decision granting summary judgment to defendant,specifically found bridgeport claims were objectively unreasonable because bridgeport had no ownership interest in miles when the oral synchronization license was granted and offered no evidence to undermine the existence of a valid license.bridgeport argues that its claim,although unsuccessful,was not objectively unreasonable because it was not aware no limit would claim it had an oral license that preceded the release and agreement.as defendant responds,nothing in this record suggests bridgeport would not have sued no limit films if it had been aware of the oral license.
this brings us to what the district court called the deciding manner in which the plaintiffs litigated this action.this consideration,plaintiffs maintain,represents nothing more than an attempt to punish bridgeport and deter the plaintiffs from pursuing reasonable,nonfrivolous claims in other cases under threat of an award of attorney fees.the district court reasoned as follows 
the initial complaint in this action is so voluminous that,with exhibits,it is almost pages long and takes days to read in its entirety.it is replete with diatribes against the music industry,but lacks concrete facts directed at specific defendants.almost all of the or so defendants in the initial complaint representing what appeared to be almost the entirety of entities involved in making urban music were lumped together in broad categories and descriptions of activities.the individual counts described the infringing conduct of the defendants by references to these broad generalizations,without any specific information as to what any individual defendant did to violate the copyright act.
from that inauspicious beginning,this action proceeded in a like manner,with heavy emphasis on discovery disputes and motion practice and little attention paid to narrowing the issues and refining the claims.the plaintiffs repeatedly taxed the patience of the court,from narrowing the margins on their memoranda to circumvent page limits,to filing voluminous pleadings that were long on argument but short on concrete facts or applicable legal authority.the plaintiffs took every opportunity to inundate the court with paperwork,yet many of these motions were hastily prepared and often lacked sufficient legal or factual support.most notably,the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on ownership yet failed to submit certified copies of the registration certificates for the copyrights they claimed to own.when this oversight was pointed out by the magistrate judge as being fatal to their summary judgment motion,the plaintiffs,instead of providing the documentation which could be easily obtained from the copyright office,expended enormous effort in subsequent motion papers trying to convince the court that the certified copies were unnecessary until ordered to produce them.
the plaintiffs tactics have contributed to the multiplication of fees by all parties,including the defendant here.this,combined with the determination that bridgeport claim was objectively unreasonable,merits an award for fees and costs against bridgeport.
to award fees simply because of the length of and lack of specificity in the original complaint or because of the number of claims brought by the plaintiffs would strike us as punitive and inconsistent with the purposes of the copyright act.see murray hill,at reversing award of attorney fees,despite district court criticism of the voluminous burden the case imposed,noting only that the law was unsettled and the plaintiff presented one or more colorable claims.the district court criticisms go beyond just that,however,and are tied to conduct that complicated rather than streamlined the issues and contributed to the multiplication of fees for the defendant.
while the district court did not articulate this consideration in terms of the fogerty factors,and was not required to since they are nonexclusive,we see it as related to the recognized factor of deterrence and compensation.the unique posture of this case as one of hundreds brought in the same manner and asserting parallel claims,makes deterrence a particularly relevant and appropriate consideration.it is not the deterrence of objectively reasonable good faith claims,but the interest in motivating plaintiffs to sort through the objectively unreasonable ones and prosecute this at best cumbersome litigation in a way that discriminates between parties and claims.
plaintiffs charge that the defendant was equally responsible for multiplying fees,particularly by failing to designate a representative for deposition who had knowledge of the facts concerning the use of get off in hook up.while there is some suggestion that defendant contributed to increased discovery costs because multiple depositions were required,our review is deferential and the record does not demonstrate clear error in the district court assessment of plaintiffs litigation conduct.ultimately,we can not say the district court abused its discretion in this case,particularly given the reduction in attorney fees to account for westbound claims.nor should southfield and nine records be relieved of the nominal award of fees in this case,as defendant was required to investigate whether they had any claim and affirmatively move for dismissal of their claims before it was conceded that they had no interest in the copyrighted works.

were we to follow the analysis used by the district judge,we would agree with the result he reached.
defendants initially claimed that this argument was made for the first time on appeal.since a panel rehearing was granted,defendants have had a full opportunity to brief and argue these issues.
in most copyright actions,the issue is whether the infringing work is substantially similar to the original work the scope of inquiry is much narrower when the work in question is a sound recording.the only issue is whether the actual sound recording has been used without authorization.substantial similarity is not an issue bradley rosen,causes of action ed.

needless to say,in the case of a recording of a musical composition the imitator would have to clear with the holder of the composition copyright.
a question arises as to whether the copying of a single note would be actionable.since that is not the fact situation in this case,we need not provide a definitive answer.we note,however,that under the copyright act,the sound recording must result from the fixation of a series of musical,spoken,or other sounds definition of sound recording.
b by clarifying the rights of a sound recording copyright owner in regard to derivative works,section b makes it clear that the digital sampling of a copyrighted sound recording must typically be licensed to avoid an infringement the import of this language is that it does not matter how much a digital sampler alters the actual sounds or whether the ordinary lay observer can or can not recognize the song or the artist performance of it.since the exclusive right encompasses rearranging,remixing,
