opinion of the court 
in this copyright case we review the district court entry of a preliminary injunction against video pipeline,online display of clip previews.a clip preview,as we use the term,is an approximately segment of a movie,copied without authorization from the film copyright holder,and used in the same way as an authorized movie trailer.we reserve the term trailer for previews created by the copyright holder of a particular movie or under the copyright holder authority.
video pipeline challenges the injunction on the ground that its internet use of the clip previews is protected by the fair use doctrine and,alternatively,that appellees buena vista home entertainment,and miramax film may not receive the benefits of copyright protection because they have engaged in copyright misuse.we reject both arguments,and affirm.
background 
video pipeline compiles movie trailers onto videotape for home video retailers to display in their stores.to obtain the right to distribute the trailers used in the compilations,video pipeline enters into agreements with various entertainment companies.it entered into such an agreement,the master clip license agreement license agreement,with disney in,and disney thereafter provided video pipeline with over trailers for its movies.
in,video pipeline took its business to the web,where it operates and.the company maintains a database accessible from,which contains movie trailers video pipeline has received throughout the years.video pipeline internet clients retail web sites selling home videos use to display trailers to site visitors.the site visitors access trailers by clicking on a button labeled preview for a particular motion picture.the requested trailer is then streamed for the visitor to view because it is streamed the trailer can not be downloaded to or stored on the visitor computer.the operators of the web sites from which the trailers are pipeline internet a fee to have the trailers streamed based on the number of megabytes shown to site visitors.video pipeline has agreements to stream trailers with approximately online retailers,including,amazon,and best buy.
as noted,video pipeline also operates.on this web site,visitors can search for movies by title,actor,scene,genre.when a search is entered,the site returns a list of movies and information about them,and allows the user to stream trailers from.in addition to displaying trailers,includes a shop now button to link the user to a web site selling the requested video.visitors to can also win prizes by playing can you name that movie after viewing a trailer on the site.
video pipeline included in its online database trailers it received under the license agreement from disney.because the license agreement did not permit this use,disney requested that video pipeline remove the trailers from the database.it complied with that request.
on october,however,video pipeline filed a complaint in the district court for the district of new jersey seeking a declaratory judgment that its online use of the trailers did not violate federal copyright law.disney shortly thereafter terminated the license agreement.
video pipeline decided to replace some of the trailers it had removed at disney request from its database.in order to do so,it copied approximately two minutes from each of at least disney movies to create its own clip previews of the movies.again,to distinguish between the previews created under the copyright holder authority and those created by video pipeline,we call the former trailers and the latter clip previews or clips.we use the term previews generically.
video pipeline stores the clip previews in its database and displays them on the internet in the same way it had displayed the disney trailers.in content,however,the clip previews differ from the trailers.each clip preview opens with a display of the miramax or disney trademark and the title of the movie,then shows one or two scenes from the first half of the movie,and closes with the title again.disney trailers,in contrast,are designed to entice sales from a target market by using techniques such as,narration,editing,and additional music.video pipeline clip previews use none of these marketing techniques 
disney also makes its trailers available online.it displays them on its own web sites in order to attract and to keep users there a concept called stickiness and then takes advantage of the users presence to advertise and sell other products.disney has also entered into agreements to link its trailers with other businesses,and,for example,has such a link with the apple computer home page.
video pipeline amended its complaint to seek a declaratory judgment allowing it to use the clip previews.disney filed a counterclaim alleging copyright infringement.the district court entered a preliminary injunction,later revised,prohibiting video pipeline from displaying clip previews of disney films on the internet.see video pipeline,buena vista home entertainment,d.video pipeline appeals 
discussion 
we review for an abuse of discretion the district court decision to grant disney request for a preliminary injunction.adams freedom forge,cir.under this standard,questions of law receive de novo review,and questions of fact are reviewed for clear error.id.
to obtain a preliminary injunction,a party must show that it is reasonably likely to succeed on the merits of its copyright infringement claim and a likelihood that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied.id.other issues to consider if relevant are the likelihood of irreparable harm to the party and the public interest.id.video pipeline presents no arguments for issues and,so we shall not discuss them,assuming instead that the district court correctly held that these factors favored issuing the injunction.we therefore address the first two issues.
likelihood of success on the merits 
subject to the fair use exception discussed below and other exceptions not relevant here,copyright owners have the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work,to prepare derivative works,to distribute copies,to perform publicly a copyrighted motion picture,and to display publicly the individual images of a copyrighted motion picture.to make out a prima facie case of copyright infringement for preliminary injunction purposes,disney needed to show that the display of the clip previews likely violates any provision of.see a,b the district court held that video pipeline clip previews likely infringe disney exclusive rights under three of provisions subsection,concerning derivative works subsection,dealing with public performance of motion pictures and subsection,relating to public display of individual images of a motion picture.
on appeal,video pipeline challenges the district court holding that the clip previews likely violate,asserting that the clips can not properly be classified as derivative works.it does not contest the court determination as to subsections and.because proof of a violation of any one subsection of states a case of illegal infringement,the district court decision that disney made a prima facie showing of infringement on the basis of subsections and would not be affected by any conclusion we might make as to whether the clip previews are derivative in nature.as video pipeline display of excerpts taken from the copyrighted movies clearly comes within the prohibition on public display of motion pictures,and images from a motion picture,we turn to whether video pipeline use should nonetheless be countenanced on the ground that it falls within the fair use doctrine.
congress constitutional power to provide for copyright protection is intended to motivate the creative activity of authors by the provision of a special reward,and to allow the public access to the products of their genius after the limited period of exclusive control has expired.sony of am.universal city studios,d.at times,however,rigid application of the copyright statute would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster.campbell music,d.when that is the case,the fair use doctrine may be implicated.
congress codified the judicially created fair use defense at of the copyright act,which permits a fair use of a copyrighted work.a fair use,although not specifically defined by the statute,is one made for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching,scholarship,or research.id.it is an affirmative defense for which the alleged infringer bears the burden of proof.
in judging the fairness of a particular use,courts must take into account the following list of factors 
the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 
the nature of the copyrighted work 
the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and 
the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
id.the four statutory factors do not represent a score card that promises victory to the winner of the majority.pierre leval,toward a fair use standard,harv.rather,each factor is to be explored,and the results weighed together,in light of the purposes of copyright.campbell,at.citations omitted.thus,as we apply copyright law,and the fair use doctrine in particular,we bear in mind its purpose to encourage creative activity for the public good.sony,at.
this focus on copyright purpose makes relevant a comparison of the copy with the original where the copier uses none of his own creative activity to transform the original work,holding the fair use doctrine inapplicable will not likely interfere with copyright goal of encouraging creativity.thus,in the typical fair use case,the analysis under each statutory factor concentrates on the copy and the original work from which it derives.in this case,however,our analysis of the four statutory factors will take into account where relevant disney original films and its trailers.we examine in this way the fairness of the online display of the clip previews because,among other things,the statute directs our attention under factor four to the effect of the allegedly infringing uses on both the potential market for any derivative works the parties do not dispute that disney trailers qualify as derivative works and the potential market for the originals.see campbell,at.
purpose and character of the use 
once again,the first factor requires that we consider the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.the district court concluded that the purpose and character of video pipeline clip previews weigh against finding fair use.we agree.
if a new work is used commercially rather than for a nonprofit purpose,its use will less likely qualify as fair.campbell,at.as video pipeline charges a fee to stream the clip previews,its use of the copies is commercial as the district court found.
the commercial nature of the use does not by itself,however,determine whether the purpose and character of the use weigh for or against finding fair use.id.at.we look as well to any differences in character and purpose between the new use and the original.we consider whether the copy is transformative of the work it copied because it alter ed the first with new expression,meaning,or message,or instead whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation.id.at.citations and alteration in original omitted.
video pipeline asserts that its use of the clip previews substantially transforms the films from which they derive because the clips and the movies have different purposes.according to video pipeline,the original works have an aesthetic and entertainment purpose while the clip previews serve only to provide information about the movies to internet users or as advertisements for the company retail web site clients to the extent that the character and purpose of the clip previews and the original films diverge,however,the clips share the same character and purpose as disney derivative trailers.whatever informational or promotional character and purpose the trailers possess,so do the clip previews.consequently,the clips are likely to supersede the objects of disney derivatives.campbell,at.citations omitted although the clips are copied from disney original rather than its derivative works,it is highly relevant to our inquiry here that the clips will likely serve as substitutes for those derivatives.
video pipeline also urges us to take into account the functional character and purpose of the database in which it stores trailers and clip previews,apparently hoping we will discern no significant difference between its database and the internet search engine used in kelly arriba soft,cir in kelly,arriba soft search engine located images on other web sites in response to a user request and displayed the results in pictures,with a link that would take the user to the web site on which the image was found.id.at.the court held that the display of the thumbnail images was a fair use.id.
video pipeline database does not,however,serve the same function as did arriba soft search engine.as used with retailers web sites,does not improve access to authorized previews located on other web sites.rather,it indexes and displays unauthorized copies of copyrighted works.does permit viewers to link to legitimate retailers web sites,but a link to a legitimate seller of authorized copies does not here,if it ever would,make prima facie infringement a fair use.
finally,we note that video pipeline clip reiterate,approximately excerpts of films with movie title and company trademark not add significantly to disney original expression.video pipeline itself asserts,and the district court found,d at,that the clip previews involved no new creative ingenuity.the court did recognize that deciding which scene or scenes to include in a clip preview requires some creative choice.id.but as video pipeline disclaims the use of any creative ingenuity,we have no difficulty viewing those decisions as involving creativity only in a theoretical,and most narrow,sense.hence,it is dubious what new expression,meaning,or message video pipeline has brought to its copies.campbell,at.
it is useful to compare the clip previews with a movie review,which might also display segments copied from a film.the movie reviewer does not simply display a scene from the movie under review but as well provides his or her own commentary and criticism.in so doing,the critic may add to the copy sufficient new expression,message,or meaning to render the use fair.id.here,in contrast,the fact that a substantial portion,indeed almost all,of the infringing work was copied verbatim from the copyrighted work with no additional creative activity reveal s a dearth of transformative character or purpose.id.at.consequently,rejecting the fair use defense in this case will not likely stifle the very creativity that the copyright clause is designed to foster.id.at.
with this context,the district court correctly concluded that video pipeline clip previews lack any significant transformative quality.thus,the commercial nature of the clip previews weighs more strongly against video pipeline use.campbell,at.if the alleged infringer merely uses the original work to get attention or to avoid the drudgery in working up something fresh,the claim to fairness in borrowing from another work diminishes accordingly if it does not vanish,and other factors,like the extent of its commerciality,loom larger.given the shared character and purpose of the clip previews and the trailers so that the clips will likely serve as a substitute for the trailers and the absence of creative ingenuity in the creation of the clips,the first factor strongly weighs against fair use in this case.
nature of the copyrighted work 
the second statutory fair use factor directs courts to consider the nature of the copyrighted work.this factor calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others,with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied.campbell,at.fictional,creative works come closer to this core than do primarily factual works.harper row publishers,nation,d.the disney movies at,for example,beauty and the beast,fantasia,pretty woman,and dead poet paradigms of creative,expression.and disney trailers share imaginative aspects with the originals.
video pipeline argues that this factor nonetheless weighs in its favor because disney released to the public its movies,if not all of its trailers,prior to video pipeline display of the clip previews it is true that disney would have a stronger case against fair use had it not yet made its movies available for the public viewing pleasure.see id.at.t he unpublished nature of a work is a key factor tending to negate a defense of fair use.quoting.at alteration and quotation marks in original omitted.
but the second statutory factor does not necessarily weigh in favor of finding fair use simply because the public already has access to the original work.rather,that disney movies and trailers contain mainly creative expression,not factual material,suggests that the use is not fair regardless of the published or unpublished status of the original.see,campbell,at.holding that the song pretty woman fit within the core of the copyright protective purposes because of its creative expression,without considering that the original had already been made available to the public.the district court therefore properly relied on the creative,expression involved in disney movies and trailers to hold that this factor weighs against the fair use defense.
amount and substantiality of the work copied 
the third factor requires an analysis of the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.the district court determined that this factor also weighed in disney favor.d at.
as video pipeline points out,its previews excerpt only about two minutes from movies that last one and a half to two hours.quantitatively then,the portion taken is quite small.
but the third factor calls for thought not only about the quantity of the materials used,but about their quality and importance,too.campbell,at.the district court found that the clip previews,for the most part,were used to provide the potential customer with some idea of the plot of each motion picture,its overall tone,and a glimpse of its leading characters.d at.although the plot,tone,and leading characters are,of course,significant aspects of the films,the glimpse provided by the clips is made up only of scenes taken from the first half of the disney films.disney has not claimed,for instance,that any of the clips give away the ending of a movie,or ruin other intended surprises for viewers of the films.moreover,as advertisements,the clip previews are meant to whet the customer appetite,not to sate it accordingly,they are not designed to reveal the heart of the movies.simply put,we have no reason to believe that the clips manage in so brief a time,or even intend,to appropriate the heart of the movies.compare harper row,at.weighing this factor against finding fair use because the alleged infringer took what was essentially the heart of the book.
because the clip previews copy a relatively small amount of the original films and do not go to the heart of the movies,this factor,contrary to the district court determination,weighs in favor of finding fair video pipeline display of its clips.
effect on potential market or value 
finally,courts should evaluate the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.the district court considered the question to be whether video pipeline use of the copyrighted work affects or materially impairs the marketability of the copyrighted motion pictures,and,finding the evidence equivocal,concluded that the fourth factor weighed neither for nor against finding a likelihood of fair use.d at.
as mentioned above,this final factor must take into account not only harm to the original but also harm to the market for derivative works.campbell,at.because the issues pertaining to the potential harm to the market for disney derivative trailers are more straightforward,we focus our analysis on this area and do not review the district court conclusion as to harm to the market for the original films it is in this context that we conclude that the fourth factor weighs in disney favor.
video pipeline argued in the district court that no market exists,or could exist,for movie previews because no one ever paid or will ever pay any money merely to see trailers.but in fact retail websites are paying video pipeline to display both trailers and clip previews.moreover,video pipeline takes too narrow a view of the harm contemplated by this fourth factor.the statute directs us to consider the effect of the use upon the value of the copyrighted work,not only the effect upon the market,however narrowly that term is defined.see also worldwide church of god philadelphia church of god,cir drawing such a distinction.and the value need not be limited to monetary rewards compensation may take a variety of forms.see also sony,at.stating in a different context that the copyright law does not require a copyright owner to charge a fee for the use of his works,and the owner of a copyright may well have economic or noneconomic reasons for permitting certain kinds of copying to occur without receiving direct compensation from the copier.
disney introduced evidence that it has entered an agreement to its trailers with the apple computer home page and that it uses on its own websites the draw of the availability of authentic trailers to advertise,and other products,and to obtain valuable marketing information from visitors who chose sic to register at the site or make a purchase there.app.see also kelly,at kelly images are related to several potential markets.one purpose of the photographs is to attract internet users to his web site,where he sells advertising space as well as books and travel packages.in addition,kelly could sell or license his photographs to other web sites or to a stock photo database,which then could offer the images to its customers.in light of video pipeline commercial use of the clip previews and disney use of its trailers as described by the record evidence,we easily conclude that there is a sufficient market for,or other value in,movie previews such that the use of an infringing work could have a harmful effect cognizable under the fourth factor.
we have already determined that the clip previews lack transformative quality and that,though the clips are copies taken directly from the original films rather than from the trailers,display of the clip previews would substitute for the derivative works.as a result,the clips,if video pipeline continues to stream them over the internet,will serve as a market replacement for the trailers,making it likely that cognizable market harm to the derivatives will occur.campbell,at.for instance,web sites wishing to show previews of disney movies may choose to enter licensing agreements with video pipeline rather than disney,as at least have already done.and internet users searching for previews of disney films may be drawn by the clip previews to web sites other than disney,depriving disney of the opportunity to advertise and sell other products to those users 
consequently,unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by video pipeline would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the derivative works.id.at.quoting nimmer nimmer,nimmer on copyright a.we therefore hold that the district court should have weighed this factor against recognizing the fair use defense in this case.
three of the four statutory factors indicate that video pipeline internet display of the clip previews will not qualify as a fair use.from our consideration of each of those factors,we can not conclude that video pipeline online display of its clip previews does anything but infringe a work for personal profit.harper row,at.the district court therefore correctly held that video pipeline has failed to show that it will likely prevail on its fair use defense.
copyright misuse 
video pipeline further contends that disney has misused its copyright and,as a result,should not receive the protection of copyright la
