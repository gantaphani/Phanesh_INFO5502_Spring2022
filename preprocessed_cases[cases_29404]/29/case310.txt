this appeal concerns the validity of the department of justice doj interpretation of its own regulation requiring that movie theaters,pursuant to title iii of the ada,provide comparable lines of sight for and moviegoers.three individual,disabled plaintiffs and the oregon paralyzed veterans of america opva sued two companies that own and operate movie theaters in oregon.the theaters at issue located all seats in the front rows,where the vertical viewing angle was significantly sharper than in the rest of the theater.
the plaintiffs raised three claims.first,they alleged that the stadium seating plans in six of the defendants movie theaters violate title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada,and doj regulations promulgated thereunder.the plaintiffs also claimed that the seating plans violate oregon public accommodations statute,and claimed negligence in the design,construction,and operation of the theaters.they sought declaratory and injunctive relief,compensatory and punitive damages under the oregon statute,and damages for negligence in an amount to be proved at trial,in addition to attorneys fees and costs.
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all three claims.the three individual plaintiffs now appeal the district court decision as to the ada claim only.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse.
viewed in the light most favorable to the appellants,the parties,oliver keller,cir,the record reveals the following facts.the in this case are three disabled,individuals living in oregon.the defendants are regal cinemas,and eastgate theatre,two companies that own operate six movie theaters in oregon all six theaters utilize a design incorporating seating,which places most of the theater seats on stepped risers rather than on a sloped floor.the purpose of the stadium design is to maximize unobstructed views for theater patrons.in most cases,the first few rows at the front of the theater are set on a sloped floor there is an aisle at the entry level of the theater separating the sloped portion of the seating from the riser section,and the stadium seats approximately rows then rise behind the aisle,with each row raised above the one in front of it.
in order to get to the seats in the stadium riser section,patrons must walk up stairs on either side of the seating section.the riser seats are not.in all six theaters,seating for disabled patrons is located only in the first five rows in five of the six theaters seating is located only on the sloped portion of the floor,not in the aisle or in the stadium seating,with over half of the accessible seats in the very front row.the result is that all patrons who require wheelchairs have no choice but to sit in the first few rows of the theater.
as the appellants point out,locating all of the seating in the first few rows of the theaterscreates significant disadvantages for patrons.plaintiffs experts,who visited the theaters and conducted research there,found that the vertical lines of sight for the wheelchair seating locations ranged from to degrees,with an average of approximately degrees,as compared with the average median line of sight of degrees in the difference the experts termed a tremendous disparity.in reality,however,the disparity is even greater,because patrons can not slump in their seats and recline their bodies in order to adjust for the unfavorable viewing angle,as can patrons sitting in the same part of the theater.
in its engineering guideline for movie theaters,the society of motion picture and television engineers smpte concluded that,for most viewers,physical discomfort occurs when the vertical viewing angle to the top of the screen exceeds degrees,and when the horizontal line of sight measured between a perpendicular to the viewer seat and the centerline of the screen exceeds degrees.soc y of motion picture television eng rs,smpte engineering guideline design of effective cine theaters hereinafter smpte guideline.thus,not only do the wheelchair seats themselves have,on average,highly unfavorable viewing angles relative to the rest of the theater,but the patrons sitting in them will be less able than other patrons to adjust for those angles by shifting position in their seats.
the experts conclusions were also borne out by the individual plaintiffs own experiences in the theaters,as recounted in their affidavits and deposition testimony.kathy stewmon,who has multiple sclerosis and has been since,related 
sitting in the front row,so close to the screen,the screen was so huge that i could focus on it it made me dizzy trying to focus.i had to keep moving my head and neck back and forth to look at the whole movie screen.i found myself losing the story because i was working so hard to watch the screen i could concentrate on the movie.
i only lasted about minutes in the front could tolerate it.my family members dragged my wheelchair up the stairs,which was a very dangerous and precarious thing to do,so i could watch the movie.
plaintiffs tina smith and kathleen braddy related similar experiences sitting in the front row of the theater made smith nauseous and gave her a headache,and braddy testified that she was unable to watch a movie with her grandson from the rows of the theater because she would have had to bend her neck back to the point where her vision would have been blurry,and because the sound was not comfortable that close.
in the district court,both the plaintiffs and the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment oregon paralyzed veterans of am.regal cinemas,d.the district court recognized that the defendants movie theaters are public accommodations subject to title iii of the ada,which provides generally 
no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,leases or leases to,or operates a place of public accommodation.
a.as the district court went on to note,congress directed the department of justice doj to issue regulations that provide substantive standards applicable to facilities covered under title iii.b paralyzed veterans of am.arena,cert.denied sub nom.pollin paralyzed veterans of,d.doj,in turn,adopted as regulations a set of guidelines promulgated by the architectural and transportation barriers compliance board access board,a body charged with establish ing and maintain ing minimum guidelines and requirements for the standards issued pursuant to title iii of the b b.these regulations,known as the americans with disabilities act accessibility guidelines adaag,provide,in relevant part,as follows 
wheelchair areas shall be an integral part of any fixed seating plan and shall be provided so as to provide people with physical disabilities a choice of admission prices and lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.
in granting the defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court held that the language about lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public in does not require that seating afford patrons comparable viewing angles to those in seating.d at.the district court followed what was,at the time,the only federal appellate decision in the nation addressing the issue directly lara cinemark usa,cir.in lara,the district court had held that,based on the plain language of,seating arrangements like the ones at issue in this case failed to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements 
comparable simply means capable of being compared equivalent or similar t he present configuration of the eighteen tinseltown theaters does not afford patrons comparable lines of sight.either the row designated for patrons is too close to the screen,or the screen is too high off the ground,or a combination of both.the average viewing angle from this row is above degrees,which the plaintiffs expert witness has properly described as well into the discomfort zone.it should be stressed that this is not some abstract scientific theory which is difficult for the lay person to comprehend.it simply means that a person seated in the wheelchair row has to lift his or her eyes crane his or her neck at a very uncomfortable angle in order to view the feature on the motion picture screen the patron is denied the full and equal enjoyment of the movie going experience in these eighteen theaters.therefore,these theaters as presently configured do not conform to the requirements of the americans with disabilities act and standard.
lara cinemark usa,no,wl,at.the fifth circuit reversed,noting that questions regarding viewing angle did not arise until well after the doj promulgated section.lara,at.rather,according to the fifth circuit,the primary concern animating section was that wheelchair users have unobstructed views,not that they sit at a certain viewing angle to the screen.id.thus,the court concluded 
in light of the lack of any evidence that the access board intended section to impose a viewing angle requirement,the board recent statement that it had not yet decided whether to adopt the doj litigating position with respect to theaters,and the common meaning of lines of sight,we can not conclude that the phrase lines of sight comparable requires anything more than that theaters provide patrons with unobstructed views of the screen.to impose a viewing angle requirement at this juncture would require district courts to interpret the ada based upon the subjective and undoubtedly diverse preferences of disabled moviegoers.
the district court in this case expressly adopted the fifth circuit reasoning in lara,notwithstanding what it termed the plain meaning of.d at.the district court found support for the fifth circuit position in plaintiff acknowledgment that the stadium riser design was not adopted for movie theaters until years after section was adopted by doj.id.moreover,the court apparently adopted as a matter of law lara holding that locating the seats only in the portion of the theater did not violate requirement that the accessible seating be an integral part of any fixed seating plan even though it did not read plaintiffs first amended complaint to state such a theory of liability under the ada.d at.
the district court rejected the plaintiffs argument that doj interpretation of,as articulated in the lara litigation,was entitled to deference.id.at.doj had filed an amicus brief in the lara case in which it interpreted to require that,in theaters,wheelchair locations must be provided lines of sight in the stadium seating seats within the range of viewing angles as those offered to most of the general public in the stadium style seats,adjusted for seat tilt.the district court found that doj interpretation was not entitled to deference because,for the reasons set forth by the fifth circuit in lara,it would be unreasonable and inconsistent with the history of section including statements by the access board to interpret it to require theaters to provide moviegoers with comparable viewing angles.d at.the district court also expressed skepticism that an amicus brief was an appropriate forum to announce an agency interpretation of a rule in any case.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the plaintiffs ada claim,holding that doj interpretation of was inconsistent with the regulation and therefore not entitled to deference.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see clicks billiards,sixshooters,cir.summary judgment is warranted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.accordingly,the appellate court must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.see oliver,at.
as this court has observed,
we owe agency interpretations of their own regulations substantial deference.thomas jefferson university shalala,d.when the meaning of regulatory language is ambiguous,the agency interpretation of the regulation controls so long as it is reasonable,that is,so long as the interpretation sensibly conforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations.martin occupational safety health review comm n,d internal citations and quotations omitted.
lal immigration naturalization,cir see also id.at explaining that the assessment of an agency interpretation of a regulation,as opposed to a statute,presents a different question from the chevron line of cases simpson hegstrom,cir we generally defer to an administrator interpretation of her own regulations unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.
in this case,the district court concluded that doj interpretation of is so inconsistent with the regulation as to preclude is to say,that doj interpretation is unreasonable.that conclusion is unwarranted.the language at issue is reference to lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.webster third new international dictionary defines line of sight,in relevant part,as a line from an observer eye to a distant point as on the celestial sphere toward which he is looking or directing an observing instrument.id.at see also webster ninth new collegiate dictionary same.in the context of a movie theater,this means a line extending from the viewer eye to the points on the screen where the film is projected,taking into account the angle from the viewer eye to those points.in its engineering guideline,promulgated in,the smpte explained 
in addition to ensuring that everyone will see well,seating in the effective cine theater must avoid physical discomfort,which occurs when the vertical viewing angle to the top of the screen image is excessive or the lateral viewing angle to the centerline of the screen requires uncomfortable head and or body position.since the normal line of sight is to below the horizontal,seat backs should be tilted to elevate the normal line of sight approximately the same amount.for most viewers,physical discomfort occurs when the vertical viewing angle to the top of the screen exceeds,and when the horizontal line of sight measured between a perpendicular to his seat and the centerline of the screen exceeds.
smpte engineering guideline at.indeed,the national association of theatre owners nato,participating in this case as amicus curiae on behalf of the appellees,has advanced a similar conception of viewing angle.steven john fellman,nato position paper on wheelchair seating in motion picture theatre auditoriums nato explained that lines of sight are measured in degrees 
the question here,then,is whether it is unreasonable for doj to interpret comparable line of sight to encompass factors in addition to physical obstructions,such as viewing angle.the answer,in light of the plain meaning of the regulation both in general and as understood in the movie theater industry,is no.we do not accept the lara court suggestion that the legislative and administrative history of compels a different answer we agree that movie theaters were rare in this country until the,and the older theaters,which were built on sloping floors,did not generally create the same kinds of dramatic disparities in vertical viewing angles that theaters do.but the fact that doj may not have been contemplating issues in the context of seating at the time when was promulgated is not dispositive.rather,the issue is whether a a broad be applied to a particular factual scenario not expressly anticipated at the time the regulation was question that the supreme court has answered in the affirmative.see pennsylvania dep t of corr.yeskey,d holding that,where statutory text is unambiguous,the fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by congress does not demonstrate ambiguity.it demonstrates breadth.internal quotation marks omitted citing imrex,d.we see no reason to treat regulations differently.
iii.conclusion 
one of the central goals of title iii of the ada is to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.a.in the theaters at issue in this case,movie theater patrons must sit in seats that are objectively uncomfortable,requiring them to crane their necks and twist their bodies in order to see the screen,while patrons have a wide range of comfortable viewing locations from which to choose.we find it simply inconceivable that this arrangement could constitute full and equal enjoyment of movie theater services by disabled patrons.yet,in rejecting doj interpretation,this is precisely what the district court in this case held no matter where in the theater the seats are,and no matter how sharp the viewing angle,so long as there is no physical object standing between the disabled patron and the screen,doj is not free to interpret its own regulation as requiring anything more.
we hold that doj interpretation of lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public in to require a viewing angle for wheelchair seating within the range of angles offered to the general public in the seats is valid and entitled to deference.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their ada claim.
reversed and remanded.
i respectfully dissent.
the majority sets up a conflict with the fifth circuit adopts an unreasonable construction of the applicable regulation,and puts theater owners in a position of impossible uncertainty as to what they must do to comply with the law.
evidently the justice department has been unable to sell its litigation position within the executive branch,so it has come to the ninth circuit.the statute requires that s tandards included in regulations shall be consistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements issued by the architectural and transportation barriers compliance board,called the access board.the access board published a notice of proposed rulemaking in that it was considering promulgating new regulations for motion picture theaters because of the frequent placement of wheelchair spaces in the first few rows 
the access board notes that doj has asserted in attempting to settle particular cases that the usual wheelchair placement should be changed to give wheelchair patrons sight lines equivalent to or better than the viewing angles provided by percent of the seats in the auditorium,by elevating the wheelchair seats to the stadium section far from announcing that doj was right about what the existing regulation meant,the access board announced that the board is considering whether to include specific requirements in the final rule that are consistent with doj interpretation.the board notes the desirability of affording better sight lines to wheelchair patrons,but also notes that design professionals have expressed some uncertainty about how to measure their compliance.balancing these concerns,the board is proposing to amend the guidelines to include specific technical provisions governing sight lines 
it is striking to contrast the just approach of the access board with the unjust approach of the majority decision.when and if the access board promulgates a regulation,architects will know before a movie theater is built how they must design it,and owners of existing theaters will know what reconstruction they must perform.by contrast,under today decision,retroactive as judicial decisions generally are,thousands of movie theaters will discover that they are out of compliance with the law,and must destroy facilities built in compliance with the law according to the best knowledge of design professionals at the time.they must rebuild them to satisfy the architectural inferences design professionals will have to draw from today opinion.those inferences are obscure and debatable.though i could come up with a scheme that i think could satisfy the implications of the majority opinion,i am not sure that it would satisfy the majority,and i am entirely unable to say what is the least expensive design that would satisfy the majority.if a judge on the panel can not say just what is required,how can a movie theater owner it is irresponsible to impose on the country a decision that will require of an industry so much reconstruction,without clear guidance on what must be done.
we ought to leave the access board process alone.if the access board adopts the justice department position or something like it,the requirements will be clear,precise and prospective.though any result might be subject to substantive objections it is hard to justify a gloss on the statute that requires wheelchair users to have a better view than half or more of the seats,at least the result would be obtained after a fair process.regulating movie theater architecture retroactively by vague judicial fiat is unjust.
the access board implicitly acknowledges that the justice department is arguing for creation of new law rather than a permissible construction of existing regulations.and the structure of the existing regulations and the timing of the regulation at issue compel this conclusion.the accessibility guidelines surrounding one covering lines of written with great precision,telephone cord length must be at least and wheelchair seating knee clearance at tables and counters must be at least in mm high,in mm wide,and in mm deep.where a regulation tells movie architects and owners to the millimeter how they must construct knee space,the use of the vague term comparable must be looser by intent.it is unreasonable to infer from the regulation on the next page,lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public,something like the better than of the seats rule that the justice department has suggested.
the majority is rightly troubled by the notion of a wheelchair ghetto in one part of the movie theater with sight lines worse than those of the other patrons.but that concern is a chimera,because the regulation already speaks to that issue.it says that w hen the seating capacity exceeds,wheelchair spaces shall be provided in more than one location,and in all theaters,the wheelchair seating has to be an integral part of the seating with lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.that means that in the smaller theaters,it is permissible to group the wheelchair seating rather than to distribute it throughout the theater,but that it has to be part of the general seating footprint rather than separated,and the lines of sight can not be substantially different from those of seats available for the general public.under the existing regulations,there can not be a wheelchair ghetto out of the way,behind a post,or off to the side.
the regulation at issue,in contrast with the highly specific to the millimeter requirements of the surrounding regulations,requires that wheelchair areas be an integral part of the fixed seating plan,that they adjoin an accessible route that also serves as an emergency exit,that they be adjacent to companion seating,and that they have lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.the majority opinion disregards all the other requirements that give context to the lines of sight requirement,such as the access and emergency exit requirements.these other requirements complicate any construction plans.the integral part requirement prohibits a separate and noncontiguous wheelchair ghetto,the companion seating provision prohibits separation of the disabled from friends and family,and the access route provision assures that the disabled can get in and out of the movie theater conveniently and safely which may require that they be in the flat area in front.
what this case is really all about is the meaning of the word comparable in the lines of sight regulation.the regulation uses comparable in its sense of similar or equivalent.the question is,comparable to what evidently the justice department position is
