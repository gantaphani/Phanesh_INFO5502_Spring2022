we must decide whether the creators of the film the minotaur are collaterally estopped from pursuing a copyright infringement claim against the producers of terminator ii.
in,filia and constantinos kourtis developed the concept for a film entitled the minotaur,which details the exploits of a,that can transform itself into various human and inanimate forms.the kourtises set forth their ideas in a treatment that provides a synopsis of the prospective film.they registered this material with the worldwide register of copyrights and then hired william green to write a screenplay based upon their treatment.the agreement between green and the kourtises provided that the kourtises would own the screenplay rights.
in,the kourtises began to shop the screenplay around to various hollywood production companies.jeffrey berg,an employee of international creative management icm,received a copy,and he informed the kourtises that he would share the materials with film maker james cameron,who was an icm client.cameron contacted the kourtises and initially expressed an interest in the minotaur,but ultimately neither cameron nor anyone else agreed to produce the project.
in,cameron released the film terminator ii judgment day,the a character that can transform its appearance into both human and nonhuman forms.green responded by filing a copyright infringement action in the united states district court for the central district of california against cameron and other persons associated with terminator ii.green schwarzenegger,no.cv wmb cal.filed.green alleged that the the copyright to the minotaur screenplay and that cameron had misappropriated the minotaur concept of a character.
although filia kourtis was deposed by cameron,the kourtises did not intervene in green suit.the court ultimately found that terminator ii and the minotaur are not substantially similar and granted summary judgment to cameron and the other defendants on green copyright infringement claim.green schwarzenegger,no.cv wmb.july,at.
the kourtises,who reside in australia,then brought suit against green in an australian court to determine ownership of the minotaur materials.after the kourtises prevailed in that action,see kourtis green,vict,they filed their own suit against cameron in the central district of california,alleging copyright infringement,breach of implied contract,breach of oral contract,and breach of confidence.like green,the kourtises alleged that cameron had utilized the minotaur concept in terminator ii without providing payment or attribution.
the district court granted cameron motion to dismiss the kourtises complaint.the court concluded that the kourtises are collaterally estopped by the green decision from relitigating the copyright infringement issue.the court further held that the kourtises state law claims are barred by the statute of limitations.the kourtises timely appealed.
the kourtises argue that the green litigation does not preclude their copyright infringement claim because green allegations differ from their own and because they were not a party to the earlier proceedings 
the doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion prevents relitigation of issues actually litigated and necessarily decided,after a full and fair opportunity for litigation,in a prior proceeding.shaw,at.a federal court decision has preclusive effect where 
the issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated the first proceeding ended with a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the first proceeding.

we address these elements in turn.
there are several factors that guide our determination of whether an issue litigated in a prior case is identical to one raised in later proceedings.relevant considerations include whether there is a substantial overlap between the evidence in the two cases and whether both suits involve application of the same rule of law.see resolution trust keating,cir.
green suit alleged that cameron infringed upon the minotaur copyright by incorporating a character into terminator ii according to the district court written decision in that case,green allege d that in august,he submitted his screenplay the minotaur to jeffrey berg of icm.draft.on january,joe rosenberg at icm expressed interest and requested a second draft draft,which plaintiff provided.about two years later,icm and other defendants released terminator.thereafter,plaintiff brought this suit.green,no.cv wmb,at.green argued that the defendants have copied several unique aspects of his screenplays,including the minotaur ability to change shape.id.at.after reviewing the screenplays,the green court granted summary judgment to the defendants because no rational trier of fact could have found substantial similarity between the minotaur and terminator ii.id.at.
the sole basis for the kourtises copyright infringement claim is the allegation that cameron misappropriated the minotaur concept for use in terminator ii.see compl.the minotaur project and term.ii are more similar than terminator i and term.ii are.there was no morphing,metamorphosis of bodies or parts of bodies into other objects in term.i as there is in the minotaur project and term.ii.id.ex.comparing scenes from terminator ii and the minotaur script.notwithstanding the substantial overlap between their arguments and those advanced by green,the kourtises contend that collateral estoppel does not attach because their copyright claim is premised upon both the original minotaur treatment and the screenplay,whereas green relied exclusively upon the screenplay.the minotaur treatment,however,contributes nothing new to the infringement inquiry because the treatment elements are also prominently featured in the screenplay considered by the green court.indeed,green screenplay was wholly based upon the kourtises treatment.
the copyright infringement claim asserted by the kourtises is therefore identical to the one adjudicated in the green litigation.
collateral estoppel does not attach merely because the same issue is raised in successive suits.indeed,w e have in this nation a historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court,and we accordingly presume that a judgment or decree among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues as among them,but it does not conclude the rights of strangers to those proceedings.headwaters forest,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because the kourtises were not a party to the green litigation,they are free to relitigate the copyright infringement issue unless they were in privity with green 
privity is a legal conclusion designating a person so identified in interest with a party to former litigation that he represents precisely the same right in respect to the subject matter involved.united states schimmels,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because the concept of privity extends the reach of a judicial decision to nonparties and thereby deprives them of their own day in court,due process considerations make adequacy of representation a prerequisite to privity.indeed,the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that it would violate the due process clause to bind litigants to a judgment rendered in an earlier litigation to which they were not parties and in which they were not adequately represented.richards jefferson county,d see also,of,d some who never appeared in a prior not be collaterally estopped without litigating the issue.they have never had a chance to present their evidence and arguments on the claim.due process prohibits estopping them despite one or more existing adjudications of the identical issue which stand squarely against their position.
privity was traditionally limited to several categories of relationships,including and of property,assignors and assignees,and indemnitors and indemnitees.see headwaters,at.recent cases apply the privity concept in a much more flexible manner,however,and courts have found the existence of privity in an array of disparate circumstances summarized under the heading of virtual representation.see id.
the case law applying the virtual representation doctrine has been appropriately characterized as episodic and lacking any clear pattern,and it is therefore difficult to distill a generally applicable framework from the relevant precedent.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed see also headwaters,at asserting that the virtual representation concept is amorphous,illustrates the harm that can be done when a catchy phrase is used to describe a perfectly sensible result,and cast s more shadows than light on the problem to be decided internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.nevertheless,those relationships that courts have deemed sufficient to give rise to virtual representation do share certain features a close relationship,substantial participation,and tactical maneuvering all support a finding of virtual representation identity of interests and adequate representation are necessary to such a finding.irwin mascott,cir emphasis added.
in irwin,for example,we concluded that a corporation was the virtual representative of its senior corporate officer.id.at.in so holding,we emphasized that the officer was intimately involved in the earlier litigation and that there was no assertion that the officer interests diverged from the corporation.id.at see also trevino gates,cir holding that a child who filed a action against law enforcement officers premised upon the shooting death of her father was collaterally estopped from relitigating the punitive damages issue by her grandmother earlier suit concerning the same events because the grandmother had a tremendous incentive to recover punitive damages.
in contrast,we held in nordhorn ladish,cir,that two corporations,hitco and ladish,were not in privity with each other where ladish had no participation in or control over the earlier suit against hitco and there was no indication that hitco had any interest in ladish affairs or during or after the lawsuit against hitco.
regardless of whether privity is asserted upon one of the more traditional grounds or upon the basis of virtual representation,a conflict of interest between a and his purported representative forecloses the possibility of privity because a nonparty can not be adequately represented by a person with whom he is in conflict see council,at if there is no conflict between the organization and its members,and if the organization provides adequate representation on its members behalf,individual members not named in a lawsuit may be bound by the judgment won or lost by their organization first emphasis added.in hansberry lee,for example,a group of landowners sought to enforce a racially restrictive covenant against property holders.the covenant was only operative if approved by of the neighborhood landowners,and the defendants contested its validity on that ground.id.at.relying upon a prior proceeding to which the property holders were not a party,the illinois courts held that the defendants challenge was precluded because the litigants to the earlier case had stipulated that the requisite number of landowners had indeed assented to the covenant.id.at.
the supreme court reversed and held that it was inconsistent with due process to bind the property holders to that stipulation because none of the parties to the previous case had adequately represented their interests.id.at.the court emphasized that the plaintiffs in the earlier litigation were attempting to enforce the restrictive covenant,whereas the defendants in the present case were seeking to invalidate it.id.at.on the basis of this conflict,the court concluded that the property holders had not been adequately represented by the prior plaintiffs.see id.in seeking to enforce the agreement the plaintiffs in the earlier suit were not representing the property holders whose substantial interest is in resisting performance.
here,the district court premised the existence of privity upon the agency relationship that was created when the kourtises hired green to write the minotaur screenplay.the court concluded that green interests in the action are identical to the kourtises interests,and green and the kourtis plaintiffs share tremendous incentive to achieve a decision in their favor,namely,a determination that defendants infringed their copyrights.dist.order.
while the district court is correct that both green and the kourtises have an interest in establishing that terminator ii infringed upon the minotaur,parallel legal interests alone,identical or otherwise,are not sufficient to establish privity.headwaters,at.both identity of interests and adequate representation are necessary.irwin,at emphasis added.
the agency relationship between green and the kourtises does not satisfy the requirement.green was not acting as the kourtises agent when pursuing his claim against cameron the kourtises did not direct him to file suit and they did not stand to share in the recovery if he prevailed.ftc garvey,cir holding that res judicata bars a claim brought against an indemnitee if the same claim has already been pursued against the indemnitor in its capacity as indemnitor.moreover,green litigating position was adverse to the kourtises because it was premised upon the allegation that the the minotaur copyright.thus,like the property holders in hansberry and the earlier litigants seeking to enforce the racially restrictive covenant,the kourtises and green are in conflict concerning a matter central to the issue on which preclusion is sought.in light of this conflict,it can not be said that the kourtises were adequately represented by green during the earlier proceedings.privity therefore did not exist between them.
the fact that the kourtises were aware of the green litigation and failed to intervene does not affect our collateral estoppel analysis.there is no duty of mandatory intervention imposed upon nonparties,and the decision not to intervene thus does not expose a nonparty to the earlier proceedings preclusive effects.see wright,miller cooper,supra,at rules on intervention such as.have not been drawn in compulsory terms.intervention has been conceived as a device that permits a nonparty to become a party when it wishes emphasis added.
martin wilks,d,illustrates the nature of intervention.there,a group of white firefighters brought suit challenging a city affirmative action program,which had been implemented under a consent decree that terminated litigation in which the martin plaintiffs had not participated.id.at.even though the white firefighters were aware of the prior suit and chose not to intervene,the supreme court held that they were not collaterally estopped by the earlier proceedings.id.at.the court explained that the 
law does not impose upon any person absolutely entitled to a hearing the burden of voluntary intervention in a suit to which he is a stranger unless duly summoned to appear in a legal proceeding,a person not a privy may rest assured that a judgment recovered therein will not affect his legal rights.
id.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.the court concluded that j oinder as a party,rather than knowledge of a lawsuit and an opportunity to intervene,is the method by which potential parties are subjected to the jurisdiction of the court and bound by a judgment or decree.id.at.
the onus therefore rested with cameron to join the kourtises to the green litigation.the kourtises themselves were under no obligation to intervene,and they are free to pursue their copyright infringement claim in this suit because they were neither parties to the green case nor in privity with a party.
cameron asserts that there exist several alternative grounds for affirming the dismissal of the kourtises copyright infringement claim.
cameron first argues that the kourtises lack standing to pursue an infringement claim because they do not allege ownership of the minotaur copyright.this contention is belied by the complaint,in which the kourtises explicitly allege that they own the copyright to the minotaur.see compl.in early and kourtis developed original creative material concept for a feature film entitled the minotaur
