robert muzikowski has devoted years of his life to coaching little league baseball teams in economically depressed areas of chicago.his commitment to this pursuit led to a book about the league he,and later to a movie produced by defendant paramount pictures entitled hardball,which was based on the book.muzikowski regarded the movie as defamatory and sued paramount,claiming that one particular character that muzikowski believed was easily identifiable as himself was portrayed in a negative way,and that this amounted to disseminating falsehoods about him and about his league.
this is the second time that muzikowski has asked this court to reverse a judgment in favor of paramount.see muzikowski paramount pictures,cir muzikowski i.after considering his first appeal,we concluded that the district court should not have granted paramount motion to dismiss,because the heightened pleading standard that the illinois courts use does not apply in federal court to a claim of defamation per se.id.at.when muzikowski returned to the district court,he took advantage of his lawsuit second lease on life to add several new claims.nevertheless,the district court again rejected his suit and granted summary judgment for paramount.to top things off,the court sanctioned muzikowski lawyers from the law firm schuyler,roche zwirner srz for their repeated failure to abide by an order requiring them to identify the documents they planned to use at trial in support of muzikowski claims.
muzikowski now challenges the district court grant of summary judgment to paramount on each of his claims.in a separate appeal,srz contests the district court sanctions order.we affirm both of the district court decisions.
because the underlying facts of this case are summarized in our earlier decision,we repeat only those facts relevant to the issues raised in this round of appeals.
since,muzikowski has been involved in founding and coaching little league programs in chicago.in,author daniel coyle,who had served as an assistant coach of a team in a league in which muzikowski had been involved,published a work of titled hardball a season in the projects.although this book focused on the children in the baseball league,it also devoted some attention to the coaches,including muzikowski.
in,paramount acquired the motion picture rights to the book several years later,in,it released the hardball film.the film told the story of a little league coach named conor.although the movie claimed that it was a fictitious story and no actual persons,events or organizations have been portrayed,the character had many similarities to muzikowski.both came from backgrounds both were involved in a bar fight in which they cut their hand both were jailed as a result both experienced the death of their father and financial difficulties.nevertheless,there were also differences between the real muzikowski and the fictional.some were benign and others painted as a far less reputable figure.on the neutral side,there is nothing in the name conor that would make one think of robert muzikowski.also,is single with no children,unlike muzikowski.coached only one team,while muzikowski cofounded and ran more than one league,in addition to coaching his teams.other differences were more troublesome unlike muzikowski,who had a history of alcohol and drug abuse that he successfully overcame,was still an alcoholic at the time of the events portrayed in the film was a compulsive gambler and original motivation for becoming involved in the team was a selfish desire to pay off a gambling debt.
muzikowski was not flattered by the attention he received because of the film.to the contrary,he was convinced that the movie was a thinly disguised biography of him,although at one point he conceded that no fewer than three characters in the film could be construed to be him.muzikowski felt that the movie portrayed him in a false and unflattering light,implying wrongly that he like the character had a drinking problem and that he like became a little league coach in order to pay off a gambling debt,rather than out of a desire to help children.offended and determined to protect his name,muzikowski sued paramount for defamation and false light invasion of privacy under illinois law.
in the initial proceeding before the district court,the court dismissed muzikowski complaint under rule b,concluding that he had failed to state a claim for defamation per se under illinois law because the hardball film was reasonably capable of an innocent construction,meaning,for this purpose,that it could have been referring to someone other than muzikowski.we reversed,holding that although the district court acted correctly by applying illinois substantive law,it improperly held muzikowski to illinois heightened pleading standard rather than the notice pleading requirements of federal rule.under the more lenient federal pleading standard,we explained,muzikowski might still be able to produce evidence showing that there is in fact no reasonable interpretation of the movie that would support an innocent construction.muzikowski i,at.we reached the same conclusion concerning muzikowski false light invasion of privacy claim,explaining that o ur analysis of the false light claim tracks our assessment of the claim for defamation per se.id.
back in the district court,muzikowski amended his complaint,adding new defamation counts and theories of false advertising,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and unjust enrichment.this time,the case proceeded to summary judgment.based on the record presented by the parties submissions,the district court granted summary judgment to paramount.the court also sanctioned muzikowski lawyers for their repeated failure to abide by its orders to identify the documents they planned to use at trial to support muzikowski claims.it ordered srz to pay paramount.muzikowski and srz have each appealed.
the two primary theories on which muzikowski relies are defamation per se and the branch of the common law tort of invasion of privacy that penalizes portrayal of the plaintiff in a false light.we therefore address those arguments first.
the supreme court of illinois recently summarized the law of defamation in tuite corbitt,wl,as follows 
a statement is defamatory if it tends to harm a person reputation to the extent that it lowers that person in the eyes of the community or deters others from associating with that person statements may be considered defamatory per se or defamatory per quod a statement is defamatory per se if its defamatory character is obvious and apparent on its face and injury to the plaintiff reputation may be presumed in a defamation per quod action,damage to the plaintiff reputation is not presumed.rather,the plaintiff must plead and prove special damages to recover 
in illinois,there are five categories of statements that are defamatory per se statements imputing the commission of a crime statements imputing infection with a loathsome communicable disease statements imputing an inability to perform or want of integrity in performing employment duties statements imputing a lack of ability or that otherwise prejudice a person in his or her profession or business and statements imputing adultery or fornication however,even if a statement falls into one of the categories of words that are defamatory per se,it will not be actionable per se if it is reasonably capable of an innocent construction 
wl at citations omitted.muzikowski,like the plaintiff in tuite,relies here on the theory of defamation per se.
in contrast to a claim of defamation per quod,for which a plaintiff is required to show extrinsic facts to explain a statement defamatory meaning,a plaintiff claiming defamation per se is not required to prove damages,since the words used are so obviously and materially harmful to the plaintiff that injury to his reputation may be presumed.kolegas heftel broadcasting,see also muzikowski i,at.in order to prove defamation per se,a plaintiff must show that her claim fits into one of the five categories summarized in tuite,supra.see also bryson news am.publ ns.as the state supreme court reaffirmed in tuite,however,even if a statement falls into a recognized per se category,it will not be actionable if it may reasonably be innocently interpreted or reasonably be interpreted as referring to someone other than the plaintiff.tuite,wl at quoting chapski copley press,solaia,llc specialty publ g,same.illinois has chosen a difficult standard to meet,as if a statement is capable of two reasonable constructions,one defamatory and one innocent,the innocent one will prevail.muzikowski i,at citing anderson vanden dorpel.the supreme court has recognized that its version of the innocent construction rule which applies only to per se actions favors defendants,but it has concluded that the tougher standard is warranted because damages are presumed in per se actions.tuite,wl at anderson,at.
in muzikowski i,we ruled that muzikowski complaint adequately alleged for purposes of fed.civ.that the portrayal of as an unlicensed securities broker injured muzikowski professionally muzikowski is a licensed securities broker and insurance salesman,and that the portrayal of committing crimes such as theft injured muzikowski reputation as well.we held that,on remand,muzikowski had to overcome the innocent construction rule by demonstrating that no one could think that anyone but him was meant,and the changes to his character,far from supporting an innocent construction that is a fictional or different person,only serve to defame him muzikowski i,at.
by reversing the district court grant of paramount motion to dismiss,and by noting that facts beyond those that appear in muzikowski federal complaint may be relevant to the reasonableness inquiry,id.at,we indicated to the district court that muzikowski was entitled to proceed with discovery.at the same time,we warned that the most serious hurdle muzikowski faces is the question whether he has in essence pleaded himself out of court,by showing that the federal trier of fact whether judge or jury would be compelled to find an innocent construction of the movie.id.at.we also acknowledged that a s the case develops further,of course,it is entirely possible that paramount will be able to produce enough facts to support its innocent construction argument.id.at.in short,we left open the possibility that paramount might prevail at a later stage,depending on how the evidence relevant to the innocent construction rule developed.
rather than focusing on remand on the evidentiary burden we outlined,muzikowski instead argued to the district court that our decision definitively resolved in his favor the question whether he had presented sufficient evidence on the innocent construction issue to reach a jury.the district court interpreted our opinion otherwise it granted paramount summary judgment on the merits,explaining that t he allegedly defamatory portrayal can be construed as not referring to muzikowski or to any real person at all because the innocent construction rule applies,no issues remain for a jury to decide with respect to these claims,and paramount is entitled to summary judgment.
on appeal,muzikowski urges this court to find that the law of the case establishes that paramount can not take advantage of the innocent construction rule.unfortunately,however,he has misunderstood our statement made in the generous procedural setting of review under.b,which assumes all facts and inferences favorably to the plaintiff that the similarities between himself and could cause a reasonable person in the community to believe that was intended to depict him and that paramount intended hardball mischaracterizations to refer to him.muzikowski i,at.this sentence fragment can be understood properly only in the broader context of our discussion of the question whether muzikowski original complaint met rule notice pleading standards.what we said was this 
muzikowski claim for defamation per se does not fall under the special pleading regime of rule,and thus he is entitled to the usual rules for notice pleading established by rule.even if muzikowski complaint would not have met illinois heightened pleading standard,we are satisfied that it was sufficient to put paramount on notice of his claim.in his complaint,he lists in great detail many similarities between himself and that could cause a reasonable person in the community to believe that was intended to depict him and that paramount intended hardball mischaracterizations to refer to him.
id.we went on to hold that in order to reach a jury,muzikowski first had to show that the innocent construction rule should not apply to paramount representation of.id.
in tuite,the supreme court of illinois was asked to jettison the innocent construction rule and join the majority of states,but it declined the invitation.instead,it reaffirmed several important points about the rule.first,it confirmed that the rule must be applied in a contextual,manner 
a written or oral statement is to be considered in context,with the words and the implications therefrom given their natural and obvious meaning if,as so construed,the statement may reasonably be innocently interpreted or reasonably be interpreted as referring to someone other than the plaintiff it can not be actionable per se.
tuite,wl at,quoting from chapski,at.next,it reiterated that statements reasonably capable of an innocent construction should be interpreted as nondefamatory,citing mittelman witous.tuite,wl at.finally,following bryson,the court held that the innocent construction rule does not require courts to strain to find an unnatural innocent meaning for a statement when a defamatory meaning is far more reasonable.id.at.
although tuite had not yet been decided when this case was before the district court,the principles it announced were already well established.it was the district court job to decide whether,in light of the summary judgment record,the statements in hardball could reasonably,without undue strain be interpreted innocently or as referring to someone other than muzikowski.it was predictable that this would be a difficult task for muzikowski,but it was not a fool errand.the pleadings indicated that there are a great many similarities between the character and muzikowski.as muzikowski emphasizes,in addition to coaching little league on the west side of chicago,both he and share irish descent and working class backgrounds,have at some point gambled on sports and engaged in heavy drinking,have some affiliation with security brokerage firms,and are regulars at a bar named duffy.there are also some important differences between muzikowski and.to be sure,some of those differences portray as a disreputable character.for example,unlike muzikowski,who kicked his drinking habit years before becoming involved with little league,continues to drink throughout the hardball film.while muzikowski motives for becoming involved in the league were altruistic,began coaching as a means to pay off a gambling debt.whereas is the coach of a single team,muzikowski and ran more than one league in addition to coaching his teams.
if this were all that the record contained,we would be tempted to ask the supreme court of illinois whether liability can be avoided if the only details that distinguish the plaintiff from the character described by the defendant are themselves defamatory.none of the cases that we have examined present that situation,and we are far from confident that illinois would adopt a rule under which the more defamatory the movie was,the better the studio defense would be.see,geisler petrocelli,cir springer viking press,kupferman,dissenting.but,as we explained earlier,the record in our case is not so.differences were also evident.the two men had different names one had children and the other did not and was less involved with the little league program.
the district court concluded that the acknowledged similarities between muzikowski and demonstrate d only that reasonable viewers could see the connection muzikowski detects between himself and the film protagonist,not that they must.it was important though not dispositive that the character in hardball did not share muzikowski name.we acknowledge that certain similarities between muzikowski and are striking enough
