this case comes to us on appeal from summary judgment,in an enforcement action brought by the united states under title iii of the americans with disabilities act of ada,granting relief against two companies.at issue is the placement of wheelchair spaces in their movie theaters.similar cases have divided the circuits on the interpretation and application of a longstanding regulation designed to implement the ada accessibility requirements for movie theaters,concert halls,and like venues.
the ada was enacted to remove barriers to equal participation by the disabled in community life.see.the statute contains provisions,both general and specific,that apply to the design and construction of movie theaters and other facilities of public accommodation.relying heavily upon the concept of discrimination,the statute aims to assure a substantial measure of equality and integration for the disabled who use such facilities the provisions describing the overall prohibition of discrimination are cast in quite general terms,full and equal enjoyment,most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual.id.a b.other provisions,also generally phrased,govern new construction and alteration 
to provide guidance for those who must comply,congress created a scheme.an existing government architectural and transportation barriers compliance board,widely referred to as the access board was directed to create new minimum guidelines supplementing accessibility guidelines within nine months of the ada enactment.the access board has representatives from numerous government agencies,including the justice department,and presumably has much experience with architectural issues.
the statute further required the attorney general within one year to promulgate regulations of his own consistent with the minimum guidelines issued by the access board.b c.the justice department was also directed to provide technical assistance to the public in coordination with the access board,including in the form of technical assistance manuals.id.a c.after overlapping periods,the access board adopted the required minimum guidelines and,on the same day,the justice department adopted them as ada regulations without change 
one of the is the focus of this known as standard and prescribes the placement of wheelchair spaces in newly constructed assembly areas set for first occupancy after january,and for alterations occurring after january.the language most pertinent to this case reads as follows 
wheelchair areas shall be an integral part of any fixed seating plan and shall be provided so as to provide people with physical disabilities a choice of admission prices and lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.
id.pt.app.a.further language requires a companion fixed seat next to each wheelchair seating area and provides that,where total seating capacity in the facility exceeds,wheelchair spaces shall be provided in more than one location.id.the standard contains no definition of lines of sight,integral or any other term of art.
in,when the regulations including standard were adopted,most movie theaters were of a traditional type in which all seats are located on a single flat or sloped floor.in or around,the new stadium movie theater concept was developed.typically,a few rows of traditional seating on a flat or sloped floor were retained at the front of the auditorium,and behind them rose the majority of the seats on tiers of stepped in many sports stadiums.somewhat confusingly,the term stadium is also often used to refer just to the section of the seating area on risers at least,where the risers create a steep enough incline,as opposed to the more gently sloped seating area in front,which we will call for simplicity sake the slope.
between and,the defendants in this big theater chains called hoyts and large numbers of stadium theaters,including the or so at issue in this case,ranging in size from fewer than seats to more than seats.most are roughly in the seat range of the hoyts theaters at issue,have seats or more,and of the national theaters,have seats or more.these theaters are of many different designs,and the accommodations for wheelchairs vary but in a great many of them the wheelchair positions are clustered together with an ordinary companion seat for each wheelchair space in the sloped section of the theater.
in smaller theaters with seats or fewer,wheelchair spaces are typically in the sloped section,although in a few cases the spaces are at the back of the theater or depending on how one labels spaces in an access aisle separating the slope from the stadium arguably in the first row of the stadium section.in larger theaters with more than seats,for which standard requires more than one location,wheelchair spaces are dispersed accordingly,usually with some at the rear of the auditorium.wheelchair placement decisions appear not to be irreversible in some theaters,wheelchair spaces were initially placed in the front row,but later moved further back.
during the period from to,as theaters grew in number,the justice department made no changes to standard,although in july the department filed an amicus brief in a private ada enforcement action brought in district court against an individual theater complex.lara cinemark usa,no,wl,at.there,the department asserted that unobstructed lines of sight from wheelchair spaces were not enough rather,the department urged that under the ada and standard,the quality of sight measured primarily by horizontal and vertical angles from the viewer to the to be comparable with those enjoyed by many or most patrons.
on appeal the fifth circuit flatly rejected the department position,holding that the existing regulations required only unobstructed lines of sight,lara cinemark usa,cir,cert.denied,d.further litigation followed in other circuits.two of sixth and that viewing angles were a component of comparable lines of sight and that patrons could not as a group be subject to highly uncomfortable viewing angles while superior angles were provided for other patrons 
in each of these cases,the department appears to have asserted that the integral part phrase in standard requires wheelchair spaces to be located in the stadium section of stadium theaters,regardless of the size of the theater and the adequacy of viewing angles provided from the slope.however,an access board technical manual issued in july said that wheelchair spaces had to be within the footprint of the seating layout and that bleachers with notches or areas would qualify as integrated.access board,adaag manual.the circuit cases,concerned primarily with viewing angles,have not clearly addressed the extent to which integration is required.
on december,the justice department brought the present enforcement action under the ada,filing lawsuits later consolidated against hoyts and national,in the district court in massachusetts.the complaints charged that a number of theaters controlled by these companies were in violation of the ada and standard.they sought declaratory and injunctive retrofitting existing well as damages and civil penalties.ultimately,the government contended that each company had more than two hundred theaters.
discovery ensued,including reports by and depositions of experts on both sides.the district court refused to allow discovery of justice department files by which the defendants sought to show that the department had been divided in its view of standard or even had once embraced the defendants interpretation.however,the district court did dismiss one count of the complaints,to the extent that it relied on statutory duties beyond those imposed by standard the court viewed the regulation as establishing the defendants present obligations under title iii as to wheelchair placement.amusements,d at 
eventually the defendants moved for summary judgment the department opposed the motion without asking for summary judgment in its favor.the defendants argued that the fifth circuit lara decision was correct,and that their obligation under standard was to provide unobstructed lines of sight,which they had done.the district court held an oral hearing on september,at which it described its own tentative views and invited further submissions to supplement the record.
on march,the court issued an extensive decision,denying the defendants motion for summary judgment but granting sua sponte summary judgment for the department to the extent of providing declaratory but not injunctive relief.united states hoyts cinemas,d.the court then entered judgment to this effect and closed the case on its docket.both sides treat this as a final judgment and,noting the district court docket entry and the lack of any commitment to further proceedings,so do we.
the district court declaration,embodied in the judgment,says that standard in all cases and regardless of stadium placing wheelchair spaces in the stadium section of the theater.hoyts cinemas,d at.however,as a matter of due process and in light of the lack of clarity in standard,the district court ruled that this obligation would only be applied to those of the defendants theaters wherein construction or refurbishment occurs on or after the date on which this lawsuit commenced,that is,december.id.from this judgment,both sides have appealed.
the defendants appeals primarily contest the district court reading of standard and the decision to make the ruling retroactive to the start of this case,but the defendants also offer procedural and discovery objections.the government primarily defends the district court substantive ruling,although saying that the court went too far in seeming to condemn wheelchair spaces that provide comparable viewing and are on on risers shorter than the court understanding of stadium would imply.the government main claim of error on its is that greater retroactivity should have been afforded to the district court ruling.
in our court,briefing followed and oral argument was held february.however,at that time a petition for certiorari was pending in the supreme court seeking review of the ninth circuit decision in regal cinemas based on the conflict with lara,so we withheld decision.but the solicitor general later opposed certiorari,noting that a new access board amendment would soon provide further guidance.virtually at the end of its term,the court denied review.regal cinemas,stewmon,d.
the access board amendment,just adopted in july requires that in assembly areas of more than seats,wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed and shall provide wheelchair users a choice of seating locations and viewing angles that are substantially equivalent to,or better than,those available to all other spectators.americans with disabilities act ada accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities amended adaag,july,to be codified at pt.app.b.in smaller theaters,no vertical dispersal would be required if the wheelchair spaces provided viewing angles that are equivalent to,or better than,the average viewing angle provided in the facility.id.at.
on these appeals,we address in order three principal issues first,whether section supports either the defendants claim that their obligations are limited to unobstructed lines of sight or the department claim that wheelchair locations must always be in the stadium section of every theater second,whether the district court correctly ruled that wheelchair placement in the stadium section is automatically required for all stadium theaters based on the alleged factual superiority of such seating and third,whether the district court retroactivity ruling is correct.other issues are presented but are most easily addressed within this framework.
standard.the defendants appear to have built many,perhaps most or all,of the stadium theaters in question on the premise that their central obligation was to provide wheelchair spaces with unobstructed lines of sight,anywhere within the plan of each theater.usually they found it most convenient to place the wheelchair spaces in the sloped section sometimes though not always near the front,but other times wheelchair spaces were placed in the front row or so of the stadium section or at the very back.in considering the defendants defense of this approach,the initial question is the substantive legal standard against which to measure it.
here,the government complaint challenged the defendants seating arrangements in two counts,one resting upon a the regulation statutory bases,and the other resting mainly upon a set of more general statutory provisions bearing upon accommodations.the district court dismissed the second count to the extent that it sought to impose obligations beyond the more specific standard,amusements,d at,and the government has not taken direct issue with this approach.
we accept this premise because neither side disputes it and because it makes more sense to focus upon a somewhat uncertain regulation directed to the very problem at hand rather than an even vaguer set of statutory provisions framed in more general terms.nevertheless,the statute as a whole remains highly relevant.it provides the purpose and general objectives that cast light on the meaning of the regulation at issue.see navarro pfizer,cir.
turning to standard,we note at the outset that it has two pertinent directed to comparability of lines of sight and the other to assuring that wheelchair spaces are made an integral part of the theater seating plan.these two elements correspond to two themes that run through title iii of the ada.title iii main thrust is to secure access for the disabled,but many of the provisions are aimed at assuring not only reasonable access but reasonable equality of access so far as feasible,while other provisions are concerned with the related but distinct aim of preventing undue segregation of the disabled.see note,above.
the defendants theaters at issue in this case do provide wheelchair access there are locations provided for wheelchairs,feasible means of reaching them,and apparently unobstructed lines of sight.the defendants say that this is all that the regulation requires and that standard does not dictate that angles of sight for those seated in wheelchairs be as good as those for patrons seated higher up in the theaters.and,say the defendants,quality of viewing aside,the regulation certainly does not say that there is a mechanical obligation to place wheelchair spaces in the stadium section of the theater.
we start with the issue of angles of sight.admittedly,the defendants position has been adopted by one circuit in lara,seconded by a strong dissent in the ninth circuit regal cinemas decision.at kleinfeld,dissenting.it gains some force from the broader context the regulations were intended to provide guidance and it would have been child play for the drafters to make clear that the lines of sight requirement encompassed not only unobstructed classic problem for wheelchair occupants in many types of auditoriums and arenas especially where spectators tend to stand but also angles of sight.yet the department and the access board apparently took no such position until.
while all of this is relevant to the equities that inform a decision on retroactive relief,we think that the better reading of the regulation is that it takes angles of sight into account.admittedly,the drafters may not have thought about angles at all there is no clear legislative history.but judges constantly read statutes and regulations in light of language,purpose,and other policy considerations to solve problems that the drafters may not have squarely considered.see versyss,coopers lybrand,cir,cert.denied,d.on balance,the considerations favor the government.
words are the usual starting point in interpretation.lines of sight is a fairly general phrase,no doubt capable of being used to refer only to an unobstructed view but its very generality makes it capable of encompassing comparability of angles as well as freedom from obstruction.each side can muster dictionary glosses but it is enough here that those favoring the government are at least as good as those favoring the defendants.then,the balance is easily tipped by the underlying policy of the statute.
the ada places substantial emphasis on equality of access.see,a,a.as a matter of common sense,this can not be absolute equality a chair for ordinary patrons does not therefore entail a platform for a wheelchair.but at least in some theater layouts,the evidence indicates that lines of sight for wheelchair patrons could be quite uncomfortable and distorting.see regal cinemas,at.if most or all of the wheelchair sites in the theater have badly degraded views and most or all of the seats have good viewing angles,the basic objective of the statute would surely be undermined.
extreme angles in either the vertical or horizontal planes have a double discomfort,especially if the head has to be tilted back too far,and visual distortion.true,some patrons have unusual preferences and some seats are always going to be worse than others but even before the ada the evidence shows an understanding in the theater design business that extreme angles are inferior.the government and the theaters evidence may suggest that vertical angles exceeding degrees to the top of the screen or degrees to the center are less than comfortable but whatever the right numbers,the record shows that severe angles at some stage grow markedly less satisfactory to many patrons.
in sum,the statutory objective can best be carried out by applying standard comparability requirement to angles of sight as well as lack of obstruction.whether the standard was initially clear enough to justify applying this interpretation to theaters constructed before the district court decision is a separate issue to which we will return.just what comparability may require is also a different question it is harder to provide guidance on this issue because of the variety of approaches available,the character of the issue,and the lack of adequate briefing.
in reaching our conclusion,we give some weight to the justice department interpretation of the regulation.such deference is proper even though the department gloss is offered only in a brief rather than in some more formal manner,an interpretive ruling,see auer robbins,d,although the courts must then be alert to the risk of post hoc rationalizations.id.at.see bowen georgetown,d discounting a convenient litigating position.the department position on angles has been consistent since lara.see thomas jefferson shalala,d.
admittedly,standard was drafted by the access board and adopted mechanically by the department on the same day.but there remain institutional reasons for giving some weight to the department reading,paralyzed veterans of am.arena,cert.denied,d navarro,at,although one conventional reason for well justify giving some weight to the views of the board itself.in any event the board technical manual agrees that b oth the horizontal and vertical viewing angles must be considered in the design of assembly areas.access board,supra,at.
where our reading of standard differs from that of the department is on the second integral the government says requires that wheelchair spaces always be placed in the stadium section.here,two possible positions must be distinguished first,that standard requires this result as a matter of law even if the quality of viewing from the slope is as good as that in the stadium section or second,that as a factual matter placing wheelchair spaces in the stadium section is required in a particular theater the department thinks is view from the slope is worse than from the stadium.
at different times the government has taken each of these positions the two arguments rest on different concepts and have different results,namely for theaters that offer slope seating comparable in quality to seating in the stadium.no circuit court has adopted a reading of the word integral that automatically compels wheelchair siting in all stadium sections regardless of quality.we reject such a reading of integral and now explain why,reserving for discussion later the department more modest factual argument that quality differences commonly justify wheelchair seating in the stadium area.
integration is inherently a matter of could have a wheelchair space in every row of the the term integral does not tell one anything about how much integration is required.read straightforwardly,integral means that the wheelchair locations must be a constituent part of the theater,see random house dictionary of the english language ed.the access board took just this view in its technical manual,saying that integral required wheelchair locations to come within the footprint of the seating layout.access board,supra,at.
further,the same technical manual deals directly with dispersal.pertinently,it says that in theaters of over,wheelchair spaces must be provided in all areas,including sky boxes and specialty areas.access board,supra,at.the converse implication is that in smaller theaters there is no automatic requirement that wheelchair spaces be in any specific location.of course,in a particular theater perhaps in most,comparability might require stadium locations for this is a different issue,dependent upon evidence 
angles of sight were a familiar aspect of theater design when the standard was framed,and there is nothing implausible about reading lines of sight to encompass the angles at which the lines connect the viewer to the screen.but the term integral was adopted in standard before there were stadium theaters.to read it as mechanically requiring wheelchair spaces in a particular part of the theater,regardless of the adequacy of the view from the slope,appears to us not to gloss the word but to rewrite the regulation in a fashion that could not reasonably be anticipated.
deference to the agency view does not mean abdication.here,the department gloss unlike that in the access board manual is an unnatural reading of integral,advanced inconstantly in this very case,and peculiarly rigid and specific as applied to a class of theaters not conceived of until well after the standard was written and adopted.the department is free to interpret reasonably an existing regulation without formally amending it but where,as here,the interpretation has the practical effect of altering the regulation,a formal certainly prospective and after notice and the proper course 
the district court main ruling.the district court,confronted with the defendants motion for summary judgment,instead granted summary judgment for the government.its holding,and main rationale for that holding,can be summed up in the district court own language 
s theaters can not possibly offer lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public when seats are placed only in the section,whether on risers or otherwise.
hoyts cinemas,d at quoting pt.app.a.the court also said that such seating could not be integral,but this ruling rested expressly on the same premise,namely,the superiority of the stadium section.id.at.
the district court bases for this factual conclusion appear to be three the district judge taking of judicial notice that movie patrons prefer the middle or back of the theater several assertions by the district judge as to why stadium seating is superior and what the district judge called a matter of simple geometry,namely,that theater seats in the stadium section,which is further back than the slope,offer patrons narrower and flatter sight lines.hoyts cinemas,d at.
on appeal,the defendants lodge an initial procedural objection,pointing out that there was no for summary judgment by the government.there is nothing impermissible in considering a grant of summary judgment sua sponte,but it is then ordinarily vital for the court to give the parties notice.without such notice,the opponent of such a disposition may be deprived of the chance to muster affidavits and other evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact precludes summary judgment.see rogan menino,cir,cert.denied,d berkovitz home box office,cir.
in the oral argument on the defendants motion,the district court did give the parties some notice of its tentative thinking,and the court also gave the parties opportunity to make further written submissions,in particular inviting them to reconsider the integral problem.indeed,on appeal the defendants rely on evidence already in the record as precluding summary judgment whether with better notice they would have offered even more evidence is unclear.
we need not resolve the procedural objection.on the present record we conclude that the district court has not justified a finding that condemns each and every theater that provides slope but not stadium spaces for wheelchairs.a trial,or perhaps even summary judgment backed by more evidence and further analysis,might justify such a result for many of the most or even all.but the district court blanket all wheelchair placement is inferior,whatever the size or configuration of the multiply flawed.
we begin with the district judge reliance on judicial notice to establish the preferences of movie theater patrons.deciding whether facts are adjudicative,and so subject to stringent substantive and procedural requirements,is often no easy task as one moves further back on the spectrum from the what happened here kinds of issues.see united states bello,cir.a advisory committee note.but the seating preferences of patrons in stadium theaters are a central issue in this case the district court deemed it adjudicative by relying on rule,and the government does not argue otherwise.
one of the requirements of rule is procedural,namely,that the parties be given notice and an opportunity to object to the taking of judicial notice.see cooperativa de ahorro y credito aguada kidder,peabody,cir,cert.denied,d.the district judge did refer in the hearing to his own experience in a particular stadium theater,but this is less than a warning that judicial notice will be used to convert this single instance into a universal proposition that may not be disputed.in any event the rule also requires both that the noticed fact be not subject to reasonable dispute and that it be so either on the basis of general knowledge within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or because it is capable of being determined by an assuredly accurate source.
to support the district court judgment,the preference for middle to rear seating must be not just common but ubiquitous,applying to every movie theater regardless of size or configuration.the district court decree applies to all of the defendants many theaters where wheelchair spaces are not in the stadium hundred in number,designed by different architects,and scattered across the united states.possibly,most of the audience in every single theater at issue prefers stadium seating,but this can not a priori be beyond reasonable dispute.
nor does rule source requirement appear met.it may be common knowledge in boston that seating at a particular theater is best in the middle or back,although this would be much more plausible in a small,town but surely residents of boston have no such common knowledge about particular theaters in other states.nor does the district court point to an unquestionably accurate respectable almanac is the usual support its proposition.as we will see,the district court proposition is colorably disputed,as to some theaters,by defense evidence in this very case.
rule is applied with some stringency,because accepting disputed factual propositions about a case not tested in the crucible of trial is a sharp departure from standard practice.lussier runyon,cir,cert.denied,d new alliance party state bd.of elections,ballot position bias may be a belief in this jurisdiction,but its imprecise and conditional nature preclude it from being characterized as a judicially noticed fact.here,theater seating preferences were a matter for evidence,not judicial notice.
the district court second basis for its finding of superiority was a set of general observations about the qualities of stadium seating.specifically,the court said that stadium seating being further back has less risk of image distortion and excessively wide horizontal or uncomfortable vertical angles of sight,and also that the stadium seats are larger,more comfortable,better elevated over seats in front and endowed with wider arm rests with cup holders and ability.no source is given for these propositions beyond the statement that they are gleaned from the record of undisputed facts.hoyts cinemas,d at.
it is not clear why the quality of the theater seats themselves matters since wheelchair patrons apparently use spaces for their chairs rather than theater seats.but the angle and distortion considerations are plausible reasons why many perhaps most patrons,in many perhaps most theaters,might prefer seating in the stadium section.yet it is hardly obvious that this would be true in every stadium theater regardless of configuration.
further,the question on summary judgment is not whether the district court assumptions might prove right but whether the government affidavits and other evidence are so overwhelming that there is no basis for a trial and specific factual findings.celotex catrett,d.a.here,the defendants did point to evidence that viewers in particular theaters found some seats in the slope or in the access aisle equally attractive to some seats in the stadium,and that in others wheelchair spaces in the slope had quite good angles the district court decision does not discuss such evidence.
the district court last building block is its geometry argument,which is easily enough grasped moving back from an object narrows both the horizontal and vertical angles of sight from the observer to the perimeter lines of the object.indeed,if the screen is itself placed high up from the floor,stadium seats may already be closer to eye level with the screen.there is nothing wrong in using such indisputable premises for reasoning about the facts.united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
but distance has disadvantages of its own the object is further away,details smaller,and the experience perhaps less absorbing for many viewers.further,narrower angles are surely better,in any meaningful sense,only up to a point.both sides,for example,point to evidence suggesting a comfort range in the vertical plane of degrees or less where such views are provided on the slope,this could arguably provide comfort comparable to stadium seats even if the latter had still flatter angles.
on appeal,the government makes no effort to sustain the district court judgment by arguing that its evidence shows,so overwhelmingly as to justify summary judgment,that in every theater the quality of viewing is better from the stadium section.what its brief says about the evidence emphasis ours is that a substantial number of defendants auditoriums situate the wheelchair areas in locations that afford lines of sight that are inferior to those provided most other members of the general public.the district court judgment was not limited to a substantial number of theaters.
admittedly,the government examples and data are telling.it says that about of the theaters in dispute have wheelchair viewing angles that range from to degrees,while most of the seats have more comfortable viewing angles.it also offers some specific examples of theaters with inferior wheelchair placement,providing information about those viewing angles.and its brief points to complaints by wheelchair patrons as well as survey data showing that in one theater complex,among others identified in the record,nearly all patrons preferred stadium to slope seating.
so the government might well have a case on summary judgment for a ruling that some,many,or even most,of the defendants theaters violate the comparability requirements of standard.but on this appeal it does not ask us to affirm the district court judgment as to any individual theater.nor is this court the proper place in the first instance to sort through the evidence and decide,theater by theater,whether a particular theater should be condemned on summary judgment.a advisory committee note amendment.nor can this be done until the parties abandon the approach and deal directly with individual theaters or groups of theaters.
the government apparently did provide in the district court an expert report in which most of the theaters were condemned based on a fairly abstruse test.but by summary judgment the government had disavowed relying on the report conclusions,and the report was severely criticized by the district court,which found it confusing,ov
