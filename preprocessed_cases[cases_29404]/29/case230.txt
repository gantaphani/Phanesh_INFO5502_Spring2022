procedural and factual background 
plaintiff interview for gangland 
defendants gangland productions,and a e television networks,llc,are the producers of the documentary television series,gangland,which explores some of america most notorious gangs and the efforts of law enforcement agencies working to stop them.this lawsuit arises from a gangland episode on the history of a white supremacist gang,public enemy number.
plaintiff john doe worked as a police informant because of his personal knowledge of certain high profile gangs.in late,plaintiff was introduced to gangland producer,stephanie kovac,by a police officer.the police officer suggested that kovac may want to speak to plaintiff about public enemy number.although plaintiff was never a member of public enemy number,he was a childhood friend of scott miller,one of the gang.miller was allegedly murdered by members of public enemy number.shortly after his introduction to kovac,plaintiff agreed to be interviewed for gangland for.
plaintiff claims he told kovac that he agreed to be interviewed on the condition that his face would be concealed.plaintiff alleges that he wore a hat and a bandana to cover his face when he entered the interview room because he did not want his identity disclosed on camera.plaintiff asserts kovac told him that he did not need the hat or the bandana because his identity would be concealed through the production process.plaintiff claims he removed those items based on these representations.plaintiff emphasizes that he made it clear to kovac and the cameraman that his life would be in danger if his identity was not concealed.according to plaintiff,kovac and the cameraman told him that they understood.
in contrast,kovac asserts that before the interview,plaintiff was not wearing anything that concealed his identity.kovac claims that plaintiff was shown on a camera monitor how he would appear on the program without his face concealed in any way,and that he approved his unconcealed appearance.according to kovac,plaintiff never requested that his identity be concealed.plaintiff also posed for photographs showing his face and gang tattoos,and provided kovac additional photographs showing his face and tattoos.plaintiff admits that he had photographs taken but asserts that he believed his face and identity would be concealed in the photographs.plaintiff asserts that his tattoos alone,without his face,do not reveal his gang affiliation.
the parties also dispute whether plaintiff signed a release concerning his participation in gangland.defendants claim that when plaintiff arrived at the interview,kovac asked him to sign a release entitled program participation release and consent agreement.the release stated that the participant grants gangland productions,the right to film,record,and use his name,likeness,image,voice,interview and performance.the release further provided 
the participant agrees that participant has allowed participant real name and identity to be used in the program and,further,understands and acknowledges that revealing participant real name and identity in the program may be dangerous for participant and may result in bodily harm or death to participant.
the release also waived all claims against anyone associated with the program for infringement of rights of publicity or misappropriation,intrusion,invasion of privacy,and infliction of emotional distress.
plaintiff tells a different story.plaintiff claims that before filming his interview,and after he had been told his identity would be concealed,he was asked to sign a document.plaintiff states that he is dyslexic,is illiterate,and told kovac that he has extreme difficulty reading.kovac allegedly told plaintiff the document was just a receipt for his payment.plaintiff further alleges that he tried to have his girlfriend,who accompanied him to the interview,read the document to him before he signed it.but,according to plaintiff,kovac told him that was not necessary because it was only a receipt.because of kovac representations,plaintiff signed the document.plaintiff never received a copy of the document he signed,and he believes that the document he signed was shorter than the release submitted by defendants.
b.the gangland broadcast 
the gangland episode aired on the history channel.in the episode,several public enemy number members,with their full names and appearances disclosed,discussed the gang violent activities.one member,with his face and voice concealed,talked about his knowledge of the gang.photographs of other public enemy number members were shown with their faces concealed.plaintiff appeared in the program,identified by his nickname,and was identified as a former member of an unspecified gang.
the episode portrayed the murder of miller,of public enemy number.miller had discussed public enemy number in a television interview.his face was covered and his voice was disguised,but he was identifiable by his tattoos and other personal traits.some members believed miller had crossed the line,so he was allegedly brutally murdered.miller had been a childhood friend of plaintiff and plaintiff knew of the murder.in the episode,plaintiff talked about public enemy number and details of miller murder.the episode reported on numerous other violent crimes allegedly committed by public enemy number.
plaintiff lawsuit 
plaintiff filed a complaint and a first amended complaint after the gangland episode aired.plaintiff first amended complaint asserts claims for appropriation of likeness public disclosure of private fact false promise negligent infliction of emotional distress intentional infliction of emotional distress and declaratory relief.plaintiff alleges that after the gangland episode aired he is no longer employable as an informant for law enforcement he has received numerous death threats he was evicted from his apartment and he was threatened by gang members.he also claims that he has suffered severe emotional distress.
district court denial of defendants anti slapp motion 
defendants filed an motion to strike plaintiff first amended complaint.the district court denied the motion on the ground that the statute did not apply.doe gangland,d.as a result,the district court did not address whether plaintiff could show a probability of prevailing on the merits.defendants timely appealed 
discussion 
california anti slapp statute 
to evaluate an motion,a court engages in a inquiry.the defendant bears the initial burden to show that the statute applies because the lawsuit arises from defendant act in furtherance of its right of petition or free speech.if the defendant meets its burden,the burden shifts to plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits of each of plaintiff claims.marijanovic gray,york duffy.under the statute,if the plaintiff can not show a probability of prevailing on a claim,the claim is stricken.navellier sletten,cal th.to evaluate an motion,the court must consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.civ.proc.b.
defendants have met their burden to establish that plaintiff lawsuit arose from their protected activity 
the parties agree that for the statute to apply to plaintiff lawsuit,defendants must show that they were engaged in conduct in furtherance of the right of free speech,and in connection with an issue of public interest.civ.proc.a,e.as explained below,we hold that defendants satisfied both requirements.
defendants have shown their conduct was in furtherance of their right of free speech 
to determine whether a defendant has met its initial burden,a court must focus on the defendant activity that gives rise to its asserted liability.navellier,cal th at.by its terms,the statute includes not merely actual exercises of free speech rights but also conduct that furthers such rights.hilton hallmark cards,cir citing civ.proc.e.consequently,california courts have held that or acts such as investigating,newsgathering,and conducting interviews constitute conduct that furthers the right of free speech.taus loftus,cal th,lieberman kcop television.
plaintiff claims are based on defendants acts of interviewing plaintiff for a documentary television show and broadcasting that interview.these acts were in furtherance of defendants right of free speech.see taus,cal th at,holding that a published article and the investigation conducted in connection with the article,including an interview,constituted protected activity hall time warner,concluding that a television broadcast and an interview in connection with the broadcast constituted protected activity.
the district court erroneously reasoned that defendants were not engaged in protected activity for two primary reasons.first,when defendants motion was before the district court it was uncontested that defendants broadcast of the program was covered by the statute.gangland,d at emphasis added.the district court,however,held that the statute did not apply because the core of plaintiff complaint attacks defendants broadcast of the program without concealing his identity.id.at emphasis added.the district court incorrectly concluded that under the statute,a lawful broadcast is in furtherance of defendants right of free speech,but an unlawful broadcast is not.the district court analysis conflated the two distinct prongs of the statute.see lieberman.at explaining that to hold lawful newsgathering is an act in furtherance of one right to free speech,but unlawful newsgathering is not conflates the two prongs of the statute.
contrary to the district court analysis,a plaintiff assertion that its claims are based on defendants alleged abusive activity does not exempt a lawsuit from scrutiny.jarrow formulas,lamarche,cal th.to determine whether a defendant has met its initial burden,a court does not evaluate whether defendant conduct was lawful or unlawful.id.instead,any claimed illegitimacy of the defendant acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise and support in the second step of the analysis when the plaintiff bears the burden to show a probability of prevailing.navellier,cal th at quoting paul for council hanyecz.if it were the case that a defendant must first establish that its actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law,then the secondary inquiry as to whether the plaintiff has established a probability of success would be superfluous.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
accordingly,california courts consistently hold that defendants may satisfy their burden to show that they were engaged in conduct in furtherance of their right of free speech under the statute,even when their conduct was allegedly unlawful see taus,cal th at,holding that defendants investigation,including an interview that was allegedly fraudulently obtained,constituted protected activity hall.at same lieberman.at concluding that defendants newsgathering,including surreptitious videotape recordings that were allegedly illegally obtained,constituted protected activity.thus,plaintiff assertion that defendants fraudulently disclosed his identity has no bearing on whether defendants engaged in protected activity.
second,the district court erroneously held that defendants were not engaged in protected activity because defendants broadcast television show about gang violence merely lurks in the background of plaintiff claims.gangland productions,d at.plaintiff lawsuit arises directly from defendants act of broadcasting gangland.but for the broadcast and defendants actions in connection with that broadcast,plaintiff would have no reason to sue defendants.see,navellier,cal th at finding lawsuit arose from defendant litigation activity because but for the litigation activity,plaintiffs present claims would have no basis.
we conclude that defendants have met their burden to show that plaintiff lawsuit arises from defendants conduct in furtherance of their right of free speech 
defendants have shown their conduct was connected to a matter of public interest 
to meet their initial burden,defendants must also show that their conduct was in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.civ.proc.e.a topic of widespread,public interest satisfies this requirement.rivero am.fed of state,mun,afl cio,
in finding that defendants failed to satisfy the public interest requirement,the district court held that the gangland episode general topics of gang violence and miller murder are topics of widespread public interest,but plaintiff identity is not.gangland,d at.the district court analysis is,in part,incorrect.
the district court correctly determined that defendants gangland episode general topics of gang violence and miller murder are issues of public interest.see lieberman.at holding that a news report on the unlawful dispensing of controlled substances is an issue of great public interest.indeed,plaintiff concedes that the topics of his interview,public enemy number and miller murder,are issues of public interest.compl,stating that gang activity and the killing of a police informant is of legitimate public concern.
the district court,however,incorrectly determined that defendants were required to show an independent public interest in plaintiff identity.see gangland,d at defendants must show that including plaintiff identity in the program was in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.quoting civ.proc.e.
in taus loftus,the california supreme court did not directly address the question whether a defendant must show a specific public interest in plaintiff under the statute.cal th at.but the court public interest inquiry focused on defendants general activities,not the plaintiff.id.the court found that there can be no question that defendants general course of conduct from which plaintiff cause of action arose was clearly activity in furtherance of defendants exercise of free speech in connection with a public issue.id.emphasis added alterations in original.
several california court of appeal decisions have instructed that the proper inquiry is whether the broad topic of defendant conduct,not the plaintiff,is connected to a public issue or an issue of public interest in time warner,defendants publications on child molestation included a photograph of a little league team whose manager had pleaded guilty to molesting children he had coached.the players and the other coaches shown in the photograph sued for invasion of privacy.plaintiffs tr ied to characterize the public issue involved as being limited to the narrow question of the identity of the molestation victims.id.at.the court rejected that definition as too restrictive.id.instead,the court looked at the broad topic of defendants publications and held that the general topic of child molestation in youth sports was an issue of public interest.id.
similarly,in terry davis community church,the court found that defendants reports and meetings regarding an inappropriate relationship between plaintiff husband and plaintiff wife,church youth group leaders,and a girl in their youth group involved an issue of public interest under the statute.the court rejected plaintiffs attempt to narrow the inquiry to whether there was public interest in a private relationship between the plaintiff husband and the girl.id.at.it held that the broad topic of the report and the meetings was the protection of children in church youth programs,which is an issue of public interest.id.at.
also instructive is tamkin cbs broadcasting,which held that defendants broadcast of a television show that allegedly used plaintiffs personas was a matter of public interest.in conducting the public interest inquiry,the court explained 
we believe the statutory language compels us to focus on the conduct of the defendants and to inquire whether that conduct furthered such defendants exercise of their free speech rights concerning a matter of public interest.we find no requirement in the statute that the plaintiff persona be a matter of public interest.
under,terry,and tamkin,because defendants demonstrated a public interest in the broad topics of gangland,they satisfied the public interest requirement under the statute.they were not required to show a specific public interest in plaintiff 
we find plaintiff argument to the contrary unpersuasive.plaintiff argues that defendants can not satisfy the public interest requirement under dyer childress.in dyer,the plaintiff sued the creators of the movie reality bites for using his name as the main character in an anniversary edition of the film.id.at.plaintiff name was used only as an inside joke because the character named after him was dissimilar to plaintiff.id.the court held that there was no public interest under the statute because a lthough reality bites may address topics of widespread public interest,the defendants are unable to draw any connection between those topics and plaintiff claims.id.at.the court emphasized that there is no discernable public interest in plaintiff persona.id.
plaintiff reliance on dyer is misplaced.unlike dyer,plaintiff is directly connected to the issues of public interest,gang violence and miller murder.plaintiff agreed to do the interview for gangland because of his personal knowledge on these topics.
we conclude that defendants acts in furtherance of their right of free speech were in connection with issues of public interest.thus,defendants have met their initial burden under the statute.
plaintiff has met his burden to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on some of his claims 
at the second step of the inquiry,we review de novo whether a plaintiff has met its burden to show a probability of success on the merits.mindys cosmetics,at.a plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.wilson parker,covert chidester,cal th,quoting matson dvorak.the applicable burden is much like that used in determining a motion for nonsuit or directed verdict,which mandates dismissal when no reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff.mindys cosmetics,at citation omitted.this means that in ruling on an motion,we can not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence.wilson,cal th at.but we should strike a claim if defendant evidence supporting the motion establishes as a matter of law that plaintiff can not show a probability of prevailing.id.
at this stage,the release does not bar plaintiff claims 
defendants contend that plaintiff claims are barred because plaintiff signed a release that expressly consented to disclosure of his real name and identity in the broadcast,and waived all claims for liability or damages caused by an infringement of rights of publicity or misappropriation,intrusion,or infliction of emotional distress.
under california law,however,a plaintiff may demonstrate fraud in the execution or inception of a contract,by establishing that as a result of defendant fraud the plaintiff did not know what he or she was signing.vill.northridge homeowners ass state farm fire cas,cal th.once a plaintiff has shown fraud in the execution or inception of a contract,the contract lacks mutual assent and is void.id.
plaintiff claims in a sworn declaration that he has dyslexia,is illiterate,and that he told kovac he has extreme difficulty reading.plaintiff claims that when he was provided the alleged release,kovac told him it was just a receipt for his payment for the interview.because of these representations,plaintiff did not ask his girlfriend to read out loud the document before he signed it.at this stage in the proceedings,plaintiff has made a sufficient showing of fraud in the execution of the release,which,if true,would render the release void.see hotels pac,inc,finding that plaintiff sufficiently alleged fraud in the execution of a contract because plaintiff claimed that the contracts defendant sought to enforce were not the same documents that plaintiff had signed mairo yellow cab of,cal,holding that a triable issue of fraud existed where an illiterate plaintiff signed releases but claimed that he believed he had signed a permit and receipts.
in the cases relied upon by defendants,the plaintiffs did not assert that they had been misled about the contents of the releases that they signed.instead,the plaintiffs beliefs regarding the scope of the releases they signed were attributable to their own failure to read the documents or have the documents read to them.see,morta korea ins,cir casey proctor,cal d,alfaro cmty.hous.improvement planning ass n.
we therefore conclude that at this juncture,plaintiff claims are not barred by the release.it follows that plaintiff statements are not barred by the parol evidence rule,which generally prohibits the introduction of any extrinsic evidence,whether oral or written,to vary,alter or add to the terms of an integrated written instrument.casa herrera,beydoun,cal th,internal quotation marks omitted.the parol evidence rule does not bar extrinsic evidence w here the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute or to establish illegality or fraud.civ.proc.f,g riverisland cold storage,fresno madera prod.credit ass n,cal th,stating the parol evidence rule can not be used as a shield to prevent the proof of fraud quoting ferguson koch,cal.further,at this time,plaintiff does not need to show that the release is unconscionable because he is not required to do so if the release is void.
plaintiff has shown a reasonable probability of prevailing on four claims 
public disclosure of private fact 
to prove a claim for public disclosure of private fact,a plaintiff must show public disclosure of a private fact which would be offensive and objectionable to the reasonable person and which is not of legitimate public concern.shulman grp.w,cal th,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of all four elements.
the first element of public disclosure is met because it is undisputed that gangland was broadcast publicly.the second element,disclosure of a private fact,is met because defendants do not contest that plaintiff identity was private.
with respect to the third element,defendants do not dispute that the disclosure of information connecting a person with a violent gang,if done involuntarily,may be offensive and objectionable to a reasonable person.defendants argue,however,that plaintiff knew that he would be recognized on gangland and voluntarily agreed to do the interview anyway.given the sharp factual dispute between the parties concerning the validity of a release giving defendants a right to disclose plaintiff identity and whether plaintiff conditioned the interview on his identity being concealed,plaintiff has proffered sufficient evidence that the disclosure of his identity would be offensive and objectionable.
the fourth element requires plaintiff to make a prima facie showing that his identity was not of legitimate public con
