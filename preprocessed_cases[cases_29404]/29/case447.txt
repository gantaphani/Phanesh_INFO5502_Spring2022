background 
appellants robert and marietta marich brought this action in,against qrz media,telecommunications,and metro goldwyn mayer,respectively,the producers and distributors of a television show entitled,lapd life on the beat.the show was videotaped by a crew consisting of a camera operator and a soundman who rode on patrol with officers of the los angeles police department.on october,the crew videotaped two officers as they responded to a call to the apartment of appellants son,michael marich,where he was found dead.
while the television crew videotaped,one of the policemen,officer jackson,telephoned appellants at their home in texas.the result of the videotaping was a segment in an episode of the show entitled,the final act.officer jackson telephone call to appellants appears in the episode.he is seen and heard speaking first to appellant marietta marich,then to appellant robert marich,informing them,without identifying appellants or their son by name,that the police discovered their son dead in his apartment of an apparent drug overdose.while the words spoken are unintelligible,appellants responses are audible,and clearly register shock and anguish.
after the show was broadcast,appellants brought this action,and it was consolidated with appellants action against the city of los angeles regarding the same show.the complaint sets forth causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress,common law invasion of privacy,based upon intrusion and public disclosure of private facts,and statutory invasion of privacy,based upon penal code sections,and.after the trial court granted the respondents motion and dismissed the action pursuant to code of civil procedure section,we reversed the judgment of dismissal and the matter was remanded for trial 
in june,qrz media,filed a chapter bankruptcy petition,staying the action with regard to that defendant,and jury trial commenced on july,against the remaining defendants,including respondents in this appeal,telecommunications,and metro goldwyn mayer,on the causes of action for common law invasion of privacy based upon intrusion,and statutory invasion of privacy,based upon penal code section.the theory of the case was that the improper recordings combined with the subsequent publication of the conversations resulted in damages to appellants.the jury deliberations began on july,and were quite eventful,with requests from the jury for rereading of testimony,further argument,and multiple questions,nearly all involving the meaning of the word intentional.
on july,after the jury indicated to the court that it might be deadlocked,one of the jurors was excused due to a prepaid family vacation,and the jury was instructed to begin deliberations anew.when the jury again indicated that it was deadlocked,the court discussed with counsel the advisability of giving an allen charge.the court answered the jury questions,permitted additional argument,and provided the rereading of requested testimony.appellants counsel then proposed an additional instruction with regard to intent,which was refused by the court.
deliberations resumed,and the jury again reported that it was deadlocked,to.the parties stipulated to accepting a verdict based on a vote of to,instead of to.the allen charge was not given.
the jury returned special verdicts on each of the two causes of action.with regard to the common law intrusion theory,the jury answered no to the following question did any employee of qrz media,acting within the scope of his or her employment,intentionally intrude into robert marich solitude,seclusion,private affairs or concerns,specifically with respect to robert marich side of the telephone conversation with officer jackson on october,
with regard to the statutory claim based on penal code section,the jury answered three questions as follows.did any employee of qrz media,acting within the scope of employment,record or eavesdrop upon robert marich side of a confidential communication without robert marich consent yes.did that person use an electronic amplifying or recording device yes.did that person do so intentionally,and not inadvertently or by chance no.
judgment was entered in favor of respondents on september,and appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
definition of intent 
appellants contend that the trial court gave erroneous jury instructions with regard to the element of intent for both the statutory and common law causes of action for invasion of privacy and that the erroneous instructions had the effect of incorrectly placing the burden on them to prove absence of mistake or inadvertence.
the elements of both the statutory invasion of privacy and common law invasion of privacy include intentional conduct.penal code section prohibits the intentional eavesdropping to a confidential communication by means of any electronic amplifying or recording device,without the consent of all parties.the common law cause of action for invasion of privacy based upon intrusion has two elements intentional intrusion into a private place,conversation or matter,in a manner highly offensive to a reasonable person.shulman group w productions,cal th,d.it encompasses unwarranted sensory intrusions such as eavesdropping citation.id.at,d.
t he word intentional has been the subject of widely differing interpretations,depending on context and apparent legislative intent.citations.t he recording of a confidential conversation is intentional if the person using the recording equipment does so with the purpose or desire of recording a confidential conversation,or with the knowledge to a substantial certainty that his use of the equipment will result in the recordation of a confidential conversation.citations.people superior court smith cal d,smith.
smith definition describes general criminal intent as professor perkins puts it intent includes those consequences which a represent the very purpose for which an act is done regardless of the likelihood of occurrence,or b are known to be substantially certain to result regardless of desire.people colantuono cal th,d.respondents contend that even if the definition of intent applied by smith to criminal eavesdropping were appropriate in a civil action arising under penal code section,it has no place in an action based upon the common law intrusion tort.we disagree 
smith dual definition of intentional is in essence,the definition found in the restatement second of torts the word intent is used throughout the restatement to denote that the actor desires to cause consequences of his act,or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it.rest d torts,italics added.thus,i ntent is not limited to consequences which are desired.if the actor knows that the consequences are certain,or substantially certain,to result from his act,and still goes ahead,he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result.rest d torts,com.
the dual definition is used widely in civil actions,korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage akins state of california th,d inverse condemnation,intentional diversion of waters arendell auto parts club,th,d intentional employer misconduct shell oil winterthur swiss ins.th,d insurance policy exclusion for intentional torts.
in spite of its widespread use,there was no separate baji instruction at the time of this trial for the dual definition of intent for general use in tort actions or for use in privacy actions,although the dual formula was used in defining several specific torts.see,baji.the trial court did not,however,borrow from other intentional torts.nor did the court use either the restatement language or the language suggested in smith,supra,cal d at page,
over appellants objection,the trial court engrafted respondents instruction,and more,onto baji,which sets forth the elements of an invasion of privacy cause of action.
unmodified,baji ed.reads the plaintiff also seeks to recover damages based upon a claim of invasion of privacy by intrusion into private affairs.the essential elements of this claim are.the defendant intentionally intruded,physically or otherwise,upon the solitude or seclusion,private affairs or concerns of the plaintiff.the intrusion was substantial,and of a kind that would be highly offensive to an ordinarily reasonable person and.the intrusion caused plaintiff to sustain injury,damage,loss or harm.in determining whether an intrusion is highly offensive,you should consider all of the evidence,including the degree of intrusion,the context,conduct and circumstances surrounding the intrusion as well as the intruder motives and objectives,the setting in which the intrusion occurs,and the plaintiff expectations of privacy in that setting.
at respondents request,the court added the following language for liability the intrusion must have been intentional.any unintended or mistaken foray into the territory of another does not give rise to liability.the intrusion must also have been injurious or damaging.any act committed or an omission made in ignorance or by reason of a mistake of fact disproves any intent to commit such act or omission.thus,a person does not act unlawfully if he or she commits an act or admits the act under an actual belief in the existence of certain facts and circumstances which,if true,would make the act or omission lawful.italics added.
respondents took the phrase unintended or mistaken foray into the territory of another from miller national broadcasting d.miller.the admonition has been frequently stated that it is dangerous to frame an instruction upon isolated extracts from the opinions of the court.citations.francis city county of san francisco cal d.the discussion in an appellate decision is directed to the issue presented.the reviewing court generally does not contemplate a subsequent transmutation of its words into jury instructions and hence does not choose them with that end in mind.we therefore strongly caution that when evaluating special instructions,trial courts carefully consider whether such derivative application is consistent with their original usage.people colantuono,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
respondents instruction amply illustrates the problem.there was no issue in miller of instructional error,since the matter was before the court on appeal from a summary judgment and there was no issue with regard to the definition of intentional.miller,supra,d at.the issue presented was whether the plaintiff complaint stated a cause of action,and the phrase,unintended or mistaken foray,appears in a discussion of what conduct might be highly offensive to a reasonable person.id.at.no language in miller provided an appropriate instruction on the definition of intent for use in this case.
further,the trial court explanation of mistake of fact had no place in the definition of intent.mistake of fact provides a defense to numerous causes of action.one such example is as a defense to the enforcement of a contract.see pechtel universal underwriters ins.d.it may also provide a defense to one charged with crime.people mayer th,d.it may negate malice.ebaugh rabkin d.we have found no case in which mistake of fact was interposed as a defense in a privacy action,although the defense is suggested in smith example of the person who intends to record the calls of wild birds on a game reserve,but accidentally picks up the confidential discussions of two poachers.smith,supra,cal d at.although smith does not elaborate,the mistaken fact is,of course,that only birdsong is being recorded.
thus,we have no difficulty concluding that mistake of fact can provide a defense to a privacy action.it remains,however,that mistake of fact is an affirmative defense.see,people mayberry cal d,mosher mayacamas d.an affirmative defense is new matter that defendants are required to plead and prove.see generally,cahill,clementina d.but respondents did not interpose an affirmative defense based upon mistake of fact and further,as we shall explain,the evidence does not support such a defense.
a mistake of fact is when a person understands the facts to be other than they are citation.berry berry d.the circumstances of the recording of the telephone call were described by jeffrey leemon,who was the qrz soundman for the final act segment.he had fitted officers lawson and jackson with lapel microphones,and along with qrz cameraman,ruben scheinberg,accompanied the officers to michael marich apartment.leemon was also equipped with a boom microphone,wireless transmitters attached to the lapel microphones,and a belt mixer with headphones.
leemon had been a soundman since at least,and had worked on a number of news shows.he was familiar with the use of lapel microphones,or lavaliere microphones,and their capabilities.the tram model lapel microphone he was using on that occasion can pick up the conversation of someone six feet away,or even the sound of a car outside.officer jackson microphone was attached approximately inches below his chin,and the speaker portion of the telephone receiver was within inches of the microphone.
when officer jackson started his conversation with appellants,leemon was about seven feet away,and with his naked ears,he could hear some kind of sound coming out of the speaker of the telephone receiver.he put his headphones on,and through the headphones,he heard what sounded like the buzz of voices coming through the other side of the telephone line.it sounded like a human voice,and he knew it was live,not an answering machine,because officer jackson was speaking to someone.he could have turned the equipment off to stop the transmission,but he did not do so,assuming that if any of the other side of the conversation had been recorded,the editors would take care of it.in fact,he later told one of the video editors that he may have picked up the voices of the people on the other side of the telephone line.
leemon testified that he did not intend to record both sides of the conversation,but that he knew that it was possible for his equipment to do so.leemon also knew that he needed the consent of both parties to record a telephone conversation,but no one asked appellants whether they consented to having their voices recorded.
thus,the only mistake of fact entertained by leemon was with regard to what the editors might do after the telephone conversation was recorded.but eavesdropping or recording of conversations without consent is prohibited regardless of whether the party expects that the content of the conversation may later be conveyed to a third party.flanagan flanagan cal th,d.and penal code section is violated the moment a confidential communication is recorded without consent,regardless of whether it is subsequently disclosed.friddle epstein th,d.and the jury so found in the answers to special interrogatories and.
mistake of fact is not a defense to an unlawful act where the defendant actions would still have been unlawful if the facts had been as he believed them to be.see people watkins th,d.mistake of fact,therefore,was not available as a defense under the facts of this case,and the trial court did not give the instruction as an explanation of respondents affirmative defense.the court used it to define or explain the meaning of intentional.but as we have explained,the result was an incorrect definition or explanation of intentional,which was the focus of special interrogatory.
the erroneous instruction was inserted into the court instruction with regard to the elements of appellants cause of action.and the instruction came fairly soon after the trial court instructed the jury that appellants bore the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence all of the facts necessary to establish the essential elements of their claims.
it is,of course,the defendant who has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the defense that he is asserting.thus,the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that appellants bore the burden to disprove mistake of fact,as an element of their cause of action.
respondents claim that appellants agreed to the changes,and they contend that such acquiescence,combined with their failure to propose an appropriate alternative instruction,waived any error.respondents rely upon the rule that a jury instruction which is incomplete or too general must be accompanied by an objection or qualifying instruction to avoid the doctrine of waiver.citation.bishop hyundai motor america th,d.
appellants did,in fact,submit a proposed instruction prior to trial that quoted smith dual definition,and respondents admitted at oral argument that the trial court tacitly refused the instruction,and that appellants did not withdraw it.further,there was an objection of sorts.appellants counsel agreed to baji only as long as it was baji without the modifications and insertions.
respondents contend that appellants later acquiesced in the erroneous instruction.they point to a discussion in which appellants counsel objected again to the addition of language to baji,which the court overruled,prompting counsel to request a change in at least one of the words.the trial court agreed,and moved the instruction into the court agreed upon set.appellants thus made their objection,and we find no acquiescence in their having refrained from arguing the point further with the court.
the second incident came at the end of trial,in a sidebar discussion during the instruction of the jury,in which the court suggested changing the words,each defendant,to a person in baji,and the words,the mgm defendants,to simply,mgm.the court made the changes,and asked,is there any objection to the jury instructions appellants counsel said,yes,your.thus,appellants were not acquiescing in the erroneous instruction,as respondents insist,but merely agreeing to minor changes.
respondents also interpret another part of the same sidebar discussion as acquiescence.defense counsel stated,we preserve all of our objections that we have previously stated on the record.the trial judge replied,i f you want to preserve all of your objections,you really need to state them on the record.the court did not order the parties to renew all objections.and we see no need for them to have done so,since they had already placed their objection on the record.
the authorities upon which respondents rely are inapposite.in both electronic equipment express,donald seiler d,and brawthen h r block,d,the appellants had expressly stated that they had no objection to a particular instruction.here,respondents have shown only that appellants missed opportunities to object repeatedly,and failed to continue to argue the issue after the court had ruled.we find no waiver.
in any event,the rule of waiver upon which respondents rely applies only to a jury instruction which is incomplete or too general it does not apply to an instruction which is prejudicially erroneous as given,which is an incorrect statement of law.suman bmw of north america,th,d.and the right to challenge an incorrect instruction on the burden of proof is not waived by a failure to suggest an alternative.enis specialty auto sales d.
respondents also contend that no prejudice resulted from the error.respondents assert that in spite of the testimony we have summarized,leemon only appeared to testify that the buzz he heard sounded like voices,because he clarified on by defense counsel that he merely suspected that the buzzing was the sound of voices.since the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to appellants,not respondents,for purposes of gauging the effect of an erroneous instruction,we decline to engage in respondents semantic exercise.see henderson harnischfeger cal d.
prejudice is shown where it is probable that the jury based its verdict on the issue that was the subject of the erroneous instruction.see henderson harnischfeger,supra,cal d at.other factors for measuring the prejudicial effect of an erroneous instruction are the degree of conflict in the evidence on critical issues citations whether respondent argument to the jury may have contributed to the instruction misleading effect citation whether the jury requested a rereading of the erroneous instruction citation or of related evidence citation the closeness of the jury verdict citation and the effect of other instructions in remedying the error citations.lemons regents of university of california cal d.as we shall explain,all of the enumerated factors weigh in favor of prejudice in this case.
despite leemon clarification of his belief on,the evidence in this regard was not in conflict.there is little difference between believing that a certain noise is a human voice and suspecting that the noise is a human voice.and even under the facts as described by respondents,a jury correctly instructed with regard to the dual definition of intent,might reasonably find that because leemon continued to record while he suspected that he heard voices on the other end of the telephone line,knowing that his equipment was capable of picking them up,he knew to a substantial certainty that his use of the equipment would result in the recordation of a confidential conversation.smith,supra,cal d at.
the jury confusion over the court definition of intentional was manifest,especially given its affirmative responses to special interrogatories and.on july,the first full day of deliberations,the jury requested a legal definition of the word intent.the following day,the foreperson informed the court that the jury might be deadlocked.after further deliberations,the jury asked,does an intentional action always require that it be planned it also asked,can a person intentionally do something halfway through a specific action or does intention require that it happen at the beginning of a specific action 
on july,the jury asked for further argument from counsel on the issue of intentional intrusion,and how they believe any qrz employee might or might not have intentionally intruded.
the trial court allowed additional argument,but the absence of an appropriate instruction defining intent gave respondents the opportunity to define it incorrectly to their advantage.defense counsel gave the jury his own dual definition of intentional.he argued,there two different ways you can look at what jeffrey leemon intended to do.one way you could look at it is what did he want to do what was his purpose what was his desire another way you could try to look at it in your common sense way is what was he certain was happening as a consequence of his actions.italics added.after arguing that it was not leemon purpose or desire to record appellants side of the conversation,counsel said,now,second sic way you could look at this would be to say did he know it was being recorded was he certain that that noise,that buzz on the other side was being recorded well,the answer is no,he was.italics added.
thus,the jury received something akin to the restatement dual definition of intent from defense counsel.but under that version,intent is not a belief that the consequences are substantially certain to result,as set forth in the restatement second of torts,section,or even a substantial certainty that the consequences would result as juries will now be instructed by caci,but knowledge that the consequences are certain to result.since it is unlikely that a jury would find that leemon entertained an unqualified degree of certainty,even though the evidence was compelling that he knew that it was substantially certain that appellants voices had been picked up by the equipment during videotaping,it is probable that counsel argument misled the jury.
defense counsel additional argument also emphasized the erroneous mistake instruction.counsel argued,if there were other sounds picked up,and you could barely hear them on the tape he had,it was by mistake.it was inadvertent.and the judge instructed you that if it not intentional,if it was done by mistake or inadvertently,you must find no liability on that question.he instructed you on that.we find it probable that this argument also contributed to the instruction misleading effect.
the jury verdict was close.indeed,it was deadlocked over the very issue of intent,until the parties agreed to an verdict.
no other instructions clarified or corrected the erroneous definition of intent or the erroneous shifting of the burden of proof.when appellants requested an additional instruction,the trial judge said to co
