review of an order granting or denying a motion to strike under section is de novo.citation.we consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.however,we neither weigh credibility nor compare the weight of the evidence.rather,we accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff citation and evaluate the defendant evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.citation.soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,fn,d,wilbanks wolk th,d.

the defendants arguments.
in support of their contention reality bites is entitled to protection under the statute,the defendants argue the film addresses broad topics of interest to the public,including the issues facing generation x at the start of the.thus,the film involved the right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public importance.further,the special commentary on the film by childress and stiller that described the writing and creation of the film,distributed for the first time in the tenth anniversary edition dvd,itself was of widespread public interest.
the defendants reason reality bites is entitled to the same protection under the statute that has been afforded other media defendants such as the radio shows in ingels westwood one broadcasting services,th,d and seelig infinity broadcasting th,d,a documentary film on surfing in dora frontline video,th,d,and an hbo documentary and sports illustrated article on molestation in youth sports in time warner,th,d.the defendants further assert the public interest requirement necessary to support a special motion to strike can be met even when the plaintiff is not a public figure if,as here,the underlying issue is of widespread interest to the public.ibid terry davis community church th,d.
the defendants conclude that because the broad topics addressed in reality bites qualify as matters of public interest,the trial court erroneously found the defendants failed to make a sufficient showing under section to shift the burden to dyer to show a probability of prevailing on his claim.
