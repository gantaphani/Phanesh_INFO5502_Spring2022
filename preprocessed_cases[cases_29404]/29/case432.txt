defendant,and appellant the national football league nfl appeals from an order granting a new trial following a jury trial.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the nfl on the raiders claims involving their move to oakland,and the trial court granted a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct.plaintiff,and appellant the oakland raiders raiders from a pretrial order granting summary adjudication in favor of individual defendants and respondents paul tagliabue the nfl commissioner and neil austrian the nfl president on the raiders cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.the raiders also appeal from a statement of decision following a bench trial on the raiders declaratory relief cause of action.
we reverse the order granting a new trial and affirm the judgment in all other respects.because the order granting a new trial failed to comply with code of civil procedure section by omitting a statement of reasons,we have independently reviewed the grounds asserted in the motion.we conclude that neither the conflicting evidence of juror misconduct nor any asserted instructional error justifies a new trial.as to the,we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that,as a matter of law,there is no fiduciary relationship between nfl officials and the raiders,and that substantial evidence supports the trial court conclusion that the nfl was not estopped to rely on the nfl constitution revenue sharing requirements.
factual and procedural background 
facts leading to the raiders move from los angeles.
the raiders are a member club of the nfl,an unincorporated association governed by the nfl constitution and bylaws.after the raiders relocated to los angeles from oakland in,they played their home games at the los angeles memorial coliseum until.unlike newer stadiums,the coliseum did not permit any revenue to be derived from items such as luxury suites,club seats,naming rights or other sponsorships.
throughout the end of and the first half of,the raiders negotiated with individuals representing hollywood park for the construction of a new,stadium in inglewood,reaching an agreement in principle in march.that agreement required the raiders to secure from the nfl a contribution in the amount of million and a commitment that at least two super bowls would be played in the stadium between and.the nfl offered to support construction of the hollywood park stadium,though not to the extent sought by the raiders.it agreed to schedule one super bowl during the requested time period,to provide the raiders with a certain number of super bowl tickets and to invest some money into the project.it further agreed to provide additional assistance on the condition that a second nfl team be permitted to play at the stadium for several years.
ultimately,the nfl memorialized its commitment at a meeting in may,where it adopted resolution which,among other things,awarded two super bowls to the hollywood park stadium conditioned on two nfl teams playing there,and created a committee to negotiate with both the raiders and hollywood park concerning a second nfl team the raiders voted in favor of resolution,though they remained opposed to the notion of a second team playing at the hollywood park stadium.
the committee created by resolution developed terms for the provision of a second nfl team that were inconsistent with the raiders goals and that the raiders perceived as favoring the second team.as a result,the had simultaneously been negotiating with oakland officials to relocate the team into an agreement with oakland in june to move to the renovated oakland coliseum.the agreement included an million payment to the raiders,immediately enhanced revenue streams and assurances from oakland officials that personal seat licenses and game tickets were already sold out.
in july,the nfl adopted resolution,approving the raiders relocation to oakland and reaffirming that the league member clubs collectively own and will control any league franchise opportunity in the greater los angeles area 
pleadings and trial 
in march,the raiders filed a complaint for damages against the nfl and myriad other defendants,alleging eleven causes of action breach of contract first,seventh and eighth causes of action breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing second,sixth and tenth causes of action unjust enrichment third cause of action tortious interference with prospective business advantage fourth cause of action breach of fiduciary duty fifth cause of action declaratory relief ninth cause of action and civil conspiracy eleventh cause of action the nfl,in turn,answered and filed a for declaratory relief against the raiders.
in august,the trial court granted the nfl motions for summary adjudication on the fourth,seventh,eighth and tenth causes of action,and denied its summary adjudication motions on the third,fifth and sixth causes of action.the court also granted summary adjudication motions brought by individual defendants tagliabue and austrian on the fourth through seventh,tenth and eleventh causes of action.
the trial began on march,and lasted approximately six weeks.the jury heard testimony and received documentary evidence on five causes of action.the first through third causes of action involved the raiders claim that,by moving to oakland,they left the nfl with an opportunity to put another team in los angeles and that the nfl constitution and bylaws implicitly required that the raiders be compensated for providing the nfl with that opportunity sometimes referred to as the los angeles opportunity.the fifth and sixth causes of action addressed the nfl failure to offer the raiders more support with the development of the hollywood park stadium.
the jury deliberated for days,though it began deliberations anew on the fifth day after one juror was excused due to a scheduling conflict.during the deliberations,the jurors asked several specific questions about the evidence and instructions.on may,the jury returned a to verdict in favor of the nfl.
following a subsequent bench trial,the trial court entered its statement of decision on the ninth cause of action on june.it denied the raiders request for a declaration that they were not required to share certain stadium revenues,because the nfl constitution and bylaws obligated the raiders to share and the nfl had not modified or waived the sharing requirement.
on july,the trial court entered judgment on all matters tried before the jury and the court.
posttrial motions 
also on july,the raiders filed their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and motion for new trial.the raiders premised their new trial motion on grounds of juror misconduct,erroneous jury instructions,erroneous admission of evidence and insufficiency of evidence.
with respect to juror misconduct,the raiders asserted that one juror,abiog,harbored a bias against the raiders and concealed that bias during voir dire.they further asserted that another juror,attorney hillman,had an unconcealed,preexisting bias against the raiders,infected the deliberations with her own view of the law,and engaged in private deliberations with another juror.they also suggested that a third juror,paulino,had difficulty understanding english.
to demonstrate this misconduct,the raiders submitted five juror declarations,as well as declarations of counsel averring that counsel were unaware of any jury misconduct occurring during the trial or deliberations.according to the juror declarations,abiog stated several times during deliberations that he hated the raiders and their owner,al davis,and that he would never award any money to the raiders or find for them in this case.one juror confronted abiog,telling him that it was improper for him to make such a statement and that he had a duty to disclose in his juror questionnaire his hostility toward the raiders.abiog responded that the questionnaire had only asked what his favorite team was and did not ask whether he disliked the raiders.two other jurors,including the jury foreman,told abiog that concealing his bias against the raiders could cause a mistrial.
with respect to hillman,the declarations stated that she exercised an unofficial leadership position,dominated the deliberations and instructed the jurors on the law.one example of hillman dominance repeated throughout the declarations was that she told the jury that if they voted one way on one of the claims,they had to vote the same way on another claim,because that was the law.another example cited in three declarations was that hillman told the jury that there could be no fiduciary relationship between the nfl and the raiders as a matter of law.hillman also wrote out statements of the law and taped them to the jury room walls her statements were not quotations from the jury instructions but were her own words of what she claimed the law was.some jurors also observed hillman having private conversations with another juror during deliberations.
finally,the declarations stated that paulino,an alternate juror who replaced an excused juror during deliberations,appeared to have trouble understanding english.according to the jurors she would say to us,i do understand,and,several times,that she wanted to material.
independent of any juror misconduct,the raiders asserted that a new trial was warranted because the jury received several erroneous and prejudicial jury instructions.
the nfl opposed the motion for new trial and submitted eight juror declarations in support of its opposition,including one declaration from an alternate juror who did not participate in the deliberations,one declaration from a juror who was excused before the jury reached a verdict,and a supplemental declaration from one of the five jurors who submitted declarations in support of the motion.it also filed evidentiary objections to the raiders juror declarations.according to abiog declaration,at some point well into the deliberations,abiog joked that he hated the raiders because he had lost a small bet on them in las vegas.abiog declared that he harbored no bias against the raiders or davis.in four other declarations,the jurors stated they could not recall abiog stating that he hated the raiders or al davis nor could they recall any other jurors responding to such a statement.the declarations further stated that abiog did not give the jurors any reason to believe that he harbored a preexisting bias against the raiders.the juror who submitted the supplemental declaration stated that he could not tell whether abiog had formed an unfavorable impression of the raiders before or during trial.
hillman submitted a declaration in which she denied dominating the deliberations stated that she told her fellow jurors to follow the instructions given by the court and did not tell the jury what the law was and explained that she wrote out the jury instructions verbatim,with the exception of an inadvertent error where she wrote fiduciary duty instead of fiduciary relationship.she denied expressing legal opinions as to the validity of any claim or the effect of any evidence.the other juror declarations stated that hillman did not dominate the deliberations.to the contrary,the jurors declared that hillman repeatedly stated that the jury decision must be based on the instructions given and that any questions about the instructions should be directed to the judge.the declarations further stated that hillman helped write out the jury instructions verbatim on butcher paper,and that many jurors also wrote on the paper by summarizing the evidence helpful to particular instructions.
the nfl declarations also stated that paulino fully participated in the deliberations on the occasions when she asked for help,she did so because she was unfamiliar with points that had been addressed in the deliberations prior to her arrival.
the nfl also responded to the claim that a new trial was warranted because of erroneous jury instructions,arguing that the evidence supported giving the challenged instructions,that the supporting evidence obviated the need to plead defenses relating to the instructions,and that the instructions correctly stated the law.
the raiders filed their reply,together with six reply declarations,on september.according to those one from paulino in.abiog demeanor indicated that his comment about the raiders was not a joke and hillman repeatedly instructed the jury on her knowledge of the law.the nfl moved to strike the declarations on the ground they were untimely filed and,alternatively,objected to the declarations contents.
on september,the trial court heard argument on the motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and took the matters under submission.on september,the court issued a minute order granting the motion for new trial and denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.in ruling on the motion for new trial,the trial court stated only the motion for new trial is granted.the court finds that the objectively ascertainable acts of juror misconduct were prejudicial to the oakland raiders right to a fair trial.with respect to the other grounds raised by the motion,the court further stated while some of the objections in the motion for new trial premised on erroneous prejudicial jury instructions raise serious questions concerning their use,and having given the court some pause,having granted the motion for new trial on other grounds,we have not reached these issues.the minute order did not rule on any of the evidentiary objections.
the nfl appealed from the order granting a new trial and the raiders appealed from the judgment.
discussion 
a.the nfl appeal.
the nfl appeal challenges solely the trial court grant of a new trial.generally,we review an order granting a new trial for abuse of discretion.lane hughes aircraft cal th,d,bell state of california th,d.here,however,the nfl not only challenges the result of the trial court order,but also contends that the order itself is deficient for failing to specify the reasons for granting a new trial.see code civ.according to the nfl,this deficiency requires us to apply a less deferential standard of review in evaluating the trial court decision.
we conclude that the order failed to comply with section because it did not adequately specify the court reason or reasons for granting the new trial upon each ground stated.we further find that this deficiency renders the order defective and requires us to independently review whether a new trial was warranted on the ground of juror misconduct or any other ground raised by the motion thompson friendly hills regional medical center th,d.on the basis of that review,we must reverse the order granting a new trial,as neither juror misconduct nor instructional error materially affected the substantial rights of the raiders.
the new trial order is defective because it does not specify the court reasons for granting a new trial.
a trial court may grant a new trial only by following the applicable statutory procedures.bank of america cal d.section governs the manner of making and entering an order granting a new trial and provides in relevant part when a new trial is granted,on all or part of the issues,the court shall specify the ground or grounds upon which it is granted and the court reason or reasons for granting the new trial upon each ground stated.the court specification of reasons need not be contained within the order granting the new trial.section further provides if an order granting such motion does not contain such specification of reasons,the court must,within days after filing such order,prepare,sign and file such specification of reasons in writing with the clerk.
here,the order granting a new trial specified juror misconduct as the ground upon which it was based.this specification was adequate,as it reasonably approximated the language of section,permitting a new trial on the ground of m isconduct of the jury.see treber superior court cal d,new trial order using statutory language adequately stated ground mercer perez cal d,new trial order specification of the ground on which it is based should use statutory language or a reasonable approximation thereof.
in the same sentence in which the trial court set forth the ground upon which its grant of the new trial was based,the court also set forth its reason for the grant the court finds that the objectively ascertainable acts of juror misconduct were prejudicial to the oakland raiders right to a fair trial.we conclude that this statement fails adequately to specify the trial court reason for granting the new trial motion.
s ection places on the trial courts a clear and unmistakable duty to furnish a timely specification of both their grounds and their reasons for granting a new trial treber superior court,supra,cal d at.requiring a specification of reasons serves the dual purpose of encouraging careful deliberation by the trial court before ruling on a motion for new trial,and of making a record sufficiently precise to permit meaningful appellate review.scala jerry witt sons,cal d,citing mercer perez,supra,cal d at.a specification of reasons satisfies these purposes if the judge who grants a new trial furnishes a concise but clear statement of the reasons why he finds one or more of the grounds of the motion to be applicable to the case before him.mercer perez,supra,at,see also meiner ford motor d.trial court granting a new trial should consider whether his proposed specification of reasons will fairly serve the legislative purposes elucidated in mercer.
as mercer further explained,n o hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the content of such a specification,and it will necessarily vary according to the facts and circumstances of each case.mercer perez,supra,cal d at.but despite the absence of any rule governing the specification of reasons content,courts have articulated one clear guideline,explaining that a reason must do more than simply restate the ground on which the order granting the new trial is based.scala jerry witt sons,supra,cal d at,mercer perez,supra,at,van zee bayview hardware store d.while this guideline had been applied principally in cases involving the grant of a new trial on the ground of insufficiency of evidence see,scala jerry witt sons,supra,at,it applies with equal force to new trial orders based on any statutorily authorized ground.for example,in stevens parke,davis cal d,the court reversed an order granting a new trial on the ground of excessive damages.the order contained a specification of reasons stating that the verdict is excessive,that it is not sustained by the evidence the court found that these reasons did not go beyond a statement of the ground for the court decision.id.at,accord,treber superior court,supra,cal d at,holding that where new trial is granted on the ground of errors in law,requires the trial court to briefly specify the errors that are the basis for his ruling thompson friendly hills regional medical center,supra,th at,d holding that adequate specification of reasons is required where new trial is granted on the ground of juror misconduct see also mercer perez,supra,at,noting by way of example that if the ground is misconduct of the jury through their resorting to chance,the judge should specify this improper method of deliberation as the basis of his action.
evaluated under these principles,the trial court specification of reasons for granting the motion is inadequate.deeming the objectively ascertainable acts of juror misconduct prejudicial does nothing more than restate the elements necessary to grant a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct.under evidence code section,a verdict may be impeached by proof of overt acts objectively ascertainable,those that are open to sight,hearing,and the other senses and thus subject to corroboration.hasson ford motor cal d,jones sieve d.by the same token,the trial court may grant a motion for a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct only where that misconduct prejudiced the losing party right to a fair trial.enyart city of los angeles th,d.thus,specifying that the reasons for granting the new trial motion were prejudicial,objectively ascertainable acts of misconduct borders on the tautological and simply reiterates the ground of the ruling itself.scala jerry witt sons,supra,cal d at.
the specification of reasons likewise fails to satisfy either of the two purposes of the requirement.on its face,the order does not indicate that it is the product of a mature and careful reflection on the part of the judge.mercer perez,supra,cal d at.the mere fact that the order was issued days after the hearing on the new trial motion is not indicative of the type of judicial deliberation sought to be promoted by the specification of reasons requirement.see ibid.to the contrary,the issuance of a order after that period of time makes it appear as if the decision to grant a new trial was hasty or.ibid.
nor is the specification of reasons sufficiently precise for the purpose of meaningful appellate review.scala jerry witt sons,supra,cal d at,see also johns city of los angeles d.as the scala court explained,the need to make the right to appeal from the order more meaningful citation is perhaps the more useful yardstick to an appellate court for measuring the adequacy of the specification.scala jerry witt sons,supra,at.the specification of reasons does not satisfy this purpose.the order references to objectively ascertainable acts could refer to any two or more of the several acts of misconduct raised by the new trial motion,including abiog remark about the raiders and their owner as demonstrating a concealed bias hillman telling the jury they had to vote the same way on related claims hillman telling the jury that a fiduciary relationship between the parties could not exist as a matter of law hillman writing her own version of the jury instructions on butcher paper taped to the wall or hillman having private deliberations with another juror.we can not agree with the raiders that the reference to acts necessarily means that the court found that the conduct of both abiog and hillman prejudiced them.in particular,the declarations asserted that hillman committed multiple acts of misconduct.without a more precise specification of reasons,we are left to speculate about the trial court bases for granting a new trial.
these circumstances are no different than those in mclaughlin city of san francisco d.there,the specification of reasons provided that the new trial granted on the ground of insufficient evidence to support an verdict was based upon the failure of the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence reasonable total damages,both general and special in excess of id.at,italics omitted.though the appellate court could have speculated as to how the trial court reached its conclusion that there was insufficient proof of approximately in damages,it declined to do so,explaining that the specification of reasons requirement was designed to put an end to speculation of this nature,and we are not permitted to infer the trial court reasons where we have not been told what they are.id.at,citing mercer perez,supra,cal d at.
in sum,the specification of reasons merely restates the ground on which the new trial order was based.moreover,it neither indicates it was the product of careful deliberation nor provides a basis for meaningful appellate review.the failure to supply an adequate specification of reasons renders the new trial order defective,but not void.thompson friendly hills regional medical center,supra,th at,d.where a new trial order is defective,t he reviewing court remains under an express statutory duty to affirm such an order if the record will support any ground listed in the motion.treber superior court,supra,cal d at.but before we address the grounds raised by the motion,we turn first to the appropriate standard of review.
because the new trial order fails to provide an adequate specification of reasons,we must independently review the grounds advanced in the new trial motion.
as we acknowledged earlier,when a new trial order complies with the requirements of section,we review that order for an abuse of discretion.lane hughes aircraft,supra,cal th at,d.at the other end of the spectrum,a defective new trial,one that contains an inadequate specification of only on the ground of insufficient evidence or excessive or inadequate damages must be reversed as a matter of law.mercer perez,supra,cal d at.the situation here,invo
