petitioner manhattan center studios mcs seeks review of an order of the national relations board nlrb or board finding that it committed an unfair labor practice ulp in refusing,inter alia,to bargain with a union certified by employee vote.after the certification election,mcs learned that one of its supervisory employees had,before the election,improperly distributed union authorization forms and solicited the unit employees to sign them.mcs refused to bargain on that basis,contending the election was not valid.it claimed that its supervisory employee subsequently discovered misconduct constituted an affirmative defense to the ulp charge.the board disagreed.before us,mcs argues that,in denying it the opportunity to contest the validity of the election,the board misapplied its precedent regarding newly discovered evidence.the board for enforcement of its order.because we find that the board erred in applying its due diligence to permit an untimely election challenge based on newly discovered the facts of this case,we remand for further proceedings.
mcs is a corporation based in new york city that offers its facility for rent for theatrical and musical productions on february,stagehands and production staff production employees employed by mcs voted by a margin to certify theatrical stage employees local no.one union or local one as the collective bargaining representative for their bargaining unit.see tally of ballots,nlrb case,reprinted at joint appendix ja.mcs did not file an objection to the election within seven days after the election as required by a eight days later,on february,the board certified the union as the representative of the production employees bargaining unit and,on march,the union wrote to mcs ceo russell arnold requesting both available dates to begin bargaining and information on terms and conditions of employment needed to formulate its bargaining proposals.
on march,mcs responded to the union request,refusing to bargain or to turn over any employee information.its letter stated that it has recently come to our attention that an mcs supervisor was improperly involved in organizational activities on behalf of local one.as a result,it appears that local one is not validly and lawfully certified as the bargaining representative of an uncoerced majority of mcs stagehands and production employees.letter from russell arnold,ceo,mcs,to james claffey,legitimate theater business manager,ja.the union then filed two ulp charges against mcs and on may the board issued a complaint charging mcs with a violation of sections a and of the national labor relations act act,a,in refusing the union requests to bargain and to provide information following a valid certification ja.in its answer to the complaint mcs admitted it had refused to bargain but offered an affirmative defense to the ulp,that the union election petition was tainted by unfair labor practices,including improper supervisory involvement in the organizing campaign.ja.mcs maintained that after the union was certified on february,significantly,after the period to object had expired,see a it learned that one of its supervisory employees,technical coordinator gustavo garces,had distributed the union authorization cards before the election and solicited employees to sign them,thereby tainting the unit employees exercise of their right to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing in violation of section b of the act.see b ja.mcs learned of garces organizing activities from michael spony,a employee,sometime in march.ja.according to the affidavits of spony and ceo arnold,spony told arnold that garces had boasted to spony of garces spearhead ing the union campaign to organize mcs production employees during a conversation the two had had in november.ja,ja.because the information regarding garces misconduct was not previously available to mcs,mcs argued that,notwithstanding the representation proceeding had closed when the unit employees voted to certify the union as their representative and the period for filing objections had expired,it could nonetheless properly raise the issues of his misconduct and its effect on the election in the ulp proceeding in order to challenge the validity of the union certification and thus undergird its refusal to bargain.mcs mem.of law in opp to mot.for summ.at,ja.because it was unaware of garces misconduct until march,it could not have timely objected to the election on that basis.nonetheless,mcs argued,it remained free to challenge the election because,in its words,a party is entitled to litigate representation issues concerning coercive conduct if the party has obtained newly discovered evidence or did not otherwise have an opportunity to litigate the issues in the prior representation proceeding.ja citing san antonio portland cement.its evidence was new,mcs claimed,because it did not learn of the supervisory taint until after the period.id.
on september,the board issued its decision and order granting summary judgment to the general counsel.manhattan ctr.studios,nlrb,wl mcs,ja.it began by noting the respondent did not file any objections to the conduct of the election within seven days thereafter the representation proceeding had therefore closed and could be reopened to litigate election impropriety issues only if mcs could establish that it has newly discovered evidence,slip.op.at.it found that mcs had not met that burden.the board described newly discovered evidence as evidence of facts that existed at the time of the representation proceeding which could not be discovered by reasonable diligence.id.citing apl logistics,slip op.at,wl.it then concluded 
t he respondent has failed to present any information indicating that prior to the expiration of time in which to file objections to the election,it engaged in an attempt to uncover any potential improprieties in that proceeding.thus,the respondent has failed to establish that the evidence at issue could not have been discovered earlier through the exercise of reasonable diligence.
id.at,ja emphasis added.because mcs had no affirmative defense to its refusal to bargain with the union,no genuine issue of material fact existed as to mcs refusal to bargain and,accordingly,the general counsel was entitled to summary judgment.mcs timely petitioned for review.
we review the board order to determine whether the board acted arbitrarily or otherwise erred in applying established law to the facts of the case.antelope valley bus,nlrb,quotations omitted.the board can not ignore its own relevant precedent but must explain why it is not controlling.bb l,nlrb.w here an agency departs from established precedent without a reasoned explanation,its decision will be vacated as arbitrary and capricious.anr pipeline ferc.if we conclude that the board misapplied or deviated from its precedent,we often remand with instructions to remedy the.lee lumber.material nlrb,remanding to resolve inconsistency between board standard and its application therein.
as noted,under the board regulations,a party has seven days after the tally of ballots in a certification election to file objections to the conduct of the election or to conduct affecting the results of the election.a.the board deadline reflects its policy favoring finality in election results in order to further industrial peace.see nlrb tower.section d of the board regulations,however,permits a party to move for reconsideration or reopening of the record after the expiration of the specified period based on newly discovered evidence.d board precedent interpreting section d sets forth two requirements for newly discovered evidence one is straightforward and the other constitutes the nub of this case.first,newly discovered evidence must be evidence of facts in existence at the time of the proceeding in question.see mcs,wl,slip.op.at.second,the moving party must have been excusably ignorant of the existence of the evidence.see seder foods.to find excusable ignorance,the board applies a due diligence reasonable diligence standard whose aim is to ensure that the moving party could not have discovered and brought the evidence to the board attention during the period see,wl party seeking to introduce evidence as newly discovered must also show facts from which it can be determined that the movant acted with reasonable diligence to uncover and introduce the evidence.
board precedent includes at least two formulations of the diligence standard we dub the conducted investigation be used if the moving party asserts its due diligence to establish that subsequently discovered facts constitute new evidence,see,superior,nlrb,slip.op.at,wl superior protection i n order to establish that evidence is newly discovered,the movant must show facts indicating that it acted with reasonable diligence to uncover and introduce the evidence and that it was therefore excusably ignorant of the evidence previously internal citations omitted and we dub the hypothetical investigation be used in circumstances where due diligence was not exercised,in which case the board asks whether the exercise of due diligence would have timely uncovered the evidence.see,apl logistics,nlrb,slip.op.at,wl defining new evidence as evidence of facts in existence at the time of the hearing which could not be discovered by reasonable diligence,a lthough the alleged offer to waive union initiation fees was made at a preelection union meeting,the respondent has failed to show that with due diligence it could not have uncovered the evidence in time to file timely objections see also amalgamated clothing workers of am.nlrb,affirming board determination that employer evidence was not new because no explanation was offered as to why this evidence was not discovered or could not have been discovered by the exercise of due diligence emphasis added.
apart from the two formulations of the board due diligence standard,the board has been less than clear as to which one it is applying in a particular case.the decision in dickerson florida,wl is an example.in that case,after the period closed and the employer refused to bargain,it asserted as an affirmative defense to the ulp charge that the election was invalid due to election improprieties including a threat by a union member and the union offer to waive initiation fees.as in this case,a employee subsequently advised the employer of the threat and the offer and the employer sought to use both as newly discovered evidence.the board found that the employer had not demonstrated that the facts of the alleged threat and unlawful offer of waiver were not previously discoverable by the employer through the exercise of due diligence and therefore disallowed them.id.at.whether the board meant that the employer had not shown that the evidence was not discoverable earlier because it had not exercised due diligence or because the evidence would not have been discovered had the employer exercised due diligence is not clear.
if,as the board argues here,the standard is that an employer has an affirmative duty to exercise due diligence to discover any evidence of irregularity in any election in order to use that evidence to permit the untimely reopening of the representation proceeding,the employer will almost certainly run a risk inasmuch as a investigation conducted within the period,as the board order counsels,see mcs,nlrb,slip.op.at,without specific evidence of misconduct would almost always involve questioning of employees.see a crossing recovery,wl,nlrb lexis,employer questioning employees regarding upcoming certification vote constituted coercive conduct and unlawful interrogation in violation of section a overnite transp,wl employer questioning employees before and immediately after certification vote violated section a because it implied surveillance of the employees union activities moreover,counsel might have to advise their client to communicate with its supervisors and perhaps even its employees during the organizational campaign whether or not the employer has cause to believe anything is amiss a union would be exposed to similar risks.see b am.postal workers union,nlrb,wl union member interrogating employee regarding her union support violated section b.
because the board has been less than clear in applying its newly discovered evidence standard,it is unlikely that an employer in mcs circumstances knows if it must make an effort to uncover a problem of any kind in order to mount an untimely challenge to an election or whether,consistent with apl logistics,it will be required to show that it could not have with due diligence discovered the particular evidence it seeks to submit as newly discovered.the first interpretation is deceptively straightforward the employer either conducted an investigation or it did not.but what makes an investigation diligent enough to meet the standard does the employer have to show that it interviewed all of its supervisors here,that probably would have been futile because the supervisor garces was himself the culprit the second interpretation,on the other hand,requires the employer to prove a negative that the evidence could not have been discovered had due diligence been exercised.one would assume under this interpretation that,if a employer could show the evidence was not discoverable even with due diligence,such as where the employer had no reasonable way of knowing or discovering whether improprieties had occurred,its burden would be met.but this is unclear from the board order here.instead of choosing either the conducted investigation version or the hypothetical investigation version of the due diligence standard and explaining its choice,the board confused the two,treating them as if they were the same.
mcs argues that it was excusably ignorant of garces actions and should therefore be allowed to submit evidence of those actions as newly discovered evidence because it had no reason to inquire of spony or any other employee about election improprieties before march and it acted with reasonable diligence to proffer the evidence once it learned of them from spony.see pet r br.and even if it had investigated for any impropriety either before the election or within the period,mcs maintains that it would be reasonable to assume,given garces supervisory status,that neither he nor his subordinates would have voluntarily disclosed his involvement in the organizing drive.id.at.on the other hand,mcs contends,if it is held to the superior protection iteration of the test,according to which it must show that it acted with reasonable diligence to uncover and introduce the newly discovered evidence and was therefore excusably ignorant of the evidence previously,superior,nlrb,slip.op.at quotations omitted,it is effectively foreclosed from using the newly discovered evidence rule because it did not know,nor have reason to know,of garces misconduct.it argues therefore that it should not be held to have failed to exercise due diligence to investigate an election irregularity of which it was excusably ignorant.
in response the board points to rumors circulating among employees in late regarding garces support of the union,alluded to in spony affidavit as garces own claim that he did care who kn ew about his actions.resp t br.ja.the board suggests that mcs can not use the newly discovered evidence rule because,given the rumors and small size of the bargaining unit,due diligence would have uncovered garces misconduct.see resp t br.mcs offers no explanation why,in a bargaining unit of only seven employees,it could not have discovered earlier that its own supervisor was spearheading the union campaign,especially given mcs own assertion that rumors about garces involvement were circulating among its employees months before the election.but the board mischaracterizes mcs own assertion it was spony,not mcs,who stated that he knew that rumors regarding garces misconduct were circulating among employees in late.mcs did not hear of these rumors until march see spony decl,ja arnold decl,ja.
it is true that in soft drink workers union local nlrb,we stated that in order to challenge election results in a ulp proceeding based on newly discovered evidence,the moving party must have made some effort to obtain the evidence at the time challenges could have been made,that is,within the per
