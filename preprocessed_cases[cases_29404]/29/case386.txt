in this idea submission case,plaintiff eric ryder challenges the trial court grant of summary judgment to defendants james cameron and lightstorm entertainment,lightstorm,on claims that defendants fraudulently expressed interest in developing ryder science fiction story krz and used parts of that story in cameron film avatar century fox.as we explain,ryder contract and fiduciary duty claims fail because we find no similarity between the projects as a matter of law.ryder fraud claims fail because he has not offered evidence raising a triable issue of material fact.finally,in light of those conclusions,his appeal of the court denial of his motion for discovery sanctions is moot.we therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
cameron avatar 
released in,avatar is a science fiction film written and directed by cameron.set in the future on pandora,a moon of a fictional gas giant planet,it explores a world of flying mountains and lush bioluminescent rainforests teeming with exotic flora and fauna unlike anything on earth.an indigenous species of humanoids called na vi live there foot tall,preternaturally strong beings living in harmony with their natural surroundings and worshipping their deity eywa.pandora is also occupied by humans affiliated with the resources development administration,or rda,and its sec ops security force,which mines a valuable mineral called unobtainium used on earth.the film title refers to genetically engineered avatar bodies resembling na vi that human scientists control via a mental link and use to interact with the native na vi.
the film begins as jake sully,a year old paraplegic,is brought to pandora to replace his deceased twin brother as an avatar operator.upon arriving,he meets colonel miles quaritch,the imposing head of sec ops,and grace augustine,head of the avatar program,among others.jake begins training as an avatar operator,joyfully discovering his avatar allows him to experience walking again.meanwhile,quaritch recruits jake to secretly provide intelligence on the na vi in exchange for expensive surgery to restore the use of his legs once back on earth.
while out in the wilds of pandora in his avatar form,jake gets separated from his group when he is attacked by a predator,barely escaping by jumping into a rushing waterfall.as night falls,neytiri,a na vi female,finds him and is about to shoot him when a woodsprite lands on her arrow.she interprets that as a sign from eywa and spares his life.later that night,she saves jake when he is attacked by a pack of viperwolves.she refuses to bring him back to her village until woodsprites land all over his body.she then brings him back to the gigantic hometree where her clan lives and where her mother,the clan spiritual leader,tells her to train him in the ways of the na vi.
in his avatar form,jake trains to become a na vi warrior,while in his human form he continues to provide intelligence to quaritch.he also chronicles his experiences with the na vi through entries in a video diary.eventually he falls in love with neytiri and the na vi,which undermines his loyalty to quaritch and the rda.when he passes all the na vi tests,he is accepted into the clan,and he and neytiri choose each other as mates.at that point,jake allegiance fully switches from the rda to the na vi.
when jake can not convince the na vi to leave hometree at the request of the rda,which wants to mine the unobtainium at the site,quaritch leads his forces into an attack on the na vi and hometree.the na vi are defeated,hometree is destroyed,and jake secret deal with quaritch is exposed to neytiri and the clan.although quaritch holds jake and grace prisoner,they manage to escape.when grace is mortally wounded in the ensuing shootout,the na vi try to save her by transferring her consciousness into her avatar body,but they are too late.she dies.
once again linked with his avatar,jake regains the na vi trust by taming a legendary flying creature and rallies thousands of other na vi warriors from neighboring clans to fight quaritch and sec ops.jake leads the na vi into battle.when it seems the na vi will be defeated,the pandoran wildlife join the fight and overwhelm the sec ops soldiers.jake and neytiri enter a final battle against quaritch,who dons a robotic suit.in human form,jake becomes exposed to deadly pandoran air,and neytiri kills quaritch to save him.in the final scene,jake undergoes the same na vi ritual used to try to save grace,but this time it works jake consciousness is permanently transferred into his avatar body and he leaves his human form behind.
cameron originally conceived of the story in in a detailed page scriptment,which he describes as a highly detailed treatment that,like a treatment,was in a narrative rather than dialogue form,and laid out the story,characters,setting and many of the visual images for avatar in great detail.starting in,cameron circulated the scriptment to generate interest,and between and,he began to explore the technology necessary to make avatar.by,however,he decided not to move forward with the film because the technology was not sufficiently developed.in,cameron decided the technology was available to make avatar,so he revisited the project.between december and may,he wrote the first draft of the screenplay.principal photography began in april.both before and during filming,cameron rewrote and refined the screenplay,although he always remained true to his original vision of avatar as expressed in the scriptment.
between and,ryder,a d computer animator,wrote a science fiction short story entitled krz based on joseph conrad classic story heart of darkness.in,ryder and his wife created a business proposal surrounding krz to finance the project as a d animated film for distribution via the internet,television,or through dvd and video sales.as relevant here,the proposal had a notice to recipients that stated the proposal was being delivered to a limited number of parties for informational purposes only.by your receipt of this document,you agree that i this proposal and its contents are confidential ii neither you,nor any person or entity with which you are associated,nor any of their respective agents,representatives or employees will copy,reproduce,or distribute to others this proposal,in whole or in part,at any time without the prior written consent of channel modus iii you and they will keep permanently confidential all information contained herein not already in the public domain and iv you and they will use this proposal for the sole purpose for which it is intended and not in any manner detrimental to the interests of channel modus or the respective partners,advisors,or retainees.
in early,ryder sent the krz story and proposal to andrew wald,a movie producer and friend of his.wald believed krz had potential as a feature film and agreed to help ryder get it made into a movie.in early,wald contacted a development executive at lightstorm,jay sanders,about krz,and he,ryder,sanders,and another independent producer toni baffo met at the lightstorm offices in february.wald provided sanders a copy of the krz story,and,according to ryder,the proposal at this meeting sanders told ryder how unique and really cool he thought the krz story was,that it presented an excellent development opportunity for lightstorm,and that lightstorm and ryder should do this together and develop the krz project.ryder agreed.
although sanders liked the story,he felt it needed to be refined.so between that initial meeting and either december according to defendants or december according to ryder,ryder,wald,and baffo met with sanders and sanders gave them notes on the story and coached them on crafting a pitch that would appeal to his bosses,rae sanchini and jon landau.if sanchini and landau liked the story,they would present it to cameron for final approval.during the development period,ryder met with sanders four times,while wald and baffo had additional meetings and calls with him.sanders felt passionate about the project,devoting hours to it while he was employed at lightstorm.ryder researched and compiled reference material relevant to krz,including information on mining practices and environmental devastation,jupiter and its moons,and strange and unique flora and fauna.
during this period ryder continued to revise the krz story,and in mid wald brought in screenwriter stuart hazeldine to write a treatment for krz on spec,without upfront payment,on speculation the project might later sell.after hazeldine finished the treatment,ryder,wald,baffo,and hazeldine had a meeting with sanders,sanchini,and landau,during which hazeldine pitched krz to them.cameron did not attend the pitch meeting.lightstorm passed on the project.at no point did anyone at lightstorm disclose the existence of the avatar scriptment to ryder.
ryder,wald,and baffo continued developing and trying to sell krz.sanders left lightstorm in march and took his krz file with him.he joined ryder,wald,hazeldine,and baffo in seeking to sell krz elsewhere.hazeldine wrote two drafts of a screenplay for krz,which the group submitted to various studios and directors without success.in,hazeldine retitled krz as the adjuster and resubmitted it to lightstorm,which again passed.shortly after,ryder and his group stopped pitching the project.lightstorm records indicate the submission entry for the adjuster in lightstorm database was m odified in january.
as set forth in the drafts of ryder short story and hazeldine later screenplays,krz takes place in the future mostly on europa,an moon of jupiter.it tells the story of corporate assassin kate shepherd named marlowe in ryder short stories who ryder described in the krz proposal as a strong,sexy,intelligent cyberbabe.she works for the malloc,which harvests organisms from ocean vents beneath europa icy surface.to do so,the corporation uses humans as well as hybrid robots called kry,which have y on their foreheads and limitation chips that block emotions and free will.kurtz,the foreman on europa,is a robot called a krz,which has a smaller limitation chip than kry and is and.
the human base commander,drew welles,turns up dead in what appears to be an accident,so malloc sends shepherd to investigate.she travels to europa with a kry named kary and meets kurtz,who knows she has come to investigate welles death.kurtz and shepherd tour the underwater harvesting fields and the surrounding exotic flora and fauna,and kurtz tells shepherd that welles died in a harvesting accident.kurtz allows shepherd to experience his memories through a cord connected to a jack in the back of his head,and she learns welles had become obsessed with increasing the organism yield from the ocean vents by using explosives that cause massive damage to the vents and kry.to stop him,kurtz reprogrammed himself,killed welles,and took over operations 
kurtz tells shepherd he wanted to protect europa from the devastating and urges her to cover up his murder of welles.instead,she reveals the murder to her malloc supervisor jeb fulford.fulford instructs her to kill kurtz,but she fails.kurtz lets her live,imploring her to join him in protecting the europan ecosystem.she declines,but decides not to oppose his efforts.
fulford arrives on europa with a replacement crew of krz.it is revealed fulford conspired with welles to use explosives in the mining process and now fulford wants to replace all the humans with krz.when kurtz learns this,he rallies the humans to fight back.kary,shepherd kry companion,reveals he is a krz loyal to malloc and fulford,and reprograms some of the kry to create an army to fight kurtz.
as the battle rages,shepherd removes kurtz limitation chip,which allows him to feel the human emotions necessary to defeat kary,but which will also kill him.kurtz pursues and kills kary,dying in the process.meanwhile,shepherd joins the battle against fulford,who is threatening to freeze the humans to death by shutting down the nuclear reactor powering the base.she overtakes fulford and forces him to tell malloc she should be put in charge of operations.she gives him the opportunity to leave europa,but he shoots at her,and the ricocheting bullets kill fulford.in the end,shepherd becomes the head of operations on europa 
procedural background 
ryder filed suit against defendants,alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty,breach of express contract,breach of implied contract,promissory fraud,fraud and deceit,and negligent misrepresentation.defendants moved for summary judgment.in a minute order,the trial court granted the motion on the ground that cameron independently created avatar.it later expanded that ruling by adopting defendants proposed order,finding ryder failed to create an inference of use,cameron independently created avatar,there was no triable issue of fact as to the existence of a joint venture or express contract,and there was no triable issue of fact as to fraud.the court also found a pending motion for discovery sanctions against defendants moot,given defendants produced the documents at issue and ryder had the opportunity to review them and file a supplemental brief opposing summary judgment.ryder timely appealed.

contract and fiduciary duty claims 
on appeal,ryder asserts a host of challenges to the trial court grant of summary judgment on his contract and fiduciary duty claims.but each of these claims requires proof that defendants used his ideas for avatar.nimmer nimmer,copyright the law of ideas,a,rel nimmer regardless of the legal theory used to impose an obligation on the,the recipient is legally obligated to pay only if the idea that the recipient used was the one actually received from plaintiff.hollywood screentest of america,nbc universal,th,granting summary judgment on express and implied contract and breach of confidence claims because evidence of independent creation prevented the required element of use.in the absence of direct evidence,use of an idea can be inferred from evidence showing the defendant had access to the plaintiff idea and the parties ideas are similar.nimmer,supra,c,benay warner.entertainment,cir,benay.we need not address the issue of access because,as we shall explain,no rational jury could conclude the actionable elements in krz and avatar were similar,which defeats an inference of use as a matter of law.funky films,time warner entertainment,cir,funky films for analogous copyright claims,n o amount of proof of access will suffice to show copying if there are no similarities.
before we compare the works,we must decide the level of actionable similarity necessary to raise an inference of use.for implied contract and fiduciary duty claims,the works must be substantially similar.benay,supra,at the requirement of substantial similarity for contract claims aligns this field with copyright infringement and also means that copying less than substantial material is.spinner,supra,th at see fink goodson todman enterprises,d,fink applying substantial similarity test to breach of confidence claim nimmer,supra,the law of ideas,a,in implied contract and confidential relationship cases,the weight of california authority is that there must be substantial similarity between plaintiff idea and defendant production to render defendant liable.for an express contract claim,however,the level of similarity permitting an inference of use is keyed to the language of the parties agreement.benay,supra,at see weitzenkorn lesser cal d,fink,supra,at.for both types of claims,the material claimed to be similar need not be protectible under copyright law.fink,supra,at.
ryder argues the terms of his krz proposal imposed a standard less than substantial similarity pointing to two clauses under the notice of recipients section the term that lightstorm would not copy,reproduce,or distribute to others this proposal,in whole or in part,at any time without the prior written consent of channel modus and the term that lightstorm would use this proposal for the sole purpose for which it is intended and not in any manner detrimental to the interests of channel modus.neither clause imposes a standard other than substantial similarity.
ryder argues he incurred detriment when sanders developed krz while concealing the existence of the avatar scriptment,relying on expert testimony that standard industry practice should have prompted lightstorm to disclose the existence of avatar.but this evidence has nothing to do with whether defendants used elements of krz to his detriment.instead,the prohibition against detrimental use presupposes there is enough similarity between elements in avatar and krz to result in some conceivable harm to ryder.that standard is consistent with substantial similarity.
likewise,the clause preventing copy ing in whole or in part italics added did not mean lightstorm could not use any part of krz in avatar,no matter how trivial or minor.this clause mirrors the touchstone inquiry of copying in copyright cases,which is circumstantially proved by access plus substantial similarity.funky films,supra,at.as noted,that standard parallels the inquiry of use in idea submission cases.spinner,supra,th at.thus,this clause also imposed a standard of substantial similarity.compare fink,supra,d at applying substantial similarity test to express oral agreement that defendants would pay plaintiff for any television program based on his submission.
turning to the question of substantial similarity,ryder points to a host of allegedly similar elements between avatar and krz that were already present in cameron avatar scriptment,as well as elements that were added to the avatar film.the preexisting elements in the avatar scriptment are not actionable because defendants would not have used those same elements from ryder krz.thus,we filter out those preexisting elements in assessing the similarity of the works.see murray hill publications,twentieth century fox film cir,murray explaining in the context of copyright infringement,logic also supports the filtering of elements.the purpose of the analysis is to answer the question whether the defendant copied the work of the plaintiff.ordinarily,similar elements between known work of the plaintiff and the defendant work will,depending on the degree of uniqueness and originality of the element,support such an inference.however,where defendant owns a prior work containing the same elements,he has no reason,beyond the illicit thrill of copyright infringement,to copy wrongfully from another what he could legally copy from himself.therefore,where an element occurs both in the defendant prior work and the plaintiff prior work,no inference of copying can be drawn.citations.such elements should be removed from consideration.
ryder claims defendants are estopped from relying on the scriptment to filter out preexisting elements because defendants concealed the existence of the avatar scriptment when sanders claimed krz was unique and agreed to develop it,whenever a party has,by his own statement or conduct,intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief,he is not,in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct,permitted to contradict it.ryder argument fails because equitable estoppel acts defensively only.it operates to prevent one from taking an unfair advantage of another but not to give an unfair advantage of one seeking to invoke the doctrine.peskin phinney d,see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity.in other words,the theory of estoppel is invoked as a defensive matter to prevent the party estopped from alleging or relying upon some fact or theory that would otherwise permit him to recover something from the party asserting estoppel.green travelers indemnity d,italics added see in re marriage of umphrey d,explaining estoppel acts defensively only it can never be used as a sword to gain unfair advantage by the one seeking to assert it.here,ryder improperly seeks to use the doctrine offensively to establish his contract claims by barring defendants from relying on the preexisting avatar scriptment to undermine the inference of use.see green,supra,at refusing to apply estoppel to preclude defendant from relying on case law defeating plaintiff claims.
ryder also contends,even if estoppel does not apply,lightstorm expressly agreed not to use preexisting elements in the avatar scriptment that were similar to elements in krz.nothing in the record remotely supports such an expansive interpretation of the parties alleged agreement.contrary to the authority ryder cites,this is not a case in which defendants could have come up with the common or unprotected ideas in krz but did not,thereby obligating them to pay ryder for disclosing his ideas.see,chandler roach d,we believe that if a producer obligates himself to pay for the disclosure of an idea,whether it is for protectible or unprotectible material,in return for a disclosure thereof he should be compelled to hold to his promise.there is nothing unreasonable in the assumption that a producer would obligate himself to pay for the disclosure of an idea which he would otherwise be legally free to use,but which in fact,he would be unable to use but for the disclosure.italics added.to confer rights on ryder over the elements already created in the avatar scriptment under these circumstances would turn idea submission law on its head.
thus,ryder can recover on his contract claims only if a rational jury could conclude the elements ryder argues were added to the avatar film beyond the scriptment were substantially similar to elements in krz.as we will explain,these elements bear no substantial similarity,defeating any inference of use as a matter of law 
the protagonist is enlisted as a spy by the corporation.both protagonists are not acting as spies.jake in avatar arguably becomes a spy when quaritch enlists him to gather clandestine intelligence about the na vi.in krz,while at points shepherd is called a spy for malloc,she is not acting as a spy on europa and her mission is always known she has gone to investigate welles death.further,the clandestine aspect of jake mission in avatar is a significant plot point leading to neytiri rejection of jake.in krz,because there is no clandestine aspect to shepherd europa mission,her job description as a spy has no impact on the plot.
the protagonist survives a situation by escaping into a rushing torrent of water.this element does not appear at all in krz.in avatar,during jake first foray into the wilds of pandora in his na vi avatar,he is attacked by a creature and escapes by jumping over a waterfall into a rushing river.in krz,shepherd does not escape a dangerous situation by water at all.in ryder short story,she is sucked into a tube of water.in the krz screenplays,while submerged in the ocean,she blasts her way into an underwater elevator shaft and rides the resulting wave of water down to the base nuclear reactor.
the corporation depends on the spy to facilitate the continued mining.again,jake and shepherd are not both acting as spies.nor does the corporation in krz rely on shepherd as a spy to facilitate the mining of the organisms on europa.because her intentions are known,the corporation simply relies on her to investigate welles death and get the mining operations back on track on europa.
the material is mined to great devastation to satisfy quarterly reports for the corporation on earth.the only alleged similarity for this element is that both works use the term quarterly.quarterly reports are common fea
