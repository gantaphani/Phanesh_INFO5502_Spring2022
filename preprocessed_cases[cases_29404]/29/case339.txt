appellant susquehanna radio corporation susquehanna appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to appellee bridge capital investors,ii bci in this breach of contract action.specifically,susquehanna contends the district court erred when it held susquehanna construction permit unambiguously became a final order as defined in section d of the parties asset purchase agreement the agreement before may,thus requiring susquehanna to pay bci the million additional payment set forth in section we affirm.
background 
the federal communications commission fcc has a standard,procedure for relocating an existing fm radio station to a new community.first,the station licensee must obtain an fcc report and order reallotment,which amends the table of allotments to allow the station to broadcast from a new community of license.if the fcc issues such a reallotment,the licensee must then secure a construction permit cp to build broadcast facilities at the new location.in summary,the licensee must obtain two separate fcc orders to relocate its existing fm radio station the reallotment and the cp.
on november,susquehanna agreed to purchase the assets of two anniston,alabama,radio stations collectively the station from sapphire broadcasting,sapphire for million.seeking to relocate the station to the more lucrative market of college park,georgia,susquehanna agreed to pay sapphire an additional million upon satisfaction of three conditions.these three of which pertains solely to the in section of the agreement the fcc grants susquehanna a class cp without any material adverse conditions,as defined in section the cp meets susquehanna broadcast coverage requirements and susquehanna obtains the final order for a cp within six years of the agreement may,closing date,before may.section d defines the term final order 
the term final order shall mean an fcc order which is not reversed,stayed,enjoined,set aside,annulled or suspended and with respect to which no timely filed request for administrative or judicial review,reconsideration or stay is pending,and as to which the time for filing any such request,or for the fcc to set aside its order on its own motion,has expired.
after receiving the million initial payment for the station from susquehanna,sapphire assigned to bci its rights to the million additional payment.
susquehanna filed a petition for rule making with the fcc on november,requesting a reallotment that would enable it to relocate the station from anniston to college park.preston small then submitted a competing proposal to move his midgeville,georgia,station to social circle,georgia.if granted,small counterproposal would have prevented susquehanna from moving the station to college park.on april,the fcc granted susquehanna petition and denied small counterproposal by means of a reallotment.
between june,and august,small filed multiple petitions for reconsideration of the reallotment and motions to reopen the record.the fcc denied each petition and motion.on january,the fcc also precluded small from filing further requests for administrative relief or rehearing.small then sought review of the reallotment in the court of appeals for the circuit,but the court denied his petition for review on may,and denied his request for rehearing en banc on july.see small fcc.
on november,while small first petition for reconsideration of the reallotment was pending,the fcc granted susquehanna its requested cp.in accordance with section,this cp did not contain any material adverse conditions and satisfied susquehanna broadcast coverage requirements.susquehanna proceeded to construct its broadcast facilities in college park and received fcc program test authority to begin broadcasting the station.since january,the station has continuously broadcast from college park as all the hits.nevertheless,when bci requested the million additional payment from susquehanna,susquehanna asserted its cp did not become a final order before may,as required under section,and thus refused payment.
bci filed suit on june,alleging susquehanna cp became a final order before may,and,therefore,susquehanna refusal to make the million additional payment constituted a breach of contract.both parties moved for summary judgment.on january,the district court determined susquehanna cp became a final order prior to may,and bci was thus entitled to summary judgment on its breach of contract claim.the district court accordingly awarded bci million plus interest and attorney fees and costs.this appeal ensued.

we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standards as the district court,and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.johnson booker washington broad,cir.
iii.discussion 
this appeal presents the following question of contract interpretation did susquehanna cp unambiguously become a final order as defined in section d of the may,to answer this question,we must look first to section,which instructs us to construe the agreement in accordance with new york law.under new york law,w hether a contract is clear or ambiguous is for the court to determine as a matter of law.fetner fetner.w here the contract is clear and unambiguous on its face,the intent of the parties must be gleaned from within the four corners of the instrument,and the case is ripe for summary judgment,am.express bank,uniroyal.
with these basic rules of contract interpretation in mind,we begin our analysis of the agreement relevant language.again,section stipulates the million additional payment shall only be due and owing by susquehanna to bci if susquehanna obtains the final order for a cp before may.as explained above,the reallotment and the cp are separately issued fcc orders.accordingly,the parties could have made the additional payment due and owing upon,among other events,susquehanna acquisition of the final order for a reallotment the final order for a cp or the final order for both a reallotment and a cp.the language of section unambiguously indicates the parties opted for the second option and made the additional payment due and owing only upon susquehanna acquisition of the final order for a cp.
we now turn to section d to determine whether the cp became a final order before may.section d sets forth three requirements for the cp to qualify as a final order 
the cp has never been reversed,stayed,enjoined,set aside,annulled or suspended 
no timely filed request for administrative or judicial review,reconsideration or stay is pending with respect to the cp and 
a the time for filing any such request for administrative or judicial review,reconsideration or stay of the cp has expired,and 
b the time for the fcc to set aside the cp on its own motion has expired.
after reviewing the parties briefs,the record,and the relevant statutes,regulations,and case law,we conclude each of these three requirements was satisfied before may.first,the cp was never reversed,stayed,enjoined,set aside,annulled or suspended.second,the secretary of the fcc,marlene dortch,certified that no request for administrative or judicial review,reconsideration or stay has been filed with respect to the cp.third,the time for filing any such request for administrative or judicial review,reconsideration or stay of the cp expired on december,days after the fcc issued public notice of the cp on november,see b c,a,and the time for the fcc to set aside the cp on its own motion expired on december,days after the fcc issued public notice of its grant of the cp on november,see.in short,the cp became a final order,as defined in section d,no later than december,two and a half years before the agreement deadline.accordingly,we hold sections and d unambiguously obligate susquehanna to pay bci an additional million.
seeking to make an around the agreement unambiguous language,susquehanna argues section d second,no timely filed request for administrative or judicial review is pending with respect to the not satisfied before may.specifically,susquehanna asserts small multiple requests for administrative and judicial review of the reallotment constituted timely filed requests for administrative or judicial review with respect to the cp.because these requests for administrative and judicial review of the reallotment were pending between june,and july,susquehanna thus contends the cp did not become a final order until july,two years after the agreement deadline 
the gravamen of susquehanna argument is that we should judicially rewrite sections and d to make the additional payment due and owing upon the reallotment and the cp becoming final orders before may.when contracting parties express their intent in unambiguous language,however,words can not be read into the contract which import an intent wholly unexpressed when the contract was executed.in re rivas trust,quotation omitted.the parties did not refer to the reallotment in sections and d instead,they unambiguously agreed to make the million additional payment contingent upon the the cp a final order,as defined in section d,before may.if susquehanna genuinely intended to link the additional payment to the reallotment finality,it should have exercised greater care in negotiating the language employed in sections and d 
furthermore,susquehanna fails to direct our attention to a single statute,regulation,or fcc case indicating that a cp can only become a final order if the related reallotment becomes a final order.if such authority existed,we could arguably read the words reallotment into sections and d,because,unless a contract provides otherwise,the law in force at the time the agreement is entered into becomes as much a part of the agreement as though it were expressed or referred to therein,for it is presumed that the parties had such law in contemplation when the contract was made.dolman trust of.susquehanna accordingly cites three fcc re meridian communications,wl in re open media,wl and in re kwqj fm,anchorage,alaska,wl for the proposition that fcc case law,in force when the parties contracted,defines final order as a cp that is not subject to fcc or judicial review in the underlying reallotment proceeding.
this argument is unavailing,however,because the facts in these three cases are not,as susquehanna asserts,indistinguishable from the facts in this case.indeed,none of these three cases involved a reallotment.rather,in each case,applicant a and applicant b submitted mutually exclusive cp applications to construct a new radio station the fcc dismissed applicant a cp application,and applicant a petitioned for reconsideration of this dismissal the fcc granted applicant b cp application and the fcc held applicant b grant could not become final until the fcc adjudicated applicant a petition for reconsideration.meridian commc ns,at open media,at,kwqj fm,at.at best,therefore,these three cases stand for the proposition that one applicant administrative or judicial challenge to the fcc dismissal of its cp application prevents the fcc grant of another applicant mutually exclusive cp from becoming a final order.
in contrast,this case stems from susquehanna efforts to relocate an existing fm radio station and involves two distinct fcc reallotment and the cp.as discussed above,neither small nor any other person brought an administrative or judicial challenge to the fcc grant of susquehanna cp application instead,small challenged only the reallotment.the three fcc cases susquehanna cites simply do not address whether small challenge to the reallotment prevented susquehanna subsequent cp from becoming a final order.susquehanna has thus failed to cite any law,in force at the time the parties executed the agreement,stating a cp can not become a final order until the related reallotment becomes a final order.accordingly,we can not presume that the parties had such law in contemplation when the contract was made,dolman,at,and susquehanna proffered interpretation of section d second requirement lacks merit.
contrary to susquehanna suggestions,our interpretation of sections and d does not give rise to an unfair result since january,susquehanna has reaped the financial benefits of continuously broadcasting the station throughout the atlanta area as all the hits.as the district court noted,therefore,susquehanna has realized the benefit of its bargain.bci,on the other hand,has not yet realized the benefit of its bargain,because susquehanna refuses to surrender the million additional payment.in short,susquehanna has thus far managed to pay bci an price for an radio station.the agreement unambiguous language indicates the parties did not contract for such an outcome 
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude susquehanna cp unambiguously became a final order,as defined in section d,no later than december,nearly two and a half years before section deadline.susquehanna refusal to make the million additional payment required under section thus constitutes a breach of the agreement.we accordingly affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to bci.
although the majority interpretation of section d to provide that the construction permit was a final order may have captured the parties intent,it is only one plausible view of what their contract reflects.if the contract can be read differently,and i submit that the majority own opinion demonstrates that it can be,then summary judgment is inappropriate and further proceedings are necessary to determine the parties intent the issue is not whether my reading of the contract or the majority is correct the issue is whether both are plausible.because i believe that the contract admits of more than one interpretation,i dissent.
there is no disagreement that section d of the contract sets out three conditions,all of which must be satisfied for an fcc order to become a final order within the meaning of the contract between bci and susquehanna.the parties also concede that the first the fcc order at issue is not reversed,stayed,enjoined,set aside,annulled or suspended is satisfied.the questions at issue in this appeal are whether the second and third conditions are also satisfied.i submit that they are not,and address them in reverse order.
as here relevant,the third condition is satisfied only if the time for the fcc to set aside its order on its own motion has expired.under the majority view,that time period is exclusively governed by a,which provides that within days after public notice is given of any action taken pursuant to delegated authority,the commission may on its own motion order the record of the proceeding before it for review.
the majority reads this regulation as a mandatory,inflexible,jurisdictional time limit,and suggests that susquehanna has waived any argument to the contrary.i do not believe that susquehanna has waived such an argument and instead conclude that the fcc must have possessed the authority to set aside the construction permit if the reallotment was invalidated by the circuit,as i explain more fully below.see post at.moreover,neither the majority nor bci cite to any statute,regulation or fcc case holding that the fcc may only rescind its orders pursuant to.that is,the majority provides no explanation for why the review contemplated by is exhaustive,a conclusion that hardly follows from the regulation own language,and that is inapposite here in light of the specific permit at issue.
under the majority view,a gave the fcc only forty days from the issuance of the construction permit to rescind it sua sponte.yet,the construction permit contemplated the possibility of future invalidation pursuant to court order whenever the judicial review of the reallotment was completed.indeed,the fcc would have had to rescind the construction permit had the circuit invalidated the reallotment.thus,the if the majority reading of a is correct,the fcc would have lacked the authority,after forty days,to do what the construction permit contemplated and what the law would have required 
indeed,the majority even notes the potential absurdity that would follow from their unambiguous interpretation of the contract.to wit if the cp had become a final order before may,but the fcc or circuit had overturned the reallotment,susquehanna would have had to pay an additional million,even though it could not broadcast from college park.ante at.the majority nevertheless justifies such an implausible reading of the contract by asserting that,i n the context of this agreement,the risk susquehanna assumed was relatively small,because it was unlikely that the review of the reallotment would succeed.this conclusion flies in the face of the majority acknowledgment of both the possible risk,albeit small,and its acknowledgment of the fact that some challenges do succeed.had the challenge succeeded in this case,would a really bar the fcc from complying with the circuit judgment if not,then a does mean what the majority says it means.
even if it were true that the challenge to the reallotment was likely to fail and i am to see how we can interject such rationalization into contract interpretation,such a result hardly amplifies the extent to which the contract is unambiguous along the lines suggested by the majority.quite to the contrary,it only bolsters the argument that the construction permit could not have become a final order until forty days after the judicial review of the reallotment had terminated,and i would so interpret the third condition.at the very least,it can not be gainsaid that the construction permit language renders the third condition of section d ambiguous.
even if the majority is correct that susquehanna waived the above argument with respect to the third condition in section d,the second condition in section d is likewise ambiguous.it provides that no timely filed request for administrative or judicial review,reconsideration or stay is pending with respect to the fcc order at issue.the majority concludes that,because no such review of the construction permit itself was pending on or before may,the second condition is also satisfied.
whereas i agree that no review of the construction permit itself was pending on or before may,i do not agree that this fact is dispositive,due to the language of the construction permit.paragraph of the construction permit expressly provides that 
the grant of this permit is conditioned on the final outcome of a pending request for review of the reallotment.the final outcome of that proceeding may require to change frequency,class,or site location.accordingly,any construction undertaken pursuant to this permit is at the permittee sole risk.
emphasis added.the permit was thus conditioned upon the successful completion of the already pending administrative and judicial review of the reallotment,and contemplated the possibility that,if the review turned out unfavorably to susquehanna,the construction permit would have to be rescinded.
the question,then,is whether the contractual language,when referring to administrative or judicial review,means only direct administrative or judicial review of the construction permit,or whether it means administrative or judicial review related to the construction permit.whereas,in most cases,this distinction would be without a difference,the opposite is true here because the fcc grant of the construction permit was,in its own terms,conditioned upon the successful completion of review of the reallotment.that is,if the purpose of the second condition of section d is to ensure that no further review is pending that could jeopardize the finality of the construction permit,it is obviously not satisfied where,as here,the permit is conditioned upon judicial review of other fcc orders.as such,administrative or judicial review of the reallotment is administrative or judicial review with respect to the construction permit.
at the very least,the conditional nature of the construction permit renders the relevant contractual language could refer either to review of only the construction permit,or,separately,review related to the permit,including,in this case,review of the reallotment under the latter reading,the second condition was not satisfied.
the majority completely ignores the conditional nature of the construction permit.it recognizes,as it must,that the permit is conditioned upon completion of the administrative or judicial review of the reallotment,but then asserts that the condition is no condition at all.instead,according to the majority,paragraph merely reiterates a fact known to both parties at the time of,if the fcc granted susquehanna a reallotment and a cp,but then revoked the reallotment,susquehanna cp alone would not enable it to broadcast the station from college park.ante at.thus,in one sentence,the majority concludes that the condition in the construction permit means merely reiterates a fact known to both parties at the time of contracting and at the same time acknowledges that it means everything,for without the reallotment,there could not be a construction permit.it strikes me as paradoxical to note the language of the construction permit and yet refuse to give the word conditioned any meaning at all.
second,in rejecting the contractual language described above,the majority offers little more than an ipse the parties would have used other language if they meant to require that the reallotment become a final order before the construction permit could follow suit.this assertion,however,overlooks one critical fact the condition in the construction permit linking the permit to the judicial review of the reallotment was created by the fcc,several years after the contract was formed.thus,the parties may not have initially intended for the construction permit to be conditioned upon the successful completion of judicial review of the reallotment,but the fcc subsequently required as much when it issued the permit.whether the parties would have intended for such an external condition to control the finality of the construction permit is the very question that the ambiguous nature of section d should foreclose us from answering at this stage.instead,the majority reads into the contractual language evidence of an intent to reject a condition that did not exist at the time,even though,as the majority itself emphasizes,we may not make a new contract for the parties under the guise of interpreting the writing.ante at quoting.teddy bear madison realty,internal quotation marks omitted.
at bottom,then,the language of the construction permit renders section d ambiguous as to when the administrative or judicial review with respect to the permit became final.
even though this case is a fairly routine action,and is sufficiently that it is hard to see how our decision will have lasting relevance to anyone other than the parties,there is something deeply flawed with the majority methodology.i recognize,as i must,that reasonable minds can read similar contractual language differently,and that my own reading of section d may not be that which my colleagues would adopt,were a choice of competing interpretations the sole purpose for which our jurisdiction was invoked.indeed,it is an inescapable truism that,in many cases that come before our court,two votes for one interpretation of language will trump one vote for a contrary view.
but this case,like some others,belongs in a different class,for our analysis is centered on the question of differences in interpretation should almost always compel the same conclusion that the relevant language is ambiguous given that observation,i can not agree that the majority reading of section d,the shortcomings of which they admit,is the only plausible one.
the result the majority reaches today might have ultimately proven to be the correct one on remand,but only if things are true about the parties intent the contract that we do not yet know.especially because much turns on the language of the construction permit,which came well after formation of the contract,extrinsic evidence,including the parol evidence rule,would likely have proven central to resolution of the intent of the parties,and of the interaction between the construction permit and section d.that is why summary judgment is manifestly inappropriate at this stage of the litigation,and that is why i must dissent.
susquehanna also contends the district court should have granted it summary judgment under the equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel.after reviewing the parties briefs,the rec
