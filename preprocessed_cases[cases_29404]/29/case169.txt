on the night of december,the melody lane lounge,a commercial bar located in massillon,ohio,showed the live broadcast of a boxing match between riddick bowe and andrew golota the event.national satellite sports,nss had obtained the exclusive right to broadcast the event to commercial establishments in ohio.time warner entertainment company,had obtained the exclusive right to broadcast the event on a basis to its ohio residential customers.the melody lane lounge,erroneously listed as a residential customer of time warner,ordered the event through time warner service.
after learning that the melody lane lounge had shown the event to its patrons on the night in question,nss brought suit against eliadis,the corporate owner of the bar.the suit also named eliadis two owners and time warner as defendants.nss alleged that the showing of the event in a commercial establishment through time warner residential service constituted a violation of the federal communications act of,communications act,which,among other things,prohibits the unauthorized divulgence of wire or radio communications.
eliadis and its reached a prompt settlement with nss.nss and time warner then filed for summary judgment against each other.the district court first granted summary judgment to nss on the issue of liability,and subsequently entered a final judgment awarding nss damages,costs,and attorney fees.
time warner appeals the district court rulings,claiming that the court erred in failing to give preclusive effect to an adverse judgment against nss in prior litigation between the parties on an allegedly controlling issue.in the alternative,time warner claims that nss lacks standing to sue under the communications act and,in any event,that nss has failed to establish a violation of that statute.for all of the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
nss and time warner obtained their respective rights to broadcast the event through separate contracts.new jersey sports productions,main events main events,produced the event.it granted pay per view networks,viewer choice viewer choice,the exclusive right to broadcast the event to residential households.viewer choice,in turn,licensed time warner to make the telecast of the event available to residential customers in ohio.main events granted entertainment by,ejj a separate exclusive right to broadcast the event to commercial establishments.nss obtained the right to be the commercial distributor of the event telecast in ohio from ejj.
main events created a single telecast of the event and sent it to a transmission station.from the transmission station,the signal was sent to two different satellites.viewer choice received the signal from one of the satellites.it decoded the signal,rescrambled it,and sent it to another set of satellites that transmitted the signal to a time warner facility in akron,ohio.the akron facility,known as a head end,receives programs via satellite and distributes them to subscribers in the akron region.because the event was a program,time warner encrypted it at the akron head end so that only subscribers who had ordered the event would be able to decode and view the program.
nss received its transmission of the telecast from a chain of distribution that traces back to the second satellite that received the initial signal from main events.as a result,the signals that nss and time warner received in their respective ohio facilities both originated from the same initial transmission sent by main events,and neither party disputes the right of the other to receive the signals in ohio according to their separate contracts.rather,the dispute centers on time warner allowing a commercial establishment to view the event on its cable network.
melody lane lounge account was listed in the individual name of gust eliadis,a of eliadis.in february of,ken sovacool,a time warner employee,serviced eliadis cable account.time warner concedes that sovacool should have recognized that the melody lane lounge was a commercial establishment and not a residence.the structure of the building,an exterior identification sign,and neon beer signs in the window made this obvious.nevertheless,having obtained service,the melody lane lounge had the capability to order programs.
time warner account records show that melody lane lounge had ordered one earlier program at the commercial rate.but melody lane lounge ordered the event in question from time warner at the residential rate of.as a commercial establishment,melody lane lounge should have paid nss for the right to show the event,which would have cost it.
nss hired investigators to visit various commercial establishments to monitor whether those showing the event had obtained the right to do so through nss as the proper distribution channel.an investigator visited the melody lane lounge on the night in question and ultimately determined that it was broadcasting the event through time warner residential system.the melody lane lounge claims that it would not have chosen to show the event had it been required to pay nss high commercial rate.only patrons were in the bar at the time the event was broadcast.
procedural background and prior litigation between the parties 
nss commenced its action in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio in november of.eliadis,and its soon settled with nss,agreeing to the entry of judgment against them for violating,which is part of the communications act,and paying in nominal damages.nss claim against time warner proceeded.
in july of,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of nss,finding that time warner had violated.a bench trial on the issue of damages was held several months later.the district court determined that time warner was liable for in statutory damages.nss further sought and was awarded attorney fees and costs pursuant to e b iii,totaling,in march of.time warner appeals the rulings of the district court,raising three alternative arguments.
first,time warner contends that the district court erred by failing to give preclusive effect to a separate district court judgment rendered in july of that arose from a substantially identical claim by nss against time warner.nss learned that a commercial establishment in akron,ohio called lyndstalder,coach corner,had shown a boxing match between evander holyfield and bobby czyz that coach corner obtained via service from time warner in march of.as in the case before us,time warner had obtained the exclusive right from the producer to distribute the match to residential customers in ohio,while nss received the exclusive license to sell the same program to ohio commercial establishments.
nss commenced an action against coach corner and its owner in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio in august of.when nss learned of time warner role in providing the broadcast to coach corner,it added time warner as a defendant.in that suit,national satellite sports,lyndstalder,coach corner,et,cv,nss alleged that both coach corner and time warner had violated.coach corner settled with nss.time warner then filed a motion for summary judgment,alleging that nss had failed to establish either a contractual or a statutory claim against it.
the district court held a hearing on time warner motion for summary judgment in july of.it issued a bench ruling at that hearing,granting time warner motion for summary judgment on the basis that nss failed to state a claim pursuant to the terms of the contracts for distribution at issue in this case as well as.nss did not appeal.time warner argues that the coach corner decision precludes nss from raising the identical claim in the present case.
second,even if we conclude that nss is not bound by the coach corner decision,time warner argues that nss does not qualify as a person aggrieved under d.it therefore contends that nss lacks the standing to sue time warner for an alleged violation of.
finally,as its last line of defense,time warner argues that nss cause of action under fails because time warner did not intercept a communication within the meaning of the communications act.it maintains that the clear purpose of the act is to prohibit and punish acts of communications piracy,which is far removed from what time warner says occurred in the present case.although time warner concedes that nss may have a claim against it based on breach of contract,it argues that nss has pursued the wrong cause of action under.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see,holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is proper when there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the judge is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.a genuine issue for trial exists only when there is sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.id.at.
we will not disturb a district court determination of an award for damages unless clearly erroneous.see meyers city of cincinnati,cir.
nss is not bound by the decision in coach corner 
nss brought suit in both this case and in the coach corner case under.section defines what constitutes the unauthorized publication or use of electronic communications.it includes such prohibited practices as the divulgence of wire or radio communications by persons authorized to receive them to others who are not so authorized,and the interception of any radio communication by a person not authorized to receive that communication from the sender.see a.according to,a ny person aggrieved by any violation of subsection a of this section may bring a civil action in a united states district court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.e a.furthermore,the statute directs that the term any person aggrieved shall include any person with proprietary rights in the intercepted communication by wire or radio,including wholesale or retail distributors of satellite cable programming.d.
in its motion before the court in coach corner,time warner argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because nss was not a person aggrieved within the meaning of d,and could therefore not pursue a claim for an alleged violation of a.nss responded by arguing that standing to sue under is not limited to those who meet the statutory definition of a person aggrieved.
the district court granted time warner motion for summary judgment in the coach corner case.in articulating its reasoning from the bench on july,the court held that nss had failed to state a claim under both the contracts at issue in that case and under.the pertinent parts of the coach corner ruling were as follows 
with regard to the ruling,nss has failed to state a claim pursuant to the terms of the contracts at issue in this case as well as united states code section.
paragraph e of the television licensing agreement provides for the enforcement of unauthorized display of the closed circuit television feed.that also provides that joe hand promotions the licensor of the event could not assert any piracy claim without prior notice.
the agreement provides that a sublicensee nss has no rights to enforceability,quote,it being understood that your sublicensee shall have no right to commence or settle any claim or litigation hereunder.
the other relevant agreement is the march,closed circuit television agreement entered into between the licensor and nss.
that agreement at paragraph provides that there is no right to a piracy action to be pursued by nss.
nss effort to overcome the language of the contract does not create a material fact for trial.
time warner now argues that the district court below should have given preclusive effect to the earlier ruling in coach corner.it claims that coach corner determined that when a commercial establishment shows a sporting event ordered through a service rather than properly paying the fees exacted by the commercial distributor,the distributor does not have standing to sue the authorized provider under.nss obviously disagrees.
our circuit has held that a prior decision shall have preclusive effect on an issue raised in a later case if four elements are met 
the precise issue raised in the present case must have been raised and actually litigated in the prior proceeding determination of the issue must have been necessary to the outcome of the prior proceeding the prior proceeding must have resulted in a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom estoppel is sought must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior proceeding.
smith sec,cir en banc quoting detroit police officers ass young,cir.
in the present case,the district court concluded that time warner had failed to establish the second and fourth elements of this test.because time warner and nss disagree as to whether these four elements were met,an analysis of each is necessary in order to decide if the district court erred by failing to give preclusive effect to the coach corner decision.
identity of issues 
time warner argues that the coach corner court was faced with the precise threshold question that the district court encountered in the current case.this question is whether nss has standing to sue under in particular,whether nss had a proprietary interest in the communication that was sent from time warner via its authorized service to its customers.time warner further contends that the bifurcation of the satellite transmission of the boxing match at issue in coach corner was identical to the manner in which the event in question was sent to time warner and nss in ohio on december.
nss counters that there is no identity of issues in these two cases.first,it contends that the transmissions at issue in coach corner are distinguishable from the ones involved in the present case.specifically,time warner distributed the boxing match to its residential customers through its home box office hbo service,not through a network.the difference is that all residential hbo subscribers had access to view the match,whereas only the residential customers who ordered the event through the network could view the program.second,nss argues that the licensing agreements as between time warner and nss were fundamentally different.
we believe that time warner argument is the more persuasive on this identity of issues element.although hbo and are different subscriber services,the key issue in both cases is the consequences of a commercial establishment gaining access to view a boxing match by being inaccurately listed as a residential customer of time warner.as a result,time warner has satisfied the first element for issue preclusion.
necessary to the outcome of the prior proceeding 
the district court held that time warner failed to establish that nss lack of standing under was necessary to the grant of summary judgment for time warner in coach corner.it determined that the coach corner decision was instead primarily based on the conclusion that nss was contractually barred from pursuing an action against time warner because of the particular language in the license agreements involved in that case.as such,it held that the alternative ground in coach corner for granting time warner motion for summary,that nss was not a person aggrieved under not necessary to that court judgment.
time warner argues that the district court erred in reaching this conclusion.it notes that coach corner is a case in which two alternative but independent grounds support the court ultimate judgment.time warner claims that under the weight of federal authority,a plaintiff is precluded from relitigating an issue actually decided against it in a prior case,even if the court in the prior case rested its judgment on alternative grounds.it cites the second,seventh,ninth,and circuits as upholding this general principle of issue preclusion.see williams ward,cir magnus,la republica argentina,cir in re westgate california,cir yamaha of america united states.
this principle of issue preclusion,however,is counterbalanced by courts and commentaries that have adopted the opposite conclusion.for example,the american law institute ali endorses nss position that i f a judgment of a court of first instance is based on determinations of two issues,either of which standing independently would be sufficient to support the result,the judgment is not conclusive with respect to either issue standing alone.restatement second of judgments cmt.i.furthermore,one leading commentary describes the restatement view as the new and modern rule.see james moore et,moore federal practice b at to ed.at least four circuits the third,fourth,eighth,and tenth have adopted this modern rule.see arab african int l bank epstein,cir ritter mount mary college,cir baker chaske,cir turney,cir.in addition,the seventh circuit has embraced the modern rule in the context of the black lung benefits act in peabody coal spese,cir en banc,without citing its contrary holding in magnus electronics,at.
the issue is a close one given the policy implications involved.time warner argues that by not recognizing coach corner as precluding relitigation of whether nss has standing to sue under,nss is free to relitigate the same issue again.nss counters by arguing that because the coach corner court decided that nss was contractually barred from pursuing a claim against time warner,nss had no incentive to appeal that court secondary decision that nss failed to state a claim under.
we find nss point persuasive because,while it might have won the battle over,nss would almost surely have lost the war in being unable to overcome the contractual prohibition on commencing litigation against time warner.furthermore,the district court oral ruling in coach corner transcribes into only a conclusory statement regarding nss claim under,which was far overshadowed by the balance of its discussion outlining the contractual obstacles that prevented nss from suing time warner.
this circuit has not decided whether alternative grounds for a judgment are each necessary to the outcome for the purposes of issue preclusion in a subsequent case involving only one of the grounds.based on the actual decision in coach corner,we do not find it necessary to fully resolve this issue at the present time.we do hold,however,that where,as in coach corner,one ground for the decision is clearly primary and the other only secondary,the secondary ground is not necessary to the outcome for the purposes of issue preclusion.coach corner secondary holding that nss failed to state a claim under was thus not necessary to the granting of time warner motion for summary judgment.
final judgment on the merits 
although the district court held that the coach corner decision was a final judgment on the merits for the purpose of issue preclusion,nss argues that it was not.in particular,it claims that the court judgment in coach corner was a dismissal of nss suit without prejudice for failure to state a claim.this argument is without merit.coach corner granted time warner motion for summary judgment pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.furthermore,the district court made clear that its judgment was final.it recognized that both parties will more than likely have a disagreement over everything i say,pretty much,and you can take it up to the sixth circuit and they can tell us whether i was right or wrong.finally,summary judgment is recognized as a final judgment for the purpose of issue preclusion.see mayer distel tool mach,cir holding that where the facts and legal theory of a complaint are identical to those of a previous complaint,a grant of summary judgment on the prior complaint is a final judgment and could be the basis for issue preclusion in a subsequent case.time warner has therefore satisfied this third element for issue preclusion.
full and fair opportunity to litigate 
turning to the final element,time warner contends that the district court in coach corner granted its motion for summary judgment after full briefing and argument,and that both parties had a sufficient opportunity to litigate the issue before that court.nss,however,argues that the district court in coach corner primarily focused on the question of whether nss license agreement contractually barred it from initiating a suit against time warner.it therefore contends that the question of whether nss had a proprietary right in the communication under was secondary.the district court agreed with nss.
we believe that time warner has the more persuasive argument on this issue.nothing in the coach corner case prevented either nss or time warner from raising all potential arguments about the applicability of to the circumstances of their case.despite the contractual language that was ultimately held to bar nss from raising a claim against time warner in coach corner,nss still had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claim that it raised under.as such,we conclude that time warner has satisfied this final element for issue preclusion.
in sum,we agree with the district court that the second element necessary to the outcome set forth in smith sec,cir en banc,has not been met,but disagree that the fourth element full and fair opportunity to litigate was lacking.but because all four elements of smith must be satisfied before the prior opinion will be given preclusive effect,nss is not bound by the decision in coach corner.we therefore turn to the issues of whether nss has standing to sue under of the communications act and whether it has sufficiently established a claim against time warner for a violation of that act.
nss has standing to sue time warner because the definition of a person aggrieved in d is nonexclusive 
congress enacted the cable communications policy act of to address a problem which is increasingly plaguing the cable theft of cable service,at,reprinted in.this statute amended and supplemented the communications act.see id.the legislation added subsections b e to.these new provisions were intended to address the growing practice of individuals taking down satellite delivered programming for private,home viewing by means of privately owned backyard earth stations.see at.the original prohibitions contained in,however,were retained without amendment in what is now codified at a.
section a,therefore,lists the types of unauthorized publication or use of electronic communications that have been prohibited since the communications act first became law.it sets forth separate prohibitions in each sentence.the first sentence states 
n o person receiving,assisting in receiving,transmitting,or assisting in transmitting,any interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio shall divulge or publish the existence,contents,substance,purport,effect,or meaning thereof,except through authorized channels of transmission or reception to any person other than the addressee,his agent,or attorney 
a.the second sentence of a prohibits piracy as is it traditionally understood 
no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any radio communication and divulge or publish the existence,contents,substance,purport,effect,or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person.
id.finally,the third sentence provides 
no person not being entitled thereto shall receive or assist in receiving any interstate or foreign communication by radio and use such communication or any information therein contained for his own benefit or for the benefit of another not entitled thereto.
congress has criminalized the unauthorized interception of communications prohibited by a.see e.subsection e also provides for private civil enforcement of as now amended.see e a any person aggrieved by any violation of subsection a of this section may bring a civil action in a united states district court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.as a result,sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for its violation.see e.furthermore,e designates varying penalties,depending on whether or not a violation of the section was willful.the term person aggrieved was not defined when e a was originally enacted.
section of the communications act was further amended by the satellite home viewer act of,stat.that act amended by adding the following definition of a person aggrieved to d 
d definitions 
for purposes of this section 
the term any person aggrieved shall include any person with proprietary rights in the intercepted communication by wire or radio,including wholesale or retail distributors of satellite cable programming 
d.the communications act elsewhere defines a communication by wire as a transmission of writing,signs,signals,pictures,and sounds of all kinds by aid of wire,cable,or other like connection,a,and a communication by radio as a transmission by radio of writing,signs,signals,pictures,and sounds of all kinds,b.
time warner contends that congress would not have amended to add the definition of any person aggrieved if it had intended to grant broad standing to anyone potentially injured by the statute.rather,time warner argues that congress intended to limit standing to sue under to those who meet the definition of a person aggrieved under d.as a result,time warner claims that the district court erred in concluding that nss had standing to sue under.
the district court held that the use of the word include in the statutory phrase any person aggrieved shall include any person does not mean that only persons who meet that definition have standing to sue.we agree.the district court interpretation is consistent with the legislative history of d.in the house report accompanying the amendment to that added the definition of person aggrieved under d,the purpose of the amendment was explained as follows 
section of the satellite home viewer act of amends of the communications act pertaining to the piracy of satellite cable programming.the committee amendment is intended to deter piracy practices by stiffening applicable civil and criminal penalties,expanding standing to sue,and making the manufacture,sale,modification of devices or equipment with knowledge that its primary purpose is to assist in unauthorized decryption of satellite cable programming expressly actionable as a criminal act.
ii,at,reprinted in,emphasis added.
limiting the availability of civil actions to those persons who meet the definition of a person aggrieved in d,and requiring that they have proprietary rights in an intercepted communication,is inconsistent with the intent of congress as expressed in the cable communications policy act of and the satellite home viewer act in.both acts were intended to expand the scope of protection provided by the communications act,not limit it.in particular,time warner argument flies in the face of congress explicit interest in expanding standing to sue under the act.by adding satellite communications under the protection of,along with wire and radio communications,congress sought to make clear that those with proprietary rights in the intercepted communication by wire or radio,including wholesale or retail distributors of satellite cable programming,d,have standing to sue.
but this explicit reference to a subset of persons aggrieved was not intended to exclude others who sustain injuries from a violation of any of the prohibitions originally listed in a.in particular,the prohibition in the first sentence of a does not involve the interception of a communication at all.it prohibits intermediaries who are authorized to receive a communication by wire or radio from divulging the contents of the transmission to any person other than the addressee intended by the sender.
our circuit has previously recognized congress intent to expand rather than contract the reach of the communications act when it amended 
in view of promoting the growth of satellite programming and facilitating individual reception of unencrypted satellite signals,congress amended the communications act to authorize the receipt of unscrambled satellite programming for private viewing,w hile leaving intact the prohibitions against unauthorized use of radio or wire communications contained in a.
loschiavo city of dearborn,cir emphasis added.time warner,however,argues that is violated only when a person both intercepts and divulges a communication,citing smith cincinnati post,cir,and bufalino michigan bell telephone,cir.the district court acknowledged these older precedents in a footnote,but distinguished them on the basis that they were both decided before the and amendments to the communications act.both cases are also distinguishable on their facts.
smith,for example,involved an employee of the domestic relations court in hamilton county,ohio who had a telephone conversation with howard wunker,a private citizen.the court employee told wunker that he could arrange a fix in a divorce case pending in that court.wunker recorded this conversation and released the recording to the local newspaper,which published the contents of the smith wunker conversation.see smith,at.smith sued both the newspaper and wunker.the decision in smith,a per curiam opinion,primarily discusses smith claim under the federal wiretap law,which it found inapplicable.it then summarily concluded that smith claim under must also be dismissed,since that section is violated only when a person both intercepts and divulges a communication,which is not the case in regard to this defendant.id.at citing bufalino,at.
because wunker was the intended of smith telephone conversation and no interception of a communication was involved,was not implicated by the fact situation in smith.as such,the broad statement in smith to the effect that requires both an interception and divulgence of a communication is dicta,because it was not necessary for the disposition of that case.see procter gamble,cir holding that a prior case sweeping language regarding a section of the lanham act was not binding where it only addressed a narrow issue thereunder and failed to address other issues arising within the same section.
bufalino is also distinguishable.in that case,william bufalino was a residential customer of a michigan telephone company.two company linemen were working on a telephone pole to transfer lines in a cable box.because one of the servicemen had incomplete information,he tried to call the office by connecting to an unknown line in the cable box.in actuality,he called bufalino residence.bufalino then sued the michigan telephone company,alleging that its workers had illegally tapped into his home telephone line in violation of.his complaint specifically alleged a violation of the second sentence of only,which is now the second sentence of a as a result of the amendments contained in the cable communications policy act of.according to that sentence,n o person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any radio communication and divulge or publish the existence,contents,substance,purport,effect,or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person.a.
this court affirmed the dismissal of bufalino complaint,concluding that there was no intercepted communication involved.bufalino,at.consequently,bufalino statement that i n order to constitute a violation of section there must be both an interception and a divulgence,though worded expansively,is properly confined to an interpretation of the second sentence of a.the statements from smith and bufalino that purportedly limit the scope of are thus overly broad,taken out of context,and therefore not definitive in determining the applicability of to the present circumstances.see,at.
in conclusion,we find no merit in time warner argument that nss does not have standing to sue under.we agree with the district court that the plain language of the word include in d does not render the definition of a person aggrieved an exclusive one.furthermore,the legislative history of the amendments to the communications act in and reveals that congress intended to bring cable and satellite communications under the protection of that act by expanding,not limiting,the group of persons who have standing to sue for its violation.consequently,we hold that the definition of a person aggrieved in d is nonexclusive,and that the district court did not err in determining that nss had standing to sue time warner u
