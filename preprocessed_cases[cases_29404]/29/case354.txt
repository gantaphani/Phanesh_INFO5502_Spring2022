the respondents in this case,the federal communications commission and the united states one of the petitioners,the united church of christ and the intervenors,the national organization for women and the minority media and telecommunications council,have each petitioned for rehearing.all but mmtc seek rehearing of the court decision not to sever option b from the commission eeo rule after holding that only that aspect of the challenged rule was unconstitutional.the now seeks rehearing of the court decision not to sever all references in the rule to minorities and thereby leave the rule intact with respect to women.only the ucc and the intervenors seek rehearing of the court underlying conclusion that option b is unconstitutional.
the only issue about which the various petitions raise any points that were not fully considered in our prior opinion is the severability of option for the reasons set forth below,we adhere to our original conclusion that option b is not severable and hence deny the petitions for rehearing.
before arguing that the panel erred in vacating the entire eeo rule rather than vacating option b alone,the commission acknowledges that severance is proper in a case where,as here,the agency has state d its intent that an unconstitutional portion of a regulation be severed,only when such intent is rational,when the remainder of the regulation could function sensibly without the stricken provision.fcc pet.for rehearing at quoting broadcasters,at see also k mart cartier,d.in this case,the court recognized that in the rulemaking proceeding the commission had expressed its intent as a general preference for severance.see broadcasters,at citing report order,wl if any provision of the rules is held to be unlawful,the remaining portions of the rules shall remain in effect.the court concluded,however,that the rule could not,without option b,sensibly serve the goals for which it was designed.
the commission marshals three reasons that,in its view,undermine our conclusion.first,citing paragraph of the decision under review,the commission argues that it clearly stated that option a was sufficient by itself to achieve the commission goals.see fcc pet.for rehearing at emphasis supplied.that,however,is not quite so.
the commission had two goals in adopting its eeo rule it sought to ensur e broad outreach in recruitment while affording broadcasters flexibility in designing their eeo programs.at.in paragraph of the report and order,in which the commission now claims that it clearly stated that option a alone could accomplish both its goals,the commission actually said this 
we believe that our goal of ensuring that broadcasters engage in broad outreach so that all qualified job candidates are informed of employment opportunities in the industry can be accomplished through compliance with option a,without requiring the collection or reporting to the commission of applicant pool data however,if a broadcaster wishes to avail itself of the option of dispensing with the supplemental recruitment measures prescribed in option a and designing its own program pursuant to option b,we do not think that it is unreasonable to require it to collect applicant pool data demonstrating that its outreach efforts are inclusive.
id.at emphasis added.as can readily be seen,the commission,despite its present argument to the contrary,did not state clearly or otherwise that it could achieve both its goals with option a alone at most,it stated that it believed it could achieve one of its two goals,namely ensuring broad outreach.it said nothing about the sufficiency of option a in achieving the commission other goal,namely affording broadcasters flexibility.
second,the commission argues that in a footnote appended to an order denying reconsideration of the rule it implicitly indicated that option a could function alone.see reconsideration order,fcc rcd.at.in that footnote the commission stated that if the court should hold the data collection requirement in option b unconstitutional,then only that option should be invalidated.the conclusory statement in the reconsideration order,however,says barely more on this issue than does the report and order under review.again,for the commission to say that it intends that the court sever option b if necessary is not to say that the court decision to do so would leave a sensible regulation in place.as we discuss further below,it would not.
third,counsel for the commission argues that,even if the commission did not previously make clear that in its view option a could function sensibly as a freestanding eeo rule,it has done so now in its petition for rehearing.in that petition,commission counsel unequivocally states that the commission would have adopted the remainder of the eeo rule even without option the federal communications commission is a collegial body,however it speaks through its orders,not through counsel filings.the dissent points to a press release issued by a single commissioner in which she refers to the petition for rehearing as an action of the commission.the same press release,however,cautions that release of the full text of a commission order constitutes official action.yet counsel points to no order taking the view espoused in the petition for rehearing.furthermore,counsel claim is facially implausible.
recall that in the decision under review,the commission told us that it had two goals ensuring broad outreach and affording flexibility.it told us that option a could satisfy the goal of achieving broad outreach.and it told us that option b was added in order to afford broadcasters flexibility.for example,in announcing that it would not exempt stations in small markets from eeo obligations,the commission explained 
while we believe that small market stations should be granted some relief from eeo requirements we believe that such relief is already built into the new broadcast eeo rule,which affords flexibility to tailor eeo programs to a station particular circumstances,including market size.for instance,stations in small markets may find that they need fewer recruitment sources to achieve broad outreach than might be the case in larger markets.also,because stations in smaller markets are likely to attract fewer applicants,they may find option b a less burdensome method of assessing the effectiveness of their outreach.
at see also id.at.
throughout the report and order,the commission repeatedly considered various proposals and evaluated them with respect both to their benefits in promoting outreach and to the effect they would have upon broadcasters flexibility.see,at permitting broadcasters to engage in joint recruiting and noting there is considerable value in allowing individual broadcasters flexibility id.at rejecting proposal to send notice of openings to all potential sources of job applicants id.at granting broadcasters flexibility in selecting form of notice id.at expressing desire to minimize burdens on broadcasters,especially smaller broadcasters id.at same id.at rejecting proposal for relief in light of flexibility afforded to broadcasters,and emphasizing role of option b to this end id.at rejecting proposal for relief in light of flexibility afforded under rule.thus,option b played an integral part in the commission evaluation of the rule as a whole indeed,in the entire report and order the commission never once considered the implications of promulgating an eeo rule without option b except insofar as it implied that without option b broadcasters would not have sufficient flexibility.
finally,commission counsel argues that vacating the rule in its entirety will,by forcing the commission to repromulgate option a as a new rule,simply cause the commission expense and delay.under the administrative procedure act,however,we can not consider that a drawback.as explained above,in the decision under review the commission described its two goals and the role that the two options played in effectuating them.in light of that decision,it is clear that severing one of the two options and thereby making the other mandatory would create a rule that the commission did not consider and which,according to the commission own analysis in the course of rulemaking,would not have accomplished the commission two goals as it described them.in a renewed rulemaking effort the commission may adopt other measures to accommodate the concerns it expressed about broadcasters need for flexibility in general and about the burden option a would impose upon broadcasters in small markets in particular.or the commission may change its goals.upon the record as it stands,however,retaining option a without further consideration and presumably further notice and comment would leave in force a rule that,in view of the commission own stated goals,would be arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,the petition for rehearing is 
petitioner,respondents,and intervenors petitions for rehearing en banc and the responses thereto have been circulated to the full court.the taking of a vote was requested.thereafter,a majority of the judges of the court in regular active service did not vote in favor of the petitions.upon consideration of the foregoing,it is 
ordered that the petitions be denied.
circuit judge garland did not participate in this matter.
a statement of circuit judge tatel,joined by chief judge harry edwards and circuit judge rogers,dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc is attached.
a facial challenge is,of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.united states salerno,d.the same principle governs facial challenges to regulations.see ins ctr.for immigrants rights,d.in this case,the panel found that option b could not be applied without harming white males and therefore declared it facially unconstitutional.because in so ruling the panel departed from basic principles of judicial beyond the record,speculating about how the commission will enforce the rule and how broadcasters might react,and refusing to defer to the commission reasonable interpretation of its own respectfully dissent from the denial of the three suggestions for rehearing en banc.see also fcc pet.for reh g suggestion for reh g en banc at the limited scope of our rehearing petition should not be misread as reflecting the commission agreement with the court conclusion that option b pressures broadcasters to recruit women and minorities in violation of the equal protection component of the fifth amendment.the commission disagrees with the court conclusions in that regard and would welcome grant of rehearing on the court equal protection analysis.
i agree with the panel that adarand requires strict scrutiny only of governmental actions that lead to people being treated unequally on the basis of their race.broadcasters ass fcc.but i do not agree that,on its face,option is entirely strict scrutiny.contrary to the panel opinion,option b merely requires outreach to the entire community,and broadcasters can accomplish such outreach without reducing their recruitment of white males.
we require,the commission said of the entire rule,that broadcasters reach out in recruiting new employees beyond the confines of their circle of business and social contacts to all sectors of their communities.review of the commission broadcast equal employment opportunity rules and policies,wl.broadcasters choosing option b may design their own outreach program to suit their needs,as long as they can demonstrate that their program is inclusive,that it widely disseminates job vacancies through the local community.id.at.the commission explained further 
w e believe that the objective of ensuring that minority and female applicants have the opportunity to apply for positions may be achieved without a specific requirement that broadcasters in every situation use recruitment methods that specifically target those groups.outreach that is truly broad and inclusive will necessarily reach minorities and females.
id.at.moreover,option b requires submission of racial data only to enable evaluat ion of whether the program is effective in reaching the entire community.id.at.although few or no minority or female applicants may be one indication that the station outreach efforts are not reaching the entire community,id.at,the commission emphasized that having few or no female or minority applicants would not be dispositive in its analysis of the adequacy of a broadcaster recruitment program 
t here is no requirement that the composition of applicant pools be proportionate to the composition of the local workforce we may ultimately determine that outreach efforts are reasonably designed to reach the entire community,even if few females or minorities actually apply for openings.conversely,the fact that a sizeable number of females or minorities have applied for openings will not necessarily establish the inclusiveness of the station efforts.also,we recognize that an employer can not control who applies for jobs.
broadcasters electing option b could thus satisfy their obligation simply by undertaking broad,recruiting.for example,advertising in a local newspaper read by both minorities and nonminorities could reach the entire community.id.no record evidence suggests that such advertising would reduce the number of white males receiving job information.indeed,broad outreach might reach more white males.
because there exist circumstances under which broadcasters can comply with option b with no adverse effect on white males,the broadcasters facial challenge should have failed.see salerno,at.the panel should have dismissed their petition,leaving them free to bring an as applied challenge when and if the commission applies the rule in a discriminatory manner.instead,misinterpreting option b and engaging in its own,the panel found that option b would inevitably curtail recruitment of white males,and so subjected it to strict scrutiny.
to avoid the fact that broadcasters could totally ignore option b,the panel said the commission does not argue that option b creates no pressure to recruit women and minorities because a licensee could always elect option at.in its report and order,however,the commission stated precisely that 
w e note that the alternative recruitment program is completely optional any employer who prefers not to collect data concerning the race,ethnicity or gender of its applicants can comply with option a requirements,none of which requires the collection of such data.no broadcaster or cable entity has cause to complain about a program with which it is not required to comply.
at.true,the commission did not make this argument to the panel,but given that the broadcasters challenged the constitutionality of option a as well as b,it is understandable that the commission never argued that option b is not coercive because of the presence of option although the commission could have so argued in the alternative,the fact that it did still does not justify ignoring the rule plain language.
to avoid the fact that nothing on the face of option b requires that people be treated unequally on the basis of their race,broadcasters,at,the panel found that option b pressure s broadcasters to focus their recruiting efforts upon women and minorities,at least until those groups generate a safe proportion of the licensee job applications.id.at.according to the panel,this will occur because the commission,having life and death power over broadcasters and a long history of employing a variety of sub silentio pressures and raised eyebrow regulation,id.at quoting.broad.of,fcc,promises to investigate any licensee that reports few or no applications from women or minorities.see also supplemental op.at.licensees,the panel found,reasonably might and prudently would conclude that the commission focus upon the race and sex of applicants belies its statement that its only goal is that licensees recruit with a broad outreach.broadcasters,at.the panel concluded that the commission is interested in results,not process,and is determined to get them.id.
the panel analysis finds no support in the record.the commission never promise d to investigate licensees that report few or no applications from women or minorities.the only record reference to the co
