steve gates sued discovery communications,and new dominion pictures,discovery,for defamation and invasion of privacy.discovery demurrer to the defamation cause of action was sustained without leave to amend.its motion to strike the privacy action under california statute code civ.was denied.discovery appeals,arguing the trial court erred in denying the motion.
background and procedure 
gates filed a complaint asserting causes of action for defamation and invasion of privacy.the complaint alleged that in will nix and others conspired to and succeeded in murdering salvatore ruscitti.gates was an employee of nix.while initially charged as a,gates eventually pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact and was sentenced to three years in prison.
discovery was the producer of a television series,the prosecutors.the program notorious crimes,identified the perpetrators and victims and included interviews with investigators and prosecutors.in the series aired an episode entitled deadly commission dealing with the ruscitti murder.the program purported to portray gates involvement in the crime.
in his cause of action for defamation gates alleged that after his release from prison he led a lawful,productive life and was a respected member of the community.he asserted discovery program falsely portrayed him as a member of the conspiracy to murder ruscitti,falsely depicted him as participating in a telephone tap to develop evidence against nix and falsely indicated that gates was a murderer.
gates stated his invasion of privacy action was based on discovery revelation that he pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to a murder for hire and the airing by defendants of his photograph.gates stated these were private facts he wished to keep private.
discovery filed a demurrer to each cause of action and a special motion to strike pursuant to section.discovery argued gates was a limited purpose public figure who could not demonstrate that the allegedly defamatory statements were made with actual malice,discovery published constitutionally privileged,truthful and newsworthy information taken from a public record and,finally,the information was privileged under civil code section,subdivision d,because it was a true report in a public journal of a judicial proceeding.
gates opposed the motion to strike,arguing that section did not apply since his complaint was not filed to chill discovery free speech rights.
the trial court granted discovery demurrer as to the defamation cause of action,finding that the gist of discovery report concerning gates was accurate.the court denied the demurrer as to the invasion of privacy cause of action.the trial court denied discovery section motion as to the invasion of privacy cause of action,finding that discovery had failed to demonstrate that its account of gates involvement in the crime,while true,was newsworthy.
discussion 
discovery argues the trial court erred in denying its special motion to strike.discovery contends the statute applies to its program concerning the ruscitti murder and gates participation in the crime.discovery notes as such the trial court was required to strike gates privacy action unless gates established there was a probability he would prevail on the claim at trial.discovery argues that as a matter of california privacy law,gates could not do so because the facts disclosed in its program were public and because they were matters of legitimate public concern.it argues gates could not prevail on his claim since liability can not arise from the publication of truthful,newsworthy information contained in public records nor from the publication of truthful information,lawfully obtained about a matter of public significance.discovery finally argues its broadcast was privileged since it was a fair and true report in a public journal of a judicial proceeding,subd.d.
ultimately,all of these claims turn on the continuing viability of briscoe reader digest association,cal d,briscoe.briscoe,which involved facts very similar to those in the present case,dealt with the inherent tension between the right of privacy and the rights of freedom of the press and speech.it resolved that tension in a way that makes it probable gates would prevail on his privacy cause of action here.however,in light of later united states supreme court authority addressing the same constitutional tension,we conclude briscoe is no longer the law.the subsequent authority supports discovery position that its report was protected by the first amendment.we conclude those cases would make it impossible for gates to prevail on his privacy action.the trial court,therefore,erred in failing to strike the action pursuant to section.
in the legislature enacted section in response to the perception that there had been an increase in lawsuits designed to chill the exercise of the rights or freedom of speech and to petition for a redress of grievances,subd.a mattel,luce,forward,hamilton scripps th,d wilcox superior court th,d.
section,subdivision b,provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
the defendant must establish that the challenged action qualifies for treatment under the section.acts in furtherance of a person right to free speech that qualify for treatment are listed in section,subdivision e.the ones arguably relevant to this case are section,subdivision e,subparagraphs any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest and any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.see mattel,luce,forward,hamilton scripps,supra,th at,d.
if the defendant establishes that the action qualifies for treatment under the section,the plaintiff must demonstrate the probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.evidence on the issue must be admissible.the court does not weigh the evidence.it determines instead whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case that if believed by the trier of fact would result in a judgment for the plaintiff.mattel,luce,forward,hamilton scripps,supra,th at,d.
whether section applies and whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing are legal questions which we review independently on appeal.citations.seelig infinity broadcasting th,d.the section requires we construe it broadly to protect the rights of petition and free speech,subd.a.
invasion of privacy 
gates invasion of privacy cause of action was based on a claimed disclosure of private facts,that he pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to a murder for hire.the elements of that tort are public disclosure of a private fact which would be offensive and objectionable to the reasonable person and which is not of legitimate public concern.the latter factor relates to newsworthiness and is subject to a test involving the social value of the published facts,the depth of intrusion into ostensibly private affairs,and whether the person acceded voluntarily to a position of public notoriety.time warner,th,d,fns.omitted.
application of section 
gates argues that discovery,in meeting its threshold burden of showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from a protected activity,was required to show that gates intent in bringing the action was to chill discovery free speech rights.to the contrary,there is no requirement in section that the plaintiff have a subjective intent to chill the defendant right of free speech or petition.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.discovery demonstrated gates suit arose from its exercise of protected constitutional rights and,therefore,section was applicable to it.
probability gates will prevail 
since discovery established that section is applicable to gates action,the burden shifts to gates to establish a probability he would prevail on his claim.discovery makes several arguments contending gates is unable to do so.all of these claims ultimately turn on whether discovery report concerning gates was protected by the first amendment.as noted,that issue requires we decide whether the opinion in briscoe has been overruled by later opinions of the united states supreme court.justices kennard and mosk in a concurring opinion in shulman group w productions,cal th,d,express doubt that the reasoning of briscoe survives that authority.some commentators agree.see,solove,access and aggregation public records,privacy,and the constitution.we conclude that in the context of the present case briscoe in fact can not be followed.
in the reader digest published an article about the hijacking of trucks.as an example of such crimes,the article noted a hijacking committed by marvin briscoe.while mentioning briscoe by name,the article did not state that the crime was committed years earlier.briscoe was rehabilitated.in his disclosure of private facts cause of action,he conceded that the fact of his crime remained newsworthy but argued the use of his name was not.as to briscoe privacy action,a demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.briscoe,supra,cal d at.
briscoe reviewed the development of the concept of the right of privacy and fully explored the tension between it and the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.while recognizing the great scope of the first amendment,the court concluded the amendment provided particular protection for hot news,items of possible immediate public concern or interest.this was so because of the pressure deadlines placed on editorial judgment and because of the particular importance of such reports for the community.the court stated the identity of persons charged with crimes also had social utility.the court concluded that in general the reports of recent crimes and the names of the suspects or offenders were protected by the first amendment.cal d at.
the court concluded,however,the first amendment provides less protection for reports of past crimes and the identification of past offenders.while conceding that reports of the facts of past crimes were newsworthy,it concluded little useful purpose was served by identifying the offender.indeed,it concluded that a strong public interest existed in keeping private the identity of past offenders since doing so preserved the integrity of the rehabilitative process.briscoe,supra,cal d at.
citing united states supreme court authority,briscoe concluded that truthful publications were constitutionally protected if newsworthy.it then reviewed the elements of that concept.the court concluded that on the facts before it,a jury could conclude briscoe name was no longer newsworthy.a jury could conclude briscoe had over time again become an anonymous member of the community.the court concluded briscoe might prevail on his privacy cause of action.it stated it was for a jury to decide whether he had become a rehabilitated member of society,whether identifying him as a former criminal was highly offensive,whether reader digest published the information with reckless disregard for its offensiveness and whether any independent justification existed for publishing briscoe name.briscoe,supra,cal d at.
the court concluded briscoe had pleaded a valid cause of action.
subsequent united states supreme court authority 
after briscoe the united states supreme court decided a series of cases dealing with the same broad issue of the tension between the right to privacy and the rights of free speech and free press.
in cox broadcasting cohn,d cox,a woman was killed during a rape in georgia.the crime received wide press coverage but the name of the victim was not disclosed because of a georgia law making it a crime to publish or broadcast such information.a reporter became aware of the name of the victim when shown an indictment in the case made available to him in the courtroom.it was undisputed that the indictment was a public record available for inspection.the reporter employer broadcast the name of the victim.the victim father brought a privacy action.cox argued its broadcast was privileged under the first and fourteenth amendments.the georgia trial court rejected the argument,stating the georgia statute gave a civil remedy to those injured by its violation.cox,supra,at.
the supreme court stated the issue was whether consistent with the first and fourteenth amendments a state may extend a cause of action for damages for invasion of privacy caused by the publication of the name of a deceased rape victim which was publicly revealed in connection with the prosecution of the crime.cox,supra,at.
the court first acknowledged a growing body of law recognizing a right to privacy.cox argued the press could not be held criminally or civilly liable for publishing information that was neither false nor misleading.the court noted that in defamation actions truth was generally viewed as a defense.the court stated,however,it had carefully left open the question of whether the constitution required that truth be recognized as a defense in a defamation action brought by a private person rather than a public figure.the court stated the same degree of caution should exist in dealing with the issue of the effect of truth on the tort of invasion of privacy.cox,supra,at.
in this regard,the court stated rather than address the broader question whether truthful publications may ever be subjected to civil or criminal liability consistently with the first and fourteenth amendments,or to put it another way,whether the state may ever define and protect an area of privacy free from unwanted publicity in the press,it is appropriate to focus on the narrower interface between press and privacy that this case presents,namely,whether the state may impose sanctions on the accurate publication of the name of a rape victim obtained from the public specifically,from judicial records which are maintained in connection with a public prosecution and which themselves are open to public inspection.we are convinced that the state may not do so.cox,supra,at.
the court explained that the reporting of information concerning the operation of every part of government,including the judiciary,was of great importance and entitled to strong protection.the court noted that the law of privacy recognized that the interest in privacy fades when the information involved was already in the public record.cox,supra,at.
the court emphasized that by putting information in an official court record,the state must presume that the public interest was being served.it stated that public records by their very nature are of interest to the public and an important benefit is performed when they are published.the court stated such reporting was important to our form of government and then concluded in preserving that form of government the first and fourteenth amendments command nothing less than that the states may not impose sanctions on the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection.cox,supra,at.
the court stated it was reluctant to embark on a course that would make public records available to the press but forbid their publication if offensive to the sensibilities of some supposed reasonable man.the court stated this would make it difficult for the press to report public business and also stay within the law.such a rule would invite timidity and and would lead to the suppression of matters that would otherwise be published.cox,supra,at.
in.publishing dist.court,d oklahoma publishing,delinquency charges arising from a murder were brought against an boy.members of the media were present in the courtroom during the detention hearing and learned the boy name.the name appeared in newspaper stories and in radio and television broadcasts.at a later closed hearing the trial court entered an order enjoining the press from revealing the boy name.oklahoma publishing petition for a writ to quash the order was denied by the oklahoma supreme court on the basis that oklahoma law required juvenile proceedings be held in private unless ordered open by the trial court.id.at.
the united states supreme court reversed.citing cox and other cases,it held that the existence of a state statute requiring closed juvenile hearings was irrelevant since members of the press had lawfully been present at a hearing where the boy name was revealed.the court noted the name was revealed in connection with the prosecution of the crime,citation,much as the name of the rape victim in cox was placed in the public domain.oklahoma publishing,supra,at.fn.omitted.the supreme court found the trial court order unconstitutional.id.at.
in smith daily mail publishing,d daily mail,a student was shot and killed by a classmate in west virginia.newspaper reporters learned the classmate name from eyewitnesses to the crime.the assailant name was published in the newspaper.indictments were returned,alleging that the publication of the assailant name violated a west virginia statute making it a crime to publish the name of any child connected with a juvenile proceeding without court permission.the west virginia supreme court found the statute unconstitutional as a prior restraint on the freedom of the press.id.at.
the united states supreme court stated the issue of whether the west virginia law was a prior restraint was not determinative.it stated that whether the statute was a prior restraint or a penal sanction for the publication of lawfully obtained truthful information,any justification required a showing that the state action furthers a state interest of the highest order.the state argued its interest was maintaining the juvenile anonymity as a means of promoting rehabilitation.the court concluded this was not an interest of the highest order.daily mail,supra,at.
in the florida star,d the florida star,the court again visited the issue of the criminalization of the disclosure of the name of sex crime victims.a florida statute made it unlawful to publish the name of the victim of a sexual offense.a report of a rape including the name of the victim was inadvertently released to the press by the police department and the florida star newspaper printed it.the rape victim sued the newspaper for printing her name in violation of the statute.the trial court found the newspaper negligent per se and a jury awarded the plaintiff in damages.id.at.
the supreme court noted the case again raised the issue of the tension between the freedom of the press and the right of individuals to maintain the privacy of even truthful information.the court noted that while it had addressed this tension in cox,oklahoma publishing and daily mail,its approach had been to deal with the discrete factual context of each case and therefore it had not exhaustively considered the issue.the florida star,supra,at.
the florida star argued that the trilogy of prior cases produced the rule that the press may never be punished civilly or criminally for publishing the truth.the plaintiff countered that in each of the trilogy cases the information published was already in the public record and the privacy interest in those earlier cases was far less profound than in hers.the court concluded that imposing damages on the florida star for publishing the plaintiff name violated the first amendment.the florida star,supra,at.
the court first noted that cox,while superficially similar,was not directly controlling.cox dealt with the publication of the name of a sex crime victim that was already contained in the public record of a judicial proceeding.the court noted cox emphasized the special protected nature of accurate reports of judicial proceedings.the florida star,supra,at.the court observed this status existed because of the special role the press plays in subjecting trials to public scrutiny and thus helping to maintain their fairness.the plaintiff name published by the florida star did not come from the public record of a judicial proceeding since there was no such proceeding at the time of publication.ibid.
the court also rejected any rule that truthful publications may never be punished.it noted the court had carefully avoided such a pronouncement,concluding that given the issues involved,it was better to treat situations as they arose and not declare categorical directives.instead,the court crystallized a flexible rule first suggested in daily mail,i f a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of public significance then state officials may not constitutionally punish publication of the information,absent a need to further a state interest of the highest order.citation.the florida star,supra,at.
the court stated such a rule giving great protection to the publication of lawfully obtained truthful information was justified by at least three considerations.first,the government has sufficient means in most cases to sufficiently protect confidential information without punishing its publication.the florida star,supra,at.next,it does little to protect the right of privacy to punish the publication of information already available to the public.in this regard,the court stated it is not,of course,always the case that information lawfully acquired by the press is known,or accessible,to others.but where the government has made certain information publicly available,it is highly anomalous to sanction persons other than the source of its release.id.at.the court continued i t is a limited set of cases indeed where,despite the accessibility of the public to certain information,a meaningful public interest is served by restricting its further release by other entities,like the press.as daily mail observed in its summary of oklahoma publishing,once the truthful information was publicly revealed or in the public domain the court could not constitutionally restrain its dissemination.citation.ibid.finally,the court noted that punishing truthful information lawfully obtained could result in a harmful timidity and on the part of the press.ibid.
in finding that allowing damages against the florida star for publishing the sex crimes victim name was unconstitutional,the court addressed the issue of what is a public interest of the highest order.it noted that the plaintiff claimed three interests advanced by florida law,the privacy of victims,the physical safety of victims and the encouragement of victims to report offenses.the court found these interests highly significant but,under the facts of the case before it,not of the highest order.the court noted the information was provided to the newspaper by the government,under florida law the publication amounted to per se negligence and the was underinclusive in that it applied only to instruments of mass communication.the florida star,supra,at.
in bartnicki vopper,d,the court dealt with the protection,if any,given by the first amendment to the disclosure of the contents of an illegally intercepted communication.in that case the media was provided and published the contents of illegally intercepted cellular telephone conversations between a teacher union president and the union labor negotiator concerning collective bargaining matters.the officials sued various members of the media who published the intercepted communications,noting that such interceptions were illegal under state and federal law and that it was illegal for anyone to disclose the content of such communication who knew or has reason to know it was illegally intercepted.id.at.
in addressing the issue the court began by assuming that the media defendants were aware the recordings were of illegally intercepted communications and that disclosing their content was illegal.the court also noted that the media defendants lawfully obtained tapes of the conversation even though they knew the information was itself illegally intercepted.the court further found that the content of the tapes was of public concern.bartnicki vopper,supra,at.
the court noted the rule th
