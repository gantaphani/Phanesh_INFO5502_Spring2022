umg recordings appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant troy augusto on umg claim of copyright infringement in violation of of the copyright act,which entitles copyright owners to institute an action for infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies of the copyrighted work.see a,b.the copies in issue comprise eight compact discs,each embodying a copyrighted sound recording.umg,the copyright owner,used the discs solely for marketing purposes,sending them unsolicited to individuals such as music critics and radio disc jockeys.although augusto was not one of those individuals,he managed to obtained the discs from various sources.he later sold them at auction,an act which umg contends infringed its exclusive right to distribute the discs.
augusto asserts that umg initial distribution of the discs effected a transfer of ownership of the discs to the recipients,rendering the discs subject to the first sale doctrine,which permits one who has acquired ownership of a copy to dispose of that copy without the permission of the copyright owner.see id.a.umg argues that the statements on the discs and the circumstances of their distribution granted only a license to each recipient,not a transfer of ownership or sale of the copy.absent a sale,umg remained the owner of the discs and,accordingly,the defense of the first sale doctrine would be out of augusto reach.we conclude that the mailing indeed did effect a sale of the discs to the recipients for purposes of the first sale doctrine,and we affirm the order of the district court.
background and procedural history 
the material facts of the case are undisputed.umg is among the world largest music companies.one of its core businesses is the creation,manufacture,and sale of recorded music,or phonorecords,the copyrights of which are owned by umg these phonorecords generally take the form of compact discs cds.
like many music companies,umg ships promotional cds to a large group of individuals recipients,such as music critics and radio programmers,that it has selected.there is no prior agreement or request by the recipients to receive the cds.umg does not seek or receive payment for the cds,the content and design of which often differs from that of their commercial counterparts.umg ships the promotional cds by means of the united states postal service and united parcel service.relatively few of the recipients refuse delivery of the cds or return them to umg,and umg destroys those that are returned.
most of the promotional cds in issue in this case bore a statement the promotional statement similar to the following 
this cd is the property of the record company and is licensed to the intended recipient for personal use only.acceptance of this cd shall constitute an agreement to comply with the terms of the license.resale or transfer of possession is not allowed and may be punishable under federal and state laws.
some of the cds bore a more succinct statement,such as promotional use for sale.
augusto was not among the select group of individuals slated to receive the promotional cds.he nevertheless managed to acquire numerous such cds,many of which he sold through online auctions at.augusto regularly advertised the cds as rare industry editions and referred to them as promo cds.
after several unsuccessful attempts at halting the auctions through ebay dispute resolution program,umg filed a complaint against augusto in the united states district court for the central district of california,alleging that augusto had infringed umg copyrights in eight promotional cds for which it retained the exclusive right to distribute.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of augusto,and umg appealed.we have jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to.
standard of review 
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment.see bagdadi nazar,cir.we may affirm on any ground supported by the record.see video software dealers ass schwarzenegger,cir.
while it is an open question as to whether the plaintiff or defendant bears the burden of proving the applicability of the first sale defense,see united states wise,cir government bears the burden of proof in the criminal context,we need not reach the issue in this case,because we would reach the same conclusion regardless of which party were to bear the burden.
discussion 
to establish a prima facie case of copyright infringement,a plaintiff must show ownership of a valid copyright and violation by the alleged infringer of at least one of the exclusive rights granted to copyright owners by the copyright act the act.see ellison robertson,cir citing a.section of the act grants copyright owners,such as umg,the exclusive right,among others,to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership.see id.a anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by section is an infringer of the copyright.the district court held that umg made out a prima facie case of copyright infringement umg established that it owned the copyright to the promotional cds and augusto sold the cds without umg permission.
although umg,as the owner of the copyright,has exclusive rights in the promotional cds,e xemptions,compulsory licenses,and defenses found in the copyright act narrow those rights.wall data los angeles cnty.sheriff,cir citing.augusto invokes the first sale doctrine embodied in a of the act.a.he argues that the circumstances attending umg distribution of the discs effected a sale transfer of ownership of the discs to the original recipients and that,under the first sale doctrine,the recipients and subsequent owners of those particular copies were permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of those copies without authorization by the copyright holder.
in the alternative,augusto argues that the original recipients were entitled to treat the cds as gifts under the unordered merchandise statute,enacted as part of the postal reorganization act of,and therefore had the right to retain,use,discard,or dispose of them in any manner they saw fit,in this case,by selling those cds to the thrift shops and stores where augusto states he purchased them.see a,b see also postal reorganization act of,stat.codified at.
umg,on the other hand,contends that the promotional statement effected a license with the recipients and,because the recipients were not owners but licensees of the cds,neither they nor augusto were entitled to sell or otherwise transfer the cds.see quality king,research int l,b ecause the protection afforded by a is available only to the owner of a lawfully made copy,the first sale doctrine would not provide a defense to any nonowner such as a bailee,a licensee,a consignee,or one whose possession of the copy was unlawful.am.int l pictures,foreman,cir u nless title to the copy passes through a first sale by the copyright holder,subsequent sales do not confer good title.
the distribution of the promotional cds effected a sale 
the first sale doctrine provides that the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under the act,or any person authorized by such owner,is entitled,without the authority of the copyright owner,to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.a.notwithstanding its distinctive name,the doctrine applies not only when a copy is first sold,but when a copy is given away or title is otherwise transferred without the accouterments of a sale.see patry on copyright see also united states atherton,cir the sale embodied in the first sale concept is a term of art.o nce the copyright owner places a copyrighted item in the stream of commerce,he has exhausted his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution.quality king,at.the seminal illustration of the principle is found in straus,where a copyright owner unsuccessfully attempted to restrain the resale of a copyrighted book by including in it the following notice the price of this book at retail is net.no dealer is licensed to sell it at a less price,and a sale at less price will be treated as an infringement of the copyright.id.the court noted that the statutory gr
