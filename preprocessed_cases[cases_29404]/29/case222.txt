we are invited to decide the ownership of copyrights in several motion pictures.the question is whether the statute of limitations in the copyright act applies.
this appeal is the latest chapter in a quest by seven arts filmed entertainment limited seven arts to establish ownership of copyrights in several motion pictures as relevant here rules of engagement,an american rhapsody,and who is cletis tout.
on may,seven arts sued paramount pictures paramount and content media.plc content for copyright infringement,a declaration of ownership rights,and an accounting,seeking a declaration that neither content,nor its collectively canwest is the owner or grantee of rights in the films.rather,seven arts claims that it is the registered owner or assignee of the registered owner of united states copyrights to the films.seven arts also alleges that paramount is the licensee of certain distribution rights in and to the pictures,and that it has paid receipts from their distribution to content,not seven arts,despite seven arts demands.
seven arts voluntarily dismissed content,deciding to pursue it in the high court of england and wales.nonetheless,seven arts claimed a viable cause of action for copyright infringement against paramount because of a summary judgment order it obtained in from the superior court of justice in ontario,canada.
that canadian action was first brought in against canwest.in it,seven arts claimed rights to the pictures stemming from a document referred to as the heads of agreement or master structure agreement.the case found its way to canada because canwest defended seven arts first lawsuit a action in the central district of california on the ground that the heads of agreement had a canadian clause.canwest defended in canada by denying that the heads of agreement was an enforceable contract.
while the canadian action was pending,seven arts returned to the united states in and filed a second action in the central district of california.just as the instant action,the lawsuit alleged causes of action for copyright infringement,declaratory relief,and an accounting against canwest.unlike the action,which had alleged seven arts was a,the lawsuit claimed that seven arts was the sole owner of the disputed film rights.the new theory of ownership was that when canwest denied the heads of agreement in canada,seven arts obtained and exercised a right to rescind any contracts which may have existed among the parties.such contracts included the heads of agreement in which seven arts had assigned all its rights to rules of engagement to paramount a agreement in which seven arts had assigned away its rights to an american rhapsody and a agreement concerning who is cletis tout.
in august,the district court granted canwest motion to stay the proceedings pending prosecution of the canadian action.seven arts belatedly appealed that stay to this court,and we affirmed.see seven arts pictures plc fireworks entm t,app x cir.in,the district court dismissed the action with prejudice for failure to prosecute after issuing two prior warnings.seven arts appealed to this court,and we affirmed.see seven arts pictures plc fireworks entm t,app x cir.
seven arts finally prosecuted its canadian action and ultimately secured the february summary judgment order already mentioned.the canadian proceeding was not adversarial,because the initially named defendants had entered bankruptcy and had not opposed the motion so the canadian court reviewed only the evidence presented by seven arts.nonetheless,the canadian order granted seven arts a declaration that it is and at all relevant times had been the owner of copyrights registered and enforceable pursuant to the united states copyright act of for an american rhapsody and who is cletis tout,and also that it had exclusive rights for international distribution of rules of engagement.the canadian order further determined that seven arts had granted no rights or interest in the copyrights or the copyrighted works to any defendant and that therefore the defendants have infringed and continue to infringe the plaintiffs rights.
seven arts with the summary judgment order in hand returned to federal district court and filed this case,a of the lawsuit,except that seven arts sued paramount for the first time and alleged that the canadian summary judgment order established its ownership rights.paramount moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b on october,the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice on the ground that seven arts claim for copyright infringement against paramount was barred by the copyright act statute of limitations,b.
we review the district court dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim and the legal issues it presents de novo.see umg recordings,shelter capital partners llc,cir.a defense,if apparent from the face of the complaint,may properly be raised in a motion to dismiss.conerly westinghouse,cir.we accept as true all allegations of material fact but are not required to accept as true allegations that contradict exhibits attached to the complaint or matters properly subject to judicial notice,or allegations that are merely conclusory,unwarranted deductions of fact,or unreasonable inferences.daniels hall educ.ass n,cir.
the copyright act of provides that all civil actions must be brought within three years after the claim accrued.b.when a claim accrues depends on the nature of the copyright claim.
for ordinary claims of copyright infringement,each new infringing act causes a new claim to accrue thus,we have held that an action may be brought for all acts that accrued within the three years preceding the filing of the suit.roley new world pictures,cir by contrast,we have held that claims of,as distinct from claims of infringement,accrue only once,when plain and express repudiation of is communicated to the claimant,and are barred three years from the time of repudiation.zuill shanahan,cir see also aalmuhammed lee,cir where creation rather than infringement is the gravamen of an authorship claim,the claim accrues on account of creation,not subsequent infringement,and is barred three years from plain and express repudiation of authorship.
copyright infringement claims have two basic elements ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.in the ordinary infringement case,ownership is not in dispute,kwan schlein,cir rather,the dispute centers on the second prong whether,for example,the copying was a fair use,or whether the materials taken were original,see,roley,at.
but this dispute is about ownership paramount concedes it is exploiting the pictures,but denies that seven arts owns the copyrights.that such is the nature of this dispute is apparent from the face of seven arts complaint,which alleges that seven arts,not canwest or content,owned the copyrights,and that paramount improperly paid royalties to canwest or content rather than seven we must decide,then,whether a claim for copyright infringement in which ownership is the disputed issue is if a freestanding ownership claim would be barred.
although this is an issue of first impression in our circuit,we are guided by the second and sixth circuits.our sister circuits have held that,where the gravamen of a copyright infringement suit is ownership,and a freestanding ownership claim would be,any infringement claims are also barred.see kwan,at ritchie williams,cir see also roger miller music,publ g,llc,cir when claims for both infringement and ownership are alleged,according to the sixth circuit,the infringement claim is timely only if the corresponding ownership claim is also timely.roger miller music,at.or,as the second circuit puts it,w here the ownership claim is,and ownership is the dispositive issue,any attendant infringement claims must fail.kwan,at.
our sister circuits approach makes good sense allowing infringement claims to establish ownership where a freestanding ownership claim would be would permit plaintiffs to skirt the statute of limitations for ownership claims and lead to results that are potentially bizarre,nimmer
