robert wagner individually and as trustee of his children trusts brought this action against columbia pictures claiming he and the trusts are contractually entitled to share in the net profits columbia earned from two motion pictures it produced based on the charlie angels television series.the trial court concluded the contract did not entitle wagner and the trusts to share in the profits from the movies and granted columbia motion for summary judgment.wagner filed a timely appeal from the judgment.we affirm 
facts and proceedings below 
robert wagner and natalie wood the wagners entered into an agreement with productions sgp relating to charlie angels herein called the series.the contract entitled the wagners to percent of the net profits sgp received as consideration for the right to exhibit photoplays of the series and from the exploitation of all ancillary,music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.sgp subsequently sold its rights and obligations with respect to the charlie angels series to defendant columbia pictures.thirteen years later columbia contracted to obtain the motion picture rights to the series from the heirs of the show writers,ivan goff and ben roberts.in and columbia produced and distributed two charlie angels films based on the tv series.
wagner contends the subsidiary rights provision in the agreement with sgp entitles him and the trusts to percent of the net profits from the two charlie angels films.columbia contends even if the term subsidiary rights may sometimes include movie rights,its production of the charlie angels movies did not constitute exploitation of a subsidiary right in connection with the right to exhibit photoplays of the series.
wagner brought this action against columbia for breach of contract,unjust enrichment,declaratory relief and an accounting.columbia answered and moved for summary adjudication of the cause of action for breach of contract.after the trial court granted that motion the parties stipulated to entry of judgment in favor of columbia on the ground the order granting the motion as to the breach of contract cause of action effectively disposed of the remaining causes of action.
discussion 
scope of review.
in wolf superior court we thoroughly examined the role of an appellate court called upon to review a trial court decision interpreting a contract and we need not repeat this discussion here essentially,when a party to a contract claims its terms are ambiguous the trial court threshold determination of ambiguity is a question of law subject to our independent review.if parol evidence is admitted to determine the meaning of a contract term and the evidence is in conflict we defer to the trial court determination under the substantial evidence test.if the evidence is not in conflict but is subject to different interpretations then we do not defer to the trial court findings.instead we review the lower court interpretation de novo 
ii.the charlie angels agreement is unambiguous in describing the conditions under which the wagners are entitled to share in the net profits from the motion pictures.
the wagners contract with sgp entitled them to a share of all monies actually received by the producer,as consideration for the right to exhibit photoplays of the charlie angels series,and from the exploitation of all ancillary,music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.the principal dispute between the parties is whether the phrase in connection therewith modifies charlie angels television series,so the net profits sgp,or columbia,received from any ancillary or subsidiary right which bears a connection to the television series are included within the agreement wagner or whether the phrase in connection therewith modifies the right to exhibit photoplays of the series so only the net profits sgp,or columbia,received by taking advantage of sgp rights,as producer,to exhibit photoplays of the series are included in the agreement columbia.
wagner offered extrinsic evidence to show the contract was reasonably susceptible to his interpretation.as has been explained in numerous cases,when a party contends the language of a contract is ambiguous the test for the admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of the contract is not whether the contract appears to the court to need interpreting but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.therefore,the court must provisionally receive all credible evidence concerning the parties intentions to determine whether the contract language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by a party.if in light of the extrinsic evidence the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged,then the extrinsic evidence is admitted to aid in interpreting the contract if it is not,the case is over.
wagner extrinsic evidence.
the antecedent love song agreement.
wagner introduced evidence of the history of the negotiations underlying the charlie angels contract in support of his interpretation of the agreement 
this history begins with a contract the wagners entered into with sgp to star in a television,love song.as compensation for wagner and wood acting in love song,sgp agreed to pay them a fixed amount plus the net profits derived from the exploitation of all ancillary,music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.the evidence shows the definition of net profits in the love song agreement was derived from a memorandum of understanding based on negotiations between sgp and the wagners.sgp sent a copy of this deal memo to its counsel requesting counsel prepare a contract under which sgp,after recouping its costs,will share equally with the wagners in all gross revenues derived from all sources from the exploitation of love song.
an early draft of the love song contract limited the wagners net profit to the net of all monies received by the producer as consideration for the right to exhibit the photoplay.the wagners objected to this language as inconsistent with the deal memo,which stated sgp intent there be an equal split of all revenues derived from all sources.they called for the phrase and all rights therein to be added immediately following the word photoplay and asserted these rights should be defined as including but not limited to remake rights,sequel rights,publication rights,legitimate stage rights,television rights.
sgp counsel responded to the wagner request for a revised definition of net profits,stating the language they wanted to include could be construed as granting them ownership rights in love song.counsel affirmed,however,the wagners were entitled to receive a share of income from any and all sources and it is my opinion that the agreement so states.
the wagners replied their intent was not to ask for ownership rights in love song but merely to make certain they participated in all revenues from all sources.
after receiving this letter sgp counsel revised the net profit definition to include profits derived from all sources from the exploitation of the photoplay and all ancillary rights therein.in an accompanying letter counsel noted with respect to net profits i have made the change requested and covered your comment.
in the final love song contract net profits were not limited to monies received for the right to exhibit the photoplay.instead they were defined as the net of all monies received by producer as consideration for the right to exhibit the photoplay,and exploitation of all ancillary,music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.italics added.
the charlie angels agreement.
another provision of the love song agreement stated the wagners would team up with sgp to jointly submit up to five ideas to abc for the basis of a pilot script for the television season.the parties agreed if abc accepted any of these ideas they would enter into a business relationship where the profits therefrom are shared equally between the parties.one of the ideas the wagners and sgp submitted to abc was a series called harry angels.
after abc expressed interest in the series,renamed charlie angels,the wagners entered into negotiations with sgp under the joint submissions provision of the love song agreement discussed above.as in the love song agreement the parties agreed to a share of the net profits.the charlie angels agreement defines net profits as the net of all monies actually received by producer as consideration for the right to exhibit photoplays of the series and from the exploitation of all ancillary,music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.this language is identical to the final definition of net profits in the love song agreement.in a letter to counsel for the wagners,counsel for sgp noted the definition of net profits in the charlie angels agreement is not a standard definition,but has many changes more favorable to your clients than any such standard definition.
wagner argument is simple and straightforward.the net profits provision in the love song agreement was intended to give the wagners a share in the net profits received by sgp from all sources without limitation as to source or time.this intent was confirmed by sgp attorney,who acknowledged the wagners were entitled to receive income from any and all sources and it is my opinion that the agreement so states this.the charlie angels agreement was based on the love song agreement and defines net profits in identical language.therefore,the charlie angels agreement should also be interpreted as providing the wagners with a percent share in sgp income from all sources without limitation as to source or time.since columbia admits it stands in sgp shoes with respect to sgp obligations under the charlie angels agreement,columbia is obligated to pay wagner and the trusts percent of the net profits derived from the charlie angels movies.
wagner extrinsic evidence does not support a meaning to which the contract is reasonably susceptible.
the problem with wagner extrinsic evidence is that it does not explain the contract language,it contradicts it.under the parol evidence rule,extrinsic evidence is not admissible to contradict express terms in a written contract or to explain what the agreement was.the agreement is the writing itself.parol evidence can not be admitted to show intention independent of an unambiguous written instrument.thus,as justice holmes explained,parol evidence is not admissible to show that when the parties said five hundred feet they agreed it should mean one hundred inches,or that bunker hill monument should signify the old south church.
even if the wagners and sgp intended the wagners would share in the net profits from any and all sources they did not say so in their contract.what they said in their contract was the wagners would share in all monies actually received by producer,as consideration for the right to exhibit photoplays of the series,and from the exploitation of all ancillary,music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.for a right to be subsidiary or ancillary,meaning supplementary or subordinate there must be a primary right to which it relates.the only primary right mentioned in the contract is the right to exhibit photoplays of the series.thus the wagners were entitled to share in the profits from the exploitation of the movie rights to charlie angels if those rights were exploited by columbia as ancillary or subsidiary rights of its primary right to exhibit photoplays of the series but not if those rights were acquired by columbia independently from its right to exhibit photoplays.
thus,for example,if sgp held the motion picture rights to charlie angels from the beginning or if it acquired them by exercising its right of first refusal as producer to purchase the rights from goff and roberts then it could be said to have acquired those rights by exploiting its right to exhibit photoplays of the series and the wagners would be entitled to a share of the profits.but if sgp or columbia purchased the motion picture rights to charlie angels on the open market,independent of any right it had as producer of the tv series,then it could not be said to have acquired those rights by exploiting its right to exhibit photoplays of the series and the wagners would not be entitled to a share of the net profits.
iii.the undisputed evidence shows sgp did not acquire the motion picture rights to charlie angels by exploiting its rights as producer of the tv series.
to understand how the producer of a television series acquires the motion picture rights in the series it is necessary to understand the concepts of works made for hire under the copyright act of and separated rights under the writers guild of america minimum basic agreement mba 
works made for hire.
the act provided the holder of the copyright in a work had the exclusive right to make any other version thereof.it further provided,the word author shall include an employer in the case of works made for hire.thus,unless the parties agreed otherwise a writer employer owned all of the rights comprised in the copyright,including the right to use a work created for one medium in another medium it was not uncommon,however,for the parties to agree to a provision reserving to the employee writer the rights in certain media while the employer producer retained the rights in other media 
here goff and roberts,who wrote the teleplay for the charlie angels pilot,entered into a contract with the producer,sgp,which provided in relevant part producer hereby engages artist to render services in the writing,composition,preparation and revision of the literary material described in paragraph hereof a complete pilot script entitled charlie angels artist agrees that all material composed,submitted,added interpolated by artist hereunder shall automatically become producer property and that producer,for this purpose,shall be deemed the author thereof,artist acting entirely as producer employee.thus,if there had been no further provision in the contract concerning media rights sgp would have had the exclusive right to exploit the charlie angels television series in a motion picture,stage play,comic book or any other media.
separated rights.
the contract between goff and roberts and sgp did contain additional provisions concerning media rights,however.the contract stated the parties acknowledge that this agreement is subject to all of the terms and provisions of the applicable mba and to the extent that the terms and provisions of the mba are more advantageous to artist than the terms hereof,the terms of the mba shall supersede and replace the less advantageous terms of this agreement.as we shall explain,the separated rights provision of the mba was more advantageous to goff and roberts than the works made for hire provision of their contract with sgp.therefore in determining the rights of the parties the mba separated rights provision prevailed over the contract works made for hire provision.
article of the mba,entitled separation of rights,provided in relevant part the producer agrees that separation of rights shall be accorded to the writer of a format,story,or story and teleplay for any television film.the rights were separated as follows producer shall own the exclusive film television rights in the literary material to which the provisions of this article apply.writer shall retain all other rights including but not limited to theatrical motion picture rights.
article of the mba described the rights and duties of the producer and writer with respect to separated rights.it stated the writer of any literary material subject to the provisions of article hereof and the producer agree that they will take no action with respect to the rights reserved to the writer or granted to the producer which will cause or permit such literary material to become a part of the public domain in the united states.insofar as such literary material is covered by the copyright of the television film,the rights reserved to the writer hereunder will be held in trust for such writer by the owner of the copyright without limiting the generality of the foregoing,producer agrees to execute and deliver to writer an assignment under the copyright of all rights in the copyright reserved or which may revert to writer pursuant to the provisions hereo
