this appeal requires us to examine the scope of the termination provision of the copyright act of the act,c.section c grants authors or if deceased,their statutory heirs an inalienable right to terminate a grant in a copyright years after the original grant notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.c.the termination provision,however,has one salient exception copyright grants in works created for hire can not be terminated.c.
the question of first impression raised here is whether a settlement agreement,entered into long after a work creation,stipulating that a work was created for hire constitutes any agreement to the contrary under the act.we conclude that it does and,therefore,reverse.
background 
this being an appeal from a grant of summary judgment to plaintiff marvel comics,marvel,we view the deposition testimony,affidavits,and documentary evidence in the light most favorable to defendant joseph simon,the party.roge nyp holdings,cir.
publication of captain america comics 
in december,martin and jean goodman,doing business as timely publications and timely comics,collectively timely published the first issue of the now iconic captain america comics.captain america,steve rogers,was an turned superhero who was charged with protecting america from all enemies,especially nazi spies.authorship of the comic book was attributed to simon and jack kirby.
according to simon,he created captain america as an independent,freelance project before shopping it around to various publishers.although there was no written agreement between the parties,simon contends that he sold the captain america story to timely for a fixed page rate plus a percent share of the profits of the comic books.simon also maintains that he created the second through tenth issues of captain america comics on a freelance basis,and orally assigned his interest in captain america comics and the captain america character collectively the works to timely.
during,timely published the second through tenth issues of captain america comics.shortly after their publication,timely applied for and received certificates of registration of the copyrights for each issue of the works.the works were a tremendous success,and to this day continue to generate substantial revenue for marvel,timely successor in interest.
ii.the copyright act of 
under the copyright act of the act,in effect at the time of simon purported creation of captain america and assignment to timely,an author was entitled to a copyright in his work for years from the date of its publication,repealed by copyright act of,et.upon expiration of the first year term,the author could renew the copyright for a second year period the renewal term simply by applying to the united states copyright office copyright office.id.the supreme court has noted that the renewal term operated to permit the author,originally in a poor bargaining position,to renegotiate the terms of the grant once the value of the work has been tested.stewart abend,d see also woods bourne,cir through the renewal term congress attempted to alleviate the problem of the inability of authors to know the true monetary value of their works prior to commercial exploitation.as the house committee which drafted the act explained,it should be the exclusive right of the author to take the renewal term,and the law should be framed as is the existing law,so that he could not be deprived of that right,at.
iii.the prior actions 
as the initial year term of copyright in the captain america works neared its completion,simon commenced two separate lawsuits the prior actions against the goodmans and their affiliates.
in october,simon sued in new york state supreme court the state action claiming that,because he was the author of the works,the goodmans exploitation of the captain america character constituted unfair competition and misappropriation of his state law property rights.see complaint,joseph simon martin goodman and jean goodman,individually and magazine mgmt,krantz films,and weston merch.at.simon sought an accounting,damages,and injunctive relief in the state action.see id.
one year later,simon filed a similar action against the goodmans and their affiliates in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the federal action.in this action,simon sought a declaratory judgment that he,as the author of the works,had the sole and exclusive right to the renewal term of the copyright in the works.see complaint,joseph simon martin goodman and jean goodman,individually and magazine mgmt.and timely comics,at.he also sought injunctive relief to prohibit the goodmans from applying for renewal registrations of the works.see id.simon was represented by counsel in the prior actions.
in both of the prior actions,the defendants denied that simon was the sole author of the works.in the state action,the defendants specifically argued that simon contributions to the works were made as an employee for hire.see defendants answer and counterclaims at.in the federal action,the defendants asserted a counterclaim for a judgment declaring that timely owned the copyrights in the works and therefore simon should be enjoined from applying to renew such copyrights.see defendants answer at.while the prior actions were pending,timely successor in interest applied to the copyright office for renewal of the copyrights in the works.
in november,after two years of discovery,the parties to the prior actions entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement.in the settlement agreement,simon acknowledged that his contribution to the works was done as an employee for hire of the goodmans.at.pursuant to this settlement agreement,simon assigned any and all right,title and interest he may have or control or which he has had or controlled in the works without warranty that he has had or controlled any such right,title or interest to the goodmans and their affiliates.at.the parties to both actions filed stipulations with the respective courts dismissing with prejudice all claims and matters alleged,threatened,implied or set forth in any of the pleadings filed by simon.at.
iv.the copyright act of 
the legislative purpose behind the act renewal provide authors a second chance to benefit from their dealt a serious blow by the supreme court decision in fred fisher music witmark sons.see woods,at.in fisher music,the supreme court addressed the renewal rights in the not to mention mellifluous song when irish eyes are smiling.the court held that renewal rights were assignable by an author during the initial copyright term,before the renewal right vested.see,at.
not surprisingly,after fisher music publishers began to insist that authors assign both their initial and renewal rights to them in one transfer.the natural effect of this,of course,was to eliminate the author renewal right under the act.
in,congress enacted a comprehensive revision of the copyright act.see.codified at see also mills music,snyder,d.responding to the continual erosion of authors rights subsequent to the act,congress extended the duration of copyrights then in their renewal terms for an additional nineteen years the extended renewal term.see b.more significantly,however,the act gave new protections to authors.it allowed authors to terminate the rights of a grantee to whom the author had transferred rights in the original work.see c woods,at.this termination provision provides,in relevant part 
in the case of any copyright subsisting in either its first or renewal term on january,other than a copyright in a work made for hire,the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright or any right under it,executed before january,by any of the persons designated by statute,otherwise than by will,is subject to termination under the following conditions 
termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant.
c and c emphasis added.section further provides that terminations may be effected at any time during a period of five years beginning at the end of years from the date copyright was originally secured.c.
v.the proceedings below 
in december,recognizing an opportunity created by c to reclaim his copyright in the works,simon filed notices of termination the termination notices with the copyright office purporting to terminate his transfers of the copyrights to timely pursuant to c.in the termination notices,simon claimed that he independently created the captain america character and authored the first issue in the captain america comic book series,and that he was neither an employee for hire nor a creator of a work for hire.
thereafter,timely successor in interest in all rights,title,and interest to the works by virtue of a series of this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york casey,seeking a declaratory judgment that the termination notices were invalid and that marvel remains the sole owner of the copyrights in the works.simon in turn filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that he is the sole author of the works the termination notices are valid and all copyrights in the works revert to him on the effective date of the notices of termination.
after discovery,marvel moved for summary judgment on its claim for a declaration that simon termination notices were invalid.marvel argued that it was entitled to summary judgment on three separate grounds equitable estoppel res judicata and fundamental principles of contract law.each argument was bottomed on the premise that the new termination right granted to authors under c of the act did not apply to simon because the settlement agreement expressly stated that he was not the author of the works for copyright purposes.
the district court found that marvel equitable estoppel argument was meritless.with respect to marvel res judicata argument,the district court held that the termination right at issue in this action was an entirely new and wholly separate right from the renewal right at issue in the prior actions.marvel characters,simon,civ,wl,at.because the prior actions could not have resolved the question of whether simon was entitled to termination rights,the district court found that this claim was not barred by res judicata.see id.at.the district court also rejected marvel argument that simon is precluded from raising the issue of authorship needed to support his claim that the termination notices are valid.see id.in rejecting this argument,the district court noted that the authorship issue was not fully and fairly litigated on the merits in the prior actions.see id.the district court did,however,find that simon counterclaim seeking a declaration that he is the author of the works was barred by res judicata because this claim was resolved in marvel favor under the settlement agreement.see id.at.simon does not appeal the district court ruling on this counterclaim.
turning to the merits of marvel claims that the termination notices are invalid and marvel is the sole owner of the copyright in the works,the district court held that marvel was entitled to summary judgment on these claims based on the plain language of the settlement agreement.the court found that simon unambiguous acknowledgment in the settlement agreement that he created the works for hire prevented simon from exercising the termination right under c.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.republic bank of new york delta air lines,cir.
the standards governing summary judgment are.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.the party seeking summary judgment has the burden to demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact exists.adickes kress,d gallo prudential residential servs,cir.
in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,a court must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to,and draw all inferences in favor of,the,in this case simon.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d weinstock columbia,cir.summary judgment is improper if there is any evidence in the record that could reasonably support a jury verdict for the party.pinto allstate ins,cir.
ii.the preclusive effect of the prior actions 
determining the preclusive effect of the prior actions requires an analysis of the common law doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.these related but distinct doctrines operate to prevent parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate,thereby conserving judicial resources and protecting parties from the expense and vexation of multiple lawsuits.see,montana united states,d.
we apply federal law in determining the preclusive effect of a federal judgment,prc harris,boeing,cir,and new york law in determining the preclusive effect of a new york state court judgment,migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,d see also implementing the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution.the parties agree that there is no discernible difference between federal and new york law concerning res judicata and collateral estoppel.see,pike freeman,cir.therefore,we see no need to undertake a separate analysis of the preclusive effect of the federal and state actions.
on this appeal,marvel contends that there is no meaningful distinction between the authorship issue raised in the prior actions and the termination right at issue in this case.therefore,according to marvel,res judicata bars simon from asserting that he is the author of the works in order to exercise his termination right under c.in contrast,simon argues that the district court was correct in finding that neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel barred him from asserting that he was the works author because the factual issue of authorship was never fully and fairly litigated in the prior actions and is quite different from his present claim to termination rights in the works.simon is correct.
res judicata 
under the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating claims that were or could have been raised in that action.see allen mccurry,d.it is clear that a dismissal,with prejudice,arising out of a settlement agreement operates as a final judgment for res judicata purposes.see,nemaizer baker,cir.it is equally well settled,however,that a prior judgment can not be given the effect of extinguishing claims which did not even then exist and which could not possibly have been sued upon in the previous case.lawlor screen serv.likewise,res judicata does not bar subsequent litigation when the court in the prior action could not have awarded the relief requested in the new action.see,leather eyck,cir burgos hopkins,cir davidson capuano,cir.
whether a claim that was not raised in the previous action could have been raised therein depends in part on whether the same transaction or connected series of transactions is at issue,whether the same evidence is needed to support both claims,and whether the facts essential to the second were present in the first.woods dunlop tire,cir internal quotations omitted emphasis added.also dispositive to a finding of preclusive effect,is whether an independent judgment in a separate proceeding would impair or destroy rights or interests established by the judgment entered in the first action.state street bank trust,cir internal quotations omitted.to determine whether two actions arise from the same transaction or claim,we look to whether the underlying facts are related in time,space,origin,or motivation,whether they form a convenient trial unit,and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties expectations or business understanding or usage.pike,at internal quotations omitted.
however,t hat both suits involved essentially the same course of wrongful conduct is not decisive.lawlor,at.internal quotations omitted.for a single course of conduct may give rise to more than a single cause of action for res judicata purposes.see id.at.
although they spring from the same set of underlying facts,the claims at issue in the prior actions and the claims asserted in the current action are plainly distinct.in the prior actions,simon claimed that he was entitled to the renewal term of copyright for the works.in the present suit,simon claims that he is entitled to terminate marvel copyright in the works and obtain the extended copyright term by virtue of c of the act.as the district court correctly recognized,neither the extended copyright term nor the termination right existed at the time of the prior actions.indeed,the termination right is an entirely new and wholly separate right than the renewal right.hence,the prior actions could not have resolved the question of whether simon was entitled to termination rights in the extended copyright term.nor could the prior actions have awarded the relief requested in this right to terminate the grant to marvel and obtain the right to the extended copyright that relief was likewise unavailable at that time.
marvel cites precision air parts,avco,cir,and hernandez city of lafayette,cir for the proposition that a change in law will only enable a party to a claim where that change could have affected the outcome of the litigation.appellee br.at.marvel also argues,correctly,that despite the enactment of the act,the act governs the authorship of the works at issue here.see,roth pritikin,cir holding that the act work for hire differ from the not to be applied retroactively.however,it does not follow,as marvel suggests,that since the works authorship was at issue in the previous actions,simon termination claim is precluded here.while simon assertion of authorship is the sine qua non of both his prior claim to renewal rights and his present claim to termination rights,it is merely an issue that determines the viability of each claim.see yoon fordham.faculty admin.retirement plan,cir.
this court reasoning in yoon is instructive.in that case,the plaintiff had previously litigated and defaulted on his state court claim that he was entitled to his teaching salary.thereafter,yoon filed a suit in federal court claiming entitlement to pension benefits under erisa.the district court granted the defendant motion to dismiss,holding that yoon erisa claim was barred on res judicata grounds.see id.at.on appeal,the defendant urged this court to affirm the district court decision because res judicata prevented yoon from proving his entitlement to pension benefits.we rejected that argument,explaining 
t he fact that,because of res judicata,yoon can not raise the question of his right to salary for purposes of getting salary past,present,and future does not mean that he is barred from raising the question of his entitlement to salary in order to establish a contractual basis for the payment of pensions.for to deprive yoon of the right to litigate the issue of his entitlement to salary would be to estop him collaterally from doing so.
id.at emphasis in original accord pierre dyer,cir finding that even if the plaintiff claims for damages were barred by res judicata,he is not necessarily precluded from proving some of the underlying issues of that claim in connection with his claims for indemnification and contribution.
applying yoon reasoning here,it is clear that simon is not precluded from claiming that he is the author of the works for purposes of exercising the termination right under c.while simon would be precluded from claiming that he was entitled to benefits flowing from the initial year renewal period,that is not his claim.he is claiming that he is entitled to terminate marvel copyright in the works,a claim that did not exist when the prior actions were settled.therefore,the district court was correct that res judicata does not bar simon from asserting that the termination notices are valid.
collateral estoppel 
collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,prevents parties or their privies from relitigating in a subsequent action an issue of fact or law that was fully and fairly litigated in a prior proceeding.see boguslavsky kaplan,cir see also comm r of internal revenue sunnen.once a party has fought out a matter in litigation with the other party,he can not later renew that duel.collateral estoppel applies when the identical issue was raised in a previous proceeding the issue was actually litigated and decided in the previous proceeding the party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue and the resolution of the issue was necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits.boguslavsky,at internal quotations omitted.
simon does not dispute that he raised the issue of the works authorship in the prior actions nor does he contest that,by virtue of the stipulations of dismissal filed in the prior actions,he did not prevail on that issue.however,where a stipulation of settlement is unaccompanied by findings,it does not bind the parties on any issue which might arise in connection with another cause of action.lawlor,at.see also motrade rizkozaan,civ,wl,at march,to have a preclusive effect on specific issues or facts,however,a voluntary dismissal also must be accompanied by specific findings sufficient for a subsequent court to conclude that certain matters were actually decided.
here,although the settlement agreement contained detailed findings on the authorship issue,neither of the stipulations filed in the prior actions contain any specific findings as to whether simon authored the works independently or whether the captain america character was created as a work for hire.nor do the stipulations reference the settlement agreement in any way.therefore,the stipulations do not collaterally estop simon from litigating the issue of authorship underlying his termination claim in this action.
iii.application of section c of the act 
having concluded that simon is not precluded from asserting that he is the author of the works for purposes of exercising his statutory termination right,we turn,at length,to the issue of first impression presented by this case whether an agreement made subsequent to a work creation that declares that it is a work created for hire constitutes an agreement to the contrary under c of the act.the district court never addressed this question.instead,it simply assumed that because simon had conceded in the unambiguous settlement agreement that the works were created for hire,he could not now assert that he was the works author for purposes of exercising the termination right in this action.while the district court was undoubtedly correct that the settlement agreement is not contention disputed by the amici is not the relevant analysis on this issue.instead,we must analyze the legislative intent and purpose of c of the act to determine its application to this case.
simon contends that the district court failure to give effect to c mandate that authors can terminate copyright grants notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary contravenes the legislative intent and purpose of c.further,because simon has submitted testimony that he was not in fact an employee for hire when he created the captain marvel character,he maintains that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding marvel claims that the termination notices are invalid and it is the sole owner of the copyright in the works.marvel only response to simon contentions is that if simon reading of the statute is upheld,no litigation concerning a claim to authorship could ever be resolved by settlement.we find simon arguments persuasive and marvel prediction unfounded.
in order to determine the meaning of c,we apply the well established canons of statutory construction.in interpreting a statute,we look first to the language of the statute itself.see,cmty.for creative reid,d auburn housing auth.martinez,cir.when the language of a statute is unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete.connecticut bank germain,d.when the terms of a statute are ambiguous,however,we may seek guidance in the legislative history and purpose of the statute.see novak kasaks,cir.in so doing,we must construct an interpretation that comports with
