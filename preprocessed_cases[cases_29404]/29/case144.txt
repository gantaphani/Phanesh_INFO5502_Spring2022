three sexually oriented businesses,richland bookmart,adult video superstore,and raymond place filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of a knox county ordinance that establishes licensing requirements and regulations for businesses.plaintiffs attacked several provisions of the ordinance,on the theory that the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to them and on its face.upon motions by both parties,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of knox county and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment,with one small exception the court ordered the severance of two crimes,racketeering and dealing in controlled substances,from the list of crimes that triggered the ordinance civil disability provision.plaintiffs appeal raises four main issues.first,plaintiffs claim that the ordinance is an unconstitutional infringement on first amendment freedoms that is not justified by adequate evidence that local sexually oriented businesses produce adverse secondary effects or that the ordinance is designed to remedy such effects.second,plaintiffs claim that the definitions of nudity,and adult motel,as well as the prohibition on the sale and consumption of alcohol are not narrowly tailored and are unconstitutionally overbroad.third,they claim that the ordinance enacts an unconstitutional prior restraint.fourth,they claim that the ordinance regulation of business hours is preempted by tennessee law.knox county,arguing that the district court erroneously ordered the severance of racketeering and dealing in controlled substances from the ordinance civil disability provision.with regard to the issues presented by plaintiffs appeal,we affirm the district court decision with regard to the,we reverse the order to sever.

in the fall of,the knox county commission county began to update its regulation of sexually oriented businesses,culminating in ordinance ordinance.the ordinance enacted licensing requirements and other regulations applicable to sexually oriented businesses,which include adult arcades,adult bookstores or adult video stores,adult cabarets,adult motels,adult motion picture theaters,model studios,sexual device shops,and sexual encounter centers.
an adult bookstore or adult video store is defined as a commercial establishment which,as one of its principal business purposes,offers for sale or rental for any form of consideration any one or more of the following books or visual representations which are characterized by their emphasis upon the display of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas.in reaction to a june,decision by the tennessee supreme court,which invalidated a zoning ordinance on the basis of its vague definition of adult bookstore,see city of knoxville entertainment resources,llc,the county amended its definition of adult bookstore or video store.the amended ordinance specifies that a principal business purpose is defined to mean or more of any one of the following a displayed merchandise,b wholesale or c retail value of the displayed merchandise,d revenues derived from sale or rental,or e interior business space we shall refer to this provision as the threshold.in addition,f a business that regularly features the specified sexual activities or anatomical areas and prohibits access by minors,because of age,to the premises,and advertises itself as offering adult or xxx or or erotic or sexual or pornographic material on signage visible from a public right of way,is also defined to have the principal business purpose sufficient to bring it within the scope of the ordinance.
an adult cabaret is defined as a nightclub,bar,juice bar,restaurant,bottle club,or similar commercial establishment,whether or not alcoholic beverages are served,which regularly features persons who appear.or state of is further defined to mean the showing of the female breast below a horizontal line across the top of the areola and extending across the width of the breast at that point,or the showing of the male or female buttocks.this definition shall include the lower portion of the human female breast,but shall not include any portion of the cleavage of the human female breasts exhibited by a bikini,dress,blouse,shirt,leotard,or similar wearing apparel provided the areola is not exposed in whole or in part.
the ordinance regulates sexually oriented businesses in three general ways it requires that such businesses and all employees thereof be licensed on an annual basis,it regulates business hours,the manner in which sexually explicit films or videos may be exhibited,and interior configuration requirements,and it prohibits certain activities.with regard to licensing,the ordinance provides that a license shall be issued to both businesses and employees unless one of the specified conditions is met.one such condition is the applicant conviction,a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere to a specified criminal activity,namely rape,aggravated rape,aggravated sexual assault,public indecency,statutory rape,rape of a child,sexual exploitation of a minor,indecent exposure,dealing in controlled substances,or racketeering.a,b.a business can also lose its license if it knowingly hires someone who committed one of these specified crimes within the previous five years.
the ordinance prohibits nudity and the sale,use or consumption of alcoholic beverage on the premises of a sexually oriented business.nudity or a state of nudity is defined to mean the showing of the human male or female genitals,pubic area,vulva,anus,anal cleft or cleavage with less than a fully opaque covering,or the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple and areola.
in may,richland and adult video filed suit seeking a preliminary injunction,a permanent injunction,and declaratory judgment against the ordinance.after the ordinance was amended as noted above and raymond motion to intervene was granted,the court denied the county motion to dismiss.plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that four provisions of the ordinance are overbroad and not narrowly tailored,and the county moved for summary judgment in november.on december,the district court denied plaintiffs motion and granted the county motion for summary judgment with one exception the court ordered that racketeering and dealing in controlled substances be severed from the ordinance definition of specified criminal activity.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.trustees of the.laborers health care fund gibbons,cir.the decision below may be affirmed only if the pleadings,affidavits,and other submissions show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,we draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.see matsushita indus,zenith radio,d.
plaintiffs first argument attacks the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence relied on by the county to justify the regulation of adult stores selling for consumption only and of stores barely meeting the threshold.furthermore,plaintiffs claim to have produced their own evidence that puts the county factual findings and rationale in sufficient doubt to render summary judgment for the county inappropriate.in order to evaluate the merits of plaintiffs first claim,we must first determine how much and what kind of evidence is required to justify a regulation such as the present ordinance,and how much and what kind of evidence is required to mount a successful challenge thereto.
a regulation of sexually oriented businesses,such as the knox county ordinance,implicates at least two protected categories of speech first,sexually explicit but speech,such as adult publications and adult videos,and second,symbolic speech or expressive conduct,such as nude dancing.the supreme court has held that a restriction on protected speech is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the government if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and if the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.united states,d.similarly,time,place,and manner regulations of protected speech will survive constitutional scrutiny so long as they are content neutral,designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.city of renton playtime theatres,d.
the supreme court has indicated that the standard for judging the validity of restrictions on expressive conduct in the last analysis is little,if any,different from the standard applied to time,place,or manner restrictions.ward rock against racism,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also barnes glen theatre,d in clark cmty.for creative,d,we observed that this time,place,or manner test has been interpreted to embody much the same standards as those set forth in united states.accordingly,we have previously treated the two standards as sufficiently similar to be applied interchangeably.see,sensations,city of grand rapids,cir dls,city of chattanooga,cir.yet,the two formulations were penned in different contexts and employ different language neither the supreme court nor this court has made explicit whether and when the differences have any legal significance.we continue to adhere to the position that the and renton inquiries embody much the same standards,barnes,at.dls,at.at the same time,a clear resolution of plaintiffs first claim is aided by an understanding of the difference between and its progeny and renton and its progeny.
unlike regulations that are subject to the most exacting scrutiny,regulations unrelated to the content of speech are subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny.turner broad.fcc,d.in,the supreme court set out the intermediate scrutiny standard for the constitutionality of regulations of expression and applied it to a regulation of general conduct a prohibition on the destruction of selective service draft cards that incidentally burdened symbolic speech or expressive conduct the burning of a draft card to protest the war.at.in renton,the supreme court confronted another kind of law a time,place,or manner regulation aimed at negative secondary effects of protected speech 
in renton,the supreme court reformulated the requirements of the test and made them more specific as applied to the subset of regulations then before the court.renton standard applies to time,place,and manner regulations rather than to prohibitions of speech,thereby limiting its application to laws that satisfy first requirement that regulations be within the government constitutional power.renton closely mirrors second requirement that the regulation further a substantial government interest by requiring that it be designed to serve the same.renton requires that such regulations be,thereby satisfying third requirement that the interest be unrelated to the suppression of speech.
final demand that a restriction be no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest is a requirement that the law be narrowly tailored.see turner broad,at.stating that a law needs to be narrowly tailored to satisfy the standard,and that narrow tailoring in this context requires that the means chosen do not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.while renton does not explicitly require narrow tailoring,we agree with the seventh circuit that a requirement is implicit in the renton standard.ben bar,village of somerset,cir.that circuit noted that the supreme court does not always spell out the narrowly tailored step as part of its standard for evaluating time,place,and manner restrictions.ibid.however,a close examination of renton reveals that the court did consider whether the zoning ordinance at issue was narrowly tailored,ibid.citing renton,at,and that the court has required narrow tailoring in other cases involving time,place,and manner regulation.see ward,at.holding that to pass constitutional scrutiny,time,place,or manner restrictions must be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information quoting clark,at.renton final requirement that alternative avenues of communication are not to be unreasonably restricted is the only one that finds no reflection in it may fairly be said that this additional requirement exists to guard against the peculiar risks of time,place,and manner regulations that are not presented by regulations.
the choice between the and renton doctrines takes on some significance mainly when we must determine what evidence is sufficient to satisfy the substantially equivalent standards.see also lounge of bradenton,manatee county,cir.importantly,the kind of evidence required to establish that a regulation furthers a substantial government interest depends on character of the interest.a regulation of conduct,such as the prohibition on public nudity or on the destruction of draft cards,require s no evidentiary showing at all that the threatened harm was real.city of erie pap,d emphasis added.it was enough,for example,that congress took official notice,as it were,that draft card destruction would jeopardize the selective service system,and no further evidence or studies were required.ibid.citing,at.see also barnes,at.however,as the supreme court cautioned,t he fact that this sort of leeway is appropriate in a case involving conduct says nothing whatsoever about its appropriateness in a case involving actual regulation of first amendment expression.ibid.emphasis added see also schad mount ephraim,d holding that plaintiffs convictions for violation of a zoning ordinance prohibiting all live entertainment in the borough of mount ephraim ran afoul of the first and fourteenth amendments,because the borough has presented no evidence that live entertainment poses problems more significant than those associated with various permitted uses emphasis added.
the burden governments must carry to establish the connection between actual regulation of first amendment expression and its purported impact on secondary effects was further elaborated in alameda books,d.the initial evidentiary burden on the government is not a heavy one the entity issuing the regulation must have had a reasonable evidentiary basis for concluding that its regulation would have the desired effect.although not extraordinarily high,this evidentiary burden requires that the entity show that the evidence upon which it relied was reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the entity sought to address,at citing renton,at.alameda books,at.plurality id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.no comparable evidentiary basis has been demanded to establish that a regulation further such an interest.see pap,at.the court in did not require evidence that the integrity of the selective service system would be jeopardized by the knowing destruction or mutilation of draft cards there was no study documenting instances of draft card mutilation or the actual effect of such mutilation on the government asserted efficiency interests.for this reason,our first step is to determine whether the knox county ordinance purports to be a regulation of conduct that incidentally burdens expression as in,a time,place,or manner regulation targeting secondary effects as in renton,or a regulation comprising both as in pap 
the knox county ordinance is a time,place,and manner regulation.its stated aim is to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the county.a.to combat the secondary effects identified in the preamble to the ordinance,the county chose to regulate sexually oriented businesses by means of a licensing scheme and other regulations that are applicable to such establishments only,and a prohibition on only certain activities in such establishments.the county does not attempt to regulate a general category of conduct as in or barnes instead,it expressly seeks to regulate protected expression in order to ameliorate adverse secondary effects.pap,at.holding that erie ordinance is on its face a general prohibition on public nudity that does not target expressive nude dancing.thus,we find it prudent to conduct our analysis in terms set forth in renton and alameda,equivalently,to apply the test,incorporating evidentiary standards articulated in renton and its progeny 
the next question is whether the ordinance serves a substantial government interest.it is now recognized that governments have a substantial interest in controlling adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented establishments,which include violent,sexual,and property crimes as well as blight and negative effects on property values,pap,at.richland bookmart,at.plaintiffs argue that the ordinance does not advance that admittedly important interest and that summary judgment in favor of the county was improper because plaintiffs adduced facts demonstrating that at least a subset of the businesses regulated by the ordinance has not in fact generated any adverse secondary effects in knox county.under renton,the county had to provide a reasonable evidentiary basis for concluding that its regulation would have the desired effect,kenton county fiscal court,cir.plaintiffs submit that the county failed to carry its initial evidentiary burden,however slight,because the evidence cited in the ordinance is not germane to at least two categories of adult businesses in knox,consumption bookstores or video stores such as richland and adult video,and combination stores that barely meet the ordinance threshold.appellants br.at.
the supreme court and this court have repeatedly held that local governments need not conduct their own studies demonstrating that adverse secondary effects result from the operation of sexually oriented businesses or that the measures chosen will ameliorate these effects.alameda books,at.plurality opinion id.at.kennedy,concurring pap,at.renton,at.deja vu of nashville,metro.gov t of nashville davidson county,cir deja vu of cincinnati,union,cir en banc.the first amendment does not require a city,before enacting such an ordinance,to conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities,so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.renton,at.emphasis added.nor are local governments required to demonstrate empirically that its proposed regulations will or are likely to successfully ameliorate adverse secondary effects.alameda books,at.thus,insofar as plaintiffs merely dispute the relevance of foreign and outdated studies,they fail to create a genuine issue of material fact to survive summary judgment.
this is not to say that,provided that the list of studies and judicial opinions is recited,no plaintiff could ever successfully challenge the evidentiary basis for a regulation.albeit light,the burden on the government is not,and a plaintiff may put forth sufficient evidence to further augment that burden 
this is not to say that a municipality can get away with shoddy data or reasoning.the municipality evidence must fairly support the municipality rationale for its ordinance.if plaintiffs fail to cast direct doubt on this rationale,either by demonstrating that the municipality evidence does not support its rationale or by furnishing evidence that disputes the municipality factual findings,the municipality meets the standard set forth in renton.if plaintiffs succeed in casting doubt on a municipality rationale in either manner,the burden shifts back to the municipality to supplement the record with evidence renewing support for a theory that justifies its ordinance.
alameda books,at.as we have recently noted,the alameda books plurality thus set forth a framework governing the evidentiary standard in cases.sensations,city of grand rapids,cir 
plaintiffs contend that not only has the county failed to carry its initial burden,but that they have raised the doubt required by alameda,appellants br.at,shifting the burden back to the county to proffer further evidence in support of its rationale,which makes summary judgment for the county at this stage improper.as an initial matter,plaintiffs are incorrect to suggest that the county cited no findings relevant to the secondary effects of the contested types of businesses and combination stores.in fact,the ordinance relied on a number of judicial decisions,which held that evidence of secondary effects produced by or sexually oriented businesses was sufficient to justify their regulation.for example,in h a land city of kennedale,the fifth circuit stated that the city of kennedale can not reasonably believe its evidence of secondary effects is relevant unless it sufficiently segregates data attributable to establishments from the data attributable to establishments,cir.that circuit considered the evidence offered by the city and found that a indianapolis study and a oklahoma city study indeed isolated the effects of establishments on property values,which sufficiently support ed the belief that sexually oriented businesses cause harmful secondary effects.ibid.similarly,in world wide video of,city of spokane,the ninth circuit upheld spokane regulation of stores on the basis of testimonial evidence from residents complaining of a variety of negative effects associated with this category of businesses,cir.the indianapolis and oklahoma studies relied on by kennedale and the testimonial evidence relied on by spokane were also included among the findings made by the county in enacting the ordinance.
while some courts have presumed that the distinction between off and consumption may be constitutionally relevant,h a land,at,it is difficult to maintain the same about plaintiffs suggested distinction between combination stores that just barely meet one of the thresholds and those that meet it by some larger margin.requiring local governments to produce evidence of secondary effects for all categories created by every articulable distinction is a misapprehension of the supreme court holding that governments may rely on any evidence reasonably believed to be relevant.alameda books,at.stating that the city need not demonstrate that adult department stores produce the same secondary effects as adult minimalls see also enters.town of joseph,cir the plurality in alameda books did not require that a regulating body rely on research that targeted the exact activity it wished to regulate,so long as the research it relied upon reasonably linked the regulated activity to adverse secondary effects.while the threshold may be arbitrarily chosen,and it very well may be that this threshold sweeps in some relatively benign establishments,it is not for us to decide that some higher,equally arbitrary percentage would lessen the burden on expression without compromising the efficacy of the ordinance in controlling secondary effects.see dls,at the city council determined that a zone struck the appropriate balance while it is probable that each marginal foot of the buffer zone achieves each of these goals somewhat less efficiently,it is not for us to say that a zone or a zone would strike a better balance.thus,we find that the cumulative evidence of secondary effects documented in the preamble to the ordinance fairly supports the county rationale in regulating and combination establishments,along with other sexually oriented businesses,as required by alameda books.
because we find that the county met its initial evidentiary burden,only if plaintiffs succeed in casting direct doubt on the county rationale or factual findings would the county need additional support for its decision to regulate the contested business categories.we conclude that plaintiffs efforts to cast such doubt are unsuccessful.assuming for the sake of argument that the evidence offered by the plaintiffs is not inadmissible on summary judgment,as the county argues it is,appellee br.at,it is of dubious substantive import.unlike most plaintiffs challenging similar regulations,spoons,dragani,cir,plaintiffs do not introduce their own expert findings or studies,but rely on a private investigator and their own or their attorney summaries of police incident reports and property value assessments.even if we were to accept this information as authoritative,its probative value is minimal because elementary rules of logic and empirical inference preclude the conclusions plaintiffs urge.
plaintiffs argue that an affidavit signed by their attorney contains evidence that no decrease in property values was caused by some of the businesses.the affidavit contains property values set by the knox county tax assessor for properties around richland and raymond,and for properties around various establishments which provide and distribute adult videos as well as provide adult dancing for years,and.however,we are told nothing about how the increase in property values over the period of eight years around richland and raymond shown in the affidavit compares to the changes in property values elsewhere in knox county.an absolute increase in property values says nothing about richland or raymond impact on those property values,because we do not observe the counterfactual,what those values would be if richland were not located there,nor do we observe the changes in property values in similar locations,or in any location,not near a sexually oriented business.nor can we conclude anything about the trends in property values prior to plaintiff richland has been in operation at its present site for over twenty years,operating as an consumption establishment since about.appellants br.at.likewise,we can not know whether the proffered various establishments which provide and distribute adult videos as well as provide adult dancing are representative of all such establishments in knox county,and therefore,we can conclude nothing about the impact on property values of the whole category of businesses.
further,plaintiffs submit a summary of p olice incident reports from the period january,through may of video stores with large adult sections of sexually explicit videos described in the affidavit of plaintiffs investigator to demonstrate the lack of any negative secondary effects on sic video stores with as little as of inventory consisting of materials as defined in the ordinance.appellants br.at.the affidavit composed by a private investigator hired by plaintiffs contains only general descriptions of the businesses,such as would be readily observable by a customer.there is little in the affidavit that allows us to conclude that all or most businesses selected meet any one of the thresholds in the ordinance or whether each or any of them barely clears,or vastly exceeds,the threshold.merely stating that a video store had an inventory of approximately sexually explicit videos,for example,says nothing about the percentage of the total inventory these videos comprise.
it is unnecessary for us to go through every piece of evidence plaintiffs offer in an attempt to cast doubt on the county findings and rationale.while the county may rely on evidence from other locations and anecdotal evidence,plaintiffs burden is heavier and can not be met with unsound inference or similarly anecdotal information.giving plaintiffs evidence the most charitable treatment,it suggests merely that the county could have reached a different conclusion during its legislative process with regard to the need to regulate some categories of sexually oriented businesses.see daytona grand,city of daytona beach,cir.as the district court and the county point out,evidence suggesting that a different conclusion is also reasonable does not prove that the county findings were impermissible or its rationale unsustainable.turner broad,at.stating that in the context of intermediate scrutiny,conflicting evidence should not lead the court to the evidence de novo,at although this evidence shows that the town government might have reached a different and equally reasonable conclusion regarding the relationship between adverse secondary effects and sexually oriented businesses,it is not sufficient to vitiate the result reached in the legislative process.while plaintiffs claim to have produced evidence disproving that their establishments are associated with lower property values or higher crime rates,the ordinance is supported by evidence to the contrary.for example,contra plaintiffs claim that raymond cabaret is not associated with higher crime,the county relied on several studies and judicial decisions attesting to such an association,a houston study,a los angeles study,police investigations of crimes and unsanitary conditions at adult cabarets in nearby chattanooga,and judicial findings of prostitution at same,dls,city of chattanooga,aff.contra plaintiffs claim that richland and adult video produce no adverse secondary effects,the county relied on several studies and testimonial evidence,such as those we noted above.plaintiffs unsystematic and eclectic collection of information is insufficient to cast direct doubt on the relevance of the evidence relied on by the county,or the county rationale in enacting the ordinance.for these reasons,we conclude plaintiffs did not meet their burden of casting direct doubt on the factual findings or rationale underlying the county ordinance.
plaintiffs second argument combines an and a facial challenge to the ordinance regulatory reach.plaintiffs challenge the definition of,which is part of the definition of adult cabaret,the definition of nudity,the prohibition on the sale or consumption of alcohol,and the definition of adult motel as not narrowly tailored overbroad.
as we discussed above in section,time,place,and manner regulations of speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government legitimate,interests.narrow tailoring means that the g overnment may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals,but it does not require that the means chosen be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving its goals.ward,at.rather,the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.dls,at quoting ward,at.
adult cabaret.plaintiffs argue that the definition of adult cabaret,insofar is it incorporates the definition of,is not narrowly tailored,and that the district court erred in denying their motion for partial summary judgment on this issue.plaintiff raymond is an adult cabaret under the ordinance and has standing to challenge this provision.
plaintiffs claim that the definition of unreasonably subjects to the licensing and regulatory requirements businesses,whose performers wear more than pasties and.plaintiffs explain that pasties show the female breast below a horizontal line across the top of the areola and a shows buttocks,which makes a ensemble insufficient to avoid the definition of thus,the regulatory reach of the ordinance.appellants br.at.subjecting such performances to regulation,plaintiffs argue,does not serve the government legitimate interest in controlling secondary effects and needlessly abridges the erotic expression communicated by the performers.
we recognize that nude or nearly nude dancing conveys an endorsement of erotic experience,and is a protected form of expression in the absence of some contrary clue.dls,at quoting barnes,at.souter,concurring in the judgment.we need not adopt the district court determination that the ordinance goes no further than regulating businesses in which dancers wear pasties and,in order to conclude that the ordinance is narrowly tailored.
we have previously upheld various time,place,and manner regulations of businesses featuring performers clad in revealing garments that nonetheless cover more than the pubic area and areolae.in dls,this court considered a chattanooga city ordinance that defined adult cabaret in a similar,if not even more manner 
an establishment which features as a principle sic use of its business,entertainers waiters bartenders who expose to public view of the patrons within said establishment,at any time,the bare female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola,human genitals,pubic region,or buttocks,even if partially covered by opaque material or completely covered by translucent material including swim suits,lingerie or latex covering.adult cabarets shall include commercial establishments which feature entertainment of an erotic nature including exotic dancers,strippers,male or female impersonators,or similar entertainers.
dls,at emphasis added.in sensations,this court upheld a grand rapids regulation of sexually oriented businesses that restricted the activities of performers,where was defined in terms identical to the ones under consideration.at.true,the plaintiffs in those cases did not emphasize the same argument plaintiffs here,that adult cabarets should be allowed to decide whether they want to be licensed and offer dancers wearing and pasties,or be free of licensing requirements and the other regulations in the ordinance by wearing slightly more clothing.appellants br.at.however,in the course of validating licensing and other regulations,we necessarily affirmed the constitutionality of burdening establishments that feature similarly defined erotic dancing.dls,upholding a licensing requirement and a requirement of a buffer zone between performers of adult cabarets and customers,employees,or other entertainers sensations,at upholding,inter alia,a buffer zone,a rule between performers and audience,and a limitation on business hours.
plaintiffs proposition that the county can not constitutionally regulate expressive conduct involving performers who wear more cloth than pasties and is unsupported.plaintiffs appeal to,city of rockford is misplaced.cir.is distinguishable on a number of grounds there,the court invalidated a zoning and licensing regulation of establishments featuring clothed exotic dancers.moreover,the ordinance before that court did not rely on any evidence,local or not,and it did not contain any legislative findings or reasoning to support the connection between exotic dancing nightclubs,as distinct from sexually oriented businesses,and secondary effects.id.at.by contrast,the county relied on,inter alia,our decision in dls,and a fifth circuit decision that considered a challenge to a zoning ordinance as applied to an adult cabaret whose dancers performed more than nothing,but less than a bikini.baby dolls topless saloons,city of dallas,cir.that court determined that in view of the secondary effects studies relied on by now by knox county,it was reasonable for the city to conclude that establishments featuring performers in attire more revealing than bikini tops pose the same types of problems associated with other sexually oriented businesses.id.at.similarly,the county legislative determination that regular performances as defined by the ordinance are as liable to produce unwanted secondary effects as other sexually oriented businesses was reasonable,in view of the secondary effects evidence the county examined.because that determination is reasonable,the regulation of cabarets featuring performers does not impose a substantial portion of the regulatory burden on protected speech without advancing the goals of the ordinance on the contrary,the ordinance promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.
finally,plaintiffs invocation of the supreme court jurisprudence regarding public nudity and nude dancing is inapposite both barnes and pap upheld bans on nudity and the concomitant requirement that erotic performers wear at least pasties and,reasoning that this limitation effected a minimal restriction on the erotic expression contained in nude dancing.neither case may be read to suggest the unconstitutionality of regulating performances as defined by the ordinance,or to suggest that pasties and are the most intrusive requirement that may be constitutionally imposed.
nudity.next,plaintiffs claim that the definition of prohibited nudity is not narrowly tailored because,in their interpretation of the ordinance terms,a person wearing only a and pasties would violate that prohibition.appellants br.at.plaintiff raymond is an adult cabaret that has featured nude dancing in the past,and therefore has standing to challenge this provision.
we have previously upheld a similar,if not,prohibition on nudity in sexually oriented establishments.in sensations,we upheld a prohibition on nudity defined as the knowing or intentional live display of a human genital organ or anus with less than a fully opaque covering or a female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of the nipple and areola.at.this court explained that t he prohibition of full nudity has been viewed as having only a de minimis effect on the expressive character of erotic dancing.id.at citing pap,at.barnes,at.plurality opinion.while erotic dancing,whether performed in the nude or nearly so,is a protected expressive activity,the state of nudity itself is not inherently expressive.see dls,at.because nudity itself is not essential to the eroticism that brings dancing under the protection of the first amendment,the plurality in pap rejected justice stevens position that a ban on public nudity effects a complete ban on expression by incidentally banning nude dancing.sensations,at quoting pap,at.instead,it merely limit s one particular means of expressing the kind of erotic message being disseminated.ibid.
because the city of erie justified its ordinance both as a regulation of general conduct incidentally restricting expression and as a restriction of expression aimed at its secondary effects,the supreme court scrutinized both rationales.the court conceded that banning nudity and nude dancing may not be the most effective or the least restrictive means of combating secondary effects of adult establishments,but that the constitution requires neither to survive intermediate scrutiny.pap,at.holding that the restriction is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest,and that it leaves ample capacity to convey the dancer erotic message,even if it is not the least restrictive means to address the problem.
plaintiffs seem to suggest that the definition of nudity in the ordinance is broader than constitutionally permissible because donning a,which they claim does not cover the anal cleft,does not take a performer out of the state of nudity.the county on the other hand,has consistently maintained that pasties and constitute sufficient covering to comply with the ordinance.appellee br.at.we need not weigh in on the dispute between the parties as to the amount of fabric required to cover the anal cleft however,we see no reason not to accept the county limiting construction of its own regulation and we presume that the county will continue to abide by its stated interpretation in its enforcement efforts we are unconvinced that defining nudity in terms of exposing the anus,anal cleft or cleavage,however anatomically or linguistically awkward,takes us beyond the territory controlled by our holding in sensations.moreover,the erie ordinance upheld by the supreme court contained an even broader definition of nudity.pap,at.ordinance defined nudity to mean,inter alia,the showing of the human male or female genital sic,pubic hair or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering.emphasis added we conclude that the prohibition on nudity in sexually oriented establishments,as defined in the ordinance,does not burden substantially more expression than necessary to advance the county objective,and is thus narrowly tailored.
moreover,the provisions involving and
