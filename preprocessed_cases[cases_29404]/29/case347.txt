cable television operators petition for review of an order of the federal communications commission fcc.in that order,the fcc declined to rescind a rule that will preclude cable operators from offering converter boxes that bundle both security descrambling and,channel selection functions in a single device.for the reasons explained below,we deny the petition for review.
in the communications context,navigation devices are equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services from multichannel video programming distributors mvpds,such as cable operators and direct broadcast satellite services.c see id.b defining mvpds.the most common such device is the converter box.cable television subscribers typically lease converter boxes from their cable operators as part of their overall service packages.as currently configured,these devices integrate security and functions.the security function contain s embedded technology that decodes or descrambles a cable signal,and it is this function that precludes a consumer from accessing tiers of cable programming not part of his subscription package.general instrument fcc,footnote omitted.converter boxes also perform other tasks unrelated to security.id.for example,converter boxes commonly include channel tuners and provide access to video programming guides.id.historically,because only the cable system operator could provide the conditional access security technology,suppliers unaffiliated with the cable operator were not able to offer consumers comparable navigation devices.hence,such devices were not available at retail.
in,congress amended the communications act to add a new section,entitled competitive availability of navigation devices.the first sentence of section a directs the fcc to adopt regulations to assure the commercial availability,to consumers of multichannel video programming,of converter boxes,interactive communications equipment,and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming,from manufacturers,retailers,and other vendors not affiliated with any mvpd.id.a.section a second sentence further provides that s uch regulations shall not prohibit any mvpd from also offering converter boxes,interactive communications equipment,and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming id.
in,pursuant to section a directive to assure the commercial availability of navigation devices,the fcc adopted regulations that required mvpds,by july,to make the security element available separately from the basic navigation device.see implementation of section of the telecommunications act of commercial availability of navigation devices,fcc rcd,wl order the fcc order concluded that requiring mvpds to make the security element separately available would permit independent manufacturers and retailers to market navigation devices while allowing mvpds to retain control over their system security.see fcc rcd at.thereafter,mvpds began developing a separate security commonly referred to as a plugs into a slot in a host navigation device,permitting the device to perform both the security and functions.
the order further required mvpds,as of january,to stop selling or leasing new integrated navigation devices that perform both security and functions after the effective date,the rule would preclude cable operators from offering subscribers the integrated converter boxes that had previously been standard.should mvpds wish to continue selling or leasing converter boxes to subscribers after the effective date,the fcc required that those boxes be and rely on the same to independent manufacturers and retailers.the commission determined that,even with an unbundled security element available from mvpds,the continued availability of integrated that only mvpds could impede competition.see id.at.
finally,the order provided that an mvpd could qualify for an exemption from the regulations if it supports the active use by subscribers of navigation devices that i operate throughout the continental united states,and ii are available from retail outlets throughout the united states that are not affiliated with the mvpd.a.in,the only mvpds that qualified for this exemption were direct broadcast satellite dbs systems.by contrast to the cable market,where navigation devices were unavailable except through cable operators,in the dbs market integrated navigation devices were already available at retail.in addition,although the dbs devices were not interchangeable among dbs providers,each dbs provider had a nationwide service footprint.thus,unlike cable subscribers,dbs subscribers could continue using their equipment if they moved across the country,as long as they used the same dbs service provider.see order,fcc rcd at.
the cable industry trade association,the national cable television association,ncta,challenged the order as well as a reconsideration order in general instrument fcc,ncta argued that the plain language of section a precludes the fcc from adopting the ban on integrated equipment.as ncta noted,although the section first sentence directs the fcc to adopt regulations to assure the commercial availability of converter boxes,interactive communications equipment,and other equipment from unaffiliated manufacturers and retailers,its second sentence directs that the regulations shall not prohibit any mvpd from also offering converter boxes,interactive communications equipment,and other equipment.a.ncta maintained that the fcc had contravened the plain text of the second sentence by prohibiting cable operators from offering integrated converter boxes.
the general instrument court rejected ncta statutory challenge,noting that the term converter boxes must be read consistently in both sentences.see at.if we accepted ncta reading,we said,the fcc would be equally compelled by the plain language of the statute to permit retailers to provide integrated converter boxes.that,we noted,would certainly be an unacceptable result from the cable industry point of view,because it would give unaffiliated companies access to cable operators proprietary security technology.id.instead,we accepted as reasonable the fcc interpretation,which construed the term converter boxes as not including integrated converter boxes.see id.
in september,with its statutory authority confirmed,the fcc issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking to review the effectiveness of its navigation device rules.implementation of section of the telecommunications act of commercial availability of navigation devices,fcc rcd,wl further notice.the further notice sought comment on the existence of obstacles or barriers preventing or deterring the development of a retail market for navigation devices,on the effect operator provision of integrated equipment has had on achieving a competitive market for commercially available navigation devices,and on whether the date for the of integrated boxes remains appropriate.id.at.before the fcc could act on the further notice,however,the cable and consumer electronics industries adopted a memorandum of understanding to integrate the navigation functionality of boxes directly into digital television sets.this innovation made it possible for customers simply to plug and play by inserting a cablecard directly into a digital television with no need for an external navigation device in april,in part because of this development,the fcc extended the implementation date for the ban on new integrated boxes from january,to july.see implementation of section of the telecommunications act of commercial availability of navigation devices,fcc rcd,wl extension order.the extension order sought additional comments from industry and promised that,by,the fcc would complete a reassessment of the state of the navigation device market and determine whether the designated time frame remains appropriate or whether the ban on integrated devices will no longer be necessary.id.at.
both the cable and the consumer electronics industries filed voluminous comments in response to the further notice and the extension order.cable commenters argued that changes in market conditions since the fcc adopted the integration ban warranted its repeal.by contrast,the consumer electronics industry denied that conditions had materially changed and opposed both repeal of the pending ban and any further extensions of the implementation deadline.
on march,the fcc issued its second report and order.see implementation of section of the telecommunications act of commercial availability of navigation devices,fcc rcd,wl second report and order.while acknowledging some market progress,the fcc was not persuaded that the current level of competition in the navigation device market is sufficient to assure the commercial availability of navigation devices to consumers from sources other than mvpds.id.at.it concluded that the ban on integrated devices should be retained because common reliance by cable operators on the same security technology and conditional access interface that consumer electronics manufacturers must employ in developing competitive navigation devices was necessary to assure development of the statutorily required competitive market for navigation devices.id.
the fcc did,however,extend the implementation date for the ban yet again,this time until july.see id.at.that extension,the fcc said,would provide the industry time in which to determine whether it was possible to implement a downloadable software security solution that would obviate the need for the physical integration ban.see id.at.the fcc further stated that,if the parties demonstrated that downloadable security was feasible but could not be implemented by july,it would consider granting still another extension.see id.at.the fcc instructed the cable industry to report on the feasibility of this solution by december,and instructed the trade associations for both the cable and consumer electronics industries to file joint status reports regarding their progress.see id.at.
cable operators charter communications,and communications,joined by intervenor ncta,now petition for review of the second report and order.they argue that the integration ban violates the plain language of section a and the fcc unreasonably declined to rescind the ban notwithstanding changed market conditions.we consider these arguments below.
we begin with the petitioners statutory argument,which is essentially a of the argument addressed by this court in general instrument.there,we rejected ncta contention that the fcc was precluded from banning integrated converter boxes by the second sentence of section a,which states that the fcc shall not prohibit any mvpd from also offering converter boxes,interactive communications equipment,and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming a.as discussed in part i above,in order to reconcile the use of the term converter boxes in both the first and the second sentences of the section,we accepted as permissible the fcc view that the term did not extend to integrated converter boxes.general instrument,at.
the petitioners now ask us to focus our attention not on the term converter boxes,but on the term other equipment.the petitioners argue that if integrated boxes are not converter boxes,as we held in general instrument,then they must be other equipment,a possibility we did not address there.and if integrated boxes are other equipment,then section a second sentence prevents the fcc from barring cable operators from offering them.in response,the fcc brief in this court points out that,like the term converter boxes,the term other equipment appears in both sentences of section a.and just as general instrument held that converter boxes does not have to mean all converter boxes,other equipment used by consumers does not need to mean all other equipment used by consumers.fcc br.
before we may address the merits of the petitioners statutory argument,we must first consider a potential offered by the fcc.according to the commission,two considerations bar us from even reaching the petitioners statutory argument.
first,the commission argues that the petitioners statutory challenge is.according to the fcc,the integration ban was based on an interpretation of section a that was adopted in the order and reconsideration order.congress has required that petitions for review of such orders be filed within days,see a,and a petitioner failure to file within that window constitutes a bar to our review.see natural res.def.council nuclear regulatory comm n.there is an exception to that bar for cases in which the fcc has reopened its original rulemaking,see kennecott utah copper united states dep t of interior,and the petitioners claim that this case falls within that exception.they contend that,when the fcc issued its further notice to review the effectiveness of the rules,fcc rcd at,and subsequently said that it would complete a reassessment of the state of the navigation devices market and determine whether the ban on integrated devices will no longer be necessary,extension order,fcc rcd at,it reopened the question of its statutory authority to adopt the rules in the first place.
but nothing in those notices suggested that,in reviewing the effectiveness of the rules,the fcc intended to review their statutory basis as well.there was not one word about the proper interpretation of section a in the notices.and there is not one word about the proper alone the construction the petitioners suggest the second report and order that is the subject of this case.although the petitioners cite our decision in public citizen nuclear regulatory comm n,in support of their reopening argument,the petitioners misread public citizen to stand for the proposition that the substantive invalidity of a previously adopted regulation can always be asserted upon review of a later rulemaking on the same general subject even though the statutory time period for review has expired.kennecott,at.to the contrary,we expressly stated in public citizen that the appropriate way in which to challenge a longstanding regulation on the ground that it is violative of statute is ordinarily by filing a petition for amendment or rescission of the agency regulations,and challenging the denial of that petition.id.quoting public citizen,at.indeed,it is absurd to suppose that every time an agency requests parties to compare the regulatory status quo with specific proposed alternatives,all facets of the status quo become fair game for new challenges.safe food and fertilizer epa,see cellular telecomms.internet ass fcc,holding that the window barred the petitioners from challenging the statutory authority underlying the fcc decision to impose wireless number portability in a forbearance petition 
moreover,even if our review were not barred by the limited statutory window for filing petitions for review,it is certainly the fcc also points,which requires that the commission be afforded an opportunity to pass on an issue as a condition precedent to judicial review.a.this circuit has strictly applied that section,holding that we may not consider arguments that have not first been presented to the commission.bdpcs,fcc,as the petitioners concede,there is not a single page in the voluminous record below in which they made the other equipment argument that they now press before this court.see oral arg.tr.
notwithstanding their failure to raise this argument below,the petitioners urge us to reach it because they raised it in their original attack on the fcc reconsideration order that we upheld in general instrument.according to the petitioners,the general instrument court misunderstood the nature of their statutory argument,and thus addressed only the converter box language in that opinion.this,they say,left the other equipment language fair game for this appeal.
but even if the petitioners did raise this issue in the assertion for which they provide no citation we see no reason the commission should be required to sift through pleadings in other proceedings in search of issues that a petitioner raised elsewhere and might have raised here had it thought to do so.beehive,fcc.i ndeed,such a duty would be inconsistent with our adversarial system,in which the petitioner has the burden of clarifying its position before the agency.id.quoting bartholdi cable fcc.nor would a reasonable commission necessarily have seen the question raised before us as part of the case presented to it.time warner entm t fcc.to the contrary,our affirmation of the fcc statutory authority in general instrument,as well as the fcc understanding that it had not reopened the issue,surely gave the commission no reason to believe that the petitioners meant to reassert a statutory argument on this.and with the petitioners failure to mention the point at explains why the fcc did not address the question in the second report and order.accordingly,we are barred from considering the petitioners statutory argument.
the petitioners also contend that the fcc unreasonably refused to rescind the integration ban in light of changed circumstances.this contention was raised below,and it is therefore properly before us.the petitioners regard the ban as unreasonable for an array of interrelated reasons.in considering those arguments,we apply the deferential standard of the administrative procedure act apa,and will uphold the commission policy judgments as long as they are not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.global crossing,fcc,quoting a.under that standard,the scope of review is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.cellular,at quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mutual auto.ins,d.the agency must,however,examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the petitioners first argument is that the integration ban is no longer needed to comply with the statutory directive of section a because navigation devices are already available to consumers in the retail market.according to the petitioners,in the period since the rule was promulgated,the cable and consumer electronics industries engaged in an extraordinary collaborative undertaking to bring navigation devices to the retail market,and to implement the separate security requirement of the order.petitioners br.in addition,the fcc plug and play rules legally bound the cable industry to specific technical and operational commitments to facilitate the commercial availability of digital equipment.see supra note.as a result,by,the record showed the commercial availability of more than models of navigation devices from different manufacturers.id.the momentum and trajectory,the petitioners assure us,is inexorably toward such availability regardless of any integration ban.petitioners reply br.
the fcc did not ignore the developments cited by the petitioners,but its assessment both of the current state of the market and of its trajectory differed from that of the cable industry.although the fcc agreed that there had been progress,it was clear from the record that the market for equipment used in conjunction with the distribution of digital cable video programming presently remains a nascent market.second report and order,fcc rcd at,and whatever number of television models might be available,the record reflected that less than three percent of the compatible televisions sold to consumers were actually being used with cablecards citing submissions from the consumer electronics industry,the fcc also expressed concern about evidence that cable operators are not adequately supporting cablecards.id.at given this record,there was nothing unreasonable about the fcc conclusion that the competitive reasons that led the commission to impose the integration ban have not been eliminated by the developments in the market.second report and order,fcc rcd at.
moreover,this court is bound to defer to the fcc predictive judgment that,a bsent common reliance on an identical security function,we do not foresee the market developing in a manner consistent with our statutory obligation.id.at,see melcher fcc,noting that this circuit review has been particularly deferential where the fcc must make judgments about future market behavior with respect to a technology.as the fcc explained at the heart of a robust retail market for navigation devices is the reliance of cable operators on the same security technology and conditional access interface that consumer electronics manufacturers must rely on in developing competitive navigation devices.second report and order,fcc rcd at.if cable operators must take steps to support their own compliant equipment,it seems far more likely that they will continue to support and take into account the need to support services that will work with independently supplied and purchased equipment.id.at.this explains the fcc prohibition on integrated devices,as it assur es that mvpds devote both their technical and business energies towards creation of an environment in which competitive markets will develop.id.it is an explanation that is neither arbitrary nor capricious.
the petitioners second contention is that the fcc failed to explain adequately why the costs of the integration ban were justified.the cable industry maintains that the costs of converter boxes will be enormous,and that these costs will be passed on to subscribers who will obtain absolutely no benefit.petitioners br.quoting a line from general instrument,the petitioners declare that p erhaps there are benefits that will flow to consumers from the integration ban,but the commission did not clearly spell them out.at.
the quotation from general instrument provides no succor for the petitioners.our reference there was to the order,not to the one we consider here,and we find the explanation offered in the second report and order satisfactory.on the cost side,the agency noted that there was considerable dispute between the cable and consumer electronics industries regarding what those costs would actually be.see fcc rcd at.while the fcc did not dispute that consumers will face additional costs in the short term,it agree d with the consumer electronics parties and other commenters that the cost s likely will decrease over time as volume usage increases.see id.at,citing comments arguing that advances in technology,as well as volume production,will bring costs down,and that the costs described by ncta are for products the commission also took steps to minimize industry costs,both by extending the implementation deadline from to,and by promising to reconsider eliminating the ban altogether should the cable and consumer electronics industries achieve a downloadable security solution capable of providing common reliance without requiring the physical separation of security and functions.see id.at.
the fcc further concluded that the costs of the integration ban should be counterbalanced to a significant extent by the benefits likely to flow from a more competitive and open supply market.id.at.those benefits included the potential savings to consumers from greater choice among navigation devices,as well as the spurring of technological innovations.id.and,of course,there was the fact that congress regarded the commercial availability of navigation devices from independent sources as a benefit in and of itself.see consumer ass fcc,indicating that the fcc had appropriately assessed,as a benefit of a regulatory requirement,the regulation contribution toward speeding achievement of a congressional mandate.given the congressional command to assure such availability,a,and the fcc determination that the integration ban was necessary to do so,we can not regard the agency balance as arbitrary.see generally consumer ass n,at noting that analyses epitomize the types of decisions that are most appropriately entrusted to the expertise of an agency quoting office of commc of united church of christ fcc.
third,the petitioners object that the fcc arbitrarily applied different decisional criteria in imposing the integration ban on cable but not dbs.petitioners br.emphasis omitted.as we noted in part i,the order provided that an mvpd could qualify for an exemption from the integration ban if it supports the active use by its subscribers of naviga
