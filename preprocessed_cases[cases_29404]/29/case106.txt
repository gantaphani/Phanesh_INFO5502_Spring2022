for over a decade,faye treadwell treadwell,widow of the late music executive george treadwell,and larry marshak marshak,a promoter of various groups,have fought tooth and nail over the rights to use the trademark of the drifters,the legendary singing group.in the late nineties,marshak sued treadwell for infringement of a federally registered mark for the drifters that marshak had obtained in.treadwell counterclaimed to cancel the registration,arguing that the mark had been procured by fraud,and that marshak was infringing on treadwell senior rights.in august,a jury issued a split verdict it found that marshak had procured his mark by fraud,but that treadwell had abandoned her common law rights to the mark through inaction.however,approximately one year after the jury verdict,judge politan granted judgment as a matter of law for treadwell.marshak treadwell,d.judge politan agreed with the jury that marshak had made misrepresentations to the patent and trademark office,but determined that the mark had not been abandoned,as the music of the drifters was still played on the radio and sold in stores.marshak appealed judge politan decision and we affirmed.marshak treadwell,cir.
the case now before us focuses on the breadth of the injunction and efficacy of the remedies that were issued along with judge politan ruling.judge politan enjoined marshak and his company from marketing the drifters on broadway,not up on the roof,and not under the ordered a full accounting of profits.in the years that followed,however,various family members and associates of marshak picked up where marshak left off,and began again promoting the drifters,just as marshak had.treadwell,thinking that these actions were not some kind of wonderful,thus brought the instant motion for contempt,arguing that the politan injunction applied to marshak associates as well as to marshak.after a lengthy hearing,the district court found that marshak and his associates were in contempt of the politan injunction,but limited treadwell remedies to an award of attorneys fees.both sides then appealed marshak and his associates appealed the merits of the decision,while treadwell challenged the paucity of the remedies.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
the dispute in this case centers on the trademark rights to the drifters,a popular singing group from the and the drifters first appeared in and came under the management of george treadwell the following year.george treadwell hired and paid the individual performers as employees,replacing them frequently.for nearly two decades,the drifters as an entity persisted,though the membership of the group was constantly in flux.george treadwell passed away in,and his wife,faye treadwell,took over management of the group.
by,the drifters had largely ceased to perform in the united states,although their songs were still played on the radio.marshak,an editor for a rock magazine,saw this as an opportunity.working with cbs radio,which had shifted to an oldies format,marshak reunited some of the former members of the who had been replaced over the years by the a series of reunion concerts.capitalizing on the success of these concerts,marshak signed the former members to exclusive management contracts and began marketing them as the drifters.
over the next three decades,marshak continued marketing the drifters in the united states.his efforts at promotion were occasionally interrupted by trademark infringement treadwell sued marshak,and marshak in turn sued other drifters these lawsuits were often inconclusive by the late nineties,however,the litigation over the drifters finally produced a decisive result as described above,in july,judge politan determined that marshak had acquired his rights to the drifters mark by fraud and that treadwell rights to the drifters were superior.marshak,d at.judge politan enjoined marshak and his company,rci management rci,from promoting groups performing under the name of the drifters,marshak treadwell,order of contempt,permanent injunction,and accounting politan injunction,and we affirmed,marshak,at.
with the issuance of the injunction,marshak should have been out of the drifters business.in the year and a half leading up to the issuance of this injunction,however,marshak and his associates had begun to reorganize his promotion business in ways that complicated the effect of judge politan injunction.it is the nature of this reorganization that lies at the center of the contempt proceeding now before us.
in the years before the injunction was issued,marshak promoted groups like the drifters through rci.andrea marshak,marshak wife,and paula marshak,marshak,both worked for rci,as did dave revels revels.charles mehlich mehlich served as rci accountant,and lowell davis davis served intermittently as rci attorney.the business was run out of marshak basement.
beginning in,marshak began to experience some health difficulties.according to andrea marshak,for the next year or so she and paula marshak handled much of the business of rci,allowing marshak to convalesce.finally,in early,after the work became too overwhelming,they collectively decided to dissolve rci and form a new company called dcpm,dcpm dcpm was officially formed on january,and was by andrea marshak,paula marshak,mehlich,revels,and dave backer backer.these same owners also formed,a licensing corporation created to work alongside dcpm.dcpm was formed as a sort of successor to rci.app.marshak decl.it basically picked up where rci left off,app.paula marshak decl,and was engaged in the same kind of singing group promotion business as rci,app.mehlich decl.in addition,dcpm was operated out of the same offices in marshak basement that housed rci.
for a brief period of time,rci and dcpm coexisted.rci last show was in november of eight months after dcpm was rci was not officially dissolved until march.after the reorganization,marshak was officially retained as an employee of dcpm,not as an owner.
in august,six and a half months after dcpm was formed,the jury returned a verdict in marshak treadwell,the underlying case.overall,the verdict was favorable to the jury found that marshak had procured his drifters trademark by fraud,the jury also found treadwell had abandoned her common law rights to the mark through inaction.as a result,marshak retained common law rights in the drifters mark.marshak victory,however,was relatively.on july,approximately a year later,judge politan vacated the jury verdict and issued judgment in favor of treadwell,rejecting the jury finding that treadwell had abandoned the drifters mark.
up until february,when the politan injunction was affirmed by a panel of this court,the drifters had been appearing nightly at the sahara hotel and casino with the platters and the coasters.all three groups were provided by dcpm,which had been assigned marshak rights to the drifters under his employment contract.once the injunction became effective and marshak lost his rights to the drifters name,however,dcpm also lost its rights to the drifters,and thus dcpm could only market the platters and the coasters.shortly thereafter,the sahara show drifters were the biggest box office draw of the three groups,and the show could not survive with only the platters and the coasters.
barry singer,a longtime business associate of marshak,had brokered the original deal between rci and the sahara prior to the issuance of the injunction.once the injunction barred the drifters from appearing with the platters and the coasters,singer attempted to obtain independent rights to the drifters name,even going so far as to negotiate with treadwell.these efforts,however,were unsuccessful.
in august,around the time that singer was attempting to secure independent rights to the drifters mark,davis,who had previously worked as an attorney for marshak,approached mehlich,a of dcpm and marshak,and informed mehlich that odessa hobbs,the widow of elsbeary hobbs,a past member of the drifters,was interested in licensing the name the elsbeary hobbs drifters.according to davis,odessa hobbs had settled with treadwell,and could now license the trademark.mehlich approached his partners at dcpm about this opportunity,but according to mehlich,no one at dcpm thought it wise to pursue that particular license given the injunction against marshak.singer,however,was interested.singer subsequently formed a new company,singer management,for the express purpose of acquiring the rights to the elsbeary hobbs drifters.he invited mehlich to come in as a of singer management.mehlich agreed,becoming an owner of dcpm and singer management simultaneously.in october,the deal was management entered into a license agreement with odessa hobbs to use the elsbeary hobbs drifters mark.by early,the old sahara show was reunited,with the platters and the coasters now playing alongside the elsbeary hobbs drifters.
on november,treadwell filed a motion for contempt,alleging that marshak and his associates had continued to infringe upon her drifters mark in violation of judge politan order.the district court issued its contempt decision on september,and made the following holdings relevant to this appeal.marshak treadwell,wl,liability opinion.first,the district court rejected the argument that treadwell action for contempt was precluded by laches.it observed that the delay in filing may have been inexcusable,but appellants did not show prejudice by the delay,a required component of the equitable defense.second,the district court held that treadwell did not relinquish her rights to the drifters mark to odessa hobbs in the january,settlement.third,the district court held that judge politan court order was valid,despite a decision rendered by the trademark trial and appeal board ttab holding that bill pickney had superior rights to treadwell.finally,and most significantly for the purposes of this appeal,the district court held that the injunction was enforceable against parties other than marshak and,the companies and employees connected to marshak that continued to market the drifters after the injunction issued.
on september,appellants moved for reconsideration of the district court liability opinion the district court issued an opinion on february,addressing the motion for reconsideration.marshak treadwell,wl,reconsideration opinion.for the most part,the reconsideration opinion endorsed the findings of the liability opinion.it did,however,make one significant change it acknowledged that the previous liability opinion contained some factual inaccuracies.in the liability opinion,the district court had inaccurately stated that dcpm was formed around the same time that rci was dissolved,and that this took place coincident with the unfavorable jury verdict.in actuality,the jury verdict,which was a split decision,was arguably favorable to marshak and was issued eight months after dcpm was formed.the district court acknowledged these factual mistakes,but noted that these mistakes did not affect the court controlling findings and conclusions of law concerning the relationship of marshak and the other marshak movants.marshak,wl,at.

before reviewing the district judge factual findings,however,we must address a threshold matter.appellants have challenged the district court basis for holding the to the,each appellant other than marshak and contempt of the politan injunction.whether a party may be held in contempt by an injunction is governed by federal rule of civil procedure d rule d.pursuant to rule d,the following persons may be bound by an injunctive order so long as they receive actual notice of the injunction

there is,of course,no doubt that judge politan injunction applies to marshak and his company,parties specifically named in the order however,the other parties held in contempt by the district marshak,paula marshak,revels,mehlich,davis,singer,singer management,dcpm,and not specifically named in judge politan injunction.the question before the court,therefore,is whether the district court provided a legally sound basis under rule d for a finding of contempt against the to the injunction.
the district court did delineate a basis under rule d for holding each appellant in contempt of the injunction it determined that andrea marshak,paula marshak,mehlich,revels,and davis were subject to the injunction as of marshak rci that singer and singer management were liable for being in active concert or and abetting marshak violation of the injunction and that dcpm and were subject to the contempt powers as to rci.putting aside for a moment the question of whether the facts bear out the district court holdings,we see no error in the basis chosen for holding singer,singer management,dcpm and in contempt.singer and singer management were properly analyzed as parties in active concert or and abetting marshak,and dcpm and were properly analyzed as.the problem,rather,is with the district court initial treatment of andrea marshak,paula marshak,mehlich,revels,and davis as parties directly subject to the injunction as employees of marshak rci.see marshak,wl,at u nder the language of both rule and judge politan order,not only is marshak directly enjoined,but also directly enjoined are andrea marshak,paula marshak,mehlich,revels,and davis as servants,employees,or agents of marshak in his business entity of rci.
the district court liability opinion misstated the chronology of events leading to the formation of dcpm.in that opinion,the district court stated that coincident with the august,unfavorable verdict returned against him in marshak treadwell,marshak dissolved rci and a bout the time marshak dissolved rci,andrea,marshak wife,formed dcpm,marshak,wl,at.this chronology of events,as acknowledged by the district court in its reconsideration opinion,was incorrect.in actuality,dcpm was formed over six months before the jury rendered its verdict,and over eight months before rci promoted its last show.moreover,the jury verdict itself was not entirely unfavorable to,only after judge politan judgment as a matter of law,which was published nearly a year after the jury issued its verdict,did marshak find himself without any legal rights to the drifters mark.
the district court issued its reconsideration opinion,in part,to correct these factual inaccuracies.it held,however,that those mistakes in fact did not affect the court controlling findings and conclusions of law concerning the relationship of marshak and the other marshak movants marshak,wl,at.although the district court did not specify why the factual mistakes in the liability opinion did not affect the judgment,we find no error in its conclusion.see dandridge williams,d the prevailing party may,of course,assert in a reviewing court any ground in support of his judgment,whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the trial court.cospito heckler,cir same.while andrea marshak,paula marshak,mehlich,revels,and davis could not be enjoined as employees of had ceased to serve marshak and rci in an employment capacity more than a year prior to issuance of the noted above,persons in active concert or participation with an enjoined party are also bound by the injunction,and may not aid or abet the violation of the injunction.see,max seafood cafe,at.therefore,it is not essential that andrea marshak,paula marshak,mehlich,revels,and davis have been employees of rci at the time that the injunction was issued to find themselves subject to the contempt powers of the court.
having determined that there is an adequate legal basis for applying the contempt standard against each appellant,we now turn to the factual findings made by the district court.we review the district court factual findings for clear error.under such review,w e accept the ultimate factual determination of the unless that determination is either completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility,or bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.vanterpool,cir quoting krasnov dinan,cir.
reviewing the record in its entirety,we find ample support for the district court contempt findings against marshak,andrea marshak,paula marshak,mehlich,davis,singer,and singer management.treadwell initiated these contempt proceedings on november.as the case progressed,marshak decided to slowly dissolve rci.his wife andrea marshak,who had long worked for rci,immediately stepped into the breach and formed company that would essentially replicate the work of rci.she then invited paula marshak,mehlich,and past employees of become of dcpm.in paula marshak own words,dcpm picked up where rci left off app.doing the same work as marshak and rci,only under a different name.even the place of business stayed the,owned and operated by the same personnel that previously ran rci,found a home in marshak basement.marshak,once the boss,was not merely an employee.
up until the moment the injunction issued,dcpm continued to market the drifters based on marshak presumed common law rights.once the injunction issued,however,dcpm was banned from using the mark.immediately,however,the parties scrambled to evade the injunction.davis,marshak former attorney,approached singer,the man who brokered the original sahara show,about purchasing rights to the drifters mark through odessa the fact that judge politan had previously held that hobbs had no rights to license the mark.marshak,wl,at determining that the settlement with the widow of elsbeary hobbs reflects nothing more than treadwell agreement to make certain royalty payments and that treadwell did not disavow any rights or claims to the name drifters quoting marshak treadwell,d at nevertheless,singer inked the deal and began marketing the drifters through singer management,a company created specifically for this purpose.then,shockingly,singer invited mehlich,a of dcpm,to become a of singer management,and moved the operation else marshak basement.thus,after a year interlude,the drifters were once again being marketed out of the same basement office by the same people.
over the next few years,the various denizens of marshak basement gave lie to the notion that dcpm and singer management were separate and distinct entities.singer management and dcpm shared the same office and phone number.inquiries by a private investigator revealed that principals of singer willingly quote prices for the drifters and fax out employment contracts,behavior that dcpm owners unconvincingly described as unintentional.dcpm even sent out media kits advertising the services of a suite of performers that included the drifters.
the district court credited significant evidence to this effect,both circumstantial and direct,in holding that marshak and the principals of dcpm and singer management had reassembled marshak business under different names in order to evade the politan injunction.we see no clear error in this determination.
likewise,we find no clear error in the district court holding that dcpm and were successors in interest to,or a mere continuation of,rci.the district court applied new jersey law,citing bowen engineering estate of reeve.
in determining whether or not successor liability should be imposed,i t is the duty of the court to examine the substance of the transaction to ascertain its purpose and true intent.factors relevant to the mere continuation exception include continuity of ownership continuity of management continuity of personnel continuity of physical location,assets and general business operations and cessation of the prior business shortly after the new entity is formed.also relevant is the extent to which the successor intended to incorporate the predecessor into its system with as much the same structure and operation as possible.thus the court should determine whether the purchaser holds itself out to the world as the effective continuation of the seller.however,the proponent of successor liability need not necessarily establish all of these factors.
bowen.at internal citations omitted and alterations in original although certain factors weighed against finding dcpm and to be successors to,the changes in ownership and majority of factors clearly weighed in favor of finding dcpm and to be successors in interest to rci the personnel of each business were the same,the location of each business was the same,the assets of each business were the same,the general operations of each business were the same,and rci folded shortly after dcpm was formed.considering the record as a whole,we find no clear error in the district court determination that dcpm and were formed to replace and continue the work of rci,nor any error with the district court concomitant decision to hold dcpm and in contempt.see walling james reuter.a n injunction enforc ea ble by contempt proceedings against the corporation,its agents and officers and those individuals associated with it in the conduct of its business,but it may also,in appropriate circumstances,be enforced against those to whom the business may have been transferred,whether as a means of evading the judgment or for other reasons.internal citations omitted merriam webster dictionary,st cir a party and his privies can not circumvent a court injunction against the activities they had effectuated before the injunction,through one legal entity,by the creation of another entity through which they,or some of them,continue essentially the same activity.
although we largely uphold the district court contempt determinations,we will reverse its findings in regard to dave revels.revels,a principal of dcpm,was the individual who mailed out media kits to entertainment producers offering the services of the drifters.in respect to his conduct,he is like the other principals of dcpm,each of whom were properly held in contempt by the district court.our concern,rather,is with the procedure by which he was held in contempt.
revels,like the other dcpm principals,was not named in the injunction.as noted above,this itself is not a barrier to a finding of contempt.the key difference separating revels from the other dcpm principals,however,is that treadwell never actually moved for revels to be held in contempt.revels became involved in this proceeding as a witness for appellants.see marshak,wl,at noting that revels testified on behalf of appellants.in so testifying,revels revealed an involvement in the business of dcpm that led the district court to include him among the parties held in contempt.
we have two concerns with the process employed by the district court.first,we are troubled by the district court failure to acknowledge that it was holding a to the proceeding liable for contempt.while there is ample authority holding that a district court may issue a finding of contempt against a,courts that do so typically acknowledge the unique status of the,and specifically note the authorities that permit such exercise of judicial power.see operation rescue,at reversing trial court of contempt by,but noting that the trial court acknowledged the status of contemnors and acknowledged the court power to hold such an individual in contempt roe operation rescue,wl,at,same,aff in relevant part,cir.although we do not presume that the district court misunderstood the step it was taking in holding revels liable for contempt,nor that it inadvertently considered revels a proper defendant,the record does not reveal any overt acknowledgment that revels status was,in fundamental respects,different than the other dcpm principals.
second,and more significantly,we reverse based on the lack of notice tendered to revels prior to the finding of contempt.treadwell initiated this contempt proceeding against some,but not all,of the principals of dcpm treadwell never moved for a finding of contempt against revels revels only appeared in this proceeding as a witness.in quinter volkswagen of america,we upheld a finding of contempt against a witness for violation of court order,cir.in that case,however,the aggrieved party specifically moved for a finding of contempt against the witness,putting him on notice of his potential liability and triggering a hearing.id.at noting that volkswagen filed a motion for sanctions against bloch after he deliberately divulged evidence placed under protective order see also latrobe steel united steelworkers of,cir civil contempt proceedings are instituted primarily on the motion of the plaintiff.this is no trivial detail.due process requires that a potential contemnor be given notice and a hearing regardless of whether the contempt is civil or criminal in nature.newton,cir citing in re grand jury proceedings,cir harris city of philadelphia,cir noting that before a district court may issue a finding of contempt for failure to obey a court order,it is appropriate to give notice by an order to show cause and to hold a hearing roe operation rescue,cir noting that due process requires,before imposition of a finding of civil contempt,an opportunity granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.see max seafood cafe ex rel,quinteros,dist.lexis,at,refusing to issue finding of contempt against because only appeared as a witness and was not represented by counsel at the hearing,rev on other grounds.these customary procedural safeguards ensure that the parties or their attorneys have an opportunity to explain the conduct deemed deficient before the fine is imposed and that a record will be available to facilitate appellate review.newton,at citing eash riggins trucking,cir en banc.
although revels was intimately involved in dcpm activities,he was never made a target of the contempt proceedings he was deliberately excluded from treadwell initial motion,and treadwell never subsequently moved to include him,even after his testimony evinced potentially contemptuous behavior.as a result,revels never obtained counsel or otherwise sought to defend himself within the proceedings or received a separate hearing.we do not question a district court ability,in certain circumstances,to issue findings of contempt sua sponte.see,in re grand jury proceedings,at there is general agreement that due process requires that a potential contemnor be given notice and a hearing regardless of whether the contempt is civil or criminal in nature,unless the contempt is committed in open court and tends to demoralize the court authority,in which case punishment can be imposed summarily.citing inter alia in re oliver.noting that courts have long exercised a power summarily to punish certain conduct committed in open court without notice,testimony or hearing.however,on the facts of this case,it was inappropriate to hold revels in contempt without notice and a hearing 
finally,we address the issue of remedies.in its september,liability opinion discussed above,the district court did not address the issue of decision held appellants in contempt,but remained silent on damages.following the entry of the decision on liability,treadwell submitted a draft order to the district court recommending a full accounting,treble damages,attorneys fees and costs,and an inclusion of live gold operations dcpm new name as a defendant.appellants responded by informing the court that they wished to move for reconsideration of the merits of the liability opinion,and thus requested that the court hold off on entering any supplementary order on remedies until the reconsideration motion had been decided.they filed this reconsideration motion on september.the district court apparently rejected appellants request,however,as it signed the proposed supplementary order on september,supplementary order without a hearing or a substantive response by appellants.appellants promptly amended their motion to request reconsideration of both the september,order and opinion and the september,supplementary order.
on february,the district court issued its reconsideration opinion.marshak,wl.this opinion,as noted above,acknowledged certain factual mistakes regarding the timing of the formation of dcpm,but stated that those errors did not affect the court controlling findings and conclusions of law as expressed in the september,opinion and order.id.at.accordingly,the liability portions of the court september,opinion and order were left undisturbed.the district court did,however,use the reconsideration opinion as an opportunity to alter the remedies provided for in the september,supplementary order.the court acknowledged that the supplementary order had been entered without a hearing or a formal response from appellants,and thus treated the portion of the reconsideration motion addressing remedies as a full scale opposition to the relief accorded by the supplementary order,brushing away the usual limitations imposed upon a motion for reconsideration.id.at.in a sense,the court wound back the clock,and contemplated anew the issue of remedies as if the supplementary order had never been issued.
reassessing the issue of remedies,the court removed the mandated accounting and treble damages,leaving in place only the attorneys fees.although the district court acknowledged that certain factors supported an accounting of profits,it decided against imposing such a remedy.the district court was less equivocal in its decision to remove the treble damages,stating that treble damages would be an unjustified windfall for treadwell,and would not have been appropriate even if an accounting had been ordered.id.at.the only remedy left standing was the attorneys fees,which the court deemed justified to cover treadwell costs in securing the adjudication of contempt.
as in our discussion of the district court decision on liability,we review the sanctions imposed by the district court for abuse of discretion.robin woods woods,cir the standard of our review of a district court sanction for civil contempt is whether the district court abused its wide discretion in fashioning a remedy.quoting.valley citizens council pennsylvania,cir.here,however,we find that the district court did abuse its discretion in refusing to impose any remedy other than attorneys fees.
sanctions for civil contempt serve two purposes to coerce the defendant into compliance with the court order and to compensate for losses sustained by the disobedience.robin woods,at quoting mcdonald victory,cir.compensatory awards seek to ensure that the innocent party gets the benefit of the injunction id.
in the original iteration of this case,judge politan ordered fairly substantial remedies.after holding that marshak had violated treadwell common law rights,see marshak,d,judge politan issued a separate order on remedies,holding that marshak infringement warranted a comprehensive injunction,a full accounting of profits,and reasonable attorneys fees,marshak.these remedies comported with the relevant provisions of the lanham act subject to the principles of equity,treadwell was entitled to recover marshak profits,any damages she suffered,the costs of the action,and,upon a showing of exceptional circumstances,attorneys fees.a detailing remedies available to plaintiffs establishing violations under a 
nearly a decade later,the same parties were back in time in front of judge debevoise.we have already addressed in detail what happened in the years between judge politan injunction and judge debevoise finding of contempt marshak family members and associates continued engaging in essentially the same business that they operated prior to the injunction,only this time without marshak as the acknowledged ringleader.the district court summed up their behavior succinctly in its liability opinion 
marshak,the motion respondents,and davis have violated the letter,as well as the spirit and intent,of judge politan injunction by engaging in an elaborate shell game through their creation of various business identities in an attempt to deceive treadwell and the court.all of them were aware of the injunction,but all of them benefitted financially from their violation of the injunction because the coasters,the platters,and the drifters,when packaged together,make more money for them.prior to the injunction the drifters,the coasters,and the platters performed at the sahara in las vegas through the efforts of marshak and the servants,employees,and agents of marshak company,paula,revels,mehlich,and davis.after the injunction,the elsbeary hobbs drifters resumed performing with the coasters and the platters at the las vegas sahara,through the active efforts of marshak,andrea,paula,revels,mehlich,and davis.each of them has continued to sell,promote and advertise the drifters through their own company,dcpm,and through the company formed exclusively for this purpose by barry singer and mehlich,singer management.their efforts continued after the court of appeals affirmed the district court order,in spite of their declarations to the contrary.
marshak,wl,at.despite laying out the evidence of this infringing describing it as an elaborate shell game crafted to evade the district court imposed remedies far less severe than those issued by judge politan.marshak and his associates were sanctioned for violating the court injunction,but were permitted by the court to keep whatever profits they gained as a result of their disregard for judge politan injunction.this,we believe,was an abuse of discretion.
the district court offered two reasons for declining to impose an accounting of profits first,because treadwell had not established that she suffered actual damages,and second,and more important ly,because treadwell waited five years before commencing the contempt action.marshak,wl,at.we will address these reasons in turn.
we have held that an accounting of an infringer profits is available if the defendant is unjustly enriched,if the plaintiff has sustained damages,or if an accounting is necessary to deter infringement.banjo buddies,renosky,cir emphasis added.in so holding,we have emphasized the or in this that because t hese rationales are stated disjunctively any one will do.id.at.accordingly,treadwell did not need to establish actual damages to justify the imposition of an accounting of she needed only to show that an accounting was necessary to deter infringement or that marshak and his associates were unjustly enriched.we think treadwell easily satisfies this standard.
the record and the district court opinion are quite clear that the initial injunction and accompanying remedies did not deter the subsequent infringement by marshak and his associates.to the contrary,to quote the district court,appellants engaged in an elaborate shell game to evade the restrictions of the injunction,and continued operating as they did prior to the court order.marshak,wl,at see,at noting that intent and wilfulness are not necessary elements of civil contempt,but are relevant regarding the extent of the sanction to be imposed.given that the injunction imposed by judge politan did not have the desired effect,and given that the district court made specific findings attesting to appellants efforts to avoid that injunction,we see little basis for limiting treadwell remedies to the imposition of attorneys fees.see banjo buddies,at noting that permitting an infringer to retain the profits from his or her infringement would not serve the congressional purpose of making infringement unprofitable.
we believe that limiting treadwell remedies to mere attorneys fees would result in the perversity of imposing less demanding remedies on appellants after the finding of contempt than were imposed before the finding of contempt.compare marshak,imposing injunction,accounting of profits,and attorneys fees for marshak infringement of treadwell marks with marshak,wl imposing attorneys fees for violation of previous injunction.moreover,to the extent that appellants argue that such an accounting would result in a windfall for treadwell,we believe it to be more equitable that treadwell,rather than marshak and his associates,receive the benefits of the infringement.see banjo buddies,at even if banjo buddies receives a windfall in this case it is preferable that banjo buddies rather than renosky receive the benefits of renosky infringement.the principles of deterrence would not be served by permitting marshak and his associates to keep the fruits of their contempt when they have evaded the injunction for more than half a decade.
the district court second basis for denying an more important that treadwell waited five years before commencing her action,despite knowing that marshak and his associates were using the elsbeary hobbs drifters trademark during the time period following the injunction.marshak,wl,at.the district court held that this inordinate delay barred her from entitlement to an accounting of profits.id
