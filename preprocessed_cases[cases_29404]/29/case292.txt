plaintiff maureen marder appeals the dismissal of her claims against defendants jennifer lopez,paramount pictures corporation paramount,and sony music entertainment,sony collectively,defendants.we have jurisdiction under and affirm the district court dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b.
factual and procedural background 
the movie flashdance,released in,tells the story of a woman construction worker from pittsburgh,pennsylvania who performs at night as an exotic dancer she performs an innovative form of dancing that includes a chair dance,during which she douses herself with water.her goal is to obtain formal dance training at a university.
flashdance brought in over million in domestic box office receipts for paramount.the film has remained popular since its release and it continues to be shown on television and distributed through video sales and rentals.
according to marder,the flashdance story was modeled after her life story and career as a nightclub dancer.she claims that she contributed to the creation of flashdance by providing paramount with details of her life story with the understanding that paramount would use this information to create an original screenplay.marder also claims that she conferred with writer joe eszterhas in creating the screenplay.
on december,marder signed a general release release purporting to discharge paramount,its subsidiaries,and its executives from claims arising out of the creation of the film.the release also granted paramount the right to use marder life story to create flashdance.as consideration,marder received.
in february,sony released a music video for the lopez song,i glad the video.the video featured lopez performance as a dancer and singer.according to marder,the video contains of many scenes from flashdance.the complaint alleges that paramount received money or other consideration from the licensing or other exploitation of the copyrights in the motion picture,flashdance.
marder filed a complaint with the district court on november.she asserted a claim against paramount for a declaration of her rights as a of flashdance and a of the copyright.she also claimed she was entitled to share in the revenues paramount allegedly received from sony for the licensing and exploitation of flashdance in the video.finally,she asserted claims against sony and lopez based on the lanham act,the copyright act,and the state law right of publicity and unfair competition.
defendants filed motions to dismiss marder complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss without opinion.marder appealed.
ii.standard of review 
a dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b is reviewed de novo.see decker advantage fund,cir.we must determine whether,assuming all facts and inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,it appears beyond doubt that marder can prove no set of facts to support her claims.libas carillo,cir.
generally,the scope of review on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is limited to the contents of the complaint.see warren fox family worldwide,cir.a court may consider evidence on which the complaint necessarily relies if the complaint refers to the document the document is central to the plaintiff claim and no party questions the authenticity of the copy attached to the b motion.see branch tunnell,cir,overruled on other grounds by galbraith county of santa clara,cir see also warren,at,chambers time warner,cir.the court may treat such a document as part of the complaint,and thus may assume that its contents are true for purposes of a motion to dismiss under rule b.united states ritchie,cir.
in this case,we may consider the release marder signed on december.paragraph of her complaint states marder provided only a release of claims against paramount and various individuals for conduct occurring prior to december.the release is central to her claim and all parties agree that it is appropriate for consideration.
it is not proper,however,for us to consider the letter submitted by sony purporting to confirm an agreement between sony and paramount permitting sony use of elements of flashdance in the video that letter was created after marder complaint was filed,and therefore could not possibly have been a document upon which her complaint necessarily relie d.paragraphs and of marder complaint,however,reference the existence of a licensing agreement between paramount and sony.therefore,to the extent the existence of an agreement,oral or written,is alleged in marder complaint,we will consider such an agreement.we will not,however,consider the contents of the letter itself.
iii.the general release precludes marder from asserting a copyright interest in flashdance 
both paramount and marder agree that california law applies to the interpretation of the release,as provided by the release terms.according to the california supreme court,a release is the abandonment,relinquishment or giving up of a right or claim to the person against whom it might have been demanded or enforced and its effect is to extinguish the cause of action.pellett sonotone,cal d,see also cal.in general,a written release extinguishes any obligation covered by the release terms,provided it has not been obtained by fraud,deception,misrepresentation,duress,or undue influence.skrbina fleming,th,d.
the interpretation of a release is governed by the same principles applicable to any other contractual agreement.see benedek plc santa monica,llc,th,d.the court must interpret the release so as to give effect to the parties mutual intent as it existed when they contracted.see cal.bank of the superior court,cal th,d.the parties intent should be inferred from the language of the release,so long as that language is not ambiguous or uncertain.see cal.
the release,executed on december,provides that marder releases and discharges paramount pictures corporation of and from each and every claim,demand,debt,liability,cost and expense of any kind or character which have arisen or are based in whole or in part on any matters occurring at any time prior to the date of this release.the release also states that w ithout limiting the generality of the foregoing release,marder also releases paramount from claims arising out of or in any way connected with,either directly or indirectly,any and all arrangements in connection with the preparation of screenplay material and the production,filming and exploitation of flashdance.
the release language is exceptionally broad and we hold that it is fatal to each of marder claims against paramount.such a release of each and every claim covers all claims within the scope of the language,absent extrinsic evidence to the contrary.jefferson cal.dep of youth,cal th,d.as described in greater detail below,marder has offered no such extrinsic evidence.accordingly,the law imputes to marder an intention corresponding to the reasonable meaning of her words and acts.id.quoting edwards comstock ins,d.here,marder released a broad array of claims relating to any assistance she provided during the creation of a hollywood movie.thus,the only reasonable interpretation of the release is that it encompasses the various copyright claims she asserts in the instant suit.
furthermore,though in hindsight the agreement appears to be unfair to only received in exchange for a release of all claims relating to a movie that grossed over is simply no evidence that her consent was obtained by fraud,deception,misrepresentation,duress,or undue influence.indeed,when she signed the release,marder was represented by counsel.she has not asserted that her counsel in was incompetent or deficient in any way.accordingly,we hold that enforcing the release by dismissing the claims against paramount would not defeat the reasonable expectations of the parties to the contract.paralift,superior court,th,d.
despite the breadth of the release,marder maintains that it does not preclude her causes of action against paramount because she retained and rights even after she and paramount executed the release.first,she claims that the section of the release relating to any matters occurring prior to the date of the release only applies to actionable conduct occurring before the release.second,she claims that the release reference to arrangements in connection with the preparation of flashdance does not include her contributions to the writing of the film screenplay.third,she contends that paramount interpretation of the agreement is impermissibly redundant because that interpretation reads the release to simultaneously grant paramount the right to use marder life story while releasing paramount from any related claims.finally,marder claims that paramount actions after the release execution support her belief that she retained rights after the date of the release.
any matters 
marder recognizes that the release absolves paramount from claims based in whole or in part upon any matters occurring at any time prior to the date of the release.in its motion to dismiss,paramount stated that this clause encompasses the current copyright claims brought by marder in connection with flashdance.marder contends,however,that the word matters is ambiguous,and that it could reasonably be interpreted more narrowly than paramount construes it.marder makes two arguments in support of her claim.
first,she says that the release does not expressly refer to her status as a of the copyright or to her alleged writing contributions.she notes,additionally,that the release does not explicitly mention copyright claims at all.therefore,she claims that the release does not preclude her from asserting a or copyright interest in the work.
this argument contravenes the plain language of the release,which states that marder released paramount from each and every claim of any kind or character.as stated above,marder knew that she was releasing her rights related to the creation of a movie at the time she signed the release.thus,it is reasonable to infer that when marder signed the agreement,she knew or should have known that copyright claims would fall within the scope of that broad language.jefferson,d,at.
second,marder claims that the word matters is susceptible to a narrower interpretation as actionable conduct.according to marder,the actionable conduct here was the alleged infringement by sony and lopez in,which occurred long after the date of execution of the release.therefore,marder alleges that her claims are not precluded because the release only applies to matters occurring prior to the date of the release.
admittedly,the word matter has a specialized legal definition a subject under consideration,especially involving a dispute or litigation case.black law dictionary ed.but courts should interpret the words of a contract in their ordinary and popular sense,rather than according to their strict legal meaning,unless the parties attach a special or technical meaning.cal.emphasis added.as paramount points out,the common definition of the word matters also includes the events or circumstances of a particular situation.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary ed.
we read the release to suggest that the parties did not intend matters to be interpreted in a strictly legal sense.the release actually encourages a broad reading of matters,because it encompasses claims that are based in whole or in part upon any matters occurring prior to the date of the release.marder present copyright claims are rooted in the contributions she made to the screenplay before the execution of the release.thus,her claims are based at least in part on matters that occurred prior to the date of the release 
any and all arrangements 
next,marder claims that the release of any claims relating to any and all arrangements does not apply to claims relating to her alleged writing contributions.the language at issue immediately follows the release of claims related to any matters discussed above,and states,in relevant part 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing release,marder hereby releases and discharges paramount from each and every claim heretofore or hereafter arising out of or in any way connected with,either directly or indirectly,any and all arrangements including but not limited to research,interviews,costumes,photographic sessions,assistance,services and technical advice of any kind in connection with the preparation of screenplay material and the production,filming and exploitation of the motion picture tentatively entitled flashdance 
emphasis added.marder states that this portion of the release only applies to a specific set of ancillary services that she provided during the movie creation,including arranging interviews and photo shoots with other dancers.according to marder,those services did not include any of her writing contributions to the screenplays.therefore,she alleges that the release of claims relating to arrangements can not include any claims in the instant suit,which are based solely on her writing contributions.
marder reading of the release relating to arrangements is strained.here,arrangements is followed by an explanatory parenthetical that lists examples of services marder might have performed,including but not limited to research,interviews,costumes,photographic sessions,assistance,services and technical advice of any kind.marder released paramount from claims relating to services including but not limited to those listed in the parenthetical.thus,we believe that any writing contributions she made in connection with the screenplay were included in the category of arrangements.more importantly,the language of the release states that paramount is released from any and all arrangements in connection with the preparation of screenplay material.emphasis added.a plain construction of preparation of screenplay material necessarily includes any of marder alleged writing contributions to the screenplay.we therefore hold that the release of claims relating to any and all arrangements necessarily includes marder writing contributions 
whether release of claims and grant of rights is redundant 
paramount construes the language of the release to preclude all of marder claims against paramount while simultaneously granting paramount the right to use marder life story in flashdance.marder contends that this construction of the release is untenable because if the agreement truly released paramount from all claims by marder,it would be redundant for paramount to secure a specific grant of rights to use her life story.in support of her claim,she quotes the general proposition that a contract must be interpreted as a whole,with each clause aiding the interpretation in the attempt to give purpose to every part,and the interpretation should,where possible,give effect to every part so that no clause is redundant.super motel assocs.wang,th,d.thus,according to marder,we should not construe the release to permit such a redundancy.
marder contention on this point also lacks merit.it is not impermissibly redundant to secure a waiver of claims and a grant of rights in the same document.as paramount points out,it is generally recommended that a party seeking to acquire life story rights for use in a motion picture include both clauses in such an agreement.see jay kenoff,entm t indus.contracts form donald farber,matthew bender.furthermore,a release from claims and a grant of rights together are not redundant.a release extinguishes claims against the released party.see skrbina,d at.by contrast,a grant is an agreement that creates a right.see black law dictionary ed.parties may include both provisions in a contract without undermining the effect of either the grant or the release.
here,paramount secured a release from claims relating to marder involvement with the creation of flashdance.by the same document,marder granted paramount the right to use her life story in connection with flashdance.these two clauses do not negate each other and each may be considered without concern for impermissible redundancy.
marder claims that after the release was executed,paramount approached her seeking her permission to make a sequel to flashdance.marder asserts that paramount request for sequel rights reveals paramount belief that marder retained ownership rights after
