the platters the legendary name of one of the most successful vocal performing groups of the lives on.with singles on the billboard hot list,the names of the platters hits ironically foreshadowed decades of litigation great pretender,smoke gets in your eyes,only you,and to each his own.larry marshak and his company florida entertainment management,collectively marshak challenge the district court preliminary injunction in favor of herb reed enterprises hre,enjoining marshak from using the the platters mark in connection with any vocal group with narrow exceptions.we consider an issue of first impression in our circuit whether the likelihood of irreparable harm must be established rather than presumed,as under prior ninth circuit precedent by a plaintiff seeking injunctive relief in the trademark context.in light of supreme court precedent,the answer is yes,and we reverse the district court order granting the preliminary injunction.
background 
the platters vocal group was formed in,with herb reed as one of its founders.paul robi,david lynch,zola taylor,and tony williams,though not founders,have come to be recognized as the other original band members.the group became a global sensation during the latter half of the then broke up in the as the original members left one by one.after the break up,each member continued to perform under some derivation of the name the platters.marshak reed,cv ng mlo,wl,at and,marshak i.
litigation has been the byproduct of the band dissolution there have been multiple legal disputes among the original members and their current and former managers over ownership of the platters mark.much of the litigation stemmed from employment contracts executed in between the original members and five platters,fpi,the company belonging to buck ram,who became the group manager in.as part of the contracts,each member assigned to fpi any rights in the name the platters in exchange for shares of fpi stock.marshak i,wl,at.according to marshak,fpi later transferred its rights to the mark to live gold,which in turn transferred the rights to marshak in.litigation over the validity of the contracts and ownership of the mark left a trail of conflicting decisions in various jurisdictions,which provide the backdrop for the present controversy.what follows is a brief summary of the tangled web of multi jurisdictional litigation that spans more than four decades.
in,fpi sued robi and taylor for trademark infringement in california,resulting in a judgment in robi favor,which held that fpi was a sham used by ram to obtain ownership of the name platters.robi five platters,cir robi i quoting the decision.by contrast,an analogous dispute between fpi and williams in new york resulted in a decision holding that fpi had lawfully acquired exclusive ownership of the name.marshak i,wl,at citing the decision.williams attempted to circumvent the new york decision by seeking declaratory judgment in the central district of california based on the judgment in favor of robi.he was ultimately unsuccessful on appeal,we reasoned that williams could not avoid the claim preclusive effect of the new york judgment by relying on issue preclusion from another case in which he was not a party.robi i,at.we upheld the judgment in favor of robi,id.at,and later affirmed the district court award of compensatory and punitive damages to robi as well as its cancellation of fpi three registered trademarks using the words the platters.robi five platters,cir robi ii.
in,fpi sued reed for trademark infringement in the southern district of florida.marshak i,wl,at.the court denied reed motion for summary judgment based on the preclusive effect of the california judgment against fpi.id.preferring to avoid trial,reed signed a stipulation of settlement in,under which he assigned to fpi all rights he had in fpi stock,retained the right to perform as herb reed and the platters,and agreed not to perform under the name the platters.however,the settlement included an escape clause 
in the event that a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final order with all appeals being exhausted that provides that the five platters,has no right in the name the platters,then nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit herbert reed rights in the name the platters and this agreement shall not inure to any party other than the five platters,and its successors and assigns or herbert reed.
a key question is whether the escape clause has now been triggered.
in,marshak,fpi,and other plaintiffs sued reed and others for trademark infringement in the eastern district of new york reed counterclaimed,also alleging trademark infringement.marshak i,wl,at.the court interpreted the settlement as barr ing reed from asserting that he has any right to the name the platters as against fpi or those claiming through fpi except as specifically allowed in that agreement,or from otherwise interfering with plaintiffs rights to the use of the platters.id.at.the court determined that the settlement escape clause had not been triggered either by robi i,because the ninth circuit reversed the judgment in favor of williams indicating that fpi still had some rights to the platters mark,or by robi ii,because cancellation of fpi federal mark registration did not resolve the question whether fpi was entitled to use the name the platters.id.at.the district court enjoined reed from,among other things,interfering with fpi and marshak use of the name the platters except as permitted in the settlement the injunction.id.at.the second circuit affirmed.marshak reed,app x cir.
reed appealed marshak i a second time on the basis that an unpublished ninth circuit memorandum issued around the same time triggered the settlement escape clause the second circuit vacated and remanded marshak i,marshak reed,app x cir,but later affirmed the district court decision to adhere to its earlier decisions because the ninth circuit memorandum left open the possibility,however remote,that fpi can establish a common law trademark right to the name the platters.marshak ii,d at,aff,marshak reed,app x cir.
hre,which manages reed business affairs and holds his rights,sued fpi and other defendants for trademark infringement in the district of nevada in.to get around the restrictions in the settlement,hre creatively alleged that it owned the herb reed and the platters mark and that defendants used a confusingly similar mark,namely the platters.herb reed,bennett,cv jcm rjj,wl,at.fpi was not represented according to marshak,fpi was by this time a defunct corporation that had already transferred and no longer owned any rights to the platters mark.the action resulted in a default judgment and permanent injunction declaring that fpi never used the mark the platters in a manner that was not false and misleading and thus never acquired common law rights to the mark,and reed,having first used the mark the platters in commerce in,and having continuously used the mark in commerce since then has superior rights to the mark to all others,including fpi and anyone claiming rights from or through fpi.herb reed,monroe powell platters,llc,d,quoting the judgment.
in,hre successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against monroe powell,fpi former performer employee,and his company in a trademark infringement action in the district of nevada.id.at.because powell claimed to have acquired rights to the platters mark through fpi,there was a question as to whether the settlement limited reed ability to pursue a remedy.the district court held that,even assuming that the stipulation applies,the escape clause has been triggered and no longer bars reed from suing fpi or those claiming through fpi for trademark infringement.id.at.the court reasoned that the nevada default judgment,which determined that fpi has no right in the name the platters as required by the stipulation,was a final order with all appeals being exhausted because the judgment was never appealed.id.at quoting the judgment.
in the period between the filing of the two nevada actions,marshak sued reed for civil contempt in the eastern district of new york,alleging that reed first nevada lawsuit violated the injunction.marshak reed,cv ng rml,cv ng rml,wl.the court denied marshak motion,holding that neither reed use of the mark herb reed and the platters nor reed suit in nevada protecting that mark constituted a violation of the injunction.id.at.
last year brought yet another lawsuit.hre commenced the present litigation in against marshak in the district of nevada,alleging trademark infringement and seeking a preliminary injunction against marshak continued use of the platters mark.the district court held that hre was not precluded from asserting a right in the platters mark either by the settlement the escape clause of which had been triggered by the nevada default judgment or by the equitable doctrine of laches.herb reed,llc.entm t,cv mmd gwf,wl,at.the district court found that hre had established a likelihood of success on the merits,a likelihood of irreparable harm,a balance of hardships in its favor,and that a preliminary injunction would serve public interest.id.at.accordingly,the district court granted the preliminary injunction and set the bond at.id.at.marshak now appeals from the preliminary injunction.
res junicata 
as an initial matter,we address whether hre is foreclosed from bringing the underlying suit by the new york actions,marshak i and marshak ii,which resulted in the injunction barring reed from interfering with marshak use of the platters mark except as permitted by the settlement.the district court correctly held that the new york actions do not have res judicata effect.
this action is neither barred by claim preclusion,which prohibits the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in an action resulting in a final judgment on the merits,federated department stores,moitie,nor by issue preclusion,which prohibits successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,new hampshire maine,u.hre is not relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in the new york actions because hre could not assert its right in the platters name at that time.as the injunction confirmed,herb reed was then bound by the settlement,and the escape clause had not yet been triggered.additionally,the new york actions did not come to a final judgment on the merits of the trademark dispute.instead,the eastern district of new york enjoined reed from pursuing that litigation on the merits because of the settlement.the new york cases thus do not have res judicata effect on either the issue of whether the much later nevada actions triggered the escape clause,or the issue of trademark ownership,both of which relate to this appeal.
marshak quibbles with the district court reliance on the res judicata effect of the nevada actions the default judgment against fpi and the preliminary injunction against powell.but the district court explicitly declined to use the default judgment as offensive collateral estoppel against marshak on the issue of trademark ownership.hre,wl,at.while the district court referenced the last in time rule to resolve any contradiction between the new york actions and the nevada actions as to whether the settlement escape clause has been triggered,hre,wl,at,such reliance was unnecessary.the language of the escape clause itself is sufficient and does not limit the type of action or who may bring an action that ultimately results in a final order with all appeals being exhausted that provides that fpi has no right in the name the platters.thus,marshak complaint that he was not a party to the default judgment has no traction.given that there is now a valid judgment with all appeals exhausted declaring that fpi never acquired common law rights to the platters mark,the escape clause has been triggered on its own terms,and hre is no longer bound by the settlement restrictions or the injunction enforcing the settlement.
next,we consider whether hre is barred from challenging marshak use of the platters mark by laches an equitable time limitation on a party right to bring suit,resting on the maxim that one who seeks the help of a court of equity must not sleep on his rights.jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the district court properly determined that laches does not foreclose this suit.
the time gap from when hre knew or should have known about its potential cause of action to when it filed its action was not long enough to be unreasonable.id.at.hre could not bring the trademark infringement suit until there was a final ruling with all appeals exhausted that triggered the escape clause.that ruling came in the nevada default judgment in may hre brought this action in april,less than a year after the escape clause was triggered,and less than one month after the eastern district of new york determined that hre had not violated that court injunction.hre,wl,at.this delay of under one year is shorter than the most analogous state statute of limitations period,giving rise to a strong presumption against laches.jarrow formulas,at w e hold that if a lanham act a claim is filed within the analogous state limitations period,the strong presumption is that laches is inapplicable.marshak agrees that the limitations period from the most analogous action under state law is three years under nevada fraud and catchall statute of limitations.because hre brought its trademark infringement claim well within three years,we presume that laches is inapplicable.hre simply did not dally or unconscionably sit on its claim.thus,laches does not preclude consideration of hre trademark infringement claim and request for preliminary injunction.
iii.preliminary injunction 
to obtain a preliminary injunction,hre must establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits,that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in its favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council.we review a district court preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,a standard of review that is limited and deferential.johnson couturier,cir.if the district court identified and applied the correct legal rule to the relief requested,we will reverse only if the court decision resulted from a factual finding that was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.united states hinkson,cir en banc.
marshak key arguments are that the district court erred in concluding that hre had established a likelihood of success on the merits because reed abandoned the platters mark and that the district court erred in finding a likelihood of irreparable harm.
likelihood of success on the underlying trademark dispute 
as to its trademark infringement claim,to establish a likelihood of success on the merits hre must show that it is the owner of a valid,protectable mark,and that the alleged infringer is using a confusingly similar mark.grocery outlet,albertson,cir per curiam.tellingly,marshak does not challenge the district court conclusions on these two points except by asserting the affirmative defense of abandonment on the alleged basis that reed abandoned the platters mark by signing the florida settlement.but a bandonment of a trademark,being in the nature of a forfeiture,must be strictly proved.prudential ins.of am.gibraltar fin.of,cir.the district court did not err in concluding that marshak failed to meet that burden.
marshak has not established either of the two requirements of abandonment under discontinuance of trademark use,and intent not to resume use.although for three consecutive years constitutes prima facie evidence of abandonment,the standard for is high.id.requires complete cessation or discontinuance of trademark use,where use signifies any use in commerce and includes the placement of a mark on goods sold or transported.electro source,llc brandess kalt aetna,cir emphasis in original.even a single instance of use is sufficient against a claim of abandonment of a mark if such use is made in good faith.carter wallace,proctor gamble co,cir.
