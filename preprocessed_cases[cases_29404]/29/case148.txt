rose wilcher,a producer of public access programming,claims that time warner cable rules for submitting public access programs violate her first amendment right of free speech.the specific regulations she challenges are a fee for each tape submitted for broadcast on time warner public access channel and a requirement that the person submitting the program live in the geographic area receiving time warner akron,cable service.because wilcher is unable to show that the actions of time warner,a private party,constitute state action or that the regulations approved by the city violate her first amendment rights,we affirm the district court dismissal of her complaint.
pursuant to its franchise agreement with the municipal government of akron,ohio,time warner cable northeast is obligated to provide at least one community service channel,also known as a public access channel,that is available to broadcast programming submitted by members of the community.in the agreement,time warner reserved the right to promulgate rules and regulations for the channel but before new rules can become effective,they are subject to approval of the akron public utilities commissioner,whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
from the agreement inception in until,time warner did not charge a fee when members of the public submitted tapes to be broadcast on the public access channel,nor did the cable company the tapes before airing them.according to wilcher complaint,in,citizens began complaining about sexually explicit material on the public access channel 
in december,time warner proposed new regulations for the public access channel.most notably,an administration fee of per program would apply to each tape submitted for broadcast and only residents of akron and surrounding communities would be allowed to submit programs.pursuant to the franchise agreement,time warner submitted the rule changes to the city.since the city did not have an acting public utilities commissioner,mayor don plusquellic approved the new regulations on behalf of the city.
rose wilcher is a resident of akron,who has been producing a substantial amount of programming for time warner public access channel since march.as of early,wilcher had reserved approximately hours per week of broadcasting time on the akron public access channel.on april,the day the new regulations took effect,wilcher applied for a temporary restraining order to enjoin time warner from enforcing the fee.after a telephone hearing,the district court denied the application,concluding that the fee was neutral on its face.wilcher then moved for a preliminary injunction,which was the subject of a hearing on april.following the hearing,the magistrate judge recommended denying the motion because time warner was not a state actor.the plaintiff did not object to the recommendation,and the district court adopted it.
in september,wilcher filed an amended complaint restating her first amendment challenges to the fee and residency requirement,and naming time warner,the city of akron and mayor plusquellic as defendants.in separate rulings,the district court granted the motions of time warner and the city including the mayor to dismiss wilcher claims because the complaint failed to allege facts showing state action.in granting the city motion,the court acknowledged that the city is a state actor,but held that the mere approval of time warner rule changes was not sufficient state action to trigger first amendment scrutiny of the cable company actions.
wilcher responses to the defendants motions to dismiss also asserted that the first amendment should apply to the public access channel because it is a public forum.the district court did not specifically address this argument in its decisions,and wilcher raises it again here.
ii.state action 
it is undisputed that first amendment protections are triggered only in the presence of state action.a private party,acting on its own,can not ordinarily be said to deprive a citizen of her right to free speech.in pressing her claim against time warner,wilcher is unable to cite any cases where a court has held a cable operator to be a state actor under the first amendment or any other constitutional provision.instead,she argues that time warner should be considered a state actor under the state action test employed by this court.
a private entity,such as time warner,can be held to constitutional standards when its actions so approximate state action that they may be fairly attributable to the state.lansing city of memphis,cir.in order to test whether private action is fairly attributable to the state,our court,following supreme court precedent,has applied three tests the public function test the state compulsion test and the symbiotic relationship or nexus test.id.a plaintiff need only show state action under one of the tests in order to proceed with her claim.
the public function test requires that the private entity exercise powers which are traditionally exclusively reserved to the state,such as holding elections or eminent domain.wolotsky huhn,cir.this particular test is derived from the supreme court holding in jackson metropolitan edison company,d,that the provision of electric utility services is not a power reserved exclusively to the state.wilcher argues that control of a public access channel should be considered a public function because in some communities but not in akron a local government official manages the public access outlet.
to support this assertion,she cites a report showing a government official managing the public access channel in out of communities surveyed.the fact that a government official managed public access broadcasting in slightly less than of communities surveyed fifteen years ago is not sufficient to meet the relatively stiff test applied by the supreme court in metropolitan edison.tv service is not a traditional service of local government.a service provided by a distinct minority of local governments can not fairly be characterized as a function traditionally reserved to the state.
the state compulsion test requires that the state exercise such coercive power or provide such significant encouragement,either overt or covert,that in law the choice of the private actor is deemed to be that of the state.wolotsky,at.although the franchise agreement provides for a public access channel,wilcher does not allege that city officials coerced or encouraged time warner to change the rules for submitting broadcasts to its public access channel.instead,she avers that members of the public complained about indecent programming on the channel to both time warner and city officials,and that the cable company responded by proposing changes to the channel regulations.the allegation that city officials were concerned about sexually explicit programming on the channel is not sufficient to trigger state actor status.further,time warner,as a private party,is free to respond to complaints from members of the public without triggering state actor scrutiny.wilcher does not even allege that city officials coerced time warner into proposing the new regulations she,therefore,can not establish state action under the state compulsion test.we note here that our holding is limited to the facts alleged in this case.we do not hold that a cable operator could never be held a state actor under the state compulsion test,only that in order to support such a theory,a plaintiff must allege and prove that state officials coerced or participated in the company to the extent required to trigger state actor status.
under the symbiotic relationship test,the action of a private party constitutes state action where there is a sufficiently close nexus between the state and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the state itself.wolotsky,at.the supreme court has cautioned that there is no readily applicable formula for finding such a close nexus divining such a close relationship can only be accomplished in the framework of the peculiar facts or circumstances present.burton wilmington parking,d.wilcher argues that the facts alleged he
