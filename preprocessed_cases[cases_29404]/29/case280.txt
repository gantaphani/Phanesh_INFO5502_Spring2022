this case requires us to determine how the copyright act,applies to karaoke devices that enable individuals to sing along to recordings of musical compositions,which is a matter of first impression in this circuit.in the district court,leadsinger,a karaoke device manufacturer,filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against music publishers,bmg music publishing and zomba enterprises,bmg.leadsinger sought a declaration that it is entitled to print or display song lyrics in real time with song recordings as long as it obtains a compulsory mechanical license under,or that it is entitled to do so under the fair use doctrine.the district court dismissed the complaint without leave to amend for failure to state a claim.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
karaoke devices necessarily involve copyrighted works because both musical compositions and their accompanying song lyrics are essential to their operation.bmg owns or administers copyrights in musical compositions and through its licensing agent,the harry fox agency,has issued to leadsinger compulsory mechanical licenses to copyrighted musical compositions under of the copyright act.in addition to the mechanical fee required to secure a compulsory license,bmg has demanded that leadsinger and other karaoke companies pay a lyric reprint fee and a synchronization fee.leadsinger has refused to pay these additional fees and filed for declaratory judgment to resolve whether it has the right to visually display song lyrics in real time with song recordings,as well as print song lyrics,without holding anything more than the compulsory licenses it already possesses.
in its complaint,leadsinger describes the karaoke device it manufactures as an microphone player that has recorded songs imbedded in a microchip in the microphone.when the microphone is plugged into a television,the lyrics of the song appear on the television screen in real time as the song is playing,enabling the consumer to sing along with the lyrics.though most karaoke companies put their recordings on cassettes,compact discs,or use a compact disc graphic or dvd format,these other karaoke devices,much like leadsinger,display lyrics visually when played in a device that is connected to a television.
leadsinger device sometimes displays licensed reproductions of still photographs as a background for the onscreen lyrics.and,on occasion,leadsinger includes with the device a printed copy of the lyrics to the songs recorded on the microchip.according to leadsinger complaint,the purpose of both the printed and visually displayed song lyrics is to facilitate the customer ability to read the lyrics sing along with the recorded music.leadsinger further claims that both in and outside the karaoke context,the inclusion of printed lyrics assists buyers in understanding song lyrics and enables parents to control the lyrical content that children are exposed to.
the district court concluded that a compulsory license does not grant leadsinger the right to display visual images and lyrics in real time with music,and that the allegations in leadsinger complaint do not support its fair use claim.leadsinger,bmg music publ g,d.the district court dismissed leadsinger complaint without leave to amend,concluding that amendment would be futile.id.at.this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
a.the copyright act 
in deciding whether the district court properly dismissed leadsinger complaint,we are guided by the language of the copyright act.section of the copyright act extends copyright protection to,among other original works of authorship,literary works,musical works including any accompanying words,and sound recordings.though grants copyright owners the exclusive right to reproduce copyrighted works in copies or phonorecords and to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale,limits copyright owners exclusive rights with respect to phonorecords.
phonorecords are defined as 
m aterial objects in which sounds,other than those accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work,are fixed by any method now known or later developed,and from which the sounds can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated,either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.the term phonorecords includes the material object in which the sounds are first fixed.
emphasis added.section subjects phonorecords to a compulsory licensing scheme that authorizes any person who complies with its provisions to obtain a license to make and distribute phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work if the work has been distributed to the public in the united states under the authority of the copyright owner and the person primary purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private use.id.a.as the definition of phonorecords indicates,audiovisual works are not phonorecords.see id.thus,compulsory licensing scheme does not apply to audiovisual works.
the copyright act defines audiovisual works as 
w orks that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines,or devices such as projectors,viewers,or electronic equipment,together with accompanying sounds,if any,regardless of the nature of the material objects,such as films or tapes,in which the works are embodied.
see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a hereinafter nimmer on copyright.though it is not explicit in the copyright act,courts have recognized a copyright holder right to control the synchronization of musical compositions with the content of audiovisual works and have required parties to obtain synchronization licenses from copyright holders.see maljack,goodtimes home video,cir recognizing the concept of synchronization rights abkco music,stellar records,cir a synchronization license is required if a copyrighted musical composition is to be used in or synchronization with an audiovisual work.citation omitted see also nimmer on copyright f a license is necessary if an existing musical composition is to be used in synchronization or with an audiovisual work.
the copyright act defines literary works as works,other than audiovisual works,expressed in words,numbers,or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia,regardless of the nature of the material objects,such as books,periodicals,manuscripts,phonorecords,film,tapes,disks,or cards,in which they are embodied.song lyrics are copyrightable as a literary work and,therefore,enjoy separate protection under the copyright act.see id.a extending copyright protection to literary works zomba,panorama records,cir abkco music,at nimmer on copyright b lyrics alone are nevertheless copyrightable as a literary work.
karaoke devices as audiovisual works 
the district court concluded that leadsinger would not be entitled,under any set of facts,to a declaration that a compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords authorizes it to display song lyrics in real time with song recordings.while our reasoning differs slightly from that of the district court,we agree with the district court conclusion.
the district court reasoned that leadsinger device falls outside of the definition of phonorecord because the device contains more than sounds.leadsinger,bmg music publ g,d,see phonorecords are material objects in which sounds,other than those accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work,are fixed.while it is true that the microchip in leadsinger device stores visual images and visual representations of lyrics in addition to sounds,the plain language of the copyright act does not expressly preclude a finding that devices on which sounds and visual images are fixed fall within the definition of phonorecords.the definition of phonorecords is explicit,however,that audiovisual works are not phonorecords and are excluded from compulsory licensing scheme.id.we need not settle upon a precise interpretation of definition of phonorecords in this case because leadsinger karaoke device meets each element of the statutory definition of audiovisual works and,therefore,can not be a phonorecord.
as stated above,of the copyright act defines audiovisual works as works consisting of a series of related images that are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines first,the visual representation of successive portions of song lyrics that leadsinger device projects onto a television screen constitutes a series of related images.though leadsinger suggests that its images of song lyrics are not related,the images bear a significant relationship when examined in context.in its complaint,leadsinger explained that the purpose of karaoke is for the consumer to sing the lyrics to a song in real time as the song is playing.to accomplish this purpose,it is necessary that the images of song lyrics be presented sequentially so as to match the accompanying music and make the lyrics readable.see nimmer on copyright b a series of slides if presented sequentially or in a related sequence will constitute an audiovisual work.
the fact that the related images are comprised of song lyrics,which constitute a literary work,does not preclude us from concluding that leadsinger device is an audiovisual work.the definition of literary works is clear that the categories of literary works and audiovisual works are not mutually exclusive.the copyright act defines literary works as works,other than audiovisual works,expressed in words regardless of the nature of the material objects,such as phonorecords,film,tapes,disks,or cards,in which they are embodied.that the definition of literary works includes the phrase other than audiovisual works,confirms that a literary work may constitute an audiovisual work if it also fulfills the definition of an audiovisual work.
second,though does not require that an audiovisual work have sound,in the case of leadsinger karaoke device,its images of successive portions of song lyrics are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machine together with accompanying sounds.id.an essential function of leadsinger device is its ability to indicate to the consumer exactly when to sing each lyric.leadsinger device is able to do so only because it utilizes a machine to project the song lyrics in real time with the accompanying music.
in abkco music,the second circuit similarly concluded that the karaoke device in that case was an audiovisual work.at.though the abkco music court failed to discuss the importance of a machine to the functioning of the karaoke device at issue,it held that the device constituted an audiovisual work,since it consist s of a series of related images the lyrics together with accompanying sounds the music.id.quoting 
to the extent it is requested,leadsinger also is not entitled to a declaration that compulsory mechanical licenses under allow it to reprint lyrics in booklets that accompany its karaoke products.as stated above,lyrics are separately copyrightable as literary works.see zomba,at abkco music,at.section covers only the right to make and distribute phonorecords.though these phonorecords may include oral renditions of song lyrics,the reproduction of song lyrics on paper is not within the scope of.see abkco music,at emi entm t world,d at noting that the defendants had reprint licenses entitling them to reprint lyrics of copyrighted songs.
we hold that leadsinger device falls within the definition of an audiovisual work.as a result,in addition to any compulsory licenses necessary to make and distribute phonorecords and reprint licenses necessary to reprint song lyrics,leadsinger is also required to secure synchronization licenses to display images of song lyrics in timed relation with recorded music.
leadsinger argues that regardless of whether its device is subject to compulsory licensing scheme,it is entitled to publish or display copyrighted song lyrics under the fair use doctrine.we agree with the district court conclusion that the allegations in leadsinger complaint do not support a finding of fair use.
the copyright act does not grant a copyright holder exclusive rights to reproduce his or her work.sony of am.universal city studios,d.section of the copyright act explains that the fair use of a copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching,scholarship,or research,is not an infringement of copyright.in determining whether the use of a copyrighted work is fair,we consider 
the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 
the nature of the copyrighted work 
the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and 
the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
id.when conducting a fair use analysis,we are not restricted to these factors rather,the analysis is a flexible one that we perform on a basis.campbell music,d citing harper row publishers,nation,d.moreover,we do not consider these factors in isolation but weigh them together,in light of the copyright law purpose to promote the progress of science and art by protecting artistic and scientific works while encouraging the development and evolution of new works.mattel,walking mountain,cir citing campbell,at.
fair use is a mixed question of law and fact,harper row publishers,at,but it is well established that a court can resolve the issue of fair use on a motion for summary judgment when no material facts are in dispute.see mattel,at citing harper row publishers,at.the posture of this case is unusual because the district court decided the fair use issue on a motion to dismiss.however,the district court resolution of the fair use issue at the motion to dismiss stage was proper.leadsinger assertion of fair use may be considered on a motion to dismiss,which requires the court to consider all allegations to be true,in a manner substantially similar to consideration of the same issue on a motion for summary judgment,when no material facts are in dispute.we hold that leadsinger allegations,when taken as true,do not support a finding of fair use.
as a preliminary matter,leadsinger does not allege that its display or printing of bmg copyrighted song lyrics are for the purpose of criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching,scholarship,or research see.while leadsinger argued on appeal that karaoke teaches singing,that allegation is not set forth in its complaint.even if the court could infer that a karaoke device has the potential to teach singing because the device allows consumers to sing along with recorded music,it is not reasonable to infer that teaching is actually the purpose of leadsinger use of the copyrighted lyrics.
with regard to the first factor under,leadsinger allegations support only a commercial use.the complaint does not allege that leadsinger use of copyrighted lyrics is transformative.see mattel,at explaining that an analysis of the purpose and character of use asks to what extent the new work transforms,rather than simply supplants,the original work,and stating that a work must add something new,with a further purpose or different character,altering the first with new expression,meaning,or message quoting campbell,at.it is reasonable to infer that leadsinger does not add to or alter the copyrighted lyrics,which would undermine the device ability to enable consumers to sing along with the recorded music.
though leadsinger alleges that its use of lyrics helps consumers to understand the song lyrics and that the words facilitate parental control over objectionable song words,the ultimate use to which the customer puts a copyrighted work is irrelevant news serv.tullo,cir see harper row publishers,at.the crux of the distinction is whether the vendor stands to profit from exploita
