the king is dead.his legacy,and those who wish to profit from it,remain very much alive.to what extent may a film maker,under the banner of fair use,incorporate video clips,photographs,and music into a biography about elvis presley without permission from the copyright owners of those materials the district court weighing the four statutory fair use factors under held that the film biographer in this case likely did not use the copyrighted materials fairly and enjoined the film maker from further distribution of its biography.we affirm.
plaintiffs are a group of companies and individuals holding copyrights in various materials relating to elvis presley.for example,plaintiff sofa entertainment,is the registered owner of several elvis appearances on the ed sullivan show.plaintiff promenade trust owns the copyright to two television specials featuring elvis the elvis comeback special and elvis aloha from hawaii.plaintiff allen family revocable living trust owns the copyright to the episode of the steve allen show that featured elvis as a guest.
plaintiffs copyright holdings extend beyond the television medium.plaintiffs jerry leiber and mike stoller are who own copyrights in many of elvis most famous songs,including jailhouse rock and hound dog.plaintiff alfred wertheimer is a professional photographer who owns numerous copyrighted photographs of elvis.
many plaintiffs are in the business of licensing their copyrights.for example,sofa entertainment charges per minute for use of elvis appearances on the ed sullivan show.
passport entertainment and its related entities collectively passport produced and sold the definitive elvis,a hour video documentary about the life of elvis presley.the definitive elvis sold for at retail.plaintiffs allege that thousands of copies were sent to retail outlets and other distributors.on its box,the definitive elvis describes itself as 
an,look at the life and career of a man whose popularity is unrivaled in the history of show business and who continues to attract millions of new fans each year.this,series is brimming with classic film clips,rare home movies,and photos 
every film and television appearance is represented in this series as well as rare footage of many of elvis tours concerts 
emphasis in original.
the biography itself is indeed exhaustive.the producers interviewed over people regarding virtually all aspects of elvis life.the documentary is divided into episodes,each with its own theme.for example,one episode is entitled the army years,whereas another the spiritual soul of elvis chronicles the religious themes of elvis life and music.
the definitive elvis uses plaintiffs copyrighted materials in a variety of ways.with the video footage,the documentary often uses shots of elvis appearing on television while a narrator or interviewee talks over the film.these clips range from only a few seconds in length to portions running as long as seconds.in some instances,the clips are the subject of audio commentary,while in other instances they would more properly be characterized as video filler because the commentator is discussing a subject different from or more general than elvis performance on a particular television show.but also significant is the frequency with which the copyrighted video footage is used.the definitive elvis employs these clips,in many instances,repeatedly.in total,at least to of the definitive elvis uses plaintiffs copyrighted materials.
use of the video footage,however,is not limited to brief clips.in several instances,the audio commentary discusses elvis appearance on a show and then,without additional,a clip is played from the show featuring elvis.for example,one excerpt from the steve allen show plays continuously for over one minute without interruption.this excerpt includes the heart of elvis famous hound dog appearance on the steve allen show.many other clips from elvis appearances on various television shows run between and seconds.
in the aggregate,the excerpts comprise a substantial portion of elvis total appearances on many of these shows.for example,almost all of elvis appearance on the steve allen show is contained in the definitive elvis.percent of his appearances on the ed sullivan show is replayed,as well as three minutes from the comeback special.
the use of plaintiffs copyrighted still photographs and music is more subtle and difficult to spot.the photographs are used in a way similar to some of the video footage the photograph is displayed as video filler while a commentator discusses a topic.the photographs are not highlighted or discussed as objects of the commentary like many of the video pieces are.finally,the songs are played both as background music and in excerpts from elvis concerts,television appearances,and movies.
plaintiffs sued passport for copyright infringement.it is undisputed that passport used plaintiffs copyrighted materials in the definitive elvis without obtaining licenses.indeed,passport had sought a license from at least one of the plaintiffs,elvis presley enterprises,but it refused passport request since it planned to release its own anthology in to commemorate the anniversary of the beginning of elvis musical career.passport,however,asserts that its use of the copyrighted materials was fair use under.
plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction,which was granted by the district court after a hearing.the district court found that passport use of plaintiffs copyrighted materials was likely not fair use.the court enjoined passport from selling or distributing the definitive elvis.passport timely appeals.

passport first argues that the preliminary injunction is unconstitutional because passport can present a plausible fair use defense commentators have suggested in such situations that a preliminary injunction might be an unconstitutional prior restraint and some cases have refused to grant preliminary injunctions based on,at least in part,first amendment principles.
we need not jump into this briar patch.we have held that first amendment concerns in copyright cases are subsumed within the fair use inquiry.in other words,if the use of the alleged infringer is not fair use,there are no first amendment prohibitions against granting a preliminary injunction.see,a m records,napster,cir uses of copyrighted material that are not fair uses are rightfully enjoined.seuss enters.penguin books usa,cir.
passport next alleges that plaintiffs delay in bringing their suit prejudiced passport after passport invested more than million in the venture,and thus injunctive relief is barred by laches.some plaintiffs learned of passport possible use of their copyrighted materials in june,but did not file their complaint until september.passport asserts that this case is similar to trust.bank putnam publishing group.
passport contentions have little merit.first,passport did not publish the definitive elvis until july.plaintiffs filed suit within two months.there was no way for plaintiffs to assess whether passport use would be fair until they saw the final product.second,as plaintiffs point out,if plaintiffs had brought suit before the work was published it might have raised a viable prior restraint argument by passport.see,globe int l,enquirer,media,wl,at.finally,passport reliance on trust.bank is unavailing.there,the plaintiffs knew the exact content of the infringing book well over two years before they brought suit.at,wl.based on that fact,as well as the substantial investment by the defendants in the interim,the district court held that the plaintiffs were barred by laches.id.at,wl.here,conversely,plaintiffs did not have knowledge of the final product produced by passport until july,and their subsequent complaint filed weeks later was not an unreasonable delay.
a preliminary injunction should be granted if a plaintiff can show either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tilt in the plaintiff favor.a m records,at.when a plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of a copyright infringement claim,irreparable harm is presumed.triad.southeastern exp,cir.the only argument passport presents to counter the irreparable harm presumption is the laches argument rejected above.therefore,this case turns on whether the district court abused its discretion when it determined that plaintiffs will probably succeed on the merits.fair use is the only issue in contention on the merits.
the fair use of a copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching including multiple copies for classroom use,scholarship,or research,is not an infringement of copyright.in determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include 
the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 
the nature of the copyrighted work 
the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and 
the effect of the use upon the potential market for and value of the copyrighted work.
this analysis should not be simplified with rules,but instead requires a analysis.los angeles news serv.cbs,cir,amended by quoting campbell acuff rose music,d.contrary to the divide and conquer approach taken by the dissent,we may not treat the factors in isolation from one another.all are to be explored,and the results weighed together,in light of the purposes of copyright.los angeles news,at.see also kelly arriba,cir.
we first address the purpose and character of passport use of plaintiffs copyrighted materials.although not controlling,the fact that a new use is commercial as opposed to weighs against a finding of fair use.harper row publishers,nation,d.and the degree to which the new user exploits the copyright for commercial gain as opposed to incidental use as part of a commercial enterprise affects the weight we afford commercial nature as a factor.see,kelly at see also harper row,at.the crux of the distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price.
more importantly for the first factor,however,is the transformative nature of the new work.campbell,at.cbs broadcasting,at.specifically,we ask whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation,or instead adds something new,with a further purpose or different character,altering the first with new expression,meaning,or message campbell,at.citation and quotation marks omitted.the more transformative a new work,the less significant other inquiries,such as commercialism,become.id.
two district courts have found that the use of film clips in biographies is transformative.in monster communications,turner broadcasting system,the district court considered whether a movie biography about muhammad ali violated the plaintiff copyrights in video footage that was used in the boxer biography for less then two minutes.the court found that the biography,while commercial,constitutes a combination of comment,criticism,scholarship and research concerning a figure of legitimate public concern and thus the purpose and character of the biography weighed in favor of fair use.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.
in hofheinz v.a e television networks,d,the court considered whether a e use of copyrighted film clips for a biography of actor peter graves was fair use.the court found that the biography was transformative because use of a movie trailer clip for a b movie was not shown to recreate the creative expression reposing in plaintiff film.id.at.the biography narrator introduced the movie clip as outdated and campy.id.at.its purpose was to enabl e the viewer to understand the actor modest beginnings in the film business.id.at.
the district court below found that the purpose and character of the definitive elvis will likely weigh against a finding of fair use.we can not say,based on this record,that the district court abused its discretion.
first,passport use,while a biography,is clearly commercial in nature.but more significantly,passport seeks to profit directly from the copyrights it uses without a license.one of the most salient selling points on the box of the definitive elvis is that every film and television appearance is represented.passport is not advertising a scholarly critique or historical analysis,but instead seeks to profit at least in part from the inherent entertainment value of elvis appearances on such shows as the steve allen show,the ed sullivan show,and the comeback special.passport claim that this is scholarly research containing biographical comments on the life of elvis is not dispositive of the fair use inquiry.
second,passport use of plaintiffs copyrights is not consistently transformative.true,passport use of many of the television clips is transformative because the clips play for only a few seconds and are used for reference purposes while a narrator talks over them or interviewees explain their context in elvis career.but do not necessarily transform a work.see news serv.kcal tv channel,cir.there must be real,substantial condensation of the materials and not merely the facile use of scissors or extracts of the essential parts,constituting the chief value of the original work.cbs,at quoting folsom marsh,cas,story.
it would be impossible to produce a biography of elvis without showing some of his most famous television appearances for reference purposes.but some of the clips are played without much interruption,if any.the purpose of showing these clips likely goes beyond merely making a reference for a biography,but instead serves the same intrinsic entertainment value that is protected by plaintiffs copyrights.
we think passport use of significant portions of the steve allen show is especially troubling.while showing a clip from these television shows is permissible to note their historical value,passport crosses the line by making more than mere references to these events and instead shows significant portions of these copyrighted materials.finally,passport does not even offer up a specific justification regarding its use of plaintiffs copyrights in still photographs and music.
this first factor is a close issue.courts have described new works as transformative when the works use copyrighted material for purposes distinct from the purpose of the original material.here,passport use of many of the television clips is transformative because they are cited as historical reference points in the life of a remarkable entertainer.the definitive elvis nature as a biography transforms the purpose of showing these clips from pure entertainment to telling part of the story of elvis life.but many of the film clips seem to be used in excess of this benign purpose,and instead are simply rebroadcast for entertainment purposes that plaintiffs rightfully own.this comes as no surprise to the viewer since the definitive elvis advertises as much on its external packaging.
we need not decide how we would resolve this factor were we to review it de novo.for our inquiry is simply whether the district court abused its discretion.the district court decision that the first factor weighs against fair use was not based on an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous factual finding.see a m records,at.
we next examine the nature of plaintiffs copyrighted works.the law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy.harper row,at.in other words,this factor calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others,with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied.campbell,at.additionally,published works are more likely to qualif
