the north carolina alcoholic beverage control commission appeals to this court a second time.the commission once again seeks relief from an order enjoining enforcement of a state statute regulating conduct on premises licensed by the commission to serve alcohol.in the first appeal,we affirmed in relevant part an order that,in response to a challenge by giovani carandola,preliminarily enjoined a predecessor statute.see giovani carandola,bason,cir carandola i.the north carolina legislature then enacted a new statute.after carandola,joined by additional plaintiffs,challenged that statute,the district court permanently enjoined the enforcement of its prohibitions on simulated sexual acts and fondling of sexual organs,finding these provisions vague and overbroad in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments the court,however,refused to enjoin a prohibition on nudity,holding that it did not violate the constitution.see giovani carandola,fox,d carandola ii.the commission appeals and carandola.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and vacate in part.
carandola operates christie cabaret,an erotic dancing establishment in greensboro,north carolina,which holds commission permits to sell alcoholic beverages.on november,a commission enforcement officer witnessed erotic dancers at christie performing in a manner that violated state law.see.and admin.code when christie received a violation notice,carandola filed suit,alleging that the statute and regulation violated its first amendment rights.the district court held a hearing at which the officer who cited christie testified that general conduct violating the statute and regulation included touching one own fully clothed buttocks,breasts,or genitals while in a licensed establishment.after the hearing,the district court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the statute and the regulation on the ground that carandola would likely prevail on an overbreadth challenge.
in carandola i,we affirmed in relevant part,concluding that the statutory and regulatory restrictions swept far beyond bars and nude dancing establishments.at.we noted that the commission itself conceded that the plain language of the restrictions prohibits on licensed premises any entertainment that simulate s sexual behavior,even if performers are fully clothed or covered,and even if the conduct is integral to the example,a political satire,a shakespeare play depicting young love,or a drama depicting the horrors of rape.id.alteration in original.after careful review of the commission interpretation of the challenged restrictions,we also determined that the restrictions were not readily susceptible to a limiting construction indeed,the commission did not even suggest a possible limiting construction.id.at.accordingly,we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that carandola would likely prevail on its overbreadth challenge and thus granting a preliminary injunction.id.at.
in response to our ruling,the north carolina general assembly enacted a new statute,which provides 
a it shall be unlawful for a permittee or his agent or employee to knowingly allow or engage in any of the following kinds of conduct on his licensed premises 
any conduct or entertainment by any person whose genitals are exposed or who is wearing transparent clothing that reveals the genitals 
any conduct or entertainment that includes or simulates sexual intercourse,masturbation,sodomy,bestiality,oral copulation,flagellation,or any act that includes or simulates the penetration,however slight,by any object into the genital or anal opening of a person body or 
any conduct or entertainment that includes the fondling of the breasts,buttocks,anus,vulva,or genitals.
b shall be unlawful for a permittee to fail to superintend in person or through a manager the business for which a permit is issued.
c section does not apply to persons operating theaters,concerts halls,art centers,museums,or similar establishments that are primarily devoted to the arts or theatrical performances,when the performances that are presented are expressing matters of serious literary,artistic,scientific,or political value.
the commission then sought to vacate as moot the preliminary injunction of the old statute.although the commission had not yet enforced the new statute,carandola joined by several additional plaintiffs challenged the new statute,claiming that it too violated both the first and fourteenth amendments.at a bench trial concerning the validity of the new statute,judith hanna,an anthropologist who specializes in the communication of dance,testified on behalf of carandola that movements in dance such as those with the hips,thighs,breasts,hair,and hands have traditionally been associated with simulating sex.carandola ii,d at.the district court also considered testimony about whether sexually oriented businesses create negative secondary effects.without resolving this question,the district court held that the commission had produced sufficient evidence to support the legislative conclusion that sexually oriented businesses were associated with higher incidents of crime.id.at.
the district court then issued a detailed opinion in which it upheld subsection a,concluding that the prohibition on nudity furthered north carolina interest in reducing negative secondary effects associated with the combination of adult entertainment and alcohol.id.at.however,the court enjoined the enforcement of subsections a and a,finding them both facially vague and overbroad,and unconstitutional as applied to carandola.id.at.the commission appeals the district court determinations that subsections a and a are facially vague and overbroad,and unconstitutional as applied to carandola.carandola cross appeals,arguing that the court should have enjoined subsection a of the statute,which prohibits nudity in licensed establishments.we consider first the commission appeal,then carandola.
the commission contends that the district court erred in holding the new statute facially vague and facially overbroad.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.north carolina city of virginia beach,cir.
the commission initially argues that subsections a and a are not vague.a statute is impermissibly vague if it either fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits or authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill colorado,d.in particular,a court must ask whether the statutory prohibitions are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with.broadrick oklahoma,d quoting civil serv.comm ass of letter carriers,d.
the district court invalidated subsection a prohibiting in licensed establishments conduct that simulates sexual intercourse,masturbation,sodomy,bestiality,oral copulation,flagellation,or any act that includes or simulates the penetration by any object into the genital or anal opening because it found the word simulates vague.for example,the court feared that prohibiting simulate d sexual intercourse would preclude entertainers from gyrating their hips on stage in a rapid motion.carandola ii,d at.
however,the dictionary precisely defines simulate as a verb meaning to make a pretense of feign or to assume or have the appearance or characteristics of.webster new universal unabridged dictionary.the supreme court and many other courts have held that the word simulate is sufficiently clear when used in similar statutory prohibitions.see,new york ferber,d holding that a statute defining forbidden content,in part,as actual or simulated sexual intercourse sufficiently describes the prohibited material miller california,d noting that ultimate sexual acts whether actual or simulated constitute a plain example of what a state statute could define for regulation as obscene united states adams,cir upholding against vagueness challenge a statute prohibiting the possession of materials depicting a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct,which includes simulated acts farkas miller,cir upholding against vagueness challenge a statute prohibiting the actual or simulated public performance of any sex act because p ersons of ordinary intelligence would not be confused as to the meaning of the term simulated sex act.indeed,carandola fails to cite,and we have not found,a case in which any court has held simulate vague in a similar context.
we too conclude that in context simulate is sufficiently precise to notify persons of ordinary intelligence of the conduct prohibited by the statute and to prevent the risk of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.as the commission notes,t here is a distinct and very real difference between a gesture that may,in the abstract,symbolize sexual intercourse such as gyrating one hips and an act that causes the audience to believe that they are actually observing sexual intercourse.reply brief of appellants at.an act only constitutes simulated sexual intercourse or simulated masturbation if it creates the realistic impression of an actual sexual act.no one would mistake a dancer gyrating her hips for someone having intercourse,nor believe that a carolina panthers cheerleader patting her buttocks as part of a dance routine was masturbating.
the district court also enjoined enforcement of subsection a banning in licensed establishments fondling of the breasts,buttocks,anus,vulva,or genitals after finding the word fondling unconstitutionally vague.the court noted that dictionaries define fondle differently.carandola ii,d at comparing webster new universal unabridged dictionary defining fondle as to handle or touch lovingly,affectionately,or tenderly caress,webster ii new riverside university dictionary defining fondle as to treat indulgently and solicitously pamper,and webster ninth new collegiate dictionary defining fondle as to show affection or desire by caressing.
notwithstanding these slight differences,however,all definitions of fondle imply an element of love,affection,or indulgen ce,whereas mere touching does not.for this reason,the new statute is more precise than the regulations implementing its predecessor,which banned touching as well as fondling.see admin.code a.moreover,the present statute uses the single word fondling in conjunction with specified erogenous zones,indicating that it aims to prevent overt sexual contact,something the ordinary person likely understands.see.a.
furthermore,although few cases have considered whether the word fondle is vague,those that have done so have concluded,as we do,that it is not.see,kev,kitsap county,cir holding that provisions of an ordinance prohibiting erotic dancers from fondling and caressing any patron were not unconstitutionally vague spoons,holding that the word fondle is sufficiently clear and noting that r egulatory language need not be mathematically precise.like simulate,fondling is sufficiently clear to put persons of ordinary intelligence on notice as to what conduct the statute prohibits and to prevent the risk of arbitrary enforcement.
for these reasons,we reverse the portions of the district court order finding the new statute unconstitutionally vague on its face.
the commission next argues that the district court erred in holding subsections a and a facially overbroad.pursuant to the overbreadth doctrine,a party may challenge a statute on its face because it also threatens others not before the who desire to engage in legally protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially invalid.bd.of airport comm rs jews for jesus,d internal quotation marks omitted.w here conduct and not merely speech is involved the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real,but substantial as well,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.broadrick,at.a law should not be invalidated for overbreadth unless it reaches a substantial number of impermissible applications ferber,at.if an overbreadth challenge succeeds,any enforcement of the regulation at issue is totally forbidden.broadrick,at.thus,the supreme court has famously cautioned that the overbreadth doctrine is,manifestly,strong medicine and should be used sparingly and only as a last resort.id.a court should invoke a limiting construction or employ partial invalidation before resorting to a finding of facial overbreadth.id.
to determine whether a statute reaches a substantial number of impermissible applications,ferber,at,a court must apply the appropriate level of first amendment scrutiny.in carandola i,we subjected the predecessor north carolina statute to intermediate,rather than strict,scrutiny because the legislature enacted it,at least in part,to address the secondary effects that follow from lewd conduct on licensed premises,and because hostility to erotic expression,if a purpose of the restrictions at all,does not constitute the predominant purpose.carandola i,at citing city of erie pap,d plurality opinion and city of renton playtime theatres,d.it is even more plain that in enacting the new statute the legislature acted to reduce the secondary effects that flow from adult entertainment on licensed premises.indisputably,the legislature passed the new statute in response to our opinion in carandola i and the preamble to the new statute expressly states that its purpose is to address the harmful secondary effects of such entertainment,including higher crime rates,public sexual conduct,sexual assault,prostitution,and other secondary negative effects,rather than to suppress the conduct of such entertainment.sess.laws.like the old statute,the new statute does not have as its predominant purpose an intent to suppress free expression.thus,we again apply intermediate scrutiny to determine whether the statute reaches a substantial number of impermissible applications,ferber,at.
to withstand intermediate scrutiny,a state must demonstrate that a statute materially advances an important or substantial interest by redressing past harms or preventing future ones.satellite broad.commc ns ass fcc,cir citing turner broad,fcc,d.here,as in carandola i,even without considering any evidence,we can conclude that the state has a substantial interest in regulating nude and topless dancing,because such entertainment has a long history of spawning deleterious effects.at quoting steakhouse,city of raleigh,cir.similarly,we can conclude that the state has a substantial interest in regulating simulate d sexual activity and fondling of sexual organs in licensed establishments because the state may rely on the evidentiary foundation set forth in renton and young american mini theatres,d,to the effect that harmful secondary effects are caused by the presence of even one adult entertainment establishment in a given neighborhood.pap,at.
despite these substantial government interests,in carandola i we found the prohibitions overbroad because the challenged restrictions prohibited myriad expressive activities within the heartland of first amendment protection.at internal quotation marks omitted.there,the commission interpreted the old restrictions broadly,and construed simulated sexual behavior to ban sexually explicit conduct even by fully clothed performers in political satires or shakespeare plays.id.according to the commission,the old restrictions also prohibited much as a ballet in which one dancer touches another buttock during a all nudity or simulated nudity,however brief,in productions with clear artistic as the pulitzer prize winning play,wit.id.the commission argued that such broad restrictions constituted the only means to protect its interest in preventing societal problems.id.at quoting reply brief at.we rejected that argument,concluding that the restrictions were facially overbroad because they swept far beyond bars and nude dancing establishments to reach a great deal of protected expression.id.at.
carandola maintains that,like the old restrictions,the new statute is facially overbroad because it prohibits vast amounts of constitutionally protected expression.brief of appellees at.according to carandola,the new statute prohibition on simulate d sexual activity proscribes ballet,hip hop,belly dancing,flamenco,jazz dancing,and even the irish
