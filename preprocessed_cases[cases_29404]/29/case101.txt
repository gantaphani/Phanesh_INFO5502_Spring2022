once again,tarzan presents this court with copyright issues the issues,arising under the copyright act,stat,codified at et.act,concern the doctrine as applied to an independent contractor,the significance of incorrect information in applications for registration filed with the register of copyrights,and laches.the appeal also presents contract issues.the estate of burne hogarth,burne hogarth dynamic media worldwide llc,and three of hogarth children collectively hogarths appeal from the march,judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,district judge entered after a bench trial.the district court ruled in favor of the edgar rice burroughs,erb,rejecting the hogarths claims for a declaratory judgment that burne hogarth,a well known illustrator,was the author of two books and as such entitled to copyright in the original and renewal terms.the books are pictorial versions of tarzan of the apes and of stories from jungle tales of tarzan collectively the books.the hogarths claimed to have succeeded to burne hogarth rights in the books upon his death.the court also rejected the hogarths claim that they had a contract right to receive a portion of licensing revenues paid to erb by the walt disney company disney and a right to have some of hogarth original artwork returned.we affirm.

creation of the books.edgar rice burroughs published tarzan of the apes,the first of his tarzan novels,in.jungle tales of tarzan was published in.both works are now in the public domain in the united states.burroughs formed erb in to manage his literary rights.
in,burne hogarth hogarth was hired by united features syndicate,to illustrate the syndicated comic strip tarzan and continued this work until.during that time,he developed a highly distinctive and still widely acclaimed style of illustrating tarzan and his universe.dist.op.at.
in the,hogarth and robert hodes,then vice president of erb,had discussions out of which emerged the idea of a new series of tarzan books.in july,hodes wrote to hogarth,suggesting production of a quality,high priced edition of an adult version of tarzan of the apes in graphic form.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in another letter,hodes proposed terms for the project that would provide the basis for the eventual agreement between erb and hogarth.the letter stated 
we would commission you to produce the work at a cost that would be paid now and out of the first proceeds of the book that deferred payment is the extent of your speculation,or risk.
we would undertake to find a publisher all expenses would be borne by us,and this,together with the sum paid to you,would be our risk.
id.at hogarth responded your proposal sounds like a capital idea.id.
later in,erb identified publications,as a likely publisher.this firm had previously published hogarth art instruction books.in proposing a contract between erb and,hodes wrote the firm editor,with a copy to hogarth 
your contract is directly with erb.we undertake to provide the services of burne hogarth to furnish you with artwork and text for your proposed illustrated book of tarzan of the apes 
you are responsible for designing and producing the book,and,in general,supervising hogarth work we reserve the right to require all parties to produce a book that reasonably and substantially tells the story of tarzan of the apes as edgar rice burroughs told that story in his classic novel as for the artwork itself,we can not and do not presume to influence or control the work of hogarth.
the contract.in an agreement dated november,agreement,signed by hogarth in,erb and hogarth established the terms for the creation of the first and subsequent books.it included the following provisions

we will have the right to approve the content of the books,but our sole interest in this regard will be to preserve the burroughs flavor.we may give you our artistic suggestions from time to time,but you will be the final judge of the artwork as distinguished from the story or text.

neither the nor the book enjoyed substantial sales.
the copyright registrations.the application for the original term registration for the pictorial version of tarzan of the apes was filed in by it identifies as the claimant edgar rice burroughs,and as the authors edgar rice burroughs deceased and illustrated by burne hogarth.in,counsel for erb submitted an application for a supplementary registration,which identifies the sole author as edgar rice burroughs,and states the explanation for the correction as work was one made for hire.
three applications for renewal term registrations were submitted for tarzan of the apes.on december,danton burroughs,on behalf of erb,submitted an application for a renewal registration listing the author of renewable matter as edgar rice burroughs,first renewal application.on december,counsel for hogarth children submitted an application for a renewal registration listing the author of renewable matter as burne hogarth second renewal application.on june,counsel for erb submitted an application for a renewal registration listing the author of renewable matter as edgar rice burroughs,third renewal application.counsel for erb subsequently advised the copyright office that,at the time of filing the third renewal application for erb,he had been unaware of the earlier filing of the first renewal application on behalf of erb.
the first renewal application was received by the copyright office on december,and that date would in the normal course have become the effective date.see d effective date of copyright registration is day on which application,deposit,and fee are received.however,for reasons that the register of copyrights can not explain,the examiner handling the renewal claims processed the third renewal application.see peters letter at.reviewing its records as a result of this court inquiry,the copyright office concluded that the examiner should have processed the first renewal application,rather than the later filed third renewal application.the copyright office therefore issued a new certificate of renewal registration with an effective date of december,and cancelled the inadvertently processed third renewal registration 
the second renewal application was also received on december,and given a december,effective date.thus,the copyright office has two renewal registrations for tarzan of the apes with an effective date of december,one identifying erb as the author and the claimant,and the other identifying hogarth as the author and hogarth children as the claimants.
the application for the original term registration for jungle tales of tarzan was filed by in.it identifies as the claimant edgard sic rice burroughs,and as the author burne hogarth.in,marion burroughs,the of edgar rice burroughs and an officer of erb,filed an application for a supplementary registration to make two changes to the original registration.first,the misspelling edgard in the name of the claimant was corrected to edgar.second,under the blank for amplified information,the application stated add name of edgar rice burroughs as author of original text.citizenship usa deceased.the author was listed as burne hogarth,as it had been on the original application.in,counsel for erb filed an application for a second supplementary registration to identify edgar rice burroughs,as the author instead of burne hogarth.under explanation of correction,this second application stated work was one made for hire.
no renewal application has yet been filed for jungle tales of tarzan because its renewal term will not begin until january,years after the publication.
the license.in an agreement dated april,erb licensed disney to use the tarzan character and stories in animated movies and television programs disney license or the license.paragraph a of the agreement defined the scope of the license to include 
the characters,plots,settings,themes,and incidents contained in or suggested by all or any portion of the stories written by edgar rice burroughs,schedules of which are attached hereto as exhibit a and exhibit 
dist.op.at.exhibits a and b list the tarzan novels written by burroughs for which or berne convention copyright protection existed in.id.neither of the books at issue in this litigation are included in these exhibits.id.at.
in paragraph b ix of the license,erb warrants 
a that,except as set forth in exhibits a and b,to the best of erb knowledge,there are no other stories authorized by erb or its predecessors in interest in which the tarzan character appears.if there are any other stories in which erb has an interest,such stories shall be deemed stories hereunder to the extent of erb rights therein,in any.
disney released its tarzan movie in.pursuant to the license,disney paid erb million,million to buy out erb share of disney revenues from tarzan merchandise and million based on box office receipts from the movie.
the pending litigation.burne hogarth died in.in september,two months after disney release of its tarzan movie,counsel for the hogarth estate sent a letter to disney,claiming that the movie infringed burne hogarth copyrights in the books.both disney and erb rejected the claim.the hogarths then brought the pending litigation,alleging three claims that burne hogarth was the sole author of the books and that his heirs are entitled to the renewal term copyrights in the books that the hogarths are entitled to a share of the proceeds erb received from disney and that erb breached paragraph of the agreement by retaining possession of the original artwork for the book but failing to establish a museum for its display.
erb answer,denying the hogarths claims,contained no counterclaim,but did include,in the prayer for relief,a request that the court declare that erb is owner of all copyright rights,including the renewal copyrights in the books.by the time of the trial,the district court understood erb to be contending,among other things,that the books were works for hire 
the district court decision.after a bench trial in,judge cote rejected all of the hogarths claims.with respect to the copyright claim,she ruled that,although the copyright registrations constituted prima facie evidence that burne hogarth was the author,as stated in the registrations,the evidence established that the registrations were not reliable,dist.op.at that i n the second circuit an independent contractor is an employee and a hiring party is an employer for purposes of the act if the work is made at the hiring party instance and expense,id.citing playboy enterprises,dumas,cir emphases deleted that the books were created at the instance and expense of erb,id.at that the books are works for hire,id.at and that erb,as an employer in the case of works made for hire,is the author for purposes of the act and entitled to the copyrights in the original and renewal terms,id.at.
with respect to the hogarths laches defense,judge cote ruled that,although the registrations listing burne hogarth as the author remained uncorrected for many years,the existence of incorrect registrations alone did not establish a laches defense and that erb had promptly acted to assert its copyright claims as soon as adversity developed between the hogarths and erb.id.at.with respect to the hogarths contract claims,judge cote ruled that the disney license gave disney only the right to use the character tarzan and the stories listed in appendix a and appendix b of the license,and not any rights with respect to the books.id.at.the court also ruled that,even if disney acquired rights in the books,the agreement did not give hogarth any right to revenue received by erb by virtue of the disney license,id.at.finally,as to the hogarths claim concerning original artwork,judge cote ruled that erb had not promised to build a museum to house hogarth drawings and had not breached the clause of the agreement concerning original artwork.id.at.
the district court judgment denies all of the hogarths claims,but neither grants nor denies the request in erb answer for a declaration that it owns all copyrights,including renewal copyrights in the books.
discussion 
copyright claima.work for hire and the renewal term 
two concepts of copyright law under the act are at issue on this work made for hire and the renewal term.the act provides no definition of work made for hire,but it states the consequence of that designation.t he word author shall include an employer in the case of works made for hire.act.thus,with respect to works made for hire,the employer is legally regarded as the author,as distinguished from the creator of the work,whom learned hand referred to as the author in the colloquial sense.shapiro,bernstein bryan,cir.the concept of a work made for hire remains in the copyright act of,et act,which defines the phrase to mean a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment or,for certain types of works,a work specially ordered or commissioned.id.see community for creative reid,d ccnv.
the second renewal a distinctive feature of the act,not carried into the act for works created on or after january,see a establishing single copyright term as enacted,the act authorized an original term of years and a renewal term of an additional years if application for the renewal term was made within one year prior to the expiration of the original term.act.an important aspect of the renewal term is that,although it is assignable by the author,see fred fisher music witmark sons,the assignment of the expectancy in acquiring the renewal term,see miller music charles daniels,d,is voided by the author death prior to the date when the renewal term vests,see act miller music,at.in that event,the renewal right belongs to the author surviving spouse or children,if living,or,if they are not living,to the author executor.see act miller music,at.however,in the case of a work made for hire,the proprietor of the copyright in the original term,the employer or its assignee,is entitled to the renewal term.act.
in the pending litigation,the concepts of a work made for hire and the renewal term are at issue concerning a work claimed to be commissioned.erb makes no claim that burne hogarth was its employee.instead,erb contends that hogarth was an independent contractor whom erb commissioned to create original artwork for the books under circumstances that render the books works for hire under the case law of this circuit.this claim raises the issue of whether a commissioned work should be considered a work for hire under the act,in which event the right to obtain the renewal term belongs to the commissioning party,or whether that right remains with the commissioned party,absent an assignment to the contrary.in the pending case,where the commissioned party,burne hogarth,assigned to the commissioning party,erb,his renewal right technically,the expectancy in acquiring the renewal term,see miller music,at,see agreement,and then died before the renewal term vested,the issue of whether the books are works for hire is critical because,if they are not,hogarth death during the original term would leave the renewal right with his children.see act miller music,at.
commissioned works under the act in a series of cases decided over more than sixty years,this court has considered the status of commissioned works under the act,with respect to both the original copyright term and the renewal term.in the process,we have developed what the fifth circuit describes as an almost irrebut t able presumption that any person who paid another to create a copyrightable work was the statutory author under the work for hire doctrine.easter seal society for crippled children and adults of louisiana,playboy enterprises,cir reviewing relevant second circuit cases.
our court first recognized a presumption in favor of a commissioning party in in yardley houghton mifflin,cir,a case involving an artist who had been commissioned by the city of new york to paint a mural.the artist had died before the expiration of the copyright original term,and his sister claimed to own a copyright for the original term by virtue of an assignment from her brother executor.in addition,the sister had filed for and obtained a registration for the copyright renewal term.
focusing on the original term,we ruled that,although the contract commissioning the artist work was silent as to which party would hold the copyright,and although the artist had included a copyright notice in his favor on the painting,this term belonged to the city because it had commissioned the artist to paint the mural.id.at.in so holding,we adopted a presumption that the commissioning party desires to control the publication of copies of the commissioned work and that the artist consents to such control in the absence of a contract to the contrary.id.at.our conclusion that the artist consents to his patron right to control reproduction of the commissioned work,coupled with the absence of any reference to the work as a work for hire,may have been intended to reflect a conclusion that the copyright for the original term and the expectancy of a copyright for the renewal term were transferred by the artist to the patron by an implied assignment,in which event the artist heirs or executor would retain renewal rights if the artist died before the renewal term vested 
some support for this conclusion can be drawn from our rejection of the sister renewal claim on the ground that only the artist executor could legally obtain a renewal.id.at citing fox film knowles.presumably,if we had regarded the mural as a work for hire,the commissioning party would have been deemed in law the author and,as such,would have been entitled to the copyright for both the original and the renewal terms,regardless of whether the artist had died during the original term.see shapiro,bernstein,at tobani carl fischer,cir.on the other hand,because the sister had conceded that only the executor could legally obtain a renewal,yardley,at,we had no occasion to consider the effect,if any,of the yardley presumption on a renewal right dispute between the executor and the city.
we seemed to resolve the question of renewal rights in commissioned works in,when we considered a work song lyrics created as a special job assignment,outside the line of the lyricist regular duties for his employer.shapiro,bernstein jerry vogel music,cir,modified on other grounds,cir vogel music ii the district court had found that the employer paid the lyricist for the lyric and his rights therein.shapiro,bernstein jerry vogel music,vogel music i.we ruled that the lyricist right to the copyright for the original term passed to the employer under the lyricist original contract with the employer to write a lyric.vogel music ii,at.but we also ruled that the lyricist retained his right to the renewal term until he subsequently assigned that right to a third party.id.although we did not amplify this conclusion,the district court had explained since the lyricist was not the employer employee for hire,the employer had no renewal interest in the lyricist lyric.vogel music i.at.
ten years later,in brattleboro publishing winmill publishing,cir,we merged the yardley presumption into the doctrine,as the fifth circuit characterized our approach,see easter seal society,at,thereby laying the foundation for the law as it now stands in this circuit.brattleboro concerned a claim of copyright infringement during the original term brought by merchants who had requested a newspaper to design and publish advertisements.in ruling that the merchants were entitled to copyrights in their ads,we,for the first time,explicitly applied to independent contractors,at,the newspaper,the instance and expense standard that had previously been used for determining when an employee work should be deemed to be a work for hire,which would result in the employer right to the copyright for both the original and the renewal term.id.at citing nimmer on copyright.brattleboro,like yardley,did not refer to the works,the ads,as works for hire.but brattleboro,unlike yardley,did identify the doctrine as the grounds for the court disposition.id.at.after reviewing the principles applicable to claims,brattleboro specifically observed we see no sound reason why these same principles are not applicable when the parties bear the relationship of employer and independent contractor.see easter seal society,at describing cited language as brattleboro critical twist on established doctrine.although we had no occasion in brattleboro to consider the parties rights in a copyright for the renewal term,the cited language,if not the facts in brattleboro provided support for our subsequent holding in picture music,bourne,cir.
picture music involved a songwriter who was asked by a music publisher to adapt music and one line of a lyric from an animated movie into a new song.for her efforts she received a percentage of song royalties.she claimed an interest in the renewal term of the copyright in the song.in rejecting her claim,this court ruled that the songwriter had acted in the capacity of an independent contractor that the music publisher and the creator of the movie were the motivating factors in the composition of the new song that they had the power to accept,reject,or modify the song and that these circumstances rendered the song a work for hire.id.at.
somewhat extending this court earlier decisions picture music stated that the instance and expense test,which had previously been used to identify an employee work as a work for hire and to deem a commissioned party to have assigned to the commissioning party a copyright for the original term,would now be used to determine whether a commissioned work was a work for hire,thereby entitling the commissioning party to the renewal term in addition to the original term.rejecting a distinction between an employee and an independent contractor as long as the instance and expense test was satisfied,the court stated that the purpose of the act is not to be frustrated by conceptualistic formulations of the employment sic relationship,id.at,and concluded that the acted in the capacity of an independent contractor does not preclude a finding that the song was done for hire.id.at.
the court willingness to treat a commissioned work as a work for hire might have resulted from the way the case was presented on appeal.although the appellant contended that the song was not a work for hire,its brief did not cite,much less discuss,the decisions in yardley,vogel music ii,or brattleboro.after the decision in picture music,professor melville nimmer entered the fray,filing a rehearing petition that discussed our earlier commissioned work decisions and reminded the court that its prior decision in yardley had left the renewal term in a commissioned work with the executor of the estate of the work creator.apparently,his argument came too late the rehearing petition was denied without comment.see picture music,bourne,cir denying petition for rehearing.the supreme court also denied nimmer petition for certiorari,with only justice douglas dissenting.picture music,bourne,d.
by the time we next encountered a commissioned work,in,picture music had carried the day,and we relied on it and its expansive reading of brattleboro to hold that,as long as the instance and expense test is met,the work is a work for hire,and the party commissioning the work is regarded as the author,entitled to all rights of copyright.see playboy enterprises,dumas,cir 
significance of ccnv.whatever questions might be raised about the law progression in this circuit from yardley through picture music,we would normally be obliged to follow picture music,especially after its holding was reconfirmed in playboy.we are given pause,however,by language in the supreme court opinion in ccnv.ccnv concerned the provision of the act.that act defines a work for hire as 
a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment or 
a work specially ordered or commissioned for any of nine specified uses if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.
ccnv stated that to determine whether a work is a work for hire under the act,a court should first ascertain,using principles of general common law of agency,whether the work was prepared by an employee or an independent contractor and then apply the appropriate subsection of the act definition.at.the court rejected the contention that congress,in enacting the act,had intended to incorporate commissioned work cases decided under the act such as picture music and brattleboro,which the court characterized as holding that an employment relationship exists sufficient to give the hiring party copyright ownership whenever that party has the right to control or supervise the artist work.id.at.although ruling that the approach of these cases was not applicable to cases governed by the act,the court had no occasion to rule as to their continued viability for cases still governed by the act.
however,in recounting the history of the doctrine under the act,the court explained that,as to commissioned works,courts of appeals generally presumed that the commissioned party had impliedly agreed to convey the copyright,along with the work itself,to the hiring party.id.at.for this account,ccnv cited our decisions in yardley and vogel music ii.id.by emphasizing our early cases reliance on an implied agreement between the commissioning and the commissioned parties,this account could be read to confirm the view of vogel music ii that a commissioned work is not a work for hire and to support an interpretation of yardley that,upon the death of the commissioned party during the original term,the right to obtain the renewal term belongs to his executor if no spouse or child survives either because the renewal right was not impliedly assigned or,if impliedly assigned,such assignment is voided by his death before the vesting of the renewal term.the argument would be that,since with a true work for hire,copyright ownership and the right to obtain the renewal term are with the employer automatically upon the employee creation of the work,the court reference to the commissioned party implied agreement to convey the copyright reflects a view that the commissioning party does not have the right to obtain a renewal term if the creator dies before the term vests.interestingly,the nimmer treatise takes this precise message from justice marshall opinion in ccnv.see nimmer d,at our issue thus becomes whether to adhere to the clear holdings of picture music and playboy or reject them on the basis of the language used in ccnv to describe our court earlier treatment of commissioned works under the act.
although the content of a supreme court opinion can provide a basis that permits us to reject a precedent of this court without the need for in banc reconsideration,see gerosa savasta,cir circuit precedent rejected by panel because of reasoning in intervening supreme court opinion boothe hammock,cir same,we conclude that the language in ccnv is an insufficient basis to warrant a panel disregard of two clear holdings of this court.ccnv was not concerned with the status of commissioned works under the act.the language that mentions such works is a brief historical account.indeed,in playboy,our own court acknowledged the same history,noting that u ntil the,federal courts applied the doctrine only to cases in which a traditional relationship existed between the hiring party and the creator of the work.at.but,as we also noted in playboy,builders hardware gertler,cir,became the first case to extend the doctrine to commissioned works.playboy,at.after picture music,the doctrine was similarly extended in murray gelderman,cir,and real estate data,sidwell,cir.in sum,because we agree with judge gee observation in easter seal society that any distinction in the case law under the act between employees and independent contractors was erased long before the act arrival,easter seal society,at,we conclude that the historical review in ccnv,if dictum at all,is dictum of a weak variety,and not grounds to relieve us from our obligation to follow picture music and playboy.
the hogarths copyright claim therefore turns on whether they can successfully challenge either the district court ultimate conclusion that the books were created at the instance and expense of erb or the factual findings that underlie this conclusion.
application of the instance and expense test.the hogarths challenge to the district court conclusion that the books were created at the instance and expense of erb,as those terms have been used in this circuit to determine copyright ownership of commissioned works,see playboy,at picture music,at brattleboro,at,is essentially a dispute about the facts.judge cote carefully considered the evidence and made precise findings to support her conclusion that the books were created at the instance and expense of erb.see dist.op.at.we see no basis for disturbing her findings or her conclusions.furthermore,as the district court suggested,id.at,the books are derivative works based on original works for which erb held the copyrights,and we ruled in picture music that in such circumstances the copyright proprietor has the right to direct and supervise the work of the commissioned party,sufficient to render it a work for hire,picture music,at quoting donaldson publishing bregman,vocco conn,cir.
timeliness 
the hogarths contend that erb is barred from claiming to be the author of the books pursuant to the doctrine because of the statute of limitations,laches,and equitable estoppel.
statute of limitations.civil actions seeking copyright remedies are barred unless commenced within three years after the claim accrued.b.a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury upon which the claim is premised.merchant levy,cir.the hogarths contend that erb claim is because it accrued when erb had notice of the contents of the copyright registration certificates identifying hogarth as author of the books in the.brief for appellants at.
the initial obstacle to the limitations defense is that erb has not made a claim to which even a valid limitations defense could be asserted by the hogarths.erb did not file a counterclaim.as the issues were presented to the district court for trial,erb contention was a defense to the hogarths claim for renewal rights.a defendant who is not seeking any affirmative relief and who asserts a defense only to defeat a plaintiff claim is not barred by a statute of limitations.see united states western pacific,d to use the statute of limitations to cut off the consideration of a particular defense in the case is quite foreign to the policy of preventing the commencement of stale litigation.luckenbach steamship united states,cir the law is well settled that limitations do not normally run against a defense.sanford avenue realty cisneros,it is well established that statutes of limitations run against affirmative claims for relief,but not against defenses.even if circumstances had existed when filed applications for registration in the that would have entitled erb to seek a declaration of against a claim by burne hogarth,erb would not have been obliged to seek such declaratory relief.potential defendants are not required to seek at the earliest opportunity a declaration that a defense to a claim not yet brought is valid.
arguably,erb inclusion,in the prayer for relief of its answer,of a request for a declaration that erb owns all copyright rights in the books functions as a counterclaim against which the hogarths limitation defense can be asserted.but the district court apparently did not understand erb to be asserting a counterclaim,and the judgment does not adjudicate one moreover,even if erb had filed a counterclaim,the statute of limitations would not have prevented erb from asserting its affirmative defense to the hogarths claim.see delaware chemicals,reichhold chemicals,dismissing counterclaims as but permitting to seek leave to amend to assert the counterclaims defensively.
we need not rest solely on the pleadings,however,because the limitations defense lacks merit.contrary to the hogarths contention,erb claim to copyright interests in the books did not accrue in the when the applications for registrations were filed.even if the filing of an application for registration by an adverse party could start a limitations period,a matter we do not decide a party can not be held to have started the limitations period for assertion of its copyright claims by filing its own applications for registration,no matter how erroneous.recognizing that erb claim can not accrue until it has suffered some injury,the hogarths contended in the district court that erb suffered a injury.dist.op.at.not surprisingly,there is no authority for such a contention.the district court cases in which a claimant has been from asserting claims contrary to the information disclosed in a copyright registration involve applications for registrations filed by a party with interests adverse to those of the claimant.see carell shubert organization,d,willsea theis,civ.bsj,wl,at,see also netzer continuity graphic associates,copyright ownership claim accrued when claimant received comic book with copyright notice identifying adverse party as copyright proprietor.
in the pending case,as the district court ruled,the injury to erb came at the earliest in,when hogarth heirs asserted an undefined copyright claim in their letter to disney.dist.op.at.the statute of limitations does not bar erb from defending on the ground that the books are works for hire.
laches and equitable estoppel.the district court correctly ruled that erb is not barred from asserting its defense because of laches or equitable estoppel.id.at.the hogarths presented no evidence of reliance to their detriment arising from the registrations or from any other action taken by erb.see ivani contracting city of new york,cir laches defense unavailable in absence of prejudice general electric capital eva armadora,cir equitable estoppel requires,among other things,reliance on misrepresentations causing change of position by innocent party.
effect of registrations 
the hogarths contend that the registrations for the books that became effective in the created a presumption that burne hogarth was the author and that erb has not overcome this presumption.section of the act provides that the register certificate of registration shall be admitted in any court as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.the application for registration of tarzan of the apes,filed by,identified the authors as edgar rice burroughs deceased and illustrated by burne hogarth.the application for registration of jungle tales of tarzan,also filed by,identified the author as burne hogarth.erb did not fully correct these registrations until,when it filed applications for supplemental registrations identifying erb as author on the basis of work for hire in,conflicting applications for registrations for the renewal term for tarzan of the apes were filed by erb and by the hogarths.erb initial renewal application listed edgar rice burroughs,as the author on a theory,and the hogarths application listed burne hogarth as the author.
the application forms on which applied for registration of a copyright for both of the books stated where a work was made for hire,the employer is the author.the hogarths contend that,in light of this explicit instruction,the omission of erb as author on the applications filed by resulted in registration certificates in effect disclaiming employer for hire status for erb.brief for appellants at.
