the operator of a club in philadelphia that features dancing,as well as two of its dancers,challenge a pennsylvania liquor code statute and regulation that prohibit lewd entertainment at any licensed establishment.plaintiffs argue that the statute and regulation are unconstitutional both on their face and as applied to plaintiffs.we conclude that the statute and regulation are facially invalid because they are substantially overbroad,punishing a significant amount of protected speech in relation to their legitimate scope.
background 
plaintiff conchatta,operates club risque,a philadelphia bar where erotic striptease performances are shown,and plaintiffs gail baker and sabrina barrar are dancers who have performed at club risque.during the performances,the dancers take off their clothes,leaving only,liquid latex covering their nipples,and shoes.club risque prohibits physical contact between the dancers and patrons.
in march,plaintiffs hereinafter conchatta filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against the commissioner of the pennsylvania state police hereinafter the commissioner seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive and declaratory relief as to the enforcement of.ann.hereinafter the statute,which provides that it shall be unlawful 
for any licensee,under any circumstances,to permit in any licensed premises or in any place operated in connection therewith any lewd,immoral or improper entertainment 
conchatta also sought relief as to one of the statute implementing regulations,b hereinafter the regulation,which provides in pertinent part 
a licensee may not permit an employee,servant,agent,participant or a person engaged directly or indirectly as an entertainer in the licensed establishment or a room or place connected therewith,to be in contact or associate with the patrons in the establishment,room or place for a lewd,immoral,improper or unlawful purpose.
under pennsylvania law,violation of the statute is a misdemeanor that can result in a fine of up to five thousand dollars and imprisonment for a period of three months to one year,as well as to suspension or revocation of the liquor license.see.ann.a,b.violation of the regulation can also result in a fine and license suspension or revocation.the commissioner asserts that there have been no criminal convictions under the challenged portions of the statute and regulation,and that they are enforced solely through a civil regulatory process.
in the district court,conchatta alleged that the statute and regulation collectively,the challenged provisions are unconstitutional under the first amendment because they are impermissibly overbroad and vague on their face.conchatta also alleged that the challenged provisions are unconstitutional as applied to it.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied conchatta motion for a preliminary injunction in april,concluding that conchatta had demonstrated neither a likelihood of success on the merits nor that it would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.the court declined to address conchatta overbreadth and vagueness claims.in anticipation of a decision related to the statute that was due to come down from the supreme court of pennsylvania,the court stayed further proceedings in the case and closed the matter administratively,subject to a motion to reopen.
in may,conchatta appealed the district court denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction.this court affirmed in a per curiam opinion,with a dissent.conchatta,evanko.cir.the majority found that conchatta had made a strong case that the statute is overbroad,but had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm under the preliminary injunction standard.id.at.in dissent,judge roth concluded that the statute was overbroad and also found that the irreparable harm requirement had been satisfied.id.at.
the pennsylvania supreme court decision anticipated by the district court,purple orchid,pennsylvania state police,was issued in december.there,the court held that the statute was not unconstitutional under the first amendment as applied to a bar featuring dancing.id.at.the purple orchid court explicitly declined,however,to consider whether the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad or vague on its face.id.at.
the district court returned the case to active status,and conchatta filed a motion for summary judgment in april.the commissioner then filed a for summary judgment.in february,the district court held that the terms immoral and improper in the challenged provisions were unconstitutionally vague,but that the term lewd was not.conchatta,evanko,wl.the court therefore granted conchatta summary judgment motion in part,ordering that the terms immoral and improper be excised from the challenged provisions,but denied the motion with respect to the remainder of the challenged language.id.at.the court did not address conchatta overbreadth claim.
conchatta now appeals the denial in part of its motion for summary judgment,with respect to the portions of the challenged provisions.the commissioner does not appeal the district court order that the terms immoral and improper be excised.we therefore consider the challenged provisions in their new form,with the single term lewd replacing the three terms lewd,immoral,and improper.
ii.discussion 
overbreadth 
the showing that a law punishes a substantial amount of protected free speech,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep,suffices to invalidate all enforcement of that law,until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression.virginia hicks,d quoting broadrick oklahoma,d.a litigant may challenge a statute as substantially overbroad under this principle even though the conduct of the litigant is clearly unprotected and could be proscribed by a law drawn with the requisite specificity.new york ferber,d.this broad standing rule is rooted in the view that a statute very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.peachlum city of york,pennsylvania,cir quoting broadrick,at.thus,in making their overbreadth claim,conchatta may assert the rights of any liquor licensees subject to the challenged provisions.
the supreme court has noted,however,that when considering a facial challenge it is necessary to proceed with caution and restraint,as invalidation may result in unnecessary interference with a state regulatory program.erznoznik city of jacksonville,d broadrick,at.holding that the invalidation of an ordinance on overbreadth grounds is strong medicine to be used sparingly and only as a last resort.
availability of a limiting construction 
in determining the scope of a state law challenged for overbreadth,this court must consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.a narrowing construction can save an otherwise unconstitutional statute by eliminating the statute substantial overbreadth.see hicks,at.if a statute is readily susceptible to a limiting interpretation that would make it constitutional,the statute must be upheld,but we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements.virginia am.booksellers ass n,d.
although pennsylvania courts and agencies have addressed the has been in effect in pennsylvania since the early numerous occasions,no clear narrowing construction of the challenged provisions has emerged.the pennsylvania supreme court has twice considered the statute constitutionality.in in re tahiti bar,the court rejected an first amendment challenge to the statute by a bar that featured erotic dancing,holding that pennsylvania authority to regulate liquor consumption gave it almost limitless power to regulate speech where liquor is consumed.id.at.the court also concluded that,taken as a whole,the phrase lewd,immoral,or improper was not unconstitutionally vague.id.at.without specifically construing the challenged terms,the court upheld the lower court finding that the performance in plaintiffs bar was lewd or obscene as well as immoral under any definition of these terms.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
more recently,in purple orchid,the pennsylvania supreme court disavowed its analysis in tahiti bar,noting that under recent united states supreme court precedent,a state does not have plenary authority over the regulation of expression in liquor licensee establishments.purple orchid,at see liquormart,rhode island,d.the purple orchid court nonetheless upheld the statute under the first amendment as applied to a club featuring erotic dancing.at.the court did not adopt a limiting construction of the statute,stating only that the statute apparently has not been applied to prohibit erotic dancing outright in establishments licensed to serve alcohol.instead,it has been interpreted by enforcement officials as requiring the dancers to cover themselves,at a minimum,with what are commonly known as pasties and a.id.at.
in pennsylvania liquor control board,which involved a challenge to a fine imposed under the statute on a bar featuring topless dancing,the pennsylvania commonwealth court noted that we have found no case law and none has been cited to us construing the terms lewd,immoral or improper as used in the code.id.at emphasis omitted.without limiting the scope of those terms,the court stated that we are convinced that partial nudity of a female dancer in a public bar is at the very least improper and,in our opinion,also falls within the broad dictionary language defining immoral and lewd.id.footnote omitted.
other decisions in the lower pennsylvania courts have similarly considered whether some form of erotic dancing falls within the terms of the challenged provisions without explicitly construing or narrowing those terms.see,rising sun entm t.bureau of liquor control enforcement,stating that topless dancing performed in licensed establishments can be lewd,immoral or improper entertainment per se bjj,commonwealth,upholding revocation of liquor license under lewd,immoral or improper language where performances included topless dancing girls who wore panties or which permitted one to see the pubic area.liquor control bd,finding statutory standard satisfied where there was evidence that female dancers wore wet nightgowns and displayed various parts of their bodies during their performances.we have found no pennsylvania court or agency holdings that contain an explicit narrowing construction of the challenged provisions.south fischer,wl,at cir,recognizing a narrowing construction of statute where state court explicitly construed a prohibition on lewd and immoral activities as a prohibition on entertainment where the predominant object and natural effect upon the of one portion of the performance is erotic excitation.citation omitted 
although the commissioner can point to no explicit narrowing construction of the challenged provisions,he argues that an implicit narrowing construction has emerged based on the fact that pennsylvania courts and agencies have applied the challenged statutory language only to live dancing involving exposure of genitals or involving physical sexual contact between patrons and dancers.we disagree.the fact that the challenged provisions have been applied exclusively to such entertainment indicates only that such entertainment falls within the scope of the challenged provisions it does not define the limits of the challenged provisions reach.past practice does not constitute a narrowing construction because it does not bind the enforcement agency,which could,at some point in the future,decide to target a broader range of establishments.this possibility of expanded enforcement creates a chilling effect.see hicks,at.expressing concern over the possibility that the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law may deter or chill constitutionally protected speech.
the commissioner asserts that the liquor board does not intend to enforce the challenged provisions against legitimate theatrical or concert performances.however,the mere fact that an agency does not currently intend to apply a statute in an unconstitutional manner can not have the effect of an explicit limiting construction.see odle decatur county,cir neither proof that an ordinance as currently applied has no unconstitutional effect,nor assurances offered by the relevant local authorities that the ordinance will not be put to such an effect in the future,constitute constructions of the ordinance,as that term is ordinarily understood see also ways city of lincoln,cir rejecting city assurances that a statute was not intended to apply to artistic venues in considering an overbreadth challenge.but see sob,county of benton,cir rejecting an overbreadth challenge where a county affidavit noted the absence of theaters in the county and averred a lack of intention to enforce the regulation against theatrical productions with serious artistic merit.in short,the current enforcement intentions of the liquor board are of no relevance to our analysis of the scope of the challenged provisions.
thus,we conclude that no limiting construction of the challenged provisions has been established by pennsylvania state courts or agencies.nor are the plain terms of the challenged provisions readily susceptible to such a construction the general prohibition on lewd entertainment in any licensed establishment does not lend itself to an obvious narrowing interpretation.see giovani carandola,bason,cir w e can not adopt a limiting construction unless a measure is readily susceptible to such an interpretation by state courts,and certainly can not rewrite state law.internal citation omitted schultz city of cumberland,cir finding statute susceptible to limiting construction where statutory prohibition on commercial establishments regularly featur ing nudity could be construed more narrowly as applying only to establishments always featur ing nudity emphasis added.
scope of the challenged provisions 
as no narrowing construction is available,we must consider the scope of the challenged provisions based on their plain terms.at the outset,we note that challenged provisions proscribe lewd entertainment in a notably broad array of contexts.the parties agree that approximately to establishments have liquor licenses in pennsylvania and are subject to the challenged provisions many of these are ordinary restaurants,but dinner theaters,comedy clubs,and other venues that present some form of entertainment and serve alcohol are also subject to the challenged provisions.moreover,the reach of the statute extends to all places operated in connection with licensed premises.this language presumably applies to performance spaces that serve alcohol in the lobby during intermission.thus,the challenged provisions do not solely apply to nude dancing,which falls only within the outer ambit of the first amendment protection,city of erie pap,d plurality opinion,but also apply to a variety of performances that are entitled to the full protection of the first amendment,as long as the venues serve alcohol.see conchatta.at noting that the statute covers plays,musicals,concerts,political satires,comedies,ballets,dramas,singing performances,dancing performances,poetry readings,and art shows throughout pennsylvania roth,dissenting see also endowment for the arts finley,d art is entitled to full protection because our cultural life,just like our native politics,rests upon the ideal of governmental viewpoint neutrality citation omitted 
as for what expression falls within the prohibition on lewd entertainment,we,like the plaintiffs,find this to be a difficult question to answer.the pennsylvania courts have construed lewd entertainment to include entertainment involving fully exposed breasts,genital exposure,or genital touching.as noted above,however,the statutory definition has not been limited to include only entertainment with those characteristics,and this exacerbates the chilling effect on a wide range of first amendment protected expression when the challenged provisions are applied to artistic,theatrical,and other entertainment venues.we need not here predict,however,how expansively the pennsylva
