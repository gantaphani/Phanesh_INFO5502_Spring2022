in the copyright royalty judges crj set the royalty rate that satellite radio services must pay to copyright owners for the use of sound recordings during the years.soundexchange,an organization established to collect and distribute royalties to the copyright owners,appeals the crj determination,arguing it is arbitrary,capricious,and not supported by substantial evidence.we affirm the crj determination with respect to the royalty rate for the use of sound recordings but reverse with respect to the crj failure to set a royalty rate for ephemeral copies of sound recordings.
background 
the congress has created two types of copyrights in a musical recording.one is for the underlying musical work,that is,the written music a copyright in the musical work affords the owner the exclusive right to perform the work in public.the broadcast of a song whether recorded or performed live over terrestrial or satellite radio is a performance of the musical work and therefore requires a license from the copyright owner.a sound recording is a performance of a musical work that is affixed to a recording medium until the owner of the copyright to a sound recording did not enjoy an exclusive performance right.in that year the congress afforded the owner of the copyright to a sound recording the narrow but exclusive right to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission,id,d in effect,this assured the copyright owner the ability to charge a royalty for a license to play its work on a satellite radio service srs.if a mutually agreeable royalty can not be negotiated between an srs company and a copyright owner,then the copyright royalty agency comprising three members appointed by the librarian of to set reasonable rates and terms of royalty payments,id.f a,calculated to achieve the following four objectives 
a to maximize the availability of creative works to the public.
b to afford the copyright owner a fair return for his or her creative work and the copyright user a fair income under existing economic conditions.
c to reflect the relative roles of the copyright owner and the copyright user in the product made available to the public with respect to relative creative contribution,technological contribution,capital investment,cost,risk,and contribution to the opening of new markets for creative expression and media for their communication.
d to minimize any disruptive impact on the structure of the industries involved and on generally prevailing industry practices.
the srs radio and xm a predecessor to soundexchange agreed upon a rate in that would remain in effect until the end of.in the congress provided that,if soundexchange and the companies had not already agreed upon the royalty to be paid thereafter,then in january the crj would begin ratemaking proceedings for the period.id.b b.the three principals did not agree upon a rate and the proceeding here under review duly followed.
for a starting point from which to consider the four objectives,the crj looked to comparable marketplace royalty rates as benchmarks,indicative of the prices that prevail for other,online services purchasing similar music inputs for use in digital programming.determination of rates and terms for preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services,determination of rates.the agency considered the record evidence reflecting various experts opinions and concluded that a rate equal to of srs gross revenue,as proposed by soundexchange,marks the upper boundary for a zone of reasonableness for potential marketplace benchmarks from which to identify a rate that satisfies the objectives in.id.at.the agency set the lower bound at the of gross revenue the companies were then paying for the right to use musical works,but found a rate close to the upper boundary is more strongly supported than one close to the lower boundary.id.at.
the crj then turned to the four statutory objectives in order to locate a specific rate within the zone of reasonableness.with respect to the first two the availability of creative works to the public and ensuring copyright owners and users a fair rate of agency found the record did not support a thumb on the scale in favor of either soundexchange or the srs companies.the crj then determined the third and fourth the relative roles of the owner and the user in making the product available and minimizing the disruptive impact upon the industries warranted a royalty rate somewhat lower than 
g iven that the current rates paid by the srs companies for these licenses are in the range of to of revenues,an immediate increase to the upper boundary of the zone of reasonableness,would be disruptive inasmuch as the companies have not yet attained a sufficient subscriber base nor generated sufficient revenues to reach consistent earnings before interest,taxes,depreciation and amortization ebitda profitability or positive free cash flow.
id.at.the agency also found the rate would endanger the srs companies planned investment in new satellites.weighing the conflicting evidence in the record,the crj chose an initial rate equal to of revenue,increasing to over the term of the license.
after setting a royalty rate for the companies transmission of musical works,the crj considered what portion of that rate should be attributed to their right to make ephemeral copies of musical works.an ephemeral copy is a digital copy of a sound recording stored on a computer an srs creates an ephemeral copy as an intermediate step toward satellite transmission of the sound recording.
under,the crj is to set the royalty rate for an ephemeral copy at the level most clearly represent ing the fees that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.id.e.finding them to be of little value,however,the crj decided not to set a separate royalty rate for ephemeral copies,but rather deemed the rate for an ephemeral copy embodied in the rate set for the license.
ii.analysis 
we may set aside the crj decision only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a see d section of title shall apply with respect to review by the court of appeals under this subsection,or if the facts relied upon by the agency have no basis in the record,recording indus.ass of am.copyright royalty tribunal.although we have not yet issued a decision in a case involving the crj,we have reviewed a decision of its predecessor applying the four objectives in b.in riaa copyright royalty tribunal we held three distinct aspects of increase the deference we owe the agency.id.first,the agency is required to estimate the effect of the royalty rate on the future of the music industry,which requires a forecast of the direction in which the future public interest lies based on the expert knowledge of the agency.id.second,the agency has legislative discretion in determining copyright policy in order to achieve an equitable division of music industry profits between the copyright owners and users.id.finally,the statutory factors pull in opposing directions,and reconciliation of these objectives is committed to the agency as part of its mandate to determine reasonable royalty rates.id.at see fresno mobile radio,fcc,when an agency must balance a number of potentially conflicting objectives judicial review is limited to determining whether the agency decision reasonably advances at least one of those objectives and its decisionmaking process was regular.
soundexchange argues the crj decision was arbitrary and capricious because the agency misapplied the four objectives in and because the decision was internally inconsistent.the librarian of congress,in turn,argues the crj decision is supported by substantial evidence and that soundexchange has failed to point to any convincing evidence showing the decision was inconsistent.soundexchange,the librarian,and intervenor agree the crj erred by failing to set a rate for the license,although each advocates a different remedy.
