this litigation stems from a dispute over the commercial use of a deceased celebrity image,likeness,and name.the sole heir of deceased rock legend jimi hendrix formed two companies,plaintiffs experience hendrix,and its wholly owned subsidiary,authentic hendrix,collectively experience hendrix.among other things,experience hendrix owns trademarks that it uses to sell and license products related to jimi hendrix.in this litigation,experience hendrix succeeded on its claims alleging that defendants andrew pitsicalis and his company,collectively pitsicalis,were licensing merchandise that infringed experience hendrix trademarks.as a result,the district court permanently enjoined pitsicalis infringing conduct,and a jury awarded experience hendrix damages under two statutes,the federal lanham act and washington consumer protection act.the district court,however,significantly reduced the jury award and,alternatively,ordered a new trial on damages.on the claims of experience hendrix,we vacate the district court permanent injunction so that one paragraph in the injunction may be clarified and reissued.we reverse the court reduction of the damages award.we affirm the district court decision to grant a new trial.finally,we remand experience hendrix claims for further proceedings.
for his part,pitsicalis sought a declaratory judgment declaring that a third statute,washington personality rights act,does not afford the heir of jimi hendrix any postmortem publicity rights.the district court held that the act does purport to give the heir of jimi hendrix publicity rights,which experience hendrix would own.but the district court went on to hold that those portions of the washington personality rights act affording those publicity rights are unconstitutional.we affirm the district court decision interpreting the act to give publicity rights to jimi hendrix heir,but reverse and vacate the holding that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the narrow circumstances presented here.thus,we remand pitsicalis claims as well for further proceedings.
background 
experience hendrix holds a number of trademarks associated with jimi hendrix,including the names hendrix and jimi hendrix and jimi hendrix signature,as well as logos incorporating a headshot of hendrix.experience hendrix uses these trademarks to market,sell and license merchandise,including apparel,posters,and artwork sold to the public through internet websites and retail stores throughout the united states,including the state of washington.
pitsicalis has also used jimi hendrix celebrity status commercially.pitsicalis owns,or has licenses to use,photographs and original pieces of art depicting hendrix,as well as visual artwork created by hendrix himself.in,pitsicalis began licensing the right to use these images to produce and sell merchandise,including apparel,posters and household items.like experience hendrix,pitsicalis licensees sold this merchandise over the internet and in stores.pitsicalis placed marks on his licensed products that used the names hendrix and jimi hendrix,as well as jimi hendrix signature and a logo of hendrix headshot with a guitar.in conducting his business,pitsicalis also used two websites with the domain names and.
in march,experience hendrix sued pitsicalis under two statutes.first,experience hendrix alleged that pitsicalis was infringing experience hendrix trademarks in violation of the federal lanham act,see.second,experience hendrix alleged that this trademark infringement also amounted to an unfair or deceptive trade practice proscribed by washington consumer protection act wcpa,see.the district court granted experience hendrix partial summary judgment on the federal lanham act claim,concluding that pitsicalis had infringed experience hendrix trademarks.the court permanently enjoined pitsicalis infringing activity.at trial,a jury found that pitsicalis trademark infringement also amounted to an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the wcpa.although the jury awarded experience hendrix damages under both statutes totaling,the district court reduced the jury award to.
pitsicalis,in turn,asserted counterclaims against experience hendrix,seeking a judgment declaring that a third statute,washington personality rights act wpra,does not provide experience hendrix with hendrix publicity rights the district court granted pitsicalis summary judgment on these counterclaims,concluding that,while the wpra does afford jimi hendrix publicity rights belonging to experience hendrix,those portions of the wpra providing those rights are unconstitutional.these followed.
ii.discussion 
we address first pitsicalis counterclaims regarding the wpra,before turning to experience hendrix claims.
jimi hendrix publicity rights under the wpra 
through his counterclaims,pitsicalis sought a judgment declaring that the wpra does not apply to publicity rights in jimi hendrix and,therefore,it is possible to trade in original images and likenesses of jimi hendrix without creating a per se infringement of experience hendrix trademark rights.as a threshold matter,experience hendrix contends that pitsicalis lacks article iii standing to assert these declaratory judgment claims.
however,there is no doubt that an actual controversy exists between pitsicalis and experience hendrix under the federal lanham act,in light of this ongoing litigation experience hendrix initiated against pitsicalis.as a result of this litigation,experience hendrix has notified potential customers of products as to experience hendrix trademark rights.and there is no question about experience hendrix standing to assert its lanham act claims against pitsicalis for trademark infringement.
it is within this same litigation that pitsicalis sought a judgment declaring that,under the wpra,experience hendrix has acquired from jimi hendrix no publicity rights,which experience hendrix could use to sue or threaten to sue pitsicalis and his licensees,customers and potential customers.experience hendrix has in fact previously asserted jimi hendrix publicity rights,albeit under an earlier version of the wpra,in prior litigation which resulted in a final ruling that the initial version of the wpra was inapplicable to jimi hendrix.that ruling was based upon principles which required application of new york law.new york was the domicile of jimi hendrix at the time of his death and it did not recognize these rights.experience hendrix,llc electric hendrix,llc,no.tsz,wl,at,unreported.
in,however,the washington legislature amended the wpra to apply it to all individuals and personalities,living and deceased,regardless of place of domicile or place of domicile at time of death.the amended wpra recognizes that every person has a property right in the use of his or her name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness.id.that right existed or exists before,on,or after june,the date the wpra originally took effect,and does not expire upon a person death.id.the amended wpra recognizes such a right of publicity regardless of whether the law of the domicile,residence,or citizenship of the individual or personality at the time of death or otherwise recognizes a similar or identical property right.id.the wpra protects such a right by providing,in part,that a ny person who uses or authorizes the use of a deceased personality name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,on or in goods,merchandise,or products entered into commerce in this state without written or oral,express or implied consent of the owner of the right,has infringed such personality right.id.as amended,then,the wpra created a new possibility that experience hendrix would renew its efforts to assert jimi hendrix publicity rights against pitsicalis,his licensees,customers,and potential customers.
the record here does not reveal any evidence that experience hendrix has explicitly threatened pitsicalis,or his licensees,customers or potential customers with suit under the amended wpra.but pitsicalis alleged that experience hendrix,relying on rights that go beyond its federally protected trademarks,interfered with the sale,by one of pitsicalis licensees to the retailer spencer gifts,of merchandise that did not infringe experience hendrix trademarks in light of all of these circumstances,pitsicalis has a sufficiently legitimate concern that experience hendrix will renew its efforts to assert rights under the amended wpra against pitsicalis and related parties,given experience hendrix past aggressive assertion of its rights related to jimi hendrix,and given the amendment to the wpra that removes the previous impediment to experience hendrix judicial efforts to enforce jimi hendrix publicity rights under that act.see rhoades avon,cir noting that,under the ninth circuit reasonable apprehension test,concrete or explicit threats of litigation are not necessary for a plaintiff to have standing.
the wpra is constitutional as applied to the narrow set of circumstances at issue here 
the parties do not dispute that the amended wpra recognizes personality rights belonging to jimi hendrix,notwithstanding that he died in,before washington originally enacted the wpra he was domiciled in new york at the time of his death and new york law does not recognize a right of publicity that would survive jimi hendrix death and descend to his heir.the parties also do not dispute that,under the wpra,experience hendrix owns jimi hendrix personality rights.notwithstanding that the wpra thus on its face provides experience hendrix with jimi hendrix personality rights,the district court granted pitsicalis summary judgment,declaring that the provisions of the wpra that recognize those personality rights are unconstitutional.we review that decision de novo.see lopez valenzuela cnty.of maricopa,cir.under the narrow,circumstances presented by this case,we disagree with the district court ruling and accordingly reverse.
the narrow,wpra controversy before us,as pitsicalis has alleged it,involves only pitsicalis reasonable apprehension that experience hendrix will use the wpra to stop his attempts to license unofficial products for sale in washington,and pitsicalis licensee unsuccessful attempt to introduce into washington,through his licensee dealings with spencer gifts,goods that bore hendrix image and likeness,but that did not carry marks that infringed experience hendrix trademarks.
washington approach to personality rights raises difficult questions regarding whether another state must recognize the broad personality rights that washington provides.but we need not resolve that issue.here,the limited controversy before us,as pitsicalis has alleged it,involves only experience hendrix interference with the sale in washington of,unofficial but goods bearing hendrix likeness,as well as pitsicalis reasonable apprehension that experience hendrix will attempt to stop such targeted sales in washington in the future 
due faith and credit clauses 
the district court held that applying washington wpra here,instead of the law of new york,the state where jimi hendrix was domiciled at the time of his death,violated principles protected by the due process and full faith and credit clauses of the constitution.those clauses require that,for a state substantive law to be selected and applied to a particular case in a constitutionally permissible manner,that state must have a significant contact or significant aggregation of contacts,creating state interests,such that choice of its law is neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair.allstate ins.hague,d 
washington has sufficiently significant contacts with the actual,controversy at issue here,which involves the loss of sales in washington of goods.therefore,because these contacts are sufficient to give washington an interest in applying its own law to this controversy,it is not arbitrary or unfair to apply the wpra here see see also at t mobility llc au optronics,cir noting that allstate places only modest restrictions on the application of forum law,and most commentators have viewed allstate as setting a highly permissive standard internal citation omitted.
dormant commerce clause 
the district court also held that applying the wpra to this case would violate the dormant commerce clause,which limits the power of states to enact laws imposing substantial burdens on interstate commerce.see ass of optometrists opticians harris,cir.the district court reasoned that,although the wpra does not discriminate against interests,to apply the wpra to the controversy at issue here would,nevertheless,give the wpra an impermissible extraterritorial reach,encompassing a variety of transactions occurring wholly outside washington borders.however,the limited,controversy at issue here,does not affect transactions occurring wholly outside washington.am.trucking ass ns.pub.serv.comm n,d holding michigan flat tax on activities taking place exclusively within that state did not violate the dormant commerce clause.nor does the record suggest that the application of the wpra to the limited,controversy at issue here would otherwise impermissibly burden interstate commerce.see id.at.
conclusion as to pitsicalis declaratory judgment claims 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the wpra can be applied constitutionally to the narrow controversy at issue here.we,therefore,reverse the district court decision to grant pitsicalis summary judgment on his declaratory judgment claims and we remand those claims to the district court with instructions for the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of experience hendrix.see gospel missions of am.city of los angeles,cir even when there has been no for summary judgment,a district court may enter summary judgment sua sponte against a moving party if the losing party has had a full and fair opportunity to ventilate the issues involved in the matter.internal quotation marks omitted.
trademark infringement and deceptive trade practices 
we turn now to the claims experience hendrix asserted against pitsicalis.experience hendrix claims against pitsicalis are premised on allegations that pitsicalis infringed several of experience hendrix trademarks related to jimi hendrix.experience hendrix asserted trademark infringement claims under two different statutes.first,experience hendrix brought a claim under the federal lanham act specifically alleging trademark infringement.the district court ultimately ruled as a matter of law that pitsicalis had in fact infringed several of experience hendrix trademarks.
second,experience hendrix brought a claim against pitsicalis under the washington consumer protection act wcpa,which prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices.under the wcpa,experience hendrix alleged that pitsicalis conduct in infringing experience hendrix trademarks amounted to an unfair or deceptive trade practice proscribed by the wcpa.a jury found that pitsicalis had in fact committed an unfair trade practice by infringing experience hendrix trademarks.
on appeal,pitsicalis challenges only one aspect of the district court conclusion that he is liable for infringing experience hendrix trademarks pitsicalis argues that his domain names and did not violate the federal lanham act by infringing experience hendrix trademark hendrix.we uphold the district court determination that the domain names did infringe experience hendrix trademark hendrix.
experience hendrix sought several remedies to redress pitsicalis infringing conduct under both the federal lanham act and wcpa.first,experience hendrix sought an injunction permanently enjoining pitsicalis from further infringing experience hendrix trademarks.the district court entered such a permanent injunction,but experience hendrix,nevertheless,challenges language the court included in that injunction.we conclude that one sentence of the injunction is sufficiently unclear to require a remand so the district court can clarify what conduct is and is not enjoined.
experience hendrix also sought damages,under both the federal lanham act and the wcpa,to compensate experience hendrix for pitsicalis past infringement.the jury awarded experience hendrix several different measures of damages under both acts,totaling over million.the district court struck all but of that award.on appeal,experience hendrix seeks reinstatement of the jury entire damages award.we agree with experience hendrix that it was error for the district court,under.b,to set aside all but of the jury award.there was legally sufficient evidence to support that award.however,the district court,alternatively,ruled that,if our court reinstated the jury damages award,as we do here,then a new trial on damages is warranted under rule.we conclude that the district court alternative ruling for a new trial was not an abuse of discretion and we,therefore,remand for a new trial limited to the issue of damages.
finally,experience hendrix requested an award of attorney fees in the amount of over.the district court awarded a much smaller amount.experience hendrix challenges the court denial of much of its attorney fee request.we vacate the fee award and remand for the district court reconsideration because many of the factors on which the district court based its attorney fee decision have now changed.
pitsicalis liability under the federal lanham act for using domain names that infringed experience hendrix trademark hendrix 
the district court granted experience hendrix partial summary judgment,concluding pitsicalis had infringed several of experience hendrix trademarks.on appeal,pitsicalis challenges only one aspect of that ruling,arguing that the district court erred in determining that his domain names,and,infringed experience hendrix trademark hendrix.we review that determination de novo see lopez valenzuela,at.
pitsicalis defended his use of the trademark hendrix in his domain names only as nominative fair use.nominative fair use applies where a defendant has used the plaintiff mark to describe the plaintiff product.fortune dynamic,victoria secret stores brand,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court rejected pitsicalis nominative fair use defense,concluding that pitsicalis used hendrix in his domain names to refer,not to experience hendrix products as is required for a nominative fair use defense,but only to pitsicalis own product or service,licensing and marketing goods which is not protected under the nominative fair use defense on appeal,pitsicalis does not argue that his domain names refer to experience hendrix products.nor does he contend that jimi hendrix is experience hendrix product.see cairns franklin mint,cir.we,therefore,affirm the district court decision to enter partial summary judgment for experience hendrix.
paragraph of the permanent injunction is inadequate 
after concluding that pitsicalis infringed several of experience hendrix trademarks,the district court issued injunctive relief under the lanham act,permanently enjoining pitsicalis infringing conduct.experience hendrix,the beneficiary of that injunction,argues that paragraph of the injunction fails to state clearly the terms of the injunction and does not describe in reasonable detail the acts that are and are not restrained.see.d.we agree with experience hendrix in part.
briefly summarized,paragraph iii iv of the challenged injunction permanently enjoins pitsicalis from using pitsicalis guitar and headshot logo or any similar mark,brand,or logo,and from using the jimi hendrix signature set forth in the injunction,or any similar signature,mark,brand,or logo.but then,contrary to that provision,the first sentence in the challenged paragraph states that n othing in this permanent injunction shall be construed as enjoining,prohibiting,or otherwise inhibiting pitsicalis or any other entity or person from creating,reproducing,advertising,distributing,selling,or otherwise commercially trading in images or likenesses of jimi hendrix.these two provisions appear to be in some conflict or at least are ambiguous when read together.thus,in this particular,the injunction does not clearly state what conduct is and is not restrained.we,therefore,vacate the permanent injunction and remand to the district court to revise the permanent injunction in order to clarify what conduct is and is not restrained.
we reject experience hendrix challenges to the rest of paragraph.the second sentence of paragraph states that t he court makes no ruling concerning whether images or likenesses of jimi hendrix might be otherwise protected by copyright laws.the district court did not abuse its discretion in including this language in the permanent injunction,see skydive,quattrocchi,cir,because this language only clarified that the district court had not ruled on any possible infringement of experience hendrix copyrights because experience hendrix never alleged a copyright claim.see id.at an injunction should be tailored to eliminate only the specific harm alleged.internal quotation marks omitted.
the third and final sentence of paragraph states that nothing in this permanent injunction shall be construed as enjoining,prohibiting,or otherwise inhibiting defendants or any other entity or person from using the names or marks jimi hendrix or hendrix to identify the subject of an associated image or the author or creator of an associated work of art.this language does not conflict with the injunction earlier language specifically precluding pitsicalis from using hendrix in its business and domain names.nor does this third sentence,contrary to experience hendrix argument,affirmatively permit pitsicalis or anyone else to infringe experience hendrix trademarks hendrix and jimi hendrix.instead,this language accurately indicates that the district court never ruled on experience hendrix claims,abandoned in the district court,which alleged that pitsicalis use of the names hendrix and jimi hendrix to describe the images pitsicalis used in his unofficial products infringed experience hendrix trademarks hendrix and jimi hendrix.in this regard,the district court again properly limited the terms of the injunction to the specific claims before it,and then only to those claims on which experience hendrix prevailed.see skydive,at see also toyota motor sales,tabari,cir noting that court must tailor injunction to eliminate only the specific harm alleged quoting gallo winery gallo cattle,cir aspex eyewear,marchon eyewear,noting,in patent infringement case,the frequent admonishment that district courts are not to issue sweeping injunctions against potentially infringing activities,but to restrict the scope of the injunction to the particular adjudicated infringing activity.
in sum,the first sentence in paragraph of the permanent injunction stating that n othing in this permanent injunction shall be construed as enjoining,prohibiting,or otherwise inhibiting defendants or any other entity from creating,reproducing,advertising,distributing,selling,or otherwise commercially trading in images or likenesses of jimi hendrix conflicts with the earlier provisions of the injunction restraining pitsicalis from using a jimi hendrix guitar and headshot logo or any similar mark,brand or logo.we,therefore,vacate the permanent injunction and remand to the district court to clarify what conduct is and is not enjoined.
damages under both the federal lanham act and the wcpa 
in addition to seeking an injunction permanently enjoining pitsicalis from infringing experience hendrix trademarks,experience hendrix also sought damages to compensate it for pitsicalis past infringement.there are two related issues involving damages that we must address,one involving the district court order entering a greatly reduced damages award under.b,and the other involving the district court alternative order granting a new trial on damages under.
as to the first damages issue,the jury awarded experience hendrix a total of over million,which represented measures of damages under both the federal lanham act and the wcpa.the district court,however,struck most of that award under.b and entered a substantially reduced damages award.experience hendrix appeals that decision.as explained in greater detail below,the legal standard applicable to rule b motions requires that a court uphold the jury award if there is any legally sufficient basis to do so.application of that particular standard here dictates that we reverse the district court and reinstate the jury entire damages award.
the second issue regarding damages involves the same damages awards,but this time under rule provisions.rule provides a different legal standard for both the district court and for us.regarding a rule motion,the district court can weigh the evidence,make credibility determinations,and grant a new trial for any reason necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice.the appellate court reviews the district court determination of these matters for an abuse of discretion.those standards require that we affirm here the district court grant of a new trial under rule,even though we reverse the district court decision to grant pitsicalis judgment as a matter of law under rule b.
overview of the jury award of damages under the federal lanham act and the wcpa 
based on pitsicalis infringing experience hendrix trademarks in violation of the lanham act,the jury awarded experience hendrix,representing the profits pitsicalis made from licensing his infringing goods and to compensate experience hendrix for the profits experience hendrix lost because of pitsicalis infringing conduct see a providing that party establishing trademark infringement can recover the defendant profits from infringing the trademark and any damages sustained by the plaintiff.
finding that this same trademark infringement also amounted to an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the wcpa,the jury further awarded experience hendrix a total of in damages under that statute.the wcpa award represented apparently the same in lost profits for experience hendrix as a result of pitsicalis unfair trade practices,for injury to experience hendrix reputation,and for experience hendrix loss of goodwill.
after the jury verdict,the district court granted pitsicalis.b motion and struck,as unsupported by the evidence,all of the damages awarded except the award under the lanham act for the profits pitsicalis made from infringing experience hendrix trademarks alternatively,the district court conditionally granted pitsicalis a new trial under,in the event this court reinstated the jury damages award.here,we reinstate the damages award,but then affirm the district court alternative ruling under rule that the award of damages should be vacated and set for a new trial.
at first glance,our resolution first reinstating the jury damages award and then affirming the district court decision to have a new trial on damages may seem contradictory.but our decision is consistent with the differing standards that governed the district court consideration of pitsicalis rule b and rule motions,as well as the differing standards by which we review the district court determination of those motions.
in considering a rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court must uphold the jury award if there was any legally sufficient basis to support it.costa desert palace,cir.in making that determination,the district court considers all of the evidence in the record,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,experience hendrix the court may not make any credibility determinations or reweigh the evidence.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d.because we review the district court rule b decision de novo,we apply those same legal standards on appeal.see go daddy software,at.
unlike with a rule determination,the district court,in considering a rule motion for new trial,is not required to view the trial evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.instead,the district court can weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.see kode carlson,cir per curiam.the district court also is not limited to the grounds a party asserts to justify a new trial,but may sua sponte raise its own concerns about the damages verdict.see.d.ultimately,the district court can grant a new trial under rule on any ground necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice.see murphy city of long beach,cir.we afford considerable deference to the district court new trial decision and will not overturn the district court decision to grant a new trial absent an abuse of discretion,meaning only when the district court reaches a result that is illogical,implausible,or without support in the inferences that may be drawn from the record.kode,at.
with these different legal standards in mind,we consider first the district court rule b decision to vacate most of the jury damages award,and then we address the district court rule new trial decision.
b.the district court erred in striking under.b most of the damages awarded by the jury 
to recap,the district court,acting under rule b,struck the jury award of lost profits under both the federal lanham act and the wcpa,and it struck the damages awards,made under the wcpa,for loss of goodwill and reputation.we review the district court determination de novo,and we will uphold the jury award if there was any legally sufficient basis to support it.costa,at.
i.the jury damages award for experience hendrix lost profits 
for the amount of profits experience hendrix lost as the result of pitsicalis infringing conduct,the jury returned two identical awards of,one under the federal lanham act and one under the wcpa on appeal,no one contends that a different analysis applies to the calculation of lost profits under the wcpa than applies under the federal lanham act.in fact,the parties already stipulated that lost profits under the wcpa are the same as the lost profits under the lanham act for the purposes of awarding double recovery.therefore,we address here the jury identical awards for lost profits under the lanham act and the wcpa together.in doing so,we conclude that,under the circumstances of this case and in light of our standard of review,the evidence was sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to calculate the profits experience hendrix lost due to pitsicalis infringing conduct.see skydive,at in a trademark action,the nature of the proof required to support a jury award depends on the circumstances of the case 
the district court instructed jurors that they were to calculate profits by deducting all expenses from gross revenue.it was experience hendrix burden to prove its damages.see lindy pen bic pen,cir applying a.in striking the jury award for experience hendrix lost profits,the district court held that,while experience hendrix had presented evidence of its lost revenue,it had failed to offer any evidence as to its expenses,which the jury was required to deduct from the lost revenue in order to calculate experience hendrix lost profits.
during the jury instruction conference,after the close of evidence,experience hendrix acknowledged that it had not presented the jury with any evidence of its expenses.this was because experience hendrix mistakenly believed that it bore the burden of proving only its lost revenue and that,once it had made that showing,the burden shifted to pitsicalis to prove any expenses that jurors should deduct in order to calculate experience hendrix lost profits.the lanham act applies this framework to proof of the defendant infringer lost profits.see a.but the burden remained with experience hendrix,as the plaintiff,to prove its actual damages,including its own lost profits.see lindy pen,at.
notwithstanding experience hendrix confusion as to the burdens of proof,there was sufficient evidence before the jurors from which they could calculate the profits experience hendrix lost due to pitsicalis infringing conduct.that evidence included the following there was undisputed evidence that,at the same time that pitsicalis was licensing his infringing goods,experience hendrix suffered a significant decline in its own licensing revenue earned from products similar to pitsicalis infringing merchandise.there was also testimony describing the nature of licensing revenue generally as a licensee payment to the licensor of a percentage of the licensee revenue in return for the use of the licensor intellectual property.in addition,the jury had before it financial documents,including exhibit,which summarized and compared experience hendrix licensing revenue from through.exhibit referred to experience hendrix licensing revenue as total income,gross profits,net ordinary income,and net income,without reflecting any deductions from the licensing revenue for expenses.the terms net income and net ordinary income in exhibit suffice to support the jury finding that those figures were after adjustment for costs and were,as represented,net income.testimony describing licensing revenues generally further suggested that there were no incremental costs saved in connection with the loss of that revenue attributed to pitsicalis.from this evidence,then,a reasonable jury could have found that,because much of experience hendrix revenue was licensing revenue,there were no incremental expenses that the jury had to deduct from the relevant licensing revenue before jurors calculated experience hendrix lost profits,or if there were incremental costs,they had already been taken into account in preparing exhibit.dspt int l,nahum,cir recognizing that the nature of the proof as to damages under a depends on the circumstances of the case,and upholding a jury award of actual damages,based in part on testimony and financial statements indicating a decline in gross profits.there was,thus,sufficient evidence presented at trial to enable the jury award of experience hendrix lost profits to survive the rule b motion.so we conclude that the district court erred in granting the rule b motion to vacate the damages of in experience hendrix lost profits 
ii.the jury damages award for experience hendrix loss of goodwill and reputation 
the jury also awarded experience hendrix in damages for harm pitsicalis caused to its reputation and for the loss of goodwill.the jury awarded these measures of damages only under the wcpa.see.state physicians ins.exch.ass fisons,en banc d amage to business reputation and loss of goodwill are also compensable damages under the w cpa.the district court,in granting pitsicalis rule b motion,struck these awards of damages after concluding there was no evidence to support them.again,we reverse in light of the standards governing rule b.
there was significant evidence to support the jury finding of the fact that pitsicalis deceptive trade practices injured experience hendrix reputation and goodwill.as to the amount of that harm,the jury had evidence regarding the total licensing revenue that experience hendrix earned during the period of time before and during pitsicalis infringing activity.from this information,jurors could have calculated the amount of harm pitsicalis caused to experience hendrix business reputation and goodwill with reasonable certainty.lewis river golf,scott sons,en banc see.state physicians,at damages for loss of professional reputation are not the type of damages which can be proved with mathematical certainty and are usually best left as a question of fact for the jury.specifically,this evidence indicated that experience hendrix overall licensing revenue declined by during,the period during which pitsicalis was infringing experience hendrix trademarks.that information provided a legally sufficient basis for the jury award of a total of in damages for harm to experience hendrix reputation and goodwill and thus permitted these damage awards to survive pitsicalis rule b motion 
c.the district court did not abuse its discretion in conditionally granting experience hendrix a new trial on damages 
the district court conditionally granted pitsicalis a new trial on damages under both the federal lanham act and the wcpa in the event,which has now occurred,that this court reinstated the jury damages awards.see.c.we affirm the district court decision granting a new trial,in light of the significant deference we owe the district court determination that a new trial is warranted.see kode,at.unlike with the district court rule b analysis,the district court,in considering pitsicalis motion for a new trial,was not required to draw all inferences in favor of the verdict and could reweigh the evidence and make credibility determinations.id.the district court also was not limited to the grounds pitsicalis raised in support of his new trial motion,but instead could and did sua sponte raise its own concerns about the damages award.see.d.and our standard of review of the district court ruling also differs from the de novo standard governing our review of a district court rule b decision.the district court decision on a rule motion for a new trial will be overturned on appeal only for abuse of discretion.kode,at.
the district court can grant a new trial under rule on any ground necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice.see murphy,at.in this case,the district court specifically concluded that a new trial was warranted because the damages awards were against the clear weight of the evidence and the product of speculation,error,and disregard of the court instructions.we must uphold the district court if any of its grounds for granting a new trial are reasonable.united states acres of land,cir.for the following reasons,we conclude the district court reasons are sufficient to warrant a new trial on both experience hendrix lost profits and damages for its loss of reputation and goodwill.
new trial on damages for lost profits 
the district court concluded that the jury damages award of,representing the profits experience hendrix lost as the result of pitsicalis infringement of experience hendrix trademarks,was against the clear weight of the evidence.briefly stated,the district court was not convinced that the references on experience hendrix exhibit to total income,gross profits,net ordinary income,and net income should be equated to profits,without further evidence indicating that there were,in fact,no expenses that should be deducted from experience hendrix licensing revenue before it is deemed a measure of lost profits.this determination alone might not have been sufficient to support the district court decision to grant a new trial on damages.see ace aetna life ins,cir recognizing that a more stringent standard of review applies to grants of new trials predicated on insufficiency of the evidence.but the district court also disbelieved the testimony of one of experience hendrix corporate officers,robert hendrix,that of experience hendrix drop in licensing revenues during the relevant time period,was the result of pitsicalis infringing products and not attributable to the general market economic downturn that occurred during this same time period.the district court based its credibility determination in part on the fact that experience hendrix licensing revenues on its other products,which would not have been affected by pitsicalis infringing goods,fell by more than during this same time.we can not say that the district judge,who heard the evidence presented at trial,abused its discretion in ordering a new trial on lost profits on these bases 
ii.new trial on damages for loss of reputation and goodwill 
as previously stated,the jury awarded experience hendrix,under the wcpa,for harm to its reputation and for the loss of goodwill.the district court granted a new trial on these damages as well,concluding that these damage awards were both contrary to the clear weight of the evidence and contrary to the district court instruction to the jury that these measures of damages were essentially the same thing.
the evidence experience hendrix presented at trial to support the amount of these damages,though sufficient to provide a legal basis for the jury award,was minimal at best.further,the jury award of differing amounts of damages for loss of reputation and for loss of goodwill directly contradicted the court supplemental instruction to jurors that these two measures of damages are essentially the same.jorgensen cassiday,cir considering the merits of an argument that the jury disobeyed trial court instructions,before rejecting that argument,concluding that t he jury did not disobey the court instructions and did not return a verdict that was unreasonable or unfair.
moreover,reading the court supplemental instruction in light of the district court instructions as a whole,jury confusion appears likely.see overseas private inv.metro.dade,cir granting new trial on damages where jury instructions were confusing,resulting in a confusing damages award.the court original instructions told jurors to consider these two
