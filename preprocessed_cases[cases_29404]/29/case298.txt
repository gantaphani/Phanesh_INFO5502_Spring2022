we consider whether los angeles police officers violated an individual constitutional rights by arresting him for his suspected role in the theft of oscar statuettes to be presented by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences on academy awards night in march.
anthony hart alleges various constitutional injuries arising from two march and again in august his suspected role in the theft of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences oscar statuettes because the claims are numerous and the issues presented are even more numerous,the facts are set out in some detail.
on march,the executive director of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences suspected that the oscar statuettes,which had recently been shipped from the manufacturer in chicago,were missing and possibly stolen.roadway express shipping roadway had been hired to deliver the trophies.the academy contacted the los angeles police department lapd,which assigned detectives marc zavala and robert rivera,members of its burglary auto theft division,to investigate.zavala had investigated cargo thefts for years and rivera had investigated cargo thefts for three years.
zavala and rivera began their investigation by interviewing jon gerloff,roadway security chief.gerloff told the detectives that the oscars had been scanned off at the los angeles roadway that they had arrived in los had not arrived at the academy in hollywood,the proper delivery address.after exhaust ing every route and or scenario as to where the oscars may have been mistakenly shipped,the detectives and gerloff concluded that the oscars had been stolen from the los angeles roadway facility on march,at some time between am and am.zavala and rivera began interviewing potential witnesses.rivera spoke with one employee who identified anthony hart as a known thief who had approached him hoping to steal macy merchandise shipped via roadway.zavala subsequently confirmed that a macy trailer had been recently stolen from the roadway facility.zavala spoke with a second man who stated that hart was involved in the theft.when zavala interviewed hart,hart only disclosed that he was a forklift driver for roadway and gave his home address in la puente.hart refused to discuss the oscar theft,explaining that he was not a snitch.
after further discussions with roadway employees,zavala and rivera concluded,in part on the basis of their combined experience investigating cargo theft,that the pound wooden pallet containing the oscars had likely been taken off the dock with a forklift.the detectives further concluded that the heist likely required at least two parties a truck driver and a forklift operator.
the next day,zavala and rivera privately announced a reward for information about the theft of the oscar statuettes.the detectives disclosed the award only to roadway dockworkers,and detective rivera saw hart in the crowd.the award announcement generated two significant leads.first,gerloff informed zavala and rivera that roadway received an anonymous call stating that hart was involved in the theft of the statuettes.second,a daniel pearson called roadway and left a message about the reward.pearson stated that an individual who wanted to turn in the oscars and collect the reward had retained him.when pearson phoned roadway,the award had not been made public.suspecting his possible involvement in the theft or his association with those involved in the theft,lapd officers conducted a surveillance of pearson.officers saw pearson drive from his law offices to hart residence in la puente.
on march,zavala and rivera met again with the roadway informed them that the reward had increased to.as happened after announcing the first award,gerloff reported receiving another anonymous phone a different also stated that hart was involved in the oscar theft.similarly,within minutes of offering the increased reward,pearson again called zavala seeking the reward.according to zavala,
pearson called me and told me that they have the stuff.pearson wanted my assurance that nothing is going to happen to them and that they would in fact get paid the reward money.pearson also told me he heard from his client the reward money was now fifty thousand dollars and they expected to be paid that amount.
pearson requested that a copy of the reward information be faxed to his office and stated that in exchange he would deliver the oscars to an undisclosed location.as with the offer,only roadway employees knew of the reward.
based on the timing of pearson phone calls,the detectives inferred that pearson was in contact with a roadway employee.because pearson had recently driven to hart home,the detectives concluded that pearson and hart knew each other and that hart had called pearson about the reward after the detectives announced it.
in addition to the two phone calls gerloff received,zavala also received an anonymous phone call on march.the anonymous caller told zavala that he had been working at roadway on march that he had personally seen hart steal the pallet containing the oscar statuettes and that hart had placed the pallet inside a trailer driven by a lawrence larry.the caller told zavala that hart and larry had worked together on the theft.
zavala and rivera attempted to corroborate the information in the anonymous tip.they examined roadway timesheets and confirmed that both hart and a truck driver named larry ledent were working on the morning of the theft.further,the heist as described fit with the detectives theory that any theft would require at least two participants a forklift operator and a truck driver.based on the detectives experience,they believed that a teamster would not rat on a fellow employee.therefore,the detectives surmised that the tipster remained anonymous because he was a teamster,and therefore likely a roadway employee 
on march,zavala also learned that both ledent and hart had prior arrests and convictions for theft.later the same day,zavala and rivera went to hart residence in la puente and questioned him outside his home.zavala requested hart consent to search his home for the statuettes,but hart refused.the detectives then informed hart that he would be taken to lapd headquarters for questioning.before they departed the scene,aubrey hart,anthony hart brother,arrived.after discovering that aubrey had an outstanding narcotics warrant,the police arrested him and transported with his brother police headquarters for further questioning.
after zavala and rivera detained anthony hart,they discovered that hart sister was the wife of daniel pearson.hart and pearson,therefore,were also on march,but after hart arrest,two detectives went to larry ledent home.ledent was taken to police headquarters for questioning,and he confessed that he and hart had stolen the oscars.according to ledent,on march,hart placed the oscars into ledent trailer and said i got something in there for you.ledent and hart had apparently stolen other merchandise in the same manner on three occasions in the prior two months.
on march,the lapd,roadway,the academy,and the city of bell police conducted a joint press conference to announce the recovery of the oscars.hart name was mentioned only once during the press conference when chief bernard parks stated that two suspects have been arrested for grand theft we arrested anthony keith hart and lawrence edward ladent sic,both employees of roadway express.
on march,roadway fired hart for violating roadway policy against dishonesty by participating in the oscar theft.roadway termination letter did not refer to or otherwise mention the press conference.
on march,three days after hart arrest,the detectives presented their arrest and investigation reports to the district attorney.the district attorney office,however,concluded that there was insufficient evidence at that point to prosecute hart who was thereupon released from custody.
over the next five months,zavala and rivera continued to investigate and discovered additional evidence incriminating hart.this evidence included telephone records reflecting phone calls between hart and ledent at the time of the theft and retrieval of the oscars the statement of ron sandoval,another roadway employee,that hart had called pearson and ledent from sandoval home on march a statement from larry ledent that hart had two of the missing oscars a statement by steve jordan that he delivered one or two oscars to hart at ledent request a roadway security tape showing hart on the loading dock near ledent trailer,where the oscars were last seen roadway records reflecting that there was no reason hart should have been near ledent trailer confessions by larry ledent and john harris admitting they stole the oscars with hart and stored them in harris home.
on august,the district attorney impaneled a grand jury.detectives zavala and rivera,roadway security chief gerloff,and attorney daniel pearson testified and the grand jury indicted hart on august.hart was on the warrant on august and on august,pled not guilty to a single charge of grand theft.
on february,the district attorney added a charge of receiving stolen property to which hart also pled not guilty.the charge of grand theft was subsequently dropped,and on october,hart changed his plea to nolo contendre on the charge of receiving stolen property and received a sentence of three years probation.
hart subsequently brought these suits against los angeles police officers,but also individuals from the academy and the district court,under,alleging a variety of injuries stemming from his allegedly unconstitutional arrests.in hart parks,docket number hart i,hart alleged that his march arrest was unconstitutional in hart parks docket number hart ii,hart alleged that his august arrest was unconstitutional.after various motions to dismiss and for summary judgment,the district court dismissed suit against all defendants except parks,david kalish lapd chief,zavala,and rivera collectively,police officers.the district court subsequently granted summary judgment for the police officers in both hart i and hart ii.hart appeals from the district court orders have been consolidated here 
hart argues that his march arrest was unconstitutional for two reasons first,that he was arrested in his home without a warrant second,that he was arrested without probable cause 
payton new york,d,the warrantless arrest of a suspect inside his residence.although hart was arrested outside his home,he rightly notes that we have recognized constructive payton violations.see united states,cir.in,we held that the payton warrant rule applied when police officers surrounded the suspect trailer,drew their weapons,and directed him with a bullhorn to exit the residence.id.at.the suspect only left his residence under circumstances of extreme coercion.id.
here,hart has proffered no admissible evidence that he was coerced into leaving his house the only valid evidence in the record is the detectives declarations,which state that they requested that hart speak with them outside.all admissible evidence shows that hart was asked to leave his house and did so free from coercion,let alone free from circumstances of extreme coercion commensurate with those presented in.id.at.there is no triable issue of fact as to whether the warrantless arrest occurred inside the home.
hart next contends that police lacked probable cause to arrest him in march.
probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officers knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the plaintiff had committed or was committing an offense.bailey newland,cir quoting beck ohio,d.police must only show that,under the totality of the circumstances,a prudent person would have concluded that there was a fair probability that the suspect had committed a crime.united states valencia amezcua,cir quoting united states garza,cir.
detectives zavala and rivera had substantial evidence tending to show that hart had a role in the theft of the statuettes.the police learned that hart was working during the period in which the oscars were stolen,that he drove a forklift,and that hart was working at the same time as ledent a truck driver meaning that hart was capable of,and had ample opportunity to,commit the theft.because the detectives were investigating a possible theft,it is particularly relevant that both hart and ledent had prior convictions for theft.greenstreet county of san bernardino,cir citation omitted prior convictions may also support probable cause,especially where the previous arrest or conviction involves a crime of the same general nature as the one the warrant is seeking to uncover.united states in united states currency,cir same.further,and perhaps most relevant,the police knew that hart associated with pearson,who had called them,claiming to know the location of the stolen property.the police could reasonably assume that only someone involved in the theft would know the location of the oscars,meaning that hart was very likely involved in the theft.on top of all this,roadway security director received two anonymous tips implicating hart,and the police received a third tip implicating hart and ledent,all of which were valuable even if not corroborated.united states roberts,cir.
considering this evidence under the totality of the circumstances a prudent person would have concluded that there was a fair probability that hart had committed a crime,at citation and quotation omitted.the police had probable cause to arrest hart in march.
hart,however,argues that despite this overwhelming evidence,there remains a triable issue of fact as to whether the officers had probable cause to arrest him.hart main contention is that zavala and rivera relied upon hearsay and other unsubstantiated information in determining they had probable cause.see,br.of appellant hart i at,this argument is meritless police may rely on hearsay and other evidence that would not be admissible in a court to determine probable cause p robable cause may be founded upon hearsay and upon information received from informants,as well as upon information within the affiant own knowledge that sometimes must be garnered hastily.franks delaware,d see also spinelli united states,d a ffidavits of probable cause are tested by much less rigorous standards than those governing the admissibility of evidence at trial.internal citation omitted.
similarly,we reject hart related contention that the district court improperly considered the detectives declarations because they are not valid evidence under federal rule of civil procedure e which requires that affidavits submitted on summary judgment must be made on personal knowledge.br.of appellant hart ii at.keeping in mind that the issue was whether the police had probable cause to arrest,while the detectives did not have personal knowledge of whether the oscars were actually stolen,they did have personal knowledge of the information they had received at the time of hart arrest.the detectives declarations,therefore,are a perfectly proper basis for summary judgment determination of probable cause.
similarly,hart questions whether the police officers presented valid evidence that the statuettes were ever actually stolen.again,this is immaterial.it is irrelevant whether the police had admissible evidence proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the oscars were stolen at the time they arrested hart.hart central allegation is that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him.here,a prudent person could conclude that a pallet of merchandise that disappeared,under the circumstances presented here,had been stolen.of course,it was impossible to definitively conclude that the missing pallet had been stolen until it had been found yet that does not mean that police lack probable cause to arrest until they have confirmed a theft beyond a reasonable doubt.
hart next contention is that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him because the facts gave rise to a variety of inferences,some of which supported hart innocence.see,br.of appellant hart i at.of course,facts may always give rise to a variety of inferences.yet,it is settled law that officers may draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information
