in this case,producers and owners of copyrighted television programming sued ivi,ivi and its chief executive officer,todd weaver,for streaming plaintiffs copyrighted television programming over the internet live and without their consent.the district court granted a preliminary injunction for plaintiffs,holding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of the case because ivi was not a cable system entitled to a compulsory license under of the copyright act,plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief the balance of hardships favored the grant of a preliminary injunction and the issuance of a preliminary injunction did not disserve the public interest.defendants appeal.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
statement of the case 
the following facts are undisputed.
on september,ivi began streaming plaintiffs copyrighted programming over the internet,live,for profit,and without plaintiffs consent ivi began by retransmitting signals from approximately thirty new york and seattle broadcast television stations by february,ivi was also retransmitting signals from stations in chicago and los angeles within five months of its launch,ivi had offered more than of plaintiffs copyrighted television programs to its subscribers.
specifically,ivi captured and retransmitted plaintiffs copyrighted television programming live and over the internet to paying ivi subscribers who had downloaded ivi tv player on their computers for a monthly subscription fee of following a day free trial.for an additional fee of per month,subscribers were able to record,pause,and rewind ivi streams.
almost immediately after ivi launch,several affected program owners and broadcast stations sent letters to ivi.ivi responded to these letters on or about september,purporting to justify its operations on the ground that it was a cable system entitled to a compulsory license under of the copyright act.

discussion 
we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.kickham hanley kodak ret.income plan,cir.a district court abuses its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction when its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or when its decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.id.in a copyright case,a district court may grant a preliminary injunction when plaintiffs demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction a balance of the hardships tipping in their favor and of the public interest by issuance of a preliminary injunction.salinger colting,cir.we discuss each prong of salinger in turn.
likelihood of success on the merits 
under the copyright act,television broadcasters generally have exclusive rights to authorize the public display of their copyrighted content,including the retransmission of their broadcast signal s.echostar satellite,see.congress,however,codified an exception to this exclusive right in of the copyright act permitting cable systems to publicly perform and retransmit signals of copyrighted television programming to its subscribers,provided they pay royalties at rates and abide by the statute procedures.see c exception,d royalties copyright office,satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act section report shvera report.
in this case,it is undisputed that plaintiffs owned valid copyrights to the television programming that ivi publicly performed without plaintiffs consent.see ivi,d at.the burden of proof thus falls on defendants to demonstrate that they have an affirmative statutory defense to copyright infringement.see bourne walt disney,cir noting possession of license by accused infringer is affirmative defense and burden falls on licensee to prove license existence citing united states larracuente,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright.indeed,defendants argue that ivi is a cable system entitled to a license under the copyright act.
thus,the principal issue presented is whether ivi,a service that streams copyrighted television programming live and over the internet,constitutes a cable system under of the copyright act.if so,ivi has a statutory defense to plaintiffs claims of copyright infringement,and ivi is entitled to a compulsory license to continue retransmitting plaintiffs programming.see satellite broad.and commc ns ass of am.oman,cir.if not,ivi has no defense to plaintiffs claims of infringement.see id.at.
as discussed below,the copyright office the federal agency charged with overseeing has spoken on the issue of whether compulsory licenses extend to internet retransmissions.accordingly,we utilize the process outlined in chevron,natural res.def.council,d.at chevron step one,we consider whether congress has clearly spoken on the issue of internet retransmissions in.see id.at.cohen jp morgan chase,cir.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter courts must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if we determine that congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,we proceed to chevron step two,which instructs us to defer to an agency interpretation of the statute,so long as it is reasonable.cohen,at quoting chevron,at.
chevron step one 
to ascertain congress intent at chevron step one,we begin with the statutory text if its language is unambiguous,no further inquiry is necessary.cohen,at citing zuni pub.sch.dist.dep t of,d robinson shell oil,d daniel am.bd.of emergency,cir.if the statutory language is ambiguous,we look to the canons of statutory construction,and then to the legislative history to see whether any interpretive clues permit us to identify congress clear intent.cohen,at citing dynamics land,cline,d accord daniel,at.
the statutory text 
section c of the copyright act provides 
s econdary transmissions to the public by a cable system of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by the federal communications commission shall be subject to statutory licensing upon compliance with the requirements of subsection d where the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is permissible under the rules,regulations,or authorizations of the federal communications commission.
c a cable system is defined as 
a facility,located in any state,territory,trust territory,or possession of the united states,that in whole or in part receives signals transmitted or programs broadcast by one or more television broadcast stations licensed by the federal communications commission,and makes secondary transmissions of such signals or programs by wires,cables,microwave,or other communications channels to subscribing members of the public who pay for such service.for purposes of determining the royalty fee under subsection d,two or more cable systems in contiguous communities under common ownership or control or operating from one headend shall be considered as one system.
based on the statutory text alone,it is simply not clear whether a service that retransmits television programming live and over the internet constitutes a cable system under.that is,it is unclear whether such a service is or utilizes a facility that receives and retransmits signals through wires,cables,microwave,or other communication channels.see f 
among other things,it is certainly unclear whether the internet itself is a facility,as it is neither a physical nor a tangible entity rather,it is a global network of millions of interconnected computers.contacts,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also akamai,cable wireless internet,aclu reno,the internet exists and functions because hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange communications and information with other computers there is no centralized storage location,control point,or communications channel for the internet,aff,reno aclu,d.when content is viewed over the internet,the viewing computer typically receives information from several different servers.see akamai,at.additionally,the growth of systems,or virtual platforms where content resides remotely on a distant server,further highlights the uncertainty as to whether an internet retransmission service is or utilizes a facility that receives and retransmits television signals.see privacy info.ctr.sec.agency.
as congress intent is not apparent from the statutory text,we turn to legislative history to see if any interpretive clues permit us to identify congress clear intent as to whether ivi constitutes a cable system under.see cohen,at internal quotations marks omitted.
legislative history 
cable systems were built in the late to bring television programming to remote or mountainous communities and households that could not receive broadcast television signals because of their geographic location.turner broad,fcc,d citing united states sw.cable,d brenner,price meyerson,cable television and other nonbroadcast video hamburg,all about cable,ch.see shvera report,supra,at.
in and,before congress passed the copyright act of,the supreme court held that retransmissions of broadcast programming by cable systems did not constitute copyright infringement under the copyright act of because such retransmissions were not performances.see teleprompter columbia broad,d,superceded by,as recognized in capital cities cable,crisp,d fortnightly united artists television,d same.as a result,cable systems were able to retransmit broadcast television programming without obtaining licenses or incurring any fees.the teleprompter court,however,concluded that if the copyright act of was inadequate to govern the commercial relationships that had emerged in the interim,it was for congress to create a substitute.mpaa,at citing teleprompter,at.
in,congress responded to the supreme court decisions by enacting.balancing two societal benefits,congress enacted to enable cable systems to continue providing greater geographical access to television programming while offering some protection to broadcasters to incentivize the continued creation of broadcast television programming.shvera report,supra,at see crisp,at.compulsory licensing not only protects the commercial value of copyrighted works but also enhances the ability of cable systems to retransmit such programs thereby allowing the public to benefit by the wider dissemination of works carried on television broadcast signals.microwave,at mpaa,at.section compulsory license thus enabled cable systems to bypass the transaction costs and impracticalities of negotiating individual licenses with dozens of copyright owners,while simultaneously ensuring that copyright owners were compensated.see crisp,at.shvera report,supra,at.
in,the eleventh circuit held that a satellite carrier was a cable system covered by compulsory licensing scheme.see broad,satellite broad.networks,cir,superceded by,as recognized in oman,see also echostar,at.in,rather than incorporate satellite technology as a communications channel under,congress responded to the eleventh circuit decision by codifying a separate statutory license for satellite carriers under of the copyright act.see the satellite home viewer act of shva.in,congress noted that in creating compulsory licenses,it is acting in derogation of the exclusive property rights granted by the copyright act to copyright holders,and that it therefore needs to act as narrowly as possible to minimize the effects of the government intrusion on the broader market in which the affected property rights and industries operate,at tasini times,cir where the copyright act sets forth exceptions to a general rule,we generally construe the exceptions narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision.alterations omitted quoting commissioner clark,d.
finally,in,congress expressly included microwave as an acceptable communications channel for retransmissions.see f.congress has not codified a statutory provision for internet retransmissions,nor has it included the internet as an acceptable communication channel under 
legislative intent 
the legislative history indicates that congress enacted with the intent to address the issue of poor television reception,or,more specifically,to mitigate the difficulties that certain communities and households faced in receiving broadcast signals by enabling the expansion of cable systems.see turner,at.crisp,at.microwave,at mpaa,at shvera report,supra,at.
through compulsory license scheme,congress intended to support localized rather than nationwide systems that use cable or optical fibers to transmit signals through a physical,connection between a transmission facility and the television sets of individual subscribers.turner,at.citing cmty.commc ns boulder,cir 
congress did not,however,intend for compulsory license to extend to internet transmissions.indeed,the legislative history indicates that if congress had intended to extend compulsory license to internet retransmissions,it would have done so expressly either through the language of as it did for microwave retransmissions or by codifying a separate statutory provision as it did for satellite carriers.see.
extending compulsory license to internet retransmissions,moreover,would not fulfill or further congress statutory purpose.internet retransmission services are not seeking to address issues of reception and remote access to television signals.they provide not a local but a nationwide arguably international service.
accordingly,we conclude that congress did not intend for compulsory license to extend to internet retransmissions.to the extent that there is any doubt as to congress intent,however,we proceed to chevron step two,and we conclude that the position of the copyright office eliminates such doubt in its entirety.
chevron step two 
the copyright office is the administrative agency charged with overseeing compulsory licensing scheme.see d oman,at mpaa,at.although congress has not expressly delegated authority to the copyright office to make rules carrying the force of law,agencies charged with applying a statute certainly may influence courts facing questions the agencies have already answered.united states mead,d.to determine the appropriate amount of deference to an agency administering a statute,courts have looked to the degree of the agency care,its consistency,formality,and relative expertness,and to the persuasiveness of the agency position.id.at.citing skidmore swift.the weight accorded to the copyright office interpretations depend s upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade.id.at.quoting skidmore,at.see also morris bus.concepts,cir oman,at.
the copyright office has consistently concluded that internet retransmission services are not cable systems and do not qualify for compulsory licenses.in,the copyright office concluded that internet retransmission services,so vastly different from other retransmission industries now eligible for compulsory licensing,were not entitled to a compulsory license.copyright office,a review of the copyright licensing regimes covering retransmission of broadcast signals.in,the register of copyrights the register asserted that the section license does not and should not apply to internet retransmissions.copyright broadcast programming on the internet hearing before the subcomm.on courts and intellectual property of the comm.on the judiciary,cong.statement of marybeth peters,the register of copyrights quoting letter of marybeth peters,register of copyrights,to the honorable howard coble.the register further concluded that if there were to be a compulsory license covering such retransmissions,it would have to come from legislation and not existing law.id.
in,the copyright office stated 
the office continues to oppose an internet statutory license that would permit any website on the internet to retransmit television programming without the consent of the copyright owner.such a measure,if enacted,would effectively wrest control away from program producers who make significant investments in content and who power the creative engine in the economy.in addition,a internet license would likely undercut private negotiations leaving content owners with relatively little bargaining power in the distribution of broadcast programming.
shvera report at.it continued to hold this position in.see copyright office,satellite television extension and localism act report,melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright e matthew bender ed.
more broadly,the copyright office has maintained that compulsory license for cable systems is intended for localized retransmission services under this interpretation,internet retransmission services are not entitled to a license.see,codified at see also oman,at.with respect to satellite carriers,the copyright office has stated examination of the overall operation of section proves that the compulsory license applies only to localized retransmission services regulated as cable systems by the fcc,see also,t he office retains the position that a provider of broadcast signals be an inherently localized transmission media of limited availability to qualify as a cable system.citing.july.
to reach this conclusion,the copyright office has explained that f refers to headends and contiguous communities,which are inapplicable to nationwide retransmission service.the copyright office also noted that defines a distant signal equivalent with reference to television stations within whose local service area the cable system is located.id because satellite carriers provide nationwide retransmission service and because they are not located in their local service area,the copyright office concluded that satellite carriers were not cable systems under.id.under this interpretation,internet retransmission services can not constitute cable systems under because they provide nationwide and arguably global services.
finally,the copyright office has consistently recognized that reference to other communications channels should not be read broadly to include future unknown services,such as satellite,multipoint distribution mmds,and satellite master antenna television smatv transmissions.id.at.in,in response to whether future unknown services could qualify for compulsory licenses,the copyright office concluded that because the act did not consider the public policy implications of extending a compulsory license to these services,the copyright office should not assert the authority to interpret the copyright act in this way.id.at.
in light of the copyright office expertise,the validity of its reasoning,the consistency of its earlier and later pronouncements,and the consistency of its opinions with congress purpose in enacting,we conclude that the copyright office position is reasonable and persuasive.see mead,at.
accordingly,applying chevron,we hold that the statutory text is ambiguous as to whether ivi,a service that retransmits television programming over the internet,is entitled to a compulsory license under the statute legislative history,development,and purpose indicate that congress did not intend for licenses to extend to internet retransmissions the copyright office interpretation of that internet retransmission services do not constitute cable systems under aligns with congress intent and is reasonable and accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of the case.
ii.irreparable injury 
we next turn to whether the district court abused its discretion in finding that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction that is,harm to the plaintiff legal interests that could not be remedied after a final adjudication.see kickham,at abuse of discretion salinger,at irreparable harm.harm may be irreparable where the loss is difficult to replace or measure,or where plaintiffs should not be expected to suffer the loss.salinger,at.under salinger,courts may no longer simply presume irreparable harm rather,plaintiffs must demonstrate that,on the facts of the case,the failure to issue an injunction would actually cause irreparable harm.id.at citing ebay,mercexchange,d.courts must pay particular attention to whether the remedies available at law,such as monetary damages,are inadequate to compensate for the injury.id.at quoting ebay,at.
we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction.first,ivi live retransmissions of plaintiffs copyrighted programming over the internet would substantially diminish the value of the programming.second,plaintiffs losses would be difficult to measure and monetary damages would be insufficient to remedy the harms.third,ivi would be unable to pay damages should plaintiffs prevail.
first,ivi actions harm plaintiffs retransmission and advertising revenues by substantially diminishing the value of their copyrighted programming.retransmission consent is a substantial and growing revenue source for the television programming industry.plaintiffs obtain retransmission revenue by licensing the right to retransmit their copyrighted television programming to cable,satellite,and telecommunications providers.see ivi,d at.plaintiffs broadcast their copyrighted programming to various communities at different scheduled times,for example,based on time zone or local network provider.for this reason,negotiated internet retransmissions for example,on typically delay internet broadcasts as not to disrupt plaintiffs broadcast distribution models,reduce the live broadcast audience,or divert the live broadcast audience to the internet.
if ivi were allowed to continue retransmitting plaintiffs programming live,nationally and arguably,internationally,over the internet,and without plaintiffs consent,ivi could make plaintiffs programming available earlier in certain time zones than scheduled by the programs copyright holders or paying retransmission rights holders.ivi retransmissions of plaintiffs copyrighted programming without their consent thus would devalue the programming by reducing its live value and undermining existing and prospective retransmission fees,negotiations,and agreements.ivi retransmissions would dilute plaintiffs programming and their control over their product.
the value of plaintiffs programming would also be harmed by the impact on advertising revenue.broadcast television stations and networks earn most of their revenues from advertising.plaintiffs argue persuasively that advertisers pay substantial fees to target specific audiences such fees are often determined by the number of viewers and their demographic profiles.ivi retransmissions of plaintiffs copyrighted programming over the internet increases the number of internet viewers and reduces,fragments,and diverts the number of local viewers.see lisa lapan,network television and the digital threat,ucla ent,see also michelle hull,sports leagues new social media policies enforcement under copyright law and state law,colum.arts.as a result,ivi retransmissions weaken plaintiffs negotiating position with advertisers and reduce the value of its local advertisements.see,mpaa,at local advertisers will not pay extra to reach viewers who can not reasonably be expected to patronize their businesses,so the revenue base from which to compensate the owners understates the value of the use of the materials,and the copyright holders would be undercompensated.citing sources.
indeed,ivi actions streaming copyrighted works without permission would drastica
