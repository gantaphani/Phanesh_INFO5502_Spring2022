in order to use the recording in the baked lays commercial,bbdo purchased the synchronization rights from duchess music corporation on behalf of jobim and gimbel music group on behalf of gimbel.bbdo also purchased a license to use the master recording from polygram records.it paid more than for the licenses.apparently believing that gilberto had retained no rights in the recording,bbdo did not seek her authorization to use it in the ad.
