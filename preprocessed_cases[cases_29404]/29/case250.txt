procedure is a means to an end,not an end in handmaid rather than the mistress of justice.charles clark,history,systems and functions of pleading.while district courts enjoy a wide latitude of discretion in case management,this discretion is circumscribed by the courts overriding obligation to construe and administer the procedural rules so as to secure the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.these consolidated appeals arise from a district court refusal to exercise discretion consistent with the dictates of rule.
amir cyrus ahanchian counsel moved for a extension of time to file his opposition to defendants summary judgment motion,citing as good cause the extremely short eight day response deadline with three of those days falling over a federal holiday weekend created by the combination of an unusual local rule and defendants litigation tactics his preplanned absence,beginning the day defendants filed the motions,in fulfillment of an commitment and the large number of supporting exhibits attached to defendants motion.defense counsel,without regard to the previous professional courtesies extended to him by ahanchian counsel,vigorously opposed the extension.despite the presence of what most reasonable jurists would regard as good cause and the absence of prejudice to anyone,the district court denied the motion.even so,ahanchian counsel managed to file the opposition,albeit three days late,due to a calendaring mistake and computer problems,along with a motion asking that the district court accept the opposition.five days later,the district court construed that motion as one for reconsideration under rule b,and,applying an incorrect legal standard,denied it.that same day,having plaintiff opposition in hand,but refusing to consider it,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,failing to provide any legal reasoning or citation to law or facts to add injury to insult,the district court awarded defense counsel in attorneys fees.we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying both the request for an extension of time and the motion to accept the opposition,and erred in granting defendants motion for summary judgment and in awarding attorneys fees to defense counsel.
factual and procedural background 
these appeals arise from the creation of the movie national lampoon tv the movie,theatrically released in november.unlike traditional films,this movie eschews plot or character development,instead lampooning several high profile television programs in a series of independent comedic skits.this lawsuit involves the disputed authorship of a number of these skits.ahanchian claims that ten skits he authored and subsequently copyrighted either appear verbatim in the movie or serve as the basis for skits included in the final version of the movie.
ahanchian filed a complaint on september,against sam maccarone director and writer of the film,preston lacy writer and actor,xenon pictures,distributor,and ckrush,producer asserting causes of action for copyright infringement,breach of an implied contract,and unfair competition in violation of the lanham act.apparently,maccarone and lacy were difficult to locate.defense counsel for xenon pictures,who had been appointed by the district court to represent maccarone and lacy,sought additional time to answer ahanchian complaint on their behalf.exhibiting the professional courtesy expected of officers of the court,ahanchian counsel stipulated to an extension of stipulation the district court then rejected.
on january,the district court issued its scheduling order establishing,among other deadlines november,as the date for the commencement of trial september,as the discovery date and september,as the last day for hearing motions.maccarone and lacy did not file their answer to the complaint until june.because of maccarone and lacy late entrance into the litigation,the parties entered into a joint stipulation on july,seeking to extend by twelve weeks all the deadlines established by the scheduling order to allow more time for discovery.the district court again denied the stipulated extension of time,finding that the parties had failed to demonstrate good cause as to why discovery could not be completed by september.
because the district court scheduling order set september,as the last day for hearing motions,the local rules in force at the time made august,the last date to file any motion for summary judgment.see cal.local requiring that any motion be filed within days before the hearing date.though there is no indication in the record that they did so,the defendants assert that they informed ahanchian counsel on august,that they would be filing a motion for summary judgment.on august,the last possible day for filing,the defendants moved for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all of ahanchian claims and for terminating sanctions resulting from a discovery dispute.these motions were accompanied by roughly pages of supporting exhibits and declarations.because the defendants chose to wait until the last day to file their motions,the local rules operated to set a deadline of september,day after labor ahanchian to review these materials and to prepare and file his oppositions.ahanchian,therefore,was left with a mere eight days,three over the labor day weekend,to draft his oppositions to the motions.see cal.local requiring any opposition to be filed no later than fourteen days before the hearing date.a c extending deadlines by an additional day where a deadline would otherwise fall on a holiday.also,ahanchian lead counsel was scheduled to travel out of state on august to fulfil a commitment 
given the already unreasonably strained deadlines,within which fell an commitment and labor day weekend,on august,ahanchian asked defense counsel to stipulate to a continuance of the hearing date for defendants motions,along with corresponding extensions of the deadlines for ahanchian to file oppositions and for defendants to reply.defense counsel refused to so stipulate.the very next day,on august,ahanchian filed an ex parte application pursuant to local rule seeking a extension.ahanchian recited as good cause for the requested extension of time that defendants had waited until the last day to file their motions,choosing to file four days before the labor day weekend,and with knowledge of pending depositions the accompanying motions and exhibits amounted to pages of materials ahanchian lead counsel had left the state on august on a prescheduled trip and would not be returning until september and ahanchian,who was needed to respond to the motion,was also out of town over labor day weekend.ahanchian noted that n o party will suffer any prejudice should the court grant the continuance.
defendants opposed the motion,arguing that ahanchian had failed to demonstrate good cause.specifically,they argued that ahanchian counsel knew or should have known that the motions would be filed no later than august yet,for reasons unexplained,this is precisely the date plaintiff counsel decided to travel out of state.why no reason is offered.in a footnote,the defendants posed some hypothetical possibilities a family emergency a conflicting priority or a vacation to mexico the point is,it is not explained.absence sic explanation,good cause can not be discerned.as for prejudice,defendants made the weak and false arguments that the requested continuance would give ahanchian several weeks to prepare an opposition,and yet defendants would have only one week to file their reply.they also asserted that they would have less time to prepare for trial.in point of fact,ahanchian had requested extensions of time to file both his opposition and for the defendants replies.had ahanchian request been granted,defendants would have had the full time allowed by the local rules to reply.moreover,the trial was not scheduled to commence for another three months.
ahanchian ultimately filed his opposition to the summary judgment motion three days late,on september,at which time he also filed an ex parte application seeking permission to make the late filing on september,defendants responded by reiterating their opposition to any extension of time,and urging the district court to ignore the late opposition.they further suggested that ahanchian counsel representation that he believed the deadline was september was disingenuous,and that ahanchian had failed to adequately explain the technical computer problems that had resulted in the delay.
on september,in a order,the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion in full.it simultaneously denied ahanchian ex parte motion,concluding,without citing any record support,that ahanchian,apparently not pleased with the court ruling,had simply failed to file timely oppositions.the court construed ahanchian september,ex parte application as a federal rule of civil procedure b motion for reconsideration of its denial of ahanchian august,request for a extension.the court then denied the motion,citing three authorities a fifth circuit decision concluding that the inadvertent mistake of counsel was not a sufficient ground to excuse missing a filing deadline a sixth circuit decision rejecting calendaring errors as justification for reconsideration and,finally,an inapposite ninth circuit decision that suggests a party should sue its lawyer for malpractice rather than bring a rule b motion when it comes to regret an action based on erroneous legal advice.
meanwhile,in its summary judgment order,the court correctly observed that ninth circuit precedent bars district courts from granting summary judgment simply because a party fails to file an opposition or violates a local rule,and also correctly cited its obligation to analyze the record to determine whether any disputed material fact was present.it then effectively flouted both legal principles stating that it had reviewed only the defense evidence,even though it knew the opposition papers were already filed,having ruled upon the accompanying motion for a late filing.unsurprisingly,based on only defendants version of the facts,the court concluded that defendants were not liable on any claim and granted judgment in their favor.
ahanchian timely appeals the district court procedural rulings,the grant of summary judgment,and the award of attorneys fees.
ii.standard of review 
the district court denial of an extension of time pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b is reviewed for abuse of discretion,see kyle campbell soup,cir,as is a court denial of a rule b motion,see united states asarco,cir.accordingly,we reverse where the district court applied the incorrect legal rule or where the district court application of the law to the facts was illogical implausible or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the record.united states hinkson,cir en banc.
iii.discussion 
ahanchian argues that the district court abused its discretion first in denying his request for a extension of time to file his opposition to defendants summary judgment motion and then in denying his application to file that opposition late.we agree.
federal rule of civil procedure b provides 
in general.when an act may or must be done within a specified time,the court may,for good cause,extend the time 
a with or without motion or notice if the court acts,or if a request is made,before the original time or its extension expires or 
b on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.
b.this rule,like all the federal rules of civil procedure,is to be liberally construed to effectuate the general purpose of seeing that cases are tried on the merits.rodgers watt,cir quoting staren american bank trust of chicago,cir see also.the federal rules should be construed and administered to secure the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.consequently,requests for extensions of time made before the applicable deadline has passed should normally be granted in the absence of bad faith or prejudice to the adverse party.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.
the circumstances of ahanchian predicament clearly demonstrate the good cause required by rule b.good cause is a standard that has been construed broadly across procedural and statutory contexts.see.sonolux records,cir thomas brennan,cir lolatchy arthur murray,cir.to begin with,ahanchian faced an exceptionally constrained deadline resulting from the peculiar dictates of the local rules for the central district of california 
compounding the problem,this deadline followed immediately upon labor day which even the federal courts are closed.by taking advantage of the unusual local rules,defendants cut ahanchian time to respond to two dispositive motions to five business days and three days over the holiday weekend.see.a c.as was certainly neither unreasonable nor unexpected,both ahanchian and his attorney were out of town over labor day weekend,and,moreover,as he informed the district court,ahanchian lead counsel was in fulfillment of a commitment from the day defendants chose to file their motions through the day the responses were due 
critically,the record is devoid of any indication either that ahanchian counsel acted in bad faith or that an extension of time would prejudice defendants.to the contrary,the record reflects that ahanchian counsel acted conscientiously throughout the litigation,promptly seeking extensions of time when necessary and stipulating to defendants earlier request for an extension of time to file their answer and to the extension due to two defendants late appearances.moreover,defendants argument that they would be prejudiced by only having a week to reply while ahanchian would have had several weeks to draft an opposition is unpersuasive and neglects the fact that in the overwhelming majority of districts,more time is given for drafting oppositions than for drafting replies.see,cal.local a,c cal.local e.had the district court had any doubts about the veracity or good faith of ahanchian counsel,or been worried about prospective prejudice,it could have held an evidentiary hearing or sought more information instead,without support in the record,it summarily denied ahanchian request.
the record shows that ahanchian requested relief was reasonable,justified,and would not result in prejudice to any party.the district court nevertheless denied ahanchian motion,thus effectively dooming ahanchian case on the impermissible ground that he had violated a local rule.because ahanchian clearly demonstrated the good cause required by rule,and because there was no reason to believe that ahanchian was acting in bad faith or was misrepresenting his reasons for asking for the extension,the district court abused its discretion in denying ahanchian timely motion.
we next turn to the district court denial of ahanchian september,ex parte application to allow his opposition,which the court construed as a rule b motion for reconsideration of its denial of ahanchian rule motion for an extension.rule b provides that a court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding on the basis of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.b.the court denied ahanchian application after concluding that ahanchian had not demonstrated excusable neglect.in so doing,however,the district court failed to cite the correct legal standard,applying an incorrect legal standard for deciding rule b motions 
to determine whether a party failure to meet a deadline constitutes excusable neglect,courts must apply a equitable test,examining the danger of prejudice to the opposing party the length of the delay and its potential impact on the proceedings the reason for the delay and whether the movant acted in good faith.pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,briones riviera hotel casino,cir adopting this test for consideration of rule b motions.through other decisions,including bateman postal,cir,and pincay andrews,cir en banc,we have further clarified how courts should apply this test.
in bateman,we concluded that when considering a rule b motion a district court abuses its discretion by failing to engage in the equitable balancing test.bateman,at.bateman counsel had left the country before fili
