white submits the demo to universal 
white attempted to generate interest in the demo cd at various record companies.he had a business relationship with adbul fakir,a former member of the singing group the four tops,and white consulted with fakir about potential contacts within the music industry.andy mckaie,senior vice president of artists and repertoire for universal music enterprises,a division of universal music group recordings,was one of the record executives fakir knew,and fakir permitted white to use his name as a reference with mckaie.mckaie division at universal does not publish new music it songs in compilations,such as greatest hits albums.

defendants creation of family affair 
family affair is the second song on blige album entitled no more drama,which was released for commercial sale by universal on august,and registered with the copyright office on september.blige is a nationally known artist,and no more drama was a commercial success,selling more than two million copies.the musical portion of family affair was created by andre young,a producer and performer of rap and music publicly known as dre.young was originally named as a defendant in this case,but the district court dismissed the claims against him for lack of personal jurisdiction,a ruling that plaintiffs do not appeal.
as a producer,young typically creates musical tracks in a studio with several other musicians and then provides those tracks to other artists who record vocals over them.young created an initial version of the musical portion of family affair on september,as evidenced by a studio log and a recording bearing that date.young testified that he created this initial version in a studio with a bass player and a keyboard player.the studio engineers working with young entitled this version of the song fragile for purposes.several months later,on january,fragile was transferred from digital to analog format and,by that point,had been renamed family affair.young testified that either blige or her brother,songwriter bruce miller,supplied the new name.the january,version of the portion of family affair was in form.

d.the district court decision 
after discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment for defendants lewis and lodge on two bases first,because plaintiffs failed to respond to a request for admissions that the lyrics of the two songs were not substantially similar and that lewis and lodge had no access to the lyrics of party ai crunk,the district court deemed plaintiffs to have conceded these points second,the court found that,even reaching the merits,no reasonable juror could find the lyrics of the two songs to be substantially similar.the district court also granted summary judgment to the remaining defendants,finding that plaintiffs could not show that those defendants had access to plaintiffs song and that,in any case,defendants had shown that they created family affair independently.during the course of the litigation,the district court excluded both sides proposed expert because plaintiffs failed to make her available for deposition on the date and defendants for reasons not apparent from the record.after prevailing on their motion for summary judgment,defendants sought attorneys fees,which the district court denied,finding that defendants could not establish the factors that would support a discretionary award of fees.
