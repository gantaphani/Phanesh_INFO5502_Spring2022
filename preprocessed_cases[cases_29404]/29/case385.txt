the principal issue in this case is whether a statement made by a slightly unhinged character in a motion picture,american hustle columbia pictures,was made in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest within the meaning of the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute.code civ,subd.e.we hold that it was,and we also conclude plaintiff failed to show a probability of prevailing on his defamation and related claims.we reverse the trial court order denying defendants special motion to strike the complaint.
we briefly summarize the facts,and then describe the evidence presented in the moving and opposition papers.we will elaborate on the facts as necessary in our discussion of the legal issues.
the parties and the movie 
plaintiff paul brodeur is a author in the environmental field,pointing out health dangers of the use of various electrical devices and other household items.among his many books is the zapping of america microwaves,their deadly risk,and the coverup hereafter the zapping of america.
defendants atlas entertainment,annapurna productions llc,doing business as annapurna pictures and columbia pictures industries,are producers and distributors of the motion picture american hustle.
the film,set in,is a century screwball farce about century con men,and uses the reality of a late fbi sting operation known as abscam which led to bribery convictions of a number of elected officials as a taking off point.turan,pros and cons crime caper shakes things up in style,los angeles times,turan review.one film critic describes the film this way american hustle giddily embraces the excesses of its era,from spandex to staches,though it a farce that speaks as well to this tarnished age.some of its extravagances are purely decorative but all the shiny surfaces,the glitter ball and the gaudiness,also suggest a world in which everyone is anxious to shake off the war,funk.the ghost of richard nixon hovers in the air everyone is a fake and everyone wears a mask,even richie,the agent with the chia pet perm.dargis,big hair,bad scams,motormouths,the new york times,dargis review.
in one scene in the film,one of the subjects of the sting operation carmine polito,the mayor of a city in new jersey has given the principal character,con artist irving rosenfeld,a new microwave oven.irving asks what it is,and carmine explains that it cooks food it science,that how it heats up the food,it scientific and tells him not to put metal in it.in a later scene,irving slightly unhinged wife,rosalyn,causes the new microwave oven to explode by putting in it a container of food covered in tin foil,despite her husband instructions not to put metal in the science oven.in the ensuing argument,rosalyn says that she read,in a magazine article by plaintiff,that a microwave oven takes all of the nutrition out of our food.it empty,just like your deals.this is the dialogue 
irving i told you not to put metal in the science oven,what did you do that or 
rosalyn do make such a big deal just get another one.
irving i do want another one,i want the one that carmine the new jersey mayor whom irving is conning gave me.
rosalyn oh,carmine i want the one that carmine gave me carmine carmine why do you just marry carmine get a little gold microwave and put it on a chain around your neck you wan na be more like carmine why do you build something,like he does instead of all your empty deals they just like your fuckin science oven.you know,i read that it takes all of the nutrition out of our food it empty,just like your deals.empty empty 
irving listen to this bullshit.
rosalyn it not bullshit i read it in an article,look by paul brodeur.rosalyn hands irving an article.
rosalyn bring something into this house that gon na take all the nutrition out of our food and then light our house on fire thank god for me.
based on rosalyn statement which,after adjusting his glasses and looking at the magazine rosalyn has handed to him,irving does not contradict,plaintiff sued defendants.he alleged causes of action for libel,defamation,slander and false light,asserting that he had never made the quoted statement,and that by misquoting him,defendants have suggested to the movie audience that brodeur made a scientifically unsupportable statement,damaging his reputation.
the special motion to strike the complaint 
defendants filed a special motion to strike the complaint,contending the complaint was based on speech that is of public interest or concerns a person in the public eye,and that plaintiff could not show a probability of prevailing on his claims.
defendants contended all causes of action were based solely on production and distribution of a movie,american hustle,which is about a matter of public interest,that is,the abscam operation and the culture of the decade in which it took place.defendants pointed out that any issue in which the public is interested is of public interest nygard,uusi kerttula th,nygard,and the film uncontroverted critical success was evidence of its public interest.
in support of their motion,defendants lodged a dvd of american hustle,and presented evidence that the film was a highly acclaimed motion picture which,among its many accolades,was nominated for academy awards and won three golden globe awards,including best picture comedy or musical.a declaration from donald gordon,counsel for defendants,covered several topics.
first,gordon declaration stated that t he safety of microwave ovens has been a matter of public controversy since at least the early,in large part because of the writings of the plaintiff,paul brodeur.the declaration tells us that plaintiff authored a series of articles in the new yorker later revised and published as a book,the zapping of america,highlighting his conviction that microwaves,including those emitted by microwave ovens,represent a serious threat to the health of the american people.gordon declaration quotes from and attaches excerpts from the zapping of america,including plaintiff questioning of the overall safety of microwave ovens and references to claims that microwaves may cause eye cataracts.
the declaration also describes plaintiff interview published in people magazine,in which he predicted an avalanche of litigation arising from the widespread use of microwaves in american society.in that interview,plaintiff was asked if there is any danger in eating food cooked by microwaves,and he responded,none that is known.
second,gordon declaration describes the film,and the character who utters the allegedly defamatory statement.rosalyn is established early in the film as an emotionally unstable character prone to outrageous behavior.when she first appears in the film,she and irving are talking about the fire she started with her new sunlamp.just stop with the whole fire thing.god,it was a mistake.i sure a million people do that.all the time.those sunlamps are dangerous.should even have them in the house really.throughout the movie,rosalyn is portrayed as an untrustworthy person and a font of misinformation,who will share her observations with anyone.
third,gordon describes the farcical scene complained of by plaintiff in which rosalyn attempts to use a series of red herrings to distract her husband irving from criticizing her regarding her destruction of the microwave oven 
finally,gordon declaration stated that c laims that the government safety standard for microwave ovens is inadequate,such as those made in plaintiff articles and books,have been rejected by numerous authorities,as evidenced by reports in the new york times july,and websites for the food and drug administration and the american cancer society.
plaintiff opposition 
plaintiff opposition contended that the statute does not apply,because the specific conduct that forms the basis of the lawsuit is plaintiff alleged comments about microwave radiation,while the topic addressed in american hustle is the abscam scandal,and defendants fail to draw any connection between the abscam scandal and plaintiff defamation and claims plaintiff relied heavily on dyer childress th,dyer while movies involve free speech,not all speech in a movie is of public significance and therefore entitled to protection under the statute.the issue turns on the specific nature of the speech rather than generalities abstracted from it.
as evidence supporting his opposition to defendant motion,plaintiff filed two declarations from his counsel,leon friedman and ian rivamonte.
friedman declaration presented evidence to complete plaintiff qualifications,showing the high esteem that plaintiff holds in the field of environmental dangers to the human community,a reputation that is undermined by misquoting him about an accepted and acknowledged environmental issue.friedman evidence included pages from plaintiff website showing the many honors plaintiff has received in his campaign against environmental dangers created by humans his four books on health hazards and various awards plaintiff received for the articles on which the books were based his articles on the dangers from depletion of the ozone level and related awards articles about hazardous substances in household detergents,chemicals in drinking water,and carcinogenic and reproductive hazards of anesthetic gases to anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists.
friedman also stated that plaintiff pioneering articles on the health hazards associated with exposure to microwave radiation won an award and were the basis for a book the zapping of america recognized by the new york times as one of the notable books of.plaintiff articles on the hazards of exposure to electromagnetic fields won a public service award and became the basis for two later books currents of death and the great power line cover up.
a declaration from ian rivamonte presented copies of plaintiff complaint reviews of american hustle by two film critics the dargis review and the turan review and an article about plaintiff in people magazine the microwave menace is zapping us all,warns writer paul brodeur interview with paul brodeur.
defendants reply 
in reply,defendants contended the dyer case was inapplicable because the plaintiff there was not a public figure,and later case law defines public interest issues in extremely broad terms.defendants also pointed out that plaintiff ignored that the movie subjects included not only the abscam scandal itself,but the broader late culture that produced it even the narrower issue about the public unease concerning microwaves was highlighted in the sole scene that is the focus of plaintiff complaint.all three topics are indisputably matters of public interest public issues as those terms have been broadly defined.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court denied defendants motion.defendants filed a timely notice of appeal.
after the parties briefed the case,we granted a request from businesses,associations and advocacy organizations to file an amici curiae brief in support of defendants.amici curiae also filed a motion requesting judicial notice of exhibits.these include the legislative history for bills that enacted the amendment to section exh.gg,supporting a broad interpretation of section articles from the federal government regarding abscam exh.ff and the safety of the microwave oven exhs.b i,to illustrate the public interest in these two subjects and various other articles,biographies,lists and news releases that are said to demonstrate the significant public interest in the subjects at issue in this case including the film itself,the culture of the,the abscam scandal,the safety of microwave ovens,and plaintiff.plaintiff has not opposed the request for judicial notice,and we grant the request.
discussion 
we review the applicable legal principles and then turn to their application in this case.
the legal principles 
a defendant may bring a special motion to strike any cause of action arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.as relevant here,an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,subd.e,or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
when ruling on an motion,the trial court employs a process.it first looks to see whether the moving party has made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,equilon.if the moving party meets this threshold requirement,the burden then shifts to the other party to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its claims.ibid.in making these determinations,the trial court considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b hms capital,lawyers title th,in opposing an motion,the plaintiff can not rely on the allegations of the complaint,but must produce evidence that would be admissible at trial.
our review is de novo.soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,fn.
as we observed at the outset,we conclude defendants made the necessary threshold showing that plaintiff complaint arose from protected activity,and plaintiff failed to produce evidence legally sufficient,if credited,to support a judgment in his favor.
a.the first prong protected activity 
the dispute in this case is over whether the public interest element of the statute has been satisfied,subd.e.we note a few preliminary points.
first,it is beyond dispute that movies involve free speech.dyer,supra,th at.
second,it is likewise beyond dispute that the statute,including the scope of the term public interest,is to be construed broadly.nygard,supra,th at discussing cases and legislative history of amendment adding the directive to construe the statute broadly.nygard concludes taken together,these cases and the legislative history that discusses them suggest that an issue of public interest within the meaning of section,subdivision e is any issue in which the public is interested.in other words,the issue need not be significant to be protected by the statute it is enough that it is one in which the public takes an interest.id.at.
third,case precedent confirms there is a public interest in the writing,casting and broadcasting of an episode of a popular television program.tamkin cbs broadcasting,th,tamkin.rejecting a claim that the defendants were not entitled to protection because the defendant screenwriter could have used fictional names,instead of the plaintiffs real names,in casting synopses that were leaked and posted on various web sites,tamkin said as stated in a different context,t he creative process must be unfettered,especially because it can often take strange turns,as many bizarre and potentially offensive ideas are suggested,tried,and,in the end,either discarded or used we must not permit juries to dissect the creative process in order to determine what was necessary to achieve the final product and what was not,and to impose liability for that portion deemed unnecessary.creativity is,by its nature,creative.it is unpredictable.much that is not obvious can be necessary to the creative process.id.at,quoting lyle warner brothers television productions cal th,conc.opn.of chin,addressing workplace sexual harassment claim.
with these principles in mind,we think it clear that plaintiff causes of action arise from defendants protected activity within the meaning of the statute.plaintiff,by his own account,is a public figure,a prolific,author in the environmental field.the views expressed in his pioneering articles on the health hazards associated with exposure to microwave radiation were plainly a matter of public interest in the,and his claims that the government safety standard for microwave ovens was inadequate have been rejected by numerous authorities
