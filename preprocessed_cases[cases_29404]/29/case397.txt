factual and procedural history 
on november,respondent,doing business as productions,filed a complaint against brewer and his wholly owned and controlled corporation,brewer media associates,in los angeles superior court.in the complaint,respondent alleged that he is a documentary film maker who made a documentary film entitled,blacks without borders chasing the american dream in south africa.respondent had employed brewer as a cameraman to shoot the film on a deferred compensation basis,which meant that brewer would not be paid until the film was released.respondent further alleged that brewer work on the film was unsatisfactory and required respondent to hire another cameraman and reshoot much of the footage.the costs of the reshoot exceeded the deferred compensation that respondent had agreed to pay brewer.
respondent further alleged that brewer has claimed without any legal basis that he and respondent were partners in producing the f ilm,that he or brewer media owns the footage used in the f ilm.respondent also alleged that brewer filed a lawsuit in against respondent in the los angeles small claims court,case no.lav lawsuit.in that lawsuit,brewer claimed that he and respondent were partners,that respondent had misappropriated partnership assets,and that he was entitled to a share thereof.the matter went to trial and resulted in a finding that respondent owed nothing to brewer.
respondent stated three causes of action in his complaint.in the first cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relationship,respondent alleged that he entered into a contract with showtime on or about october,whereby respondent granted a license to showtime to broadcast the f ilm from february,for one year,and showtime agreed to pay respondent a license fee that appellants caused a letter to be written to showtime dated april,falsely claiming that brewer media was the owner and licensor of the footage that comprised the f ilm,and that the f ilm was brewer brain child,and demanding that showtime cease to broadcast the f ilm and provide an accounting that appellants knew about his contract with showtime,and intentionally induced showtime to breach the contract by writing the cease and desist letter and that as a result of appellants conduct,showtime refused to pay respondent the agreed licensing fee.
in the second cause of action for intentional interference with economic relationship,respondent alleged that he worked hard over the years to establish close relationships with tac the african channel and the organizers of paff the pan african film festival,and others that appellants knew or should have known about these relationships that appellants intentionally sought to disrupt respondent economic and contractual relationships with tac,paff and others,by falsely claiming to those parties that they had a partnership or copyright or other legal interest in the f ilm that appellants knew or should have known that these claims had no legal basis because the lawsuit had been decided in respondent favor and that as a direct result of appellants conduct,tac refused to license the film and the organizers of paff refused to allow the film to be shown at paff.
in the third cause of action for declaratory relief,respondent sought a judicial determination whether he owed brewer any payment for brewer work on the film because brewer errors cost respondent far more than respondent would otherwise have owed brewer.respondent sought a judgment that he owed brewer nothing because the expenses for the reshoot offset the deferred compensation owed to brewer.
on february,appellants filed a special motion to strike the first and second causes of action pursuant to the statute.in the motion,appellants contended these two causes of action are based on cease and desist letters that appellants sent to showtime,the africa channel,the pan african film festival and others in anticipation of litigation.appellants contended that the cease and desist letters were protected under section,subdivision e and as statements made in connection with an issue under consideration or review before a judicial proceeding.thus,appellants argued,the first two causes of action were within the scope of the statute.appellants further contended that the cease and desist letters were absolutely privileged under civil code section.accordingly,respondent could not show that he would prevail on the first two claims in his complaint because those claims were barred as a matter of law.
in support of the motion,brewer filed a declaration in which he stated that he entered into a partnership with bailey to jointly develop,produce and exploit an episodic lifestyle television program under the name global living productions that he filmed the content for the program,including interviews that the interviewees signed release forms stating that this was a between his company,brewer media associates,and bailey company,productions that after the shooting was completed,he gave bailey all of the signed release forms and the master field tapes that bailey subsequently refused to recognize that a joint partnership existed and claimed that he exclusively owned all rights to the program that bailey had all of the interviewees sign new releases without any mention of brewer or his company that bailey edited the program and changed its name to blacks without borders and began to distribute the program that in response,my attorneys and i sent cease and desist communications to showtime,the africa channel,the pan african film festival and the schomburg center informing them of my rights in the p rogram and demanding them to cease and desist the exhibit and exploitation of the p rogram and that at the time he sent the cease and desist communications,he had a good faith intention to file suit against bailey if we could not resolve the dispute by way of settlement.
appellants also attached a copy of the cease and desist letter to showtime.in the letter,bradley gross of the law firm of becker poliakoff informed showtime that he represented brewer media associates,brewer,the owner and licensor of the footage comprising a documentary called,blacks without borders,that his client footage had been unlawfully incorporated into the documentary that the film was the brainchild of brewer,and wa s the result of dozens of hours of interviews and footage,all of which were filmed in south africa that a ll of the footage comprising the d ocumentary belongs to brewer,and productions usurped that footage in violation of his client valuable intellectual property rights and that he had contacted all media outlets that have received the film and that the pan african film festival,the africa channel and tv one had all refused to accept and show the d ocumentary upon learning of the facts described above.
respondent opposed the motion on the ground that the statute and the litigation privilege applied only to litigation contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration,and that appellants had not shown that the cease and desist letter to showtime was made in connection with anticipated litigation that brewer was contemplating in good faith.according to respondent,the letter did not reference any litigation or contain an imminent threat to file a lawsuit.moreover,respondent contended,brewer statement that he intended to file suit against bailey must be rejected because brewer had filed a small claims court action on the same grounds as in the instant anticipated litigation and had lost after a contested hearing.
respondent attached a copy of the small claims action as part of a request for judicial notice.in the small claims action,brewer alleged that the parties entered into a joint venture to produce a television program,global living.he further alleged that respondent breach ed his fiduciary duties to the partnership,misappropriat ed partnership assets and repudiat ed the partnership.brewer sued to wind up the partnership and for partial value of partnership assets misappro priated.on june,after a contested hearing,the small claims court concluded that d efendant does not owe plaintiff any money on plaintiff claim.
in their reply to respondent opposition,appellants contended that prelitigation statements need not be immediately followed by a lawsuit in order to be considered protected by the statute and the litigation privilege and that the litigation privilege applies to claims that are not legally viable.appellants asserted that it was irrelevant whether brewer had filed a prior lawsuit against bailey.moreover,they claimed the ruling in small claims court did not mention anything regarding the rights to the f ilm,and t hus,brewer is not precluded from litigating the issue of whether or not the parties had formed a partnership with regards to the f ilm.
after a hearing,the superior court denied the motion.in its written order denying the motion,the trial court found that appellants prelitigation letters and communications to showtime and other media entities formed the basis of respondent first and second causes of action it concluded,however,that appellants letters and communications were not protected by the statute and the litigation privilege because the dispute between the parties had not ripened into a proposed proceeding.see haneline pacific properties,llc may th,the litigation privilege arises at the point in time when litigation is no longer a mere possibility,but has instead ripened into a proposed proceeding that is actually contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration as a means of obtaining access to the courts for the purpose of resolving the dispute.citation.having determined that appellants could not demonstrate their entitlement to the benefits of the statute,the trial court denied the motion.the court further found that respondent had produced evidence that would entitle him to prevail on the merits of his claims.
the order denying the motion was entered july.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal from the order.
discussion 
to determine whether a cause of action should be stricken under the statute,section establishes a two part test.under the first part,the party bringing the motion has the initial burden of showing that the cause of action arises from an act in furtherance of the right of free speech or petition,that it arises from a protected activity.zamos stroud cal th.once the defendant has met its burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the cause of action.ibid.only a cause of action that satisfies both parts of the statute,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit is a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.navellier sletten cal th.

here,the trial court denied the motion on the ground that appellants had failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the activity underlying respondent claims was protected.the trial court determined that appellants cease and desist letters and communications to showtime and various other media outlets formed the basis of respondent first two causes of action.the court held,however,that the letters and communications did not fall within the scope of the statute because they were not in connection with a dispute that had ripened into a proposed proceeding.haneline pacific properties,llc may,supra,th at.appellants contend the trial court erred as a matter of law in making this determination.for reasons other than those identified by the trial court,we conclude there was no error in denying the motion.
as an initial matter,we independently conclude that appellants cease and desist letters and communications to showtime and other media outlets formed the basis of respondent first two causes of action in his complaint.although the cease and desist letters and communications were not attached to the complaint and appellants produced only one cease and desist letter with the motion,we make this determination based upon our independent review of the record.the complaint alleged that appellants had sent a letter to showtime and made certain communications to other media outlets that caused those media outlets to refuse to broadcast or show the film.the motion asserted that these letters and communications were cease and desists letters and communications from appellants attorneys.on this record,there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the cease and desist letters and communications formed the basis of respondent first two causes of action.we next address whether these letters and communications were protected under the statute.

in determining whether a statement was made in anticipation of litigation contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration,this court may look to how this test has been applied in cases involving the litigation privilege of civil code section.flatley,supra,cal th at although the scope of and,are not identical,the latter may be used as an aid in construing the scope of section,subdivision e and with respect to the first step of the inquiry that is,by examining the scope of the litigation privilege to determine whether a given communication falls within the ambit of subdivision e and.cases applying the litigation privilege have held that if the statement is made with a good faith belief in a legally viable claim and in serious contemplation of litigation,then the statement is sufficiently connected to litigation and will be protected by the litigation privilege.citation.blanchard directv,th,italics added.a party resisting the assertion of the litigation privilege,however,must do more than simply assert that litigation to which the statement is related is without merit,and therefore the proponent of the litigation could not in good faith have believed it had a legally viable claim.to adopt such an interpretation would virtually eradicate the litigation priv
