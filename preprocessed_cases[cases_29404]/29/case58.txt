in,the marvel comics group published a comic book featuring the ghost rider a superhero with supernatural powers and a flaming skull for a head.the issue which sold for twenty cents told the story of johnny blaze,a motorcycle stunt rider who promised his soul to the devil to save his adoptive father from cancer.
in this case,gary friedrich contends that he conceived the ghost rider,the related characters,and the origin story,and that he owns the renewal term copyrights in those works.while acknowledging that friedrich contributed his ideas,marvel characters,marvel contends that the ghost rider characters and story were created through a collaborative process with marvel personnel and resources,and that marvel owns the renewal rights in question.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of marvel on the ownership issue,holding that friedrich had assigned any rights he had in the renewal term copyrights to marvel when he executed a form agreement in,six years after the initial publication of the issue in question.friedrich and his production company,gary friedrich enterprises,llc,appeal.we vacate and remand for trial.
statement of the case 
a.the facts 
the facts are heavily disputed.they are presented here in the light most favorable to friedrich,with all reasonable inferences drawn in his favor.see garcia hartford police dep t,cir per curiam.to the extent friedrich argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of authorship,we construe the facts in marvel favor and set forth that alternative version below.
friedrich creates the ghost rider 
a fan of comic books and motorcycle gang movies,friedrich began to imagine,in the,a motorcycleriding superhero who wore black leather.the hero developed into a motorcycle stuntman when evel knievel rose in popularity in the late.then in,after seeing his and friend on a motorcycle,friedrich was inspired to give his hero a flaming skull for a head.this epiphany caused friedrich to flesh out an origin story in which his hero became a demon after making a deal with the devil.
friedrich was a freelance comic book writer,scripting issues of existing comic book serials when solicited by and other publishers.in,friedrich decided to try to publish a comic book starring his hero after the comics code authority relaxed its standards to permit comic books to contain more and supernatural content.after refining the origin story and the characters appearances,friedrich created a written synopsis on his own initiative and at his own expense.the synopsis detailed ghost rider origin story and the main characters appearances.
marvel agrees to publish the comic 
friedrich presented his written synopsis to his friend roy thomas,an assistant editor at magazine management,magazine mgmt,the of marvel comics thomas liked the idea,so he gave the synopsis to marvel chief stan lee and arranged for lee to meet with friedrich.lee agreed to publish the ghost rider comic book in the series marvel spotlight,a vehicle used to audition new superheroes.in return,friedrich agreed to assign his rights in the ghost rider characters to marvel.friedrich and lee never discussed renewal rights and did not execute a written agreement.
at marvel suggestion,friedrich gave the synopsis to freelance artist mike ploog,who illustrated the comic book according to friedrich instructions.friedrich supervised the entire production of the comic book,advising ploog on how the characters should look and what to draw.
the comic is published in 
the first ghost rider comic was published in marvel spotlight,vol,spotlight in april,bearing a copyright notice in favor of magazine management.marvel comics group.the first page of the comic,reproduced above,contained a credit box that included the following 
conceived written 
gary friedrich 
at the same time spotlight was published,marvel advertised the new superhero in a contemporaneous issue of the amazing spider man.in a feature called marvel bullpen bulletins,marvel encouraged fans to read spotlight and acknowledged that friedrich had dreamed the whole thing up.
ghost rider quickly became one of marvel most popular comic book heroes.after spotlight,ghost rider stories appeared in the next six issues of marvel spotlight.by may,marvel launched a separate ghost rider comic book series.friedrich wrote the stories for several of these later comics on a freelance basis and does not dispute that these subsequent stories were works made for hire.marvel promptly filed registrations for several of these subsequent ghost rider comic books,even though it had not filed a registration for spotlight in october,marvel reprinted the original spotlight as ghost rider vol,leaving friedrich conceived written credit intact.
the ghost rider comic book series ran,in successive volumes,from to,to,and to.in total,marvel published over comic book stories starring ghost rider and reprinted spotlight five times,including as late as.marvel never removed friedrich conceived written credit from any of the spotlight reprints.
the agreement 
friedrich continued to write ghost rider and other superhero stories for marvel on a freelance basis until approximately.in,congress repealed the copyright act and replaced it with the current copyright act.see,stat.codified at et.under the act,which took effect on january,id.codified at note preceding,a work created outside the scope of employment was considered a only if the parties had executed an express written agreement to that effect,see defining work made for hire thus,in,cadence industries,cadence,the of marvel comics required friedrich and all of its other freelance artists to sign a form agreement.
the full agreement was a page long and read in pertinent part 
marvel is in the business of publishing comic and other magazines known as the marvel comics group,and supplier wishes to have marvel order or commission either written material or art work as a contribution to the collective work known as the marvel comics group.marvel has informed supplier that marvel only orders or commissions such written material or art work on an basis.
therefore,the parties agree as follows 
in consideration of marvel commissioning and ordering from supplier written material or art work and paying therefor,supplier acknowledges,agrees and confirms that any and all work,writing,art work material or services the work which have been or are in the future created,prepared or performed by supplier for the marvel comics group have been and will be specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work and that as such work was and is expressly agreed to be considered a work made for hire.
supplier expressly grants to marvel forever all rights of any kind and nature in and to the work,the right to use supplier name in connection therewith and agrees that marvel is the sole and exclusive copyright proprietor thereof having all rights of ownership therein.supplier agrees not to contest marvel exclusive,complete and unrestricted ownership in and to the work.
july,agreement between friedrich marvel the agreement.cadence told friedrich that the agreement only covered future work and that he had to sign it without alteration if he wanted to obtain further freelance work from them.thus,friedrich filled in his name and address by hand as the supplier and signed the agreement on july.friedrich was not paid anything for signing the agreement.after he signed,neither cadence nor any subsequent marvel publisher solicited any more freelance work from him.
the renewal term beginning in 
the initial copyright term for ghost rider expired at the end of,years after spotlight original publication in.see a a.beginning in,the renewal copyright would have vested in friedrich,as the original author,by operation of law.see id.a c i,b ii.nonetheless,marvel exploited the ghost rider character after by publishing reprints of spotlight in,and publishing six issues of a new ghost rider comic series that ran from august to january offering a single ghost rider toy for sale in catalogs in and having ghost rider make cameo appearances in other characters video games released in and filming the ghost rider movie in and releasing it in pursuant to a licensing agreement entered into in and releasing a ghost rider video game,based on the movie,in.while most of these items did not credit friedrich,all the spotlight reprints published during the renewal term contained friedrich conceived written credit.
friedrich was not aware of marvel use of the ghost rider character during the renewal period until around,when he learned marvel was preparing to make the ghost rider movie.on april,friedrich attorney wrote a letter to sony pictures,the company producing the movie,asserting friedrich rights to the ghost rider copyright.in a response dated april,marvel advised friedrich that ghost rider was a.despite taking this position,however,marvel paid friedrich with checks labeled roy,meaning royalties,when it reprinted spotlight in.
friedrich first learned about the concept of renewal rights in or.he filed for,and received,a renewal copyright registration in spotlight and ghost rider in february.he then assigned the rights to his company,gary friedrich enterprises,llc.
proceedings below 
on april,plaintiffs filed a complaint in the southern district of illinois against the current owners of marvel and their licensees,alleging copyright infringement and various state law claims.the action was transferred to the southern district of new york.the district court jones,dismissed plaintiffs state law claims because they were either preempted by the copyright act or failed to state a claim for relief.see generally gary friedrich,llc marvel,d.the district court forrest,thereafter denied friedrich motion for reconsideration,which sought to reinstate his state law accounting claim under federal law 
on may,marvel and the related defendants filed their answer,asserting that ghost rider was a.on december,they amended their answer to include a compulsory counterclaim for copyright infringement.plaintiffs also amended their complaint in march to add additional licensee defendants.
after discovery on the ownership issues,both sides moved for summary judgment.plaintiffs argued that friedrich was the sole author,or at least a joint author,as a matter of law.defendants argued primarily that friedrich ownership claim was barred by the statute of limitations,but alternatively that he had assigned his renewal rights to marvel in the agreement.the district court concluded that genuine disputes of material fact surrounded the authorship of the work,but it nonetheless granted marvel motion and denied friedrich.see generally gary friedrich,llc marvel,d.the court reasoned that even if friedrich were the sole author,by executing the agreement,he had conveyed all his remaining rights in the work to marvel forever.see id.at the district court reasoned that the term forever clearly indicated the parties intent to convey the renewal term to marvel.see id.at citing films home video,cir.
after the court issued its order,the parties stipulated that friedrich realized in profits from exploiting the ghost rider copyright.defendants also agreed to voluntarily dismiss their trademark counterclaims without prejudice,pending this appeal.the district court then entered final judgment dismissing all outstanding claims,awarding damages to marvel for friedrich copyright infringement,and enjoining friedrich from using the ghost rider copyright.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,friedrich argues that the district court erred in granting marvel motion for summary judgment because the agreement did not convey the renewal rights in the ghost rider copyright.while marvel argues that we may affirm on that basis,it primarily argues that we should affirm on the alternative ground that friedrich ownership claim is barred by the copyright act statute of limitations.finally,friedrich asks us to reverse the district court denial of his for summary judgment on the issue of authorship,leaving only the issue of damages on remand.
we address each of the three arguments in turn.
renewal rights 
we review de novo both the grant of summary judgment and the district court interpretation of the agreement.see ment.iron works interstate fire cas,cir mullins city of new york,cir.in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see mullins,at.
applicable law 
for artistic works still in their initial term of copyright protection on january,the copyright act establishes two terms of protection an initial term of years from the date the copyright was originally secured and a renewal term of years.a a,a c.the renewal term of a copyright is not merely an extension of the original copyright term but a new estate clear of all rights,interests or licenses granted under the original copyright.films,at quoting ricordi paramount pictures,cir.its purpose is to provide authors a second opportunity to obtain remuneration for their works and to renegotiate the terms of the grant once the value of the work has been tested.id.at alteration omitted quoting stewart abend.
an author may assign his renewal rights during the copyright initial term,but there is a strong presumption against the conveyance of renewal rights.corcovado music hollis music,cir.this presumption may be rebutted by an express assignment of renewals of copyright or extensions of copyright,or by general words of assignment,such as forever,hereafter,or perpetual,if the parties clear intent was to convey renewal rights.films,at quoting corcovado music,at siegel periodical publ,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in siegel,we explained that words like forever may be indicative of an intent to convey renewal rights,but this intent is to be determined by the trier of the facts.siegel,at in films,we affirmed the district court conclusion,reached after a bench trial,that the term perpetual indicated a clear intent to convey renewal rights.at.there,the parties had agreed to use the term perpetual after months of negotiations conducted by sophisticated and expert parties,each represented by counsel.id.at.furthermore,there was undisputed testimony that the assignee would not have entered the agreement for less than a perpetual term and that,in his understanding,the term perpetual was not coterminous with the initial copyright term.id.at.
we construe the agreement according to state law principles of contract interpretation,even though the subject matter of the agreement concerns issues of federal copyright law.see kennedy juvenile detention ass n,cir films turner entm t,aff sub nom.films home video,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b a ed.supp t he vast bulk of copyright contractual issues must be resolved under state law,given the silence of the copyright act in addressing such issues as how to construe ambiguous contractual language.because the agreement was made entirely in new york and performance was complete upon execution,new york law governs its construction.see brink african airways,cir,selastomer detroit,cir

application 
applying the strong presumption against the conveyance of renewal rights,corcovado music,at,we conclude that the district court erred in holding as a matter of law that friedrich had assigned his renewal rights to marvel by signing the agreement.we reach this conclusion for the following reasons.
a.the plain language 
the agreement is ambiguous on its face.first,the critical sentence defining the work covered by the agreement is ungrammatical and awkwardly phrased 
in consideration of marvel commissioning and ordering from supplier written material or art work and paying therefor,supplier acknowledges,agrees and confirms that any and all work,writing,art work material or services the work which have been or are in the future created,prepared or performed by supplier for the marvel comics group have been and will be specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work and that as such work was and is expressly agreed to be considered a work made for hire.
this opaque cluster of clauses is simply not clear and parsing through its dense provisions does little to elucidate its meaning.
second,the language is ambiguous as to whether it covered a work published six years earlier.the introductory recitals indicate that the supplier wishes to have marvel order or commission work and that marvel only orders or commissions such work on an basis.there is no explicit acknowledgement that the generic supplier ever performed work for marvel previously,and certainly no specific mention of the ghost rider works.marvel attempts to extract the phrase all work which have sic been created,prepared or performed by supplier for the marvel comics group from the dense sentence quoted above,but the entire agreement suggests that this was a contract only intended to cover work submitted after the agreement was signed read in this context,work that have sic been created to the extent the phrase has a discernible meaning may refer to work that was inprogress when the agreement was executed,even though marvel may have commissioned that work,and the freelance artist may have begun working on it,before the agreement was formally reduced to writing.see,agreement marvel has informed supplier that marvel only orders work on an basis supplier acknowledges,agrees and confirms that any and all work have sic been and will be specially ordered or commissioned as a work made for hire.
third,the language is ambiguous as to whether it conveys renewal rights.the contract contains no explicit reference to renewal rights and most of the language merely tracks the act definition of work made for hire.see defining term as a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them.if the contract only covers work made for hire,marvel would be the statutory author,see id.b cmty.for creative non violence reid,citing copyright act,repealed,and the supplier would not have any renewal rights that could be assigned to marvel.
finally,marvel relies heavily on the provision grant ing to marvel forever all rights of any kind and nature in and to the work.siegel,at.in context,however,for the reasons discussed above,it is not clear whether this broad language applies to work performed by friedrich some six years earlier.the broadness of the language would be of no help to marvel if the agreement were intended to cover only future work.moreover,that sentence goes on to provide that marvel is the sole and exclusive copyright proprietor thereof having all rights of ownership therein,which again suggests marvel is the statutory author by virtue of the fact that the work was made for hire.thus,the agreement could reasonably be construed as a form contract having nothing to do with renewal rights.accordingly,the language by itself fails to overcome the strong presumption against the conveyance of renewal rights.corcovado music,at.
extrinsic evidence 
because the agreement is reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning,it is ambiguous and we next look to extrinsic evidence in the record to determine whether there is a genuine dispute regarding the parties intent at the time of the agreement.see diesel props greystone bus.credit ii llc,cir.
here,the record demonstrates that cadence extended this same,form contract to all its freelance artists to ensure that commissioned work would be deemed a work made for hire under the new copyright act.it did so shortly after the act took effect on january.see see also copyright act of,stat.codified at note preceding noting effective date of act was january,martha graham sch.dance,martha graham ctr.of contemporary dance,cir explaining that act only governs whether a work created on or after january,is a.when friedrich signed the agreement,he was doing other freelance work for marvel and he believed the agreement would only cover future work because that was what cadence told him at the time.he was not paid anything separately for signing the agreement.moreover,spotlight had been published six years earlier by a different corporate entity magazine mgmt.and had grown so popular that marvel had already reprinted it once and had launched a separate ghost rider comic book series.given that context,it is doubtful the parties intended to convey rights in the valuable ghost rider copyright without explicitly referencing it.it is more likely that the agreement only covered ongoing or future work.hence,there is a genuine dispute regarding the parties intent for this form contract to cover ghost rider.
even if the parties intended the definition of work to extend to ghost rider,that alone would not mean that they intended the agreement to convey friedrich remaining renewal rights in that work.first,the agreement appears to create an employee for hire relationship,but the agreement could not render ghost rider a work made for hire ex post facto,even if the extrinsic evidence shows the parties had the intent to do so.the act governs whether works created and published before january,are works made for hire,see martha graham,at,and that act requires us to look to agency law and the actual relationship between the parties,rather than the language of their agreements,in determining the authorship of the work,marvel characters,simon,cir thus,regardless of the parties intent in,the evidence must prove ghost rider was actually a work made for hire at the time of its creation.but the circumstances surrounding the creation of the work are genuinely in dispute.
second,there is little extrinsic evidence to suggest that the parties actually intended to assign anything other than an initial term of copyright and much evidence to suggest that they did not.see films,at g eneral words of assignment can include renewal rights if the parties had so intended.emphasis added quoting siegel,at.friedrich was unrepresented by counsel,was told that the agreement only covered future work,and did not learn about the concept of renewal rights until.there was no discussion about renewal rights when he signed the agreement in.a jury could reasonably conclude that the parties never even considered renewal rights when they made this contract.accordingly,the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on the agreement.
timeliness of ownership claims 
because marvel asserts that there is an alternative ground for affirming the district court judgment,we next consider its argument that friedrich claim is barred by the statute of limitations.we may affirm the district court order granting summary judgment on any ground supported by the record,even if it is not one on which the district court relied.mcelwee cnty.of orange,cir.
applicable law 
under the copyright act,all civil actions,including claims of ownership,must be commenced within three years after the claim accrued.b see kwan schlein,cir.an ownership claim accrues only once,when a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have been put on inquiry as to the existence of a right.kwan,at quoting stone williams,cir.if the ownership claim is,and ownership is the dispositive issue,any attendant infringement claims must fail.id.at.
although an alleged author is aware of his claim to ownership of the work from the moment of its creation,merchant levy,cir,the author does not need to bring suit until there has been an express repudiation of that claim,see zuill shanahan,cir.a ny number of events can trigger the accrual of an ownership claim,including a n express assertion of sole authorship or ownership.kwan,at quoting netzer continuity graphic,see also zuill,at c laims of,as distinct from claims of infringement,accrue when plain and express repudiation of is communicated to the claimant,and are barred three years from the time of repudiation.for example,a claim can accrue when a book is published without the alleged name on it,see kwan,at when alleged are presented with a contract identifying the defendant as the sole owner and copyright holder,zuill,at see also gaiman mcfarlane,cir or when alleged learn they are entitled to royalties that they are not receiving,see merchant,at,stone,at 
application 
marvel is not entitled to summary judgment on its statute of limitations defense.friedrich filed his complaint on april,and thus marvel had to have repudiated friedrich claim to ownership of the renewal rights prior to april,for his claim to be untimely.we conclude the district court could not have granted summary judgment on this basis because there are genuine disputes of fact regarding whether and,if so,when marvel a publicly repudiated friedrich claim b privately repudiated friedrich claim in its communications with him and c implicitly repudiated friedrich claim by conspicuously exploiting the copyright without paying royalties.
public repudiation 
first,there is a genuine dispute whether marvel publicly repudiated friedrich claim.there is evidence that,over the years,marvel repeatedly and publicly recognized that friedrich created the work.marvel publicly credited friedrich with conceiv ing spotlight each time it reprinted the original comic including as late as.when the comic was originally published in,marvel explained in a contemporaneous publication that friedrich had dreamed the whole thing up.moreover,marvel did not register a copyright in spotlight or ghost rider before friedrich filed this action,even though it had registered nearly all of its other characters and several later ghost rider stories.
marvel argues that the copyright notice on spotlight declared that marvel was the owner and publicly repudiated friedrich claim.but in,the notice would have only indicated that marvel held the rights to the initial term of copyright.it would not have conclusively demonstrated that marvel was the author or otherwise had the right to register the renewal term see,films,at explaining that agreement permitted alleged assignees to register the renewal copyright in the ir names as just as their predecessors had done for the original copyright registration.at a minimum,there is a genuine dispute regarding whether this notice publicly repudiated friedrich claim of authorship,and thus his claim to ownership of the renewal rights.
private repudiation 
second,the record is unclear as to whether marvel privately repudiated friedrich claim in its communications with friedrich before april.although marvel contends that it told friedrich that it considered ghost rider to be a work made for hire either at the time of the comic book creation or at the time he executed the agreement in,the circumstances surrounding those events are in dispute.only marvel letter dated april,clearly communicates that position to friedrich.because friedrich filed his complaint less than three years later,his ownership claim would be timely if that was the first time marvel privately repudiated his ownership claim.accordingly,there is a genuine dispute as to when marvel first told friedrich that it intended to take sole credit for ghost rider.
implied repudiation 
finally,there is a genuine dispute as to whether marvel exploitation of the ghost rider copyright during the renewal term without paying royalties,implicitly repudiated friedrich claim to ownership.in merchant levy,cir,and stone williams,cir,the alleged were charged with notice of their ownership claim once they knew they were entitled to receive royalties,but the works in both those cases were hit songs regularly played on the radio.see merchant,at,why do fools fall in love by frankie lymon and the teenagers stone,at,songs of hank williams.in contrast,marvel used the ghost rider copyright sparingly and in ways between and.zuill,at analogizing statute of limitations for ownership claims to doctrine of adverse possession,which requires an express or implicit ouster to put the owner on notice d adverse possession ed.explaining that the possession of the adverse claimant must be open and notorious.during the renewal period but before,marvel merely published six issues of a ghost rider comic book series from august to january advertised a single ghost rider toy in each of its and toy catalogs and used ghost rider for a cameo appearance in a video game entitled spider man.there is a genuine dispute as to whether a reasonably diligent person would have been put on notice by this activity.
marvel points out that its agreement to license a ghost rider movie had been highly publicized since and argues that this implicitly repudiated friedrich ownership of the renewal copyright.we conclude that there are genuine disputes of fact regarding whether these news reports repudiated friedrich claim.
first,it is unclear whether this conduct even occurred during the renewal term.because the copyright appears to have been first secured in,the renewal term would not have vested in friedrich until january.see a a i nimmer on copyright c explaining that the initial term for a work first published on march,would end december,at the end of the year and the renewal term would vest on january.marvel entered the license agreement on may,before the initial term expired.therefore,news of that agreement would not necessarily have repudiated friedrich ownership of the renewal term.
second,it was not clear that marvel would refuse to pay royalties to friedrich when the movie was released.according to merchant and stone,an ownership claim is triggered by knowledge of an entitlement to royalties that are not being paid,rather than by mere knowledge of the exploitation.see merchant,at,stone,at.of course,in many cases,these two will go.for example,a is aware of his claim of from the moment the work is created,see merchant,at,and thus learning that another joint author is exploiting the work is sufficient notice that royalties are due.here,however,friedrich alleges primarily that he is sole author and alternatively that he is a joint author.
as to his claim of sole authorship,friedrich would not have a right to royalties with respect to the movie,but a claim for damages.but as explained above,it is not clear that entering the agreement infringed friedrich ownership rights as it may have occurred during the initial term.with respect to the alternative claim,it is unclear whether the agreement entitled friedrich to any royalties before the movie was released and began generating profits in.moreover,there is evidence that marvel did pay friedrich royalties when it reprinted spotlight in,suggesting that marvel also might pay him royalties when the movie was released.hence,a jury could find that a reasonably diligent person would not have known that marvel was exploiting ghost rider,without paying royalties,during the renewal term but before april.because there are genuine disputes regarding whether friedrich should have known about marvel repudiation of his claim of ownership,his claim is not untimely as a matter of law 
authorship and work for hire 
on appeal,friedrich also asks us to review the district court decision to deny his for summary judgment on the issue of authorship.friedrich contends that the record establishes as a matter of law that he was the author,or at least a joint author,o
