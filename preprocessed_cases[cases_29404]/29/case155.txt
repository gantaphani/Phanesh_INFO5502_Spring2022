plaintiff,club italia soccer sports organization,appeals a september,order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant,charter township of shelby,to dismiss plaintiff due process and equal protection claims.plaintiff alleges that defendant violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment as made actionable under by accepting a soccer complex development proposal from soccer city,soccer city without first granting plaintiff the opportunity to submit a bid on terms equal to those granted to soccer city.soccer city is a corporation engaged in the business of developing,designing,constructing,and maintaining soccer fields and facilities.the district court dismissed plaintiff claims for lack of standing,holding that plaintiff did not allege an because plaintiff failed to demonstrate the existence of a protected liberty or property interest.while we find that plaintiff did in fact have standing,we affirm the order of the district court on the ground that plaintiff failed to state a claim for relief.
background 
factual history 
the facts in this case are largely undisputed.sometime in,soccer city contacted defendant to propose the development and construction of soccer facilities on defendant property.defendant authorized soccer city to conduct environmental tests on the property and instructed soccer city to submit a formal development proposal.the first site soccer city tested was found to be unsuitable for construction,so a second site was tested.after determining that the second site was suitable,soccer city submitted a formal proposal to defendant on december.
in march,plaintiff,a sports organization,contacted defendant and obtained a copy of soccer city proposal.at a town board meeting shortly thereafter,on april,jack ciraulo,plaintiff president,voiced concerns about the bidding process and expressed plaintiff interest in submitting a proposal.the board held a special session on april,during which it decided to accept additional proposals.on april,the board issued an invitation to compete,inviting all other interested parties to submit proposals.the board required any interested parties to submit their bids within the following three weeks in order to have them considered.the board further required a guarantee from any new bidders that whomever was awarded the contract would reimburse soccer city for the environmental testing it had conducted.
plaintiff was unable,in the time allotted,to conduct the necessary surveying or designing,or to obtain the necessary engineering services needed to complete its bid.thus,plaintiff could not prepare a proposal within the period.on may,the day the bids were due,plaintiff contacted the board to request additional time to prepare its proposal.the board never responded to plaintiff request,and subsequently accepted the only bid submitted,which was the one from soccer city.
ii.procedural history 
on june,plaintiff filed a complaint in district court alleging that defendant bidding procedures and its acceptance of a bid from soccer city violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.plaintiff simultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction,requesting that the district court prohibit defendant from beginning work on soccer city proposal until after the district court resolved the issues alleged in the complaint.the district court denied plaintiff motion for a preliminary injunction on june.
on july,defendant moved for summary judgment.the district court held a hearing on defendant motion on august,and thereafter granted the motion on september.plaintiff timely appealed the district court order on september.

ii.plaintiff standing to bring its claims 
requirements for.constitutional standing requirements 
the standing doctrine imposes both constitutional and prudential limitations on who may properly bring suit in federal court.warth seldin,d.the basis for constitutional standing is derived from article iii case or controversy requirement,which limits federal court authority to legal issues which are traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.rifle ass of am.magaw,cir quoting flast cohen,d.constitutional standing requires a plaintiff to allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.allen wright,d.this encompasses three distinct elements 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of third,it must be likely as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
lujan defenders of wildlife,d.these requirements exist to insure that the litigants possess a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.baker carr,d.
prudential standing requirements 
prudential standing imposes at least two additional requirements on plaintiffs.allen,at.first,a plaintiff may not raise generalized grievances.fed.comm akins,d.second,a plaintiff generally may not raise the rights of third parties.allen,at.craig boren,d.the prudential standing requirements,unlike the constitutional limitations,are not derived from law,but instead are judicially constructed restraints on standing.allen,at.as such,they vary in application,and there exist some prudential standing requirements that are not universally applied in all cases.clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.
one such narrowly applied requirement is the zone of interest test.the zone of interest test requires a plaintiff to show that the rights he or she is seeking to protect are those rights contemplated by the statute or constitutional guarantee being invoked.the test originated in association of data processing service organizations,camp,d,which established the requirements for standing under the administrative procedure act,a,apa.in that case,the supreme court held that a plaintiff has standing to sue under the apa as a person aggrieved so long as the plaintiff suffered an and seeks to protect interests which are arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guaranty in question.data processing,at.
there remains some question as to the category of cases to which the zone of interest test applies.subsequent supreme court cases have applied the zone of interest test almost exclusively to apa cases.see clarke,at.discussing this tendency to apply the test only in the context of apa cases.however,the court has declined to hold that the apa represents the only framework under which to apply the zone of interest test.in fact,the court has recently noted that the test may be appropriately applied outside of this context.see bennett spear,d citing as examples of this application dennis higgins,d and boston stock exchange state tax comm n,d.
this circuit has applied the zone of interest test outside the context of the apa on numerous occasions.see,solid wastes mgm t daviess,cir huish detergents,warren county,kentucky,cir.accordingly,to assert standing in the present case,plaintiff must demonstrate that the rights it seeks to assert are protected by the zone of interests of the due process and the equal protection clauses.
plaintiff constitutional standing 
in order to assert constitutional standing,plaintiff must show that it suffered an that is cognizable by this court.lujan,at.the district court improperly approached this question by applying an inapplicable body of law in addressing the question of plaintiff standing and,additionally,by conflating the standing analysis for plaintiff claims with the merits of its due process claim.
the district court conclusion that plaintiff lacks standing seems to be based on two grounds.first,the district court held that because plaintiff does not allege a legally protectable interest,plaintiff does not have standing.this conclusion improperly grafts the standing inquiry onto the merits of plaintiff due process claim.the fact that plaintiff has no legal right to bid on the contract at issue,and therefore,has not suffered the invasion of a protected liberty or property interest,has no bearing on the question of standing.as the supreme court clarified in data processing,a plaintiff need not have a legal right,or a right protected by the law of property,contract,tort,or statute,to suffer.at.stripped to its essence,the district court conclusion is simply that plaintiff does not allege a violation of an interest protected by the due process clause.while this argument goes toward the merits of plaintiff due process claim,it does not affect the standing inquiry.
the district court further based its conclusion that plaintiff did not have standing to bring its claims upon the improper characterization of plaintiff as a disappointed bidder.the court determined that as a disappointed bidder,plaintiff was unable to assert standing.in coming to this conclusion,the district court relied upon several cases for the proposition that a disappointed bidder has no standing to sue.see united of omaha life ins.solomon,cir kasom city of sterling heights.malan construction board of county road comm rs.
the law concerning whether a disappointed bidder is conferred standing in a federal court has been the source of a fair amount of confusion.in the interest of clarity,we will begin with a discussion of the general law in this area.
in perkins lukens steel,the supreme court expressly addressed whether a disappointed,or unsuccessful,bidder has standing to seek relief in federal court.the court held that a disappointed bidder for a federal government contract did not have standing to sue the federal government for violations of bidding rules contained in the public contracts act.the court reasoned that no legal rights of plaintiffs were shown to have been invaded or threatened and that neither the damage nor loss of income in consequence of the action of the government,which is not an invasion of a legally recognized right,is itself a source of the legal rights in the absence of constitutional legislation recognizing it as such.id.at.
since that ruling,the impact of lukens steel has been eroded by the passage of the apa.increasingly more courts have come to view the apa as proof of congressional intent to create private rights in contracting with the government.these courts have reasoned that this congressional intent supplanted the supreme court previous ruling and conferred standing upon disappointed bidders.see instrument,united states,cir airco,energy research dev,cir armstrong armstrong,united states,cir merriam kunzig,cir william wilke,department of army,cir scanwell,shaffer.
unlike those circuits,this court has declined to depart from lukens steel in its entirety.instead,we have held that the apa represents an exception to the general rule that disappointed bidders do not have standing.where there is proof of congressional intent to confer standing upon a disappointed bidder,this court will recognize such standing.however,it remains the law in this circuit that where the apa or similar legislation that expresses a congressional intent to create standing does not apply,a disappointed bidder does not have standing before this court.as we explained in cincinnati electronics kleppe,
rather,we view the present case as dealing with an exception recognized in lukens steel,at.where congress has by constitutional legislation recognized the legal right of a bidder for government contracts to benefit from the policy of granting a fair share of such contracts to small business concerns.standing is conferred by section of the apa only when a relevant statute indicates a congressional intent that the person or firm seeking review comes within the zone of interests sought to be regulated or protected.absent such a congressionally created exception,the general rule of perkins lukens steel,supra,that a disappointed bidder has no legally enforceable right against the government award of a procurement contract retains its validity.
cir see also hoke tennessee valley,cir discussing kleppe.
thus,this circuit has recognized the passage of the apa as an exception to the general rule in lukens steel,not as a legislative rejection of it.therefore,unless a party brings a suit under the apa or similar legislation which evinces a congressional intent to create a grounds for standing for a disappointed bidder,this court will not confer standing upon disappointed bidders.kleppe,at.
because plaintiff in the present case does not rely on the apa or any similar legislation,it would,as the district court held,be improper to grant plaintiff standing as a disappointed bidder.this conclusion,however,does not end the standing discussion.while the district court properly held that plaintiff did not have standing as a disappointed bidder,it neglected to address plaintiff assertion that it is not,in fact,a disappointed bidder because it never actually submitted a bid.instead,plaintiff contends that its standing arises from the fact that it was not afforded an adequate opportunity to submit a proposal in an open bidding process.therefore,plaintiff argues,it has suffered the necessary to assert standing without relying on the theory.
we are persuaded that plaintiff can not be characterized as a disappointed bidder because plaintiff never actually submitted a bid.see fed of fed.employees cheney,concluding that since neither the appellant nor its members ever submitted a bid,it was not a disappointed bidder in a procurement contract case.therefore,the district court focus on cases addressing the standing of a disappointed bidder was misplaced.plaintiff need only allege a cognizable and show that the rights it seeks to have protected fall within the zone of interest of the constitutional guarantees being invoked in order to have standing.
defendant refusal to allow plaintiff to bid on the contract allegedly caused it to suffer an economic injury,since it precluded plaintiff from being considered for a lucrative contract.this court has explicitly held that such an economic injury is sufficient to confer standing upon a party.owen of georgia,shelby county,cir.the district court improperly distinguished owen of georgia on the basis that it involved tennessee instead of michigan law.however,the proposition that economic injury of a prospective bidder constitutes an is not derived from tennessee law.in fact,this court expressly stated in that case that in coming to this conclusion it was not looking to tennessee law,but rather,to the united states supreme court.specifically,we held 
even looking beyond tennessee law to the recent restrictive decisions of the supreme court we would find that owen would have standing.as a prospective,and here the low bidder for shelby county business,owen clearly has economic interests at stake which give it standing.its injury in fact is loss of business and profits which is fairly traceable to the defendants acts or omissions.village of arlington hts.metropolitan housing dev,d.
owen of georgia,at.further,several of our sister circuits have also held that a prospective bidder economic interest in a proposal on which it was not allowed to bid constitutes for the purposes of standing.see,image carrier beame,cir as prospective bidders for city business,appellees clearly have economic interest at stake sufficient to give them standing.plaintiff economic injury is as sufficient to support standing.
contrary to defendant argument,the fact that plaintiff is a organization does not undermine the theory that plaintiff economic injury is an.the supreme court has already rejected this argument.see vill.of arlington heights metro.hous,d holding that a organization had standing based upon an economic injury.defendant further argues that plaintiff must submit evidence of this economic injury in order to avoid summary judgment.this argument is also unconvincing.wh
