terri hancock challenges the denial by metropolitan life insurance company metlife of ad d benefits for the death of her mother,verla hancock.applying review,the united states district court for the district of utah affirmed metlife decision.on appeal hancock contends that judicial review of metlife decision should be de novo because the clause of her mother benefit plan giving metlife discretion in reviewing claims does not comply with a utah insurance regulation governing clauses that even if the clause is valid,judicial deference to the metlife decision should be significantly reduced because of procedural irregularities in processing the claim and metlife conflict of interest and that metlife decision should be reversed regardless of the judicial standard of review.
exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.as the parties agree,verla hancock benefit plan is governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.erisa preempts the utah insurance regulation relied upon by hancock she has not shown any procedural irregularities in metlife review of her claim and metlife decision was not arbitrary and capricious,even taking into account its conflict of interest.
factual background 
verla hancock death 
on november,having not heard from her mother for several days,hancock went to her mother house to check on her.she found verla hancock body on the bathroom floor.the body was already in advanced stages of decomposition.according to the police report,
verla hancock was lying on the floor with her head under the toilet.her pants were pulled down and there was what appeared to be feces on the floor and also on her back,staining her shirt.
there was a shower chair in the bathroom that had been knocked over and one leg of it was lying across the right side of her face and there was an open storage container that was lying next to her body with misc items scattered around the floor.there was also a prescription bottle of what was later identified as oxycontin next to her right hand.it appeared to have fallen out of the storage container.that was the only prescription bottle found in the bathroom.
admin.at.elsewhere in the house,police found eight other kinds of prescription drugs.hancock told police that her mother had suffered from diabetes,hypertension,sleep apnea,and depression.hancock also said that her mother had been addicted to painkillers and had overdosed on oxycontin and lortab in august though she did not know whether the reason for the overdose was attempted suicide or inadvertence.additionally,police interviewed three neighbors and verla hancock brother,who said that he had last spoken with his sister five days before she was found.
although the medical examiner thought that verla hancock may have overdosed on oxycontin,there was no evidence of excessive amounts of oxycontin or other intoxicants in the toxicology results.id.at.nor did the autopsy find any evidence of natural disease,injury or intoxication sufficient to explain death.id.the medical examiner report concluded that the cause of death was undetermined,and verla hancock death certificate so stated.
b.the plan 
verla hancock participated in a plan the plan sponsored by her employer,intermountain health care.metlife is the plan insurer and claim fiduciary.as claim fiduciary,metlife resolves benefit claims and reviews appeals.
verla hancock coverage under the plan included basic life insurance,optional additional life insurance,and ad d benefits.the plan pays ad d benefits for loss of life if the insured is injured in an accident that occurs while she is under ad d coverage that accident is the sole cause of the injury that injury is the sole cause of death and death occurs not more than one year after the date of that accident.id.at.under the plan,ad d benefits will be paid when metlife receive s notice and satisfactory proof of that loss.id.at.excluded from ad d coverage is loss that in any way results from,or is caused or contributed to by physical or mental illness,diagnosis of or treatment for the illness.id.at.the plan also provides for an appeals process entitling an unsuccessful claimant to request that metlife conduct a review of the adverse benefit determination.id.at.
of central importance to this appeal,the plan grants metlife discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan and to determine eligibility for and entitlement to plan benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan.id.at.the utah insurance commissioner,however,has attempted to limit by regulation such grants of discretion.utah admin.code rule prohibits clauses in insurance forms other than those relating to benefit plans governed by erisa and permits them in erisa plans only if their language is substantially similar to the language set forth in the regulation,id.
metlife claim determination 
hancock is her mother plan beneficiary.on january,metlife received her claim for life and ad d payments.it approved the claims under basic and optional coverage but denied ad d benefits.its march notification letter to hancock explained that because accidental death had not been established,she was ineligible for ad d benefits.
on may hancock sent metlife a letter appealing the denial of ad d benefits.she provided her own observations of the scene of death and reported on two conversations with those who had investigated the death according to her letter,the investigating detective said that it looked like verla hancock slipped,fell,and hit her head,and the medical examiner told her that it was entirely possible that verla hancock slipped,fell and hit her head hard enough to render her unconscious but not hard enough to fracture her skull.admin.at.metlife denied her appeal on september.it characterized hancock evidence as conjecture and reiterated that she had not shown that her mother death had been caused by an accident.
hancock obtained counsel and appealed again on february.this time she submitted copies of the police report,police photographs of the scene,autopsy documents,and an investigative report prepared by mra forensic sciences,a firm she had hired.metlife agreed to conduct further administrative review but had rendered no decision by june,when hancock counsel demanded that metlife pay ad d benefits within ten days or be sued.on september,still without word on her appeal,hancock filed suit against metlife in utah state court,alleging breach of contract,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and other claims.one day later,metlife sent her a letter reaffirming its denial of benefits.the case was later removed to federal court on metlife motion.
the district court was presented with three motions by the parties.on december,hancock moved for a partial summary judgment on the standard of review,contending that the court should review de novo the denial of benefits by metlife.she argued that rule deprived metlife of any discretionary authority that would justify judicial deference.on february,metlife moved for a bench trial on the papers.it argued that its decision was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.about two weeks later,hancock moved for summary judgment.she characterized metlife denial of benefits as an attempt to invoke a policy exclusion,presumably that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim,vol ii.at,and asserted that metlife had the burden of establishing the factual basis for the exclusion.she also argued that metlife had a conflict of interest and had committed procedural irregularities in handling her claim.
the district court issued an opinion addressing each motion and ruling on the merits.see hancock metro.life ins,wl.it denied hancock motion for partial summary judgment,holding that erisa preempted rule and that metlife was entitled to review.responding to hancock motion,the court determined that metlife denial was based not on a plan exclusion but on hancock failure to satisfy her burden to show that a covered loss had occurred.finally,denying hancock motion and granting metlife motion to resolve the merits,the court held that metlife decision to deny ad d benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.it therefore dismissed hancock claims.
ii.discussion 
on appeal hancock raises two issues whether metlife is entitled to deferential review,and whether its decision survives our review.we begin with the standard of review.
standard of review 
as the supreme court stated in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,a denial of benefits challenged under erisa is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.if the administrator or fiduciary has discretionary authority,then,absent procedural irregularities,the denial of benefits is reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.kellogg metro.life ins,cir.when,as here,the district court determination of the standard of review did not require it to resolve any disputed historical facts,we do not defer to its determination but decide de novo what the standard of review should be.see rasenack ex rel.tribolet aig life ins,cir.
the plan contains the following provision entitled,discretionary authority of plan administrator and other plan fiduciaries 
in carrying out their respective responsibilities under the plan,the plan administrator and other plan fiduciaries shall have discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan and to determine eligibility for and entitlement to plan benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan.any interpretation or determination made pursuant to such discretionary authority shall be given full force and e ffect,unless it can be shown that the interpretation or determination was arbitrary and capricious.
admin.at.there is no dispute that the clause gives metlife discretion in interpreting plan terms and determining benefit eligibility.the question is whether the clause is valid.hancock contends that it is invalid because it fails to comply with utah insurance rule therefore,she reasons,metlife lacks discretionary authority and its decision must be reviewed de novo.metlife counters,however,that erisa expressly preempts the application of the rule in this case hancock argues against preemption,and alternatively contends that even if the plan clause is valid,we must temper our deference because of procedural defects in metlife benefit determination and metlife conflict of interest.we first answer the preemption question,and then address hancock and arguments.
erisa preemption 
rule imposes a ban on clauses in forms.an exception,however,is provided for plans governed by erisa.rule authorizes clauses in such plans if the clause language is the same as,or substantially similar to the following language 
benefits under this plan will be paid only if the plan administrator decides in its discretion that the claimant is entitled to them.the plan administrator also has discretion to determine eligibility for benefits and to interpret the terms and conditions of the benefit plan.determinations made by the plan administrator pursuant to this reservation of discretion do not prohibit or prevent a claimant from seeking judicial review in federal court of the plan administrator determinations.
the reservation of discretion made under this provision only establishes the scope of review that a federal court will apply when a claimant seeks judicial review of the plan administrator determination of eligibility for benefits,the payment of benefits,or interpretation of the terms and conditions applicable to the benefit plan.
the plan administrator is an insurance company that provides insurance to this benefit plan and the federal court will determine the level of discretion that it will accord the plan administrator determinations.
rule internal quotation marks omitted.the p arenthes e s in the rule indicate that the company filing the form may use a name or pronouns as applicable.id.the rule also dictates that clauses be highlighted by use of a bold font that is not less than point type.rule.
rule can be applied to the plan only if it is not preempted by erisa.erisa expressly preempts any state law insofar as it may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan,see a,unless the law regulates insurance,banking,or securities,id.b a.the issue before us is whether rule regulates insurance.the supreme court has declared that a state law regulates insurance within the meaning of b a if it is specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance,and substantially affect s the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.kentucky ass of health plans miller,d.metlife does not dispute that rule satisfies miller first prong.we therefore turn to prong two.
at dispute in miller was a kentucky law requiring health insurers to accept services from any health provider willing to meet the insurer terms.see id.at.the court held that the law was not preempted by erisa because it regulated insurance.see id.at.with respect to prong two,it said that a law substantially affects risk pooling if it alter s the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds,id.at,and that the kentucky law,by expanding the number of providers from whom an insured may receive health services,altered the scope of permissible insurance bargains,id.at.
miller reaffirmed the court earlier decisions holding that certain state insurance laws were not preempted by erisa.in metropolitan life insurance massachusetts,d,the court upheld a law obligating insurers to cover certain medical conditions,noting that the law effectively forc es the individuals to become part of the risk pool,id.at.in unum life insurance of america ward,d,it held that erisa did not preempt a state rule that prohibited insurers from denying coverage based on the insured untimely notice unless the insurer showed actual prejudice from the delay.and in rush prudential hmo,moran,d,the court upheld a state law that gave the insured the right to review by an independent physician of an insurer denial of a covered service on the ground that it was not medically necessary.see id.at.although these decisions had not applied the same reasoning as miller,the miller court said that in each instance the state law regulated insurance because it alter ed the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds.at.see also id.at.explaining that the rule upheld in unum dictates to the insurance company the conditions under which it must pay for the risk that it has assumed,which certainly qualifies as a substantial effect on the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and insured.
in accordance with miller,we hold that the application of rule to the plan is expressly preempted by erisa.the rule does not remove the option of insurer discretion from the scope of permissible insurance bargains in erisa plans.it neither affects who gets in the risk pool nor prescribes the conditions under which insurers must pay for assumed risks.rather,the rule authorizes clauses so long as they disclose certain matters and conform with the rule font requirement.see rule.in short,rule relates to the form,not the substance,of erisa plans it has no impact on risk pooling and fails to satisfy miller prong two.
if rule imposed a blanket prohibition on the use of clauses,we would have a different case.two circuits have held that such a prohibition substantially affects risk pooling.they reasoned that by preventing insureds from accepting a clause in return for a lower premium,the prohibition narrows the scope of permissible insurance bargains.see standard ins.morrison,cir miller prong two is satisfied by montana practice of disapproving all insurance forms containing clauses am.council of life insurers ross,cir michigan prohibition on clauses satisfies miller prong two because it limits the contracts that insurers and insureds can enter into,preventing them from granting the insurer unfettered discretionary authority.but that reasoning does not apply here.rule,although initially stating a prohibition,see rule prohibit ing the use of reservation of discretion clauses,permits clauses in erisa plans so long as they substantially conform to the rule language and use bold,font,see rule.indeed,the rule title permitted language for reservation of discretion clauses belies any notion that rule prohibits discretion.
hancock contends that rule affects risk pooling because if a clause does not substantially conform to the rule language,the clause is invalid,the insurer is deprived of discretion,and the resulting de novo review affects the risk pool by causing more reversals of benefit denials.her argument proves too much.by her logic,any requirement,no matter how trivial for example,a requirement that the plan be printed on mauve paper,affects risk pooling simply because an insurer noncompliance would divest it of discretion,trigger de novo review,and change its risks.we decline to interpret miller so broadly.the change in risk pooling must result from compliance with the state law,not its violation.
hancock also contends that rule puts a bridle on insurer discretion,reply br.at,because it requires any clause to state that the federal court will determine the level of discretion that it will accord the plan administrator determinations,rule.we disagree.the quoted language must be read in conjunction with the previous paragraph,which states 
the reservation of discretion made under this provision only establishes the scope of review that a federal court will apply when a claimant seeks judicial review of the plan administrator determination of eligibility for benefits,the payment of benefits,or interpretation of the terms and conditions applicable to the benefit plan.
id.by stating in this paragraph that the clause establishes the scope of review by a federal court while also acknowledging in the language relied upon by hancock that the federal court has the final say regarding the extent to which it will defer,the rule is merely recognizing settled law with respect to the ultimate authority of the federal court.see weber ge group life assurance,cir describing judicial power to adjust the standard of review.the extent of judicial deference depends not only on whether discretionary authority is conferred by a plan,but also on the presence of conflicts of interest or failure to comply with procedural requirements.see id.w e dial back our deference if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest.emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted rasenack,at w hen an administrator violates the statutory deadlines incorporated into the plan,firestone deference no longer applies.thus,the language quoted by hancock serves only an informational purpose,advising claimants of the scope of authority even when the plan has a clause.
at oral argument,counsel for hancock raised two arguments not presented in her briefs on appeal.although we could reject them both on procedural grounds,see corder lewis palmer sch.dist,cir an argument made for the first time at oral argument will not be considered.dubbs head start,cir failure to brief issues,even those raised in district court,permits an appellate court to decline review,we can readily dispose of them on the merits and elect to do so.
first,counsel asserted at oral argument that rule permits insurers to restrict only the scope of review,not the standard of review.although conceding that the terms scope of review and standard of review are sometimes used loosely,counsel asserted that s cope of review talks about what material a trial or appellate court can review in evaluating whether the decision was correct,whereas standard of review is looking at the degree to which you look at it from a de novo perspective,or the deference that you give.because the language of rule uses the term scope of review,argued counsel,the plan could restrict only what materials a court could consider in reviewing metlife decisions.if this argument is valid,the rule prohibits clauses providing for judicial review,thereby affecting and surviving erisa preemption.the argument,however,is unpersuasive.it would require us to adopt a nonsensical interpretation of the rule.the rule language states that the decisionmaker has discretion to decide whether the claimant is eligible for benefits and to interpret the terms and conditions of the benefit plan.rule internal quotation marks omitted.granting discretion to the decisionmaker would have no practical effect if a reviewing court did not have to give some measure of deference to the decisions made.to give an insurer discretion is to uphold its decision even at times when it appears to be incorrect.further,nothing in the rule addresses what materials can be reviewed by courts.thus,the term scope of review in the language must be referencing the extent to which a court defers to the decisionmaker,not the materials that a court can consider.see rule the reservation of discretion made under this provision only establishes the scope of review that a federal court will apply when a claimant seeks judicial review of the plan administrator determination of eligibility for benefits,the payment of benefits,or interpretation of the terms and conditions applicable to the benefit plan.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.perhaps the rule would have been clearer if it used the term standard of review rather than scope of review.but hancock has not persuaded us that the phrase scope of review is a term of art with such a settled meaning that we should ignore the clear import of the rule.
the second unbriefed contention raised at oral argument was that rule safe harbor is available only if the insurance company is the plan administrator.counsel drew that inference from the provision use of the term the plan administrator in the parentheticals where the name of the insurer would appear in a plan.noting that being a plan administrator triggers significant responsibilities under erisa,counsel suggested that the rule intended to permit discretion only to insurers that assumed such responsibilities.this restriction on which insurers could be permitted deference,concluded counsel,is a substantive constraint that affects risk pooling,so the rule regulates insurance and is not preempted by erisa.we reject the argument because rule does not require the insurance company to be the plan administrator.the rule definition of reservation of discretion clause encompasses clauses reserving discretion to the plan administrator or to the insurance company acting in the capacity of a plan administrator in an employee benefit plan.rule.the second alternative is superfluous if the insurance company must actually be the plan administrator and we generally avoid construing a law in a manner that renders clauses,or even words,superfluous.see ftc accusearch,cir.also,nowhere does the rule explicitly state that deference is available only to insurers who are plan administrators.we can hardly infer such a requirement from the rule use of the term plan administrator as a mere place holder in its language.
because rule has no substantial effect on risk pooling,we hold that it is not saved from erisa preemption as a state law regulating insurance.the utah rule is therefore preempted by a,and metlife clause is valid.
metlife review procedure 
although we ordinarily apply review when an erisa benefit plan gives discretion to the administrator or fiduciary to determine benefit claims,see kellogg,at,de novo review may be appropriate if the process did not substantially comply with erisa regulations,see id.at 
hancock contends that metlife determination of her claim was so procedurally defective as to warrant de novo review.in particular,she alleges that metlife denial letters did not include information required by erisa regulations,and that metlife did not provide a full and fair review of her appeal.we reject both contentions.
metlife denial letters 
erisa regulations require notifications to set forth,among other things,the specific plan provision justifying the denial as well as a description of additional information needed to perfect the claim and why the information is necessary.see g ii,iii.hancock complains that metlife letter and its first letter violated this regulation by not citing the plan provision upon which the denial was based and not explaining how she could perfect her claim.
metlife received hancock claim on january.in its march,denial letter metlife explained that because both verla hancock death certificate and autopsy report state that the cause of death is undetermined,accidental death has not been established and therefore hancock is not entitled to ad d benefits.admin.at.the letter quoted the plan ad d provision,including language that limits coverage to accidental losses.it informed hancock of her right to appeal to metlife,and asked her to state the reason s you believe the claim was improperly denied,and submit any additional comments,documents,records or other information relating to your claim that you deem appropriate to enable metlife to give your appeal proper consideration.id.at.
on may,hancock sent metlife a letter appealing the denial of ad d benefits.the letter argued that the autopsy report and death certificate did not preclude the possibility of accidental death and that o ther evidence exists to support the conclusion that my mother death was indeed an accident.id.at.it said that she had spoken with detective frank johnson of the west valley city police,who had investigated verla hancock death,and that he had told her that her mother had apparently hit her head after slipping and falling in the bathroom.the letter further stated that todd grey,who had conducted the autopsy,had agreed that it was possible for verla hancock to have slipped and hit her head without fracturing her skull,and that decomposition could have made it hard to detect a head injury.in addition,the letter included hancock offer to send police photographs of the scene as additional evidence that would be helpful in further establishing the accidental nature of my mother death.id.metlife denied hancock appeal on september.
neither metlife letter nor its letter violated g.first,the letter set forth the plan provision justifying the denial.it stated that the claim was denied for lack of evidence of accidental death,and properly cited the ad d language that limits coverage to such losses.hancock argues that the denial was based on an exclusion in the plan for death caused by physical illness but the record shows that metlife did not rely on that provision.second,the denial letter described what information was needed to perfect the claim and why that information was needed.it explained that to obtain ad d benefits,hancock must supply evidence of accidental death as required by the ad d provision.her own appeal letter indicates that she had understood what she had to do to contest metlife decision.we discern no procedural violation in metlife letter.
as for metlife letter,it could not have violated g because that provision applies only to denials of benefits,not denials of appeals.see metzger unum life ins.of,cir citing g to describe a plan administrator duties in the initial denial,and citing h to describe its duties in the appeals process ellis metro.life ins,cir what is not required to be included in the decision on appeal,because not relevant at this stage of the administrative review,is notice regarding how to perfect a claim or how to seek review.midgett washington group int l long term disability plan,cir explaining that the adverse benefit determination is the initial benefit denial,which is to be distinguished from the determination on review.emphases and internal quotation marks omitted.
full and fair review 
hancock contends that metlife denied her full and fair review because it ignored her evidence,did not respond to her forensic expert opinion in a timely manner,and failed to conduct an independent investigation of verla hancock death,instead relying solely on the government reports.aplt.br.at.her contentions lack merit.
every erisa benefit plan must have a procedure giving claimants a reasonable opportunity to appeal and under which there will be a full and fair review of the claim and the adverse benefit determination.h.full and fair reviews must take into account all comments,documents,records,and other information submitted by the claimant.id.h iv.moreover,absent special circumstances,decisions must be rendered within days of receipt of the appeal.id.i i.
in its first letter dated september,metlife rejected hancock conversations with detective johnson and the medical examiner as evidence of accidental death.it said that johnson had deferred to the medical examiner,grey,on cause of death,and that grey had merely speculated with hancock and had never amended his report regarding the cause of death.their comments,it continued,were conjecture.
by letter dated february,hancock appealed again.this time she submitted an investigative report prepared by mra forensic sciences.mra had conducted a test on tiles similar to those in verla hancock bathroom and found that they were slippery when wet.mra listed factors that made a accident likely,including verla hancock medical problems,history of falls,and a potentially wet floor although it provided no evidence that the tiles were wet at the time of death.the report then stated i t can not be concluded that verla hancock did not die of accidental causes.in fact,based upon the available information,there was sufficient evidence to suggest that she was prone to falling down and that she probably did fall down in the bathroom.admin.at.hancock letter stated that the enclosed documents were submitted on condition that they not be used in any future litigation.
metlife received hancock letter on february.ten days later it informed her that it would be willing to conduct a further administrative review,id.at,provided that she agree that her submissions be part of the administrative record that could be reviewed by a court.on march hancock agreed and asked metlife to proceed with its review.
more than three months passed with no decision from metlife.on june,hancock attorney wrote to metlife,noting that he had contacted metlife over times in the previous months and was always told only that the claim is in the review process,without additional explanation.id.at.the letter threatened suit for breach of contract if metlife did not pay the disputed ad d benefits within ten days.on september hancock,still without a decision on her appeal,filed suit.
metlife denied hancock second appeal the next day.the denial letter stated that it only supplemented the first letter and did not replace it.it again cited the plan ad d provision and summarized metlife reasons for denying the claim and the first appeal.it then stated that the mra report d id not demonstrate with certainty that the decedent had an accident and that the test said nothing about verla hancock actual cause of death.id.at.
from this correspondence we can not conclude that metlife denied hancock a full and fair review.metlife did not ignore her evidence it merely found it inconclusive.both letters took into account the information hancock had submitted and then reasonably explained why the information was insufficient to support the theory.
moreover,metlife had no duty to respond to the mra report within a particular time.erisa requires only that claimants be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal.h emphasis added.metlife satisfied this requirement when it reviewed hancock first appeal.erisa does not demand,and the plan does not provide for,a second opportunity to appeal.that metlife nevertheless considered her second appeal did not bring its response to that appeal under erisa regulations governing appeals.because hancock submitted the mra report with her second appeal,metlife delay in responding to it was not a procedural defect under erisa.
finally,hancock contends that metlife failure to conduct an independent investigation denied her the required full and fair review.we disagree.hancock argument for such an investigation is particularly unpersuasive here,because her mother death had been properly investigated by police detectives and a medical third parties with recognized credentials.
conflict of interest 
hancock contends that because metlife has a serious and inherent conflict of interest,aplt.br.at,it bears the burden of proving that its denial was reasonable.metlife concedes that as both claim administrator and insu
