background 
foley is the former president of the international brotherhood of electrical workers local hereinafter the union and a former trustee of the union pension fund.he worked in covered employment for fund pension purposes,employment in the electrical industry,from until his employer laid him off in.then,from through,foley worked in his family tire business,returning to employment in the electrical industry in.following his return to the electrical industry,foley was elected the union president and he served as a trustee of the pension fund from through july.in july,foley retired and sought pension benefits.
under the plan provisions,foley forfeited all credited service earned prior to his return to work in because of a provision which provided,in the years applicable to foley,that accrued pension credits lapsed when a plan participant did not work hours in covered employment for a consecutive period.there is,however,an exception to the provision,known as the exception,wherein the plan provides that an employee shall not forfeit credited service if he was continuously available for work within the jurisdiction of the union and unable to obtain covered employment based on this exception,in,shortly after foley began his tenure as trustee,the trustees agreed to excuse his pursuant to their understanding that work had not been available to him in covered employment from to.
on october,however,fred compton,a former union president and trustee,sent laurance baccini,counsel to the pension fund,a letter stating that the decision was incorrect because the trustees at that time based their decision on fabricated information improperly skewed in foley favor.upon receipt of compton letter,the trustees appointed a subcommittee to investigate compton allegations.then,in february,based on the subcommittee recommendations,the trustees reversed the decision because they concluded that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate foley claim that work was unavailable and that he was available for covered employment in the period.
in july,foley applied for pension benefits but,based upon their decision,the trustees denied his application insofar as it sought credits for the period between.foley appealed but was not successful as the trustees determined that he still had not presented sufficient information to establish his entitlement to credit for the disputed years of credited service.
on february,foley commenced this action under the employee retirement income security act,et.erisa,in particular a b and a,which action,as subsequently amended,named the fund,the union,the trustees,and various union officers as defendants.in his complaint foley asserted that the trustees improperly applied a more demanding evidentiary standard to him than to other employees who had been granted an exception to the provision notwithstanding a provision in the plan that all interpretations and decisions shall be applied in a uniform manner to all employees similarly situated.in addition to his erisa claims,foley also asserted claims under the labor management reporting and disclosure act of,et,lmrda,and the internal revenue code,and.following the parties for summary judgment,the district court dismissed all but foley erisa claims.see foley ibew local union pension fund,d we make no further reference to the dismissed claims,as foley has not from their dismissal and has not asserted that we should affirm on the basis of these claims.
after a bench trial in august,the district court found that the trustees arbitrarily and capriciously acted contrary to the terms of the plan when they denied foley credit for time during his employment in the electrical industry prior to his layoff.see foley ibew local union pension fund,d,foley.on august,the court entered judgment against appellants,and on december,entered an order granting foley motion for attorneys fees.see foley ibew local union pension fund,no.civ,wl.appellants have timely appealed from the judgment and order

iii.discussion 
the trustees denied foley credit for the disputed years of service because the subcommittee investigation demonstrated that work had been plentiful between and,but that foley was unavailable for work during that period due to his employment in the family tire business.the trustees also found that foley failed to produce any evidence supporting his claim.
under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,the district court was bound to affirm this decision if it was not contrary to the plan terms and was rationally related to a legitimate plan purpose.see orvosh,at.the district court determined that although the trustees believed in good faith that they were treating foley the same as any other applicant seeking the benefit of the exception,they actually treated him differently from other employees similarly situated in that they arbitrarily and capriciously subjected his application to a more demanding evidentiary standard and a stricter level of scrutiny than those of other employees.see foley,d at.a district court,however,may not substitute its judgment for that of a plan trustees in determining a claimant eligibility for benefits,and,as we discuss below,the record demonstrates that the trustees here did not arbitrarily and capriciously treat foley as not being similarly situated to other employees to whom the exception to the rule had been applied.
the record shows that during a trustees meeting in,they determined that foley forfeited the credits he earned from as he had a break in service as of.in,when,after resuming employment in the electrical industry,foley inquired as to the status of those credits,compton informed him that they had been forfeited and that it was too late to save them.
in,six months after foley was elected president of the union,he appointed himself,paul gilmore,and james mackin to three of the six positions on the fund board of trustees.shortly thereafter,the board of trustees granted foley credits for the years,reversing its prior forfeiture of his credits even though he had not applied formally for their reinstatement.indeed,foley did not present documentary evidence to support the award of credits at the time he was awarded the credits.instead,mackin and gilmore spoke on foley behalf,and the trustees appear to have accepted their statements as true.the record shows,however,that mackin and gilmore did not have first hand knowledge of the germane facts as they had not been employed full time in the electrical industry during the to period.
in october,however,the trustees received compton letter,seriously question ing the decision and stating that the pension trustees may have been either misled or misinformed when they reinstated foley credits.confronted with this formal written challenge,the trustees determined that they were obliged to review the facts and,accordingly,created the subcommittee to investigate the issues compton raised in his letter.
the subcommittee rendered its report in late or early.it found that work opportunities were plentiful from through and,according to the record available to it,the hours electricians worked during that period evidenced full employment,a few visiting brothers working and a decent amount of overtime.the subcommittee also determined that the trustees in primarily relied on gilmore statement that foley was available for work but gilmore admitted to the subcommittee that he knew only of foley availability after.the subcommittee interviewed foley,who stated that he went into the family business in and periodically checked to see if electrical work was available.
we recognize that the subcommittee noted that the lack of evidence supporting foley alleged availability for work in the electrical industry and inability to find work was not unique and that the available for work available exception had been applied liberally.in fact,the subcommittee report included a list showing each case in which the exception had been applied since.consequently,the subcommittee recommended that the trustees construe the exception more strictly than they had in the past and that if they did so in foley case,they also should examine the included list,making appropriate adjustments.id.at 
in february,following their review of the subcommittee report,the trustees unanimously voted to remove the credited service from foley pension record but advised him that at any time he could submit a request for reconsideration attaching relevant documentation.the trustees also resolved to reinvestigate all other individuals to whom the available for work available exception had been applied.see foley,d at.
in july,when foley applied for benefits,he did not submit additional information supporting a credit for service from to.accordingly,the trustees awarded foley pension benefits taking into account his break in service.foley appealed the decision,but the trustees concluded that they had insufficient evidence as to the unavailability of work and foley inability to obtain covered employment during the plan years,and.
the district court found that the trustees acted in good faith and believed they did not treat foley differently than other employees.foley,d at.however,the court determined that the trustees actually held foley to a stricter standard than any other individual in like circumstances,arbitrarily and capriciously violating their duty to interpret the plan and apply decisions in a uniform manner to all employees similarly situated.id.at citation omitted.
the district court made much of the fact that the trustees appointed the subcommittee to investigate the circumstances under which foley had been granted the exception in,yet failed to form a subcommittee to examine any other plan participant pension application.foley,d at.as the district court recognized,however,the allegations of impropriety that compton raised in his letter justified a review of plaintiff claim to determine whether there was any impropriety.id.at.thus,given the allegations of impropriety in the compton letter,and in light of their fiduciary duties to the fund,the trustees reasonably and appropriately appointed the subcommittee in foley case.
the district court next took issue with the actions the trustees took upon receipt of the subcommittee report.see id.the court seems to have been of the view that because the investigation yielded no evidence of wrongdoing or deceit,the trustees were bound to grant foley application for benefits as they had with a number of individuals who sought refuge under the exception who,like foley,produced a minuscule amount of evidence.id.the court also seemed frustrated with the fact that the trustees had not conducted an investigation with respect to the other employees who were granted the benefit of the exception.id.at.these cases differed from foley,however,in that these employees eligibility for the exception never was challenged.further,the subcommittee did not uncover any evidence suggesting that any of them acquired pension credits through improper means 
in essence,the court held that because foley was similarly situated to other employees who had benefitted from a liberal interpretation of the exception,the trustees failure to award him the service credits was arbitrary and capricious.foley,d at.the premise of the court decision was,however,erroneous as foley was not similarly situated to rank and file union members who had been granted the benefit of the exception.rather,he was a trustee when he sought to have service credits added to his pension record,and he appointed the trustees who spoke on his behalf and apparently voted to grant him the benefit of the exception.moreover,foley case was the only one under the exception where issues of impropriety were raised,and his case was the only one in which the employee entitlement to benefits under the exception was challenged.furthermore,upon review of the subcommittee report,the trustees recognized that they did not have evidence to support the application of the exception to foley.
it is also significant that at a time that he should have been continuously available for work in order for his break in service to be excused,foley was engaged in the family tire business and thus had an incentive not to work in the electrical industry.when the district court made its determination that the trustees acted arbitrarily and capriciously,it should have recognized that this circumstance distinguished foley case from those of other supposedly similarly situated employees who were granted the benefit of the exception,as foley made no showing that they had incentives equivalent to his to eschew employment in the electrical industry.in the circumstances,it can not reasonably be held that the trustees arbitrarily and capriciously treated foley differently from other employees similarly situated,and thus the district court erred in reaching its result.
we emphasize that in focusing on the fact that credit under the exception had been granted liberally in the past rather than examining whether the trustees decision was contrary to plan language or whether it was rationally related to a legitimate plan purpose,the district court did not properly credit significant evidence.this evidence included the subcommittee finding that work was plentiful from,the trustees own recollections and understanding regarding the availability of work during that time,gilmore admission to the subcommittee of his lack of knowledge of the germane facts,foley failure to present evidence,and the circumstances in which foley was originally granted the exception.the court,however,should have relied on this evidence as it was not free to substitute its judgment for that of the plan administrators.see orvosh,at.
moreover,the district court holding binds the trustees to a result that was a consequence of poor admini
