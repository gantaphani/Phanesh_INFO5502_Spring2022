erisa seeks to make the benefits promised by an employer more secure by mandating certain oversight systems and other standard procedures,travelers,at,and those systems and procedures are intended to be uniform,at.erisa extensive reporting,disclosure,and recordkeeping requirements are central to,and an essential part of,this uniform plan administration system.vermont law and regulation,however,also govern plan reporting,disclosure,and recordkeeping.is necessary in order to prevent multiple jurisdictions from imposing differing,or even parallel,regulations,creating wasteful administrative costs and threatening to subject plans to liability.erisa uniform rule design also makes clear that it is the secretary of labor,not the separate states,that is authorized to decide whether to exempt plans from erisa reporting requirements or to require erisa plans to report data such as that sought by vermont.
vermont counterarguments are unpersuasive.vermont argues that respondent has not shown that the state scheme has caused it to suffer economic costs,but respondent need not wait to bring its claim until confronted with numerous inconsistent obligations and encumbered with any ensuing costs.in addition,the fact that erisa and the state reporting scheme have different objectives does not transform vermont direct regulation of a fundamental erisa function into an innocuous and peripheral set of additional rules.vermont regime also can not be saved by invoking the state traditional power to regulate in the area of public health.
c erisa reporting,disclosure,and recordkeeping provisions maintain their force regardless of whether the new patient protection and affordable care act reporting obligations also state law.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
this case presents a challenge to the applicability of a state law requiring disclosure of payments relating to health care claims and other information relating to health care services.vermont enacted the statute so it could maintain an health care database.stat,tit,a cum.supp.the state law,by its terms,applies to health plans established by employers and regulated by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et.the question before the court is whether erisa the vermont statute as it applies to erisa plans.
vermont requires certain public and private entities that provide and pay for health care services to report information to a state agency.the reported information is compiled into a database reflecting all health care utilization,costs,and resources in vermont,and health care utilization and costs for services provided to vermont residents in another state.b.a database of this kind is sometimes called an claims database,for it requires submission of data from all health insurers and other entities that pay for health care services.almost states have or are implementing similar databases.see brief for state of new york et as amici curiae,and.
vermont law requires health insurers,health care providers,health care facilities,and governmental agencies to report any information relating to health care costs,prices,quality,utilization,or resources required by the state agency,including data relating to health insurance claims and enrollment.c.health insurers must submit claims data on members,subscribers,and policyholders.h.the vermont law defines health insurer to include a health care benefit plan,as well as any third party administrator and any similar entity with claims data,eligibility data,provider files,and other information relating to health care provided to a vermont resident.j b.the database must be made available as a resource for insurers,employers,providers,purchasers of health care,and state agencies to continuously review health care utilization,expenditures,and performance in vermont.h b.
vermont law leaves to a state agency the responsibility to establish the types of information to be filed under this section,and the time and place and the manner in which such information shall be filed.d.the law has been implemented by a regulation creating the vermont healthcare claims uniform reporting and evaluation system.the regulation requires the submission of medical claims data,pharmacy claims data,member eligibility data,provider data,and other information,reg,code of.rules,d cvr,in accordance with specific formatting,coding,and other requirements.under the regulation,health insurers must report data about the health care services provided to vermonters regardless of whether they are treated in vermont or and about who are treated in vermont.d see also.the agency at present does not collect data on denied claims,a,but the statute would allow it to do so.
covered entities reporters must register with the state and must submit data monthly,quarterly,or annually,depending on the number of individuals that an entity serves.the more people served,the more frequently the reports must be filed,i.entities with fewer than members need not report at all,and are termed voluntary reporters as distinct from mandated reporters.reporters can be fined for not complying with the statute or the regulation.g.
respondent liberty mutual insurance company maintains a health plan plan that provides benefits in all states to over individuals,comprising respondent employees,their families,and former employees.the plan is and,which means that plan benefits are paid by respondent.the plan,which qualifies as an employee welfare benefit plan under erisa,is subject to erisa comprehensive regulation,new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins.respondent,as the plan sponsor,is both a fiduciary and plan administrator.
the plan uses blue cross blue shield of massachusetts,blue cross as a administrator.blue cross manages the processing,review,and payment of claims for respondent.liberty mut.ins.donegan,case below.in its contract with blue cross,respondent agreed to hold blue cross harmless for any charges,including legal fees,judgments,administrative expenses and benefit payment requirements,arising from or in connection with the plan or due to respondent failure to comply with any laws or regulations.app.the plan is a voluntary reporter under the vermont regulation because it covers some vermonters,which is fewer than the cutoff for mandated reporting.blue cross,however,serves several thousand vermonters,and so it is a mandated reporter.blue cross,therefore,must report the information it possesses about the plan members in vermont.
in august,vermont issued a subpoena ordering blue cross to transmit to a contractor all the files it possessed on member eligibility,medical claims,and pharmacy claims for vermont members,at.for clarity,the court uses vermont to refer not only to the state but also to state officials acting in their official capacity.the penalty for noncompliance,vermont threatened,would be a fine of up to a day and a suspension of blue cross authorization to operate in vermont for as long as six months,at.respondent,concerned in part that the disclosure of confidential information regarding its members might violate its fiduciary duties under the plan,instructed blue cross not to comply.respondent then filed this action in the united states district court for the district of vermont.it sought a declaration that erisa application of vermont statute and regulation to the plan and an injunction forbidding vermont from trying to acquire data about the plan or its members.
vermont filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court treated as one for summary judgment,see fed.rule civ.proc.d,and respondent filed a for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to vermont.it first held that respondent,despite being a mere voluntary reporter,had standing to sue because it was faced with either allegedly violating its fiduciary and administrative responsibilities to the plan or assuming liability for blue cross withholding of the data from vermont.liberty mut.ins.kimbell,d.the district court then concluded that the state reporting scheme was not.although that scheme may have some indirect effect on health benefit plans,the court reasoned that the effect is so peripheral that the regulation can not be considered an attempt to interfere with the administration or structure of a welfare benefit plan.at.
the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed.the panel was unanimous in concluding that respondent had standing,but it divided on the merits of the challenge.the panel majority explained that one of erisa core functions reporting can not be laden with burdens,subject to incompatible,multiple and variable demands,and freighted with risk of fines,breach of duty,and legal expense.at.the vermont regime,the court held,does just that,at.
this court granted certiorari to address the important issue of erisa.
the text of erisa express clause is the necessary starting point.it is terse but comprehensive.erisa 
any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.
the court has addressed the potential reach of this clause before.in travelers,the court observed that i f relate to were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,then for all practical purposes would never run its course.at.that is a result no sensible person could have intended.california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,scalia,concurring.so the need for workable standards has led the court to reject uncritical literalism in applying the clause.travelers,at.
implementing these principles,the court case law to date has described two categories of state laws that erisa.first,erisa a state law if it has a reference to erisa plans.ibid.to be more precise,w here a state law acts immediately and exclusively upon erisa plans or where the existence of erisa plans is essential to the law operation,that reference will result in.dillingham,supra,at.second,erisa a state law that has an impermissible connection with erisa plans,meaning a state law that governs a central matter of plan administration or interferes with nationally uniform plan administration.egelhoff egelhoff.a state law also might have an impermissible connection with erisa plans if acute,albeit indirect,economic effects of the state law force an erisa plan to adopt a certain scheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of insurers.travelers,supra,at.when considered together,these formulations ensure that erisa express clause receives the broad scope congress intended while avoiding the clause susceptibility to limitless application.
respondent contends that vermont law falls in the second category of state laws that are by erisa laws that govern,or interfere with the uniformity of,plan administration and so have an impermissible connection with erisa plans.egelhoff,supra,at travelers,at.when presented with these contentions in earlier cases,the court has considered the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive,and the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans,dillingham,supra,at.here,those considerations lead the court to conclude that vermont regime,as applied to erisa plans,is.
erisa does not guarantee substantive benefits.the statute,instead,seeks to make the benefits promised by an employer more secure by mandating certain oversight systems and other standard procedures.travelers,at.those systems and procedures are intended to be uniform,at erisa clause indicates congress intent to establish the regulation of employee welfare benefit plans as exclusively a federal concern quoting alessi.requiring erisa administrators to master the relevant laws of states and to contend with litigation would undermine the congressional goal of minimiz ing the administrative and financial burden s on plan administrators burdens ultimately borne by the beneficiaries.egelhoff,supra,at quoting mcclendon,see also fort halifax packing coyne.
erisa reporting,disclosure,and recordkeeping requirements for welfare benefit plans are extensive.erisa plans must present participants with a plan description explaining,among other things,the plan eligibility requirements and procedures.a,b.plans must notify participants when a claim is denied and state the basis for the denial.most important for the question presented here,welfare benefit plans governed by erisa must file an annual report with the secretary of labor.the report must include a financial statement listing assets and liabilities for the previous year and,further,receipts and disbursements of funds.b,b,b a b,a.the information on assets and liabilities as well as receipts and disbursements must be provided to plan participants on an annual basis as well.a,b a b,b.because welfare benefit plans are in the business of providing benefits to plan participants,a plan reporting of data on disbursements by definition incorporates paid claims.see of labor,schedule h form financial information requiring reporting of b enefit claims payable and b enefit payment and payments to provide benefits online at.as last visited.
the secretary of labor has authority to establish additional reporting and disclosure requirements for erisa plans.erisa permits the secretary to use the data disclosed by plans for statistical and research purposes,and to compile and publish such studies,analyses,reports,and surveys based thereon as he may deem appropriate.a.the secretary also may,in connection with any research,collect,compile,analyze,and publish data,information,and statistics relating to plans.a see also a approving other studies relating to employee benefit plans,the matters regulated by this subchapter,and the enforcement procedures provided for under this subchapter 
erisa further permits the secretary of labor to requir e any information or data from any plan where he finds such data or information is necessary to carry out the purposes of the statute,a b,and,when investigating a possible statutory violation,to require the submission of reports,books,and records,and the filing of data related to other requisite filings,a.the secretary has the general power to promulgate regulations necessary or appropriate to administer the statute,and to provide exemptions from any reporting obligations,a.
it should come as no surprise,then,that plans must keep detailed records so compliance with erisa reporting and disclosure requirements may be verified,explained,or clarified,and checked for accuracy and completeness.the records to be retained must include vouchers,worksheets,receipts,and applicable resolutions.see also allowing the secretary to provide for the keeping of books and records,and for the inspection of such books and records 
these various requirements are not mere formalities.violation of any one of them may result in both civil and criminal liability.see.
as all this makes plain,reporting,disclosure,and recordkeeping are central to,and an essential part of,the uniform system of plan administration contemplated by erisa.the court,in fact,has noted often that these requirements are integral aspects of erisa.see,dillingham,at travelers,supra,at,supra,at massachusetts morash,fort halifax,supra,at metropolitan life ins.massachusetts.
vermont reporting regime,which compels plans to report detailed information about claims and plan members,both intrudes upon a central matter of plan administration and interferes with nationally uniform plan administration.egelhoff,at.the state law and regulation govern plan reporting,disclosure,and by necessary implication recordkeeping.these matters are fundamental components of erisa regulation of plan administration.differing,or even parallel,regulations from multiple jurisdictions could create wasteful administrative costs and threaten to subject plans to liability.see,g supplying penalties for violation of vermont reporting rules cvr same.is necessary to prevent the states from imposing novel,inconsistent,and burdensome reporting requirements on plans.
the secretary of labor,not the states,is authorized to administer the reporting requirements of plans governed by erisa.he may exempt plans from erisa reporting requirements altogether.see a cfr exempting health plans from the annual financial reporting requirement.and,he may be authorized to require erisa plans to report data similar to that which vermont seeks,though that question is not presented here.either way,the uniform rule design of erisa makes it clear that these decisions are for federal authorities,not for the separate states.
vermont disputes the of its reporting regime on several fronts.the state argues that respondent has not demonstrated that the reporting regime in fact has caused it to suffer economic costs.brief for petitioner.but respondent challenge is not based on the theory that the state law must be solely because of economic burdens caused by the state law.see travelers,at.respondent argues,rather,that vermont scheme regulates a central aspect of plan administration and,if the scheme is not,plans will face the possibility of a body of disuniform state reporting laws and,even if uniform,the necessity to accommodate multiple governmental agencies.a plan need not wait to bring a claim until confronted with numerous inconsistent obligations and encumbered with any ensuing costs.
vermont contends,furthermore,that erisa does not the state statute and regulation because the state reporting scheme has different objectives.this court has recognized that t he principal object of erisa is to protect plan participants and beneficiaries.boggs boggs.and i n enacting erisa,congress primary concern was with the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.morash,supra,at.the state maintains that its program has nothing to do with the financial solvency of plans or the prudent behavior of fiduciaries.see brief for petitioner.this does not suffice to avoid federal.
p claims turn on congress intent.travelers,at.the purpose of a state law,then,is relevant only as it may relate to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive,at,or the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans,dillingham,supra,at.in travelers,for example,the court noted that b oth the purpose and the effects of the state law at issue distinguish ed it from laws that function as a regulation of an erisa plan itself.at.the perceived difference here in the objectives of the vermont law and erisa does not shield vermont reporting regime from.vermont orders health insurers,including erisa plans,to report detailed information about the administration of benefits in a systematic manner.this is a direct regulation of a fundamental erisa function.any difference in purpose does not transform this direct regulation of a central matter of plan administration,egelhoff,supra,at,into an innocuous and peripheral set of additional rules.
the vermont regime can not be saved by invoking the state traditional power to regulate in the area of public health.the court in the past has addressed claims of with the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law,in particular state laws regulating a subject of traditional state power.travelers,supra,at.erisa,however,certainly contemplated the of substantial areas of traditional state regulation.dillingham,at.erisa a state law that regulates a key facet of plan administration even if the state law exercises a traditional state power.see egelhoff,at.the fact that reporting is a principal and essential feature of erisa demonstrates that congress intended to state reporting laws like vermont,including those that operate with the purpose of furthering public health.the analysis may be different when applied to a state law,such as a tax on hospitals,see de buono medical and clinical services fund,the enforcement of which necessitates incidental reporting by erisa plans but that is not the law before the court.any presumption against,whatever its force in other instances,can not validate a state law that enters a fundamental area of erisa regulation and thereby counters the federal purpose in the way this state law does.
respondent suggests that the patient protection and affordable care act aca,which created new reporting obligations for health plans and incorporated those requirements into the body of erisa,further demonstrates that erisa vermont reporting regime.see,e.the aca,however,specified that it shall not be construed to preempt any state law that does not prevent the application of the provisions of the aca.d.this provision might prevent any new reporting obligations from state reporting regimes like vermont,notwithstanding the incorporation of these requirements in the heart of erisa.but see a providing that the new aca provisions shall not be construed to affect or modify the erisa clause as applied to group health plans a same.
the court has no need to resolve this issue.erisa reporting,disclosure,and recordkeeping provisions upon which the court conclusion rests maintain their force whether or not the new aca reporting obligations also state law.
erisa express clause requires invalidation of the vermont reporting statute as applied to erisa plans.the state statute imposes duties that are inconsistent with the central design of erisa,which is to provide a single uniform national scheme for the administration of erisa plans without interference from laws of the several states even when those laws,to a large extent,impose parallel requirements.the judgment of the court of appeals for the second circuit is

we decided travelers in.i joined that opinion and have joined others applying the approach we adopted in travelers.but our interpretation of erisa express provision has become increasingly difficult to reconcile with our jurisprudence.travelers departed from the statutory text,deeming it unhelpful.at.but,in other cases involving express provisions,the text has been the beginning and often the end of our analysis,chamber of commerce of united states of america whiting,focus ing on the plain wording to define the scope of the immigration reform and control act express clause see also national meat harris,slip,at,parsing the text to determine the scope of the federal meat inspection act express clause.we have likewise refused to look to policy limits that are not remotely discernible in the statutory text.whiting,supra,at.we have not given a sound basis for departing from these principles and treating differently from other express provisions.

i write separately to emphasize that a failure to find here would subject health plans under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et,to or more potentially conflicting information reporting requirements.doing so is likely to create serious administrative problems.the court points out that the respondent plan provides benefits to over individuals living in different states.see ante,at.in addition,amici curiae tell us that,health plans provide benefits to million americans.brief for american benefits council et as amici curiae.if each state is free to go its own way,each independently determining what information each plan must provide about benefits,the result could well be unnecessary,duplicative,and conflicting reporting requirements,any of which can mean increased confusion and increased cost.private standard setting can of course help alleviate these problems,but given the large number of different possible regulations,i do not believe that is sufficient.costello taylor,apcd council nahdo,standardization of data collection in claims databases,online at https as last visited.
i would also emphasize that does not necessarily prevent vermont or other states from obtaining the,information that they need.states wishing to obtain information can ask the federal government for appropriate approval.as the majority points out,the secretary of labor has authority to establish additional reporting and disclosure requirements for erisa plans.ante,at see.moreover,the secretary is authorized to undertake research and surveys and in connection therewith to collect,compile,analyze and publish data,information,and statistics relating to employee benefit plans,including retirement,deferred compensation,and welfare plans.a.at least one other important statute provides the secretary of health and human services with similar authority.see a part of the patient protection and affordable care act that is applicable to group health insurance plans including erisa plans brief for united states as amicus curiae the department of labor,the department of health and human services,and the department of treasury are currently considering a rulemaking to require health plans to report more detailed information about various aspects of plan administration,such as enrollment,claims processing,and benefit offerings 
i see no reason why the secretary of labor could not develop reporting requirements that satisfy the states needs,including some requirements,as appropriate.nor do i see why the department could not delegate to a particular state the authority to obtain data related to that state,while also providing the data to the federal secretary for use by other states or at the federal level.
although the need for federal approval or authorization limits to some degree the states power to obtain information,requiring that approval has considerable advantages.the federal agencies are more likely to be informed about,and to understand,consequences and needs from a national perspective.their involvement may consequently secure for the states necessary information without unnecessarily creating costly conflicts particularly when compared with such alternatives as giving each state free rein to go its own way or asking nonexpert federal courts to try to iron out,regulation by regulation,such conflicts.med tronic,lohr,breyer,concurring in part and concurring in judgment reading a complex,ambiguous regulatory statute to permit informed agency involvement is more likely to achieve congress general objectives.
for these reasons,and others that the majority sets forth,i agree that vermont statute is because it interferes with nationally uniform plan administration.egelhoff egelhoff.

to better control health care outcomes and costs,vermont requires all public and private entities that pay for health care services provided to vermont residents to supply data to the state claims database.many states have similar databases in place or in development.the question presented in this case is whether vermont health care law is preempted by the employer retirement income security act of erisa,stat,et,the federal law regulating employee benefit plans.i would hold that vermont effort to track health care services provided to its residents and the cost of those services does not impermissibly intrude on erisa dominion over employee benefit plans.
in,the vermont legislature established the vermont health care uniform reporting and evaluation system,a database populated by information on health care claims paid by insurers and other coverage providers.see.stat,tit,cum.supp.reg,code.rules,d directing insurers and other coverage providers to submit medical claims data,pharmacy claims data,member eligibility data,provider data,and other information related to health care provided to vermont residents and health care provided by vermont health care providers and facilities health insurers and other coverage providers must report the required data if they cover at least vermont residents.ab.
seventeen other states have enacted similar database systems,called claims databases.these states,like vermont,collect data to serve compelling interests,including identification of reforms effective to drive down health care costs,evaluation of relative utility of different treatment options,and detection of instances of discrimination in the provision of care.see brief for national governors association et as amici curiae brief for harvard law school center for health law and policy innovation et as amici curiae brief for state of new york et as amici curiae.see also.stat,tit,a vermont law is designed to help identif y health care needs and infor m health care policy,evaluat e the effectiveness of intervention programs on improving patient outcomes,compar e costs between various treatment settings and approaches,determin e the capacity and distribution of existing resources,and provid e information to purchasers of health care 
respondent liberty mutual insurance company liberty,in common with legions of employers,provides health care to its employees through a plan,administered by blue shield blue cross because blue cross administers thousands of health care policies in vermont,the state requires it to report data for all of the plans it administers,and blue cross has complied with this mandate.in,for example,blue cross reported data on over vermont health beneficiaries.roughly half of the beneficiaries received coverage through employer policies.app.in,at liberty request,blue cross did not submit data on vermont residents who received coverage through liberty plan,at.vermont ordered blue cross to provide the claims data,at.liberty instructed blue cross not to comply and,shortly thereafter,filed the instant suit,seeking to block vermont from obtaining the data.
in defense of its resistance to vermont law,liberty relies on its plan status as an employee welfare benefit plan,defined as any plan,fund,or program established or maintained by an employer for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries,through the purchase of insurance or otherwise,medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness.because erisa directs plan fiduciaries to conserve plan assets for the purpose of providing benefits to participants,a a ii,liberty maintains that erisa preempts diverse state reporting laws.if there is to be mandatory reporting by erisa plans,liberty urges,the source of the mandate should be a uniform national reporting regime.see brief for respondent tr.of oral arg.
opposing preemption of its law,vermont points out that the efficacy of the state law depends on comprehensive reporting,collecting data on numerous beneficiaries from each of several major segments of the health care market.see brief for petitioner brief for harvard law school center for health law and policy innovation et as amici curiae about half of americans with health insurance receive coverage from their employers,of commerce,bureau of census,smith medalia,health insurance coverage in the united states,and of such persons are covered by an employer plan.brief for harvard law school center for health law and policy innovation et as amici curiae.in vermont,about of the database total content originates from employer plans.brief for petitioner,and.stopping states from collecting claims data from employer health care plans would thus hugely undermine the reporting regimes on which vermont and other states depend to maintain and improve the quality,and hold down the cost,of health care services.
the united states district court for the district of vermont rejected liberty plea for preemption.vermont law,that court determined,served the state undoubted interest in regulating health care markets,and did not substantially interfere with the operation of liberty erisa plans.see app.to pet.for cert.the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed,two to one.liberty mut.ins.donegan.the majority acknowledged that the supreme court decisions of the marked something of a pivot in starting with a presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law,especially if the state action occurs in fields of traditional state regulation,like health care.at quoting new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins.nonetheless,the majority concluded that erisa preempted the application of vermont law to liberty plan,at.the reporting of information about plan benefits,the majority reasoned,qualifies as a core erisa functio n and,therefore,must be subject to a uniform federal standard.at.judge straub dissented,offering a concise critique of the majority opinion 
the majority finds that the burden imposed by the vermont reporting requirement warrants preemption of the statute.this conclusion falters for two primary reasons.first,the reporting requirement imposed by the vermont statute differs in kind from the reporting that is required by erisa and therefore was not the kind of state law congress intended to preempt.second,liberty mutual has failed to show any actual burden,much less a burden that triggers erisa preemption.rather,the vermont statute does not interfere with an erisa plan administration of benefits.at.
essentially for the reasons judge straub identified,i would hold that erisa does not preempt vermont statute.that law and erisa serve different purposes.erisa domain is the design and administration of employee benefit plans notably,prescriptions on the vesting of benefits,claims processing,and the designation of beneficiaries.see travelers,at congress intended to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law internal quotation marks omitted.its reporting requirements,geared to those functions,ensure that the plans in fact provide covered benefits.vermont statute,in contrast,aims to improve the quality and utilization,and reduce the cost,of health care in vermont by providing consumers,government officials,and researchers with comprehensive data about the health care delivery system.nor does vermont law impose burdens on erisa plans of the kind this court has found sufficient to warrant preemption.
erisa preemption clause provides that the act shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.lacking clear direction from the clause opaque text,de buono medical and clinical services fund,the court has sought to honor congress evident call for an expansive preemption principle without invalidating state regulations falling outside erisa domain.see travelers,at the governing text of the erisa preemption clause is clearly expansive but i f relate to were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,then for all practical purposes would never run its course,for really,universally,relations stop nowhere.some internal quotation marks omitted 
seeking to bring some measure of determinacy to erisa preemption,the court has stated a law relates to an employee benefit plan if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.at some internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the court of appeals found,and the parties do not here contest,that vermont law lacks reference to erisa plans because the law applies to all health care payers and does not home in on erisa plans.see,at.the question,therefore,is whether the law has an impermissible connection with erisa plans.because the term connection with is scarcely more restrictive than relate to,the court has cautioned against uncritical literalism,egelhoff egelhoff,internal quotation marks omitted,and has set out this further formulation t o determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection,we look both to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive,as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.
in framing preemption doctrine,the court does not assum e lightly that congress has derogated state regulation,but instead addresse s claims of with the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law,travelers,at,especially where the state regulation deals with matters of health and safety,de buono,at internal quotation marks omitted.in travelers and subsequent decisions upholding state laws against preemption challenges,this court made clear that this presumption plays an important role in erisa cases.travelers,at,california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,de buono,at.vermont law is a vital part of the state control of its own health care market.see supra,at,at straub,dissenting.the presumption against preemption should thus apply full strength,and liberty has not rebutted it,it has not shown that erisa demands the preemption of vermont law.to the contrary,the court erisa preemption precedent points against preemption in this case.
to determine whether vermont law,as applied to liberty plan,has an impermissible connection with erisa plans,i look first to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide.egelhoff,at oneok,learjet,slip,at emphasizing the importance of considering the target at which the state law aims in applying ordinary principles.because erisa reporting requirements and the vermont law elicit different information and serve distinct purposes,there is no sensible reason to find the vermont law preempted.
benefit plans must,absent exemption,file annual reports containing financial and actuarial data to enable the secretary of labor to evaluate plans management and solvency.see,a b dillingham,at congress established extensive reporting requirements to protect against the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.internal quotation marks omitted 
beyond debate,vermont law does not seek to regulate the management and solvency of welfare plans.see supra,at reciting objectives of the vermont law.vermont requests no information on plan finances.see reg,code of.rules,d supra,at detailing the types of data collected by vermont.the state collects data on paid health care claims,not denied claims.see a.vermont seeks a better understanding of how its residents obtain health care and how effective that care is.unlike erisa superintendence,vermont interest does not lie in reviewing whether a provider is keeping its bargain to covered employees.nor does vermont statute even arguably regulate relationships among the prime erisa entities beneficiaries,participants,administrators,employees,trustees and other fiduciaries,and the plan itself.
despite these significant differences between erisa reporting requirements and vermont regime,liberty contends that congress intended to spare erisa plans from reporting requirements unless those requirements are nationally uniform.in support of this contention,liberty points to dicta from this court opinions and selections from erisa legislative history.see,travelers,at s ubject matters covered by erisa include reporting,disclosure,fiduciary responsibility,and the like.quoting shaw delta air lines,mcclendon,erisa sets various uniform standards,including rules concerning reporting,disclosure,and fiduciary responsibility,for both pension and welfare plans.cong.rec.remarks of javits state laws compelling disclosure from plans will be superseded.far from unambiguously endorsing liberty sweeping view of erisa preemptive scope,these statements can be read at least as reasonably for the unremarkable principle that erisa preempts state reporting rules designed to serve the same purposes as erisa reporting requirements.this more limited understanding is consistent with the court admonition to pay close attention to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide.egelhoff,at.
satisfied that erisa objectives do not require preemption of vermont law,i turn to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans.ibid.the imposition of some burdens on the administration of erisa plans,the court has held,does not suffice to require preemption.see de buono,at.while a law imposing costs so acute as to effectively dictate how a plan is designed or administered could trigger preemption,see,at,no such extreme effects are present here.moreover,no central matter of plan administration,egelhoff,at,is touched by vermont law.that law prescribes no vesting requirements,benefit levels,beneficiary designations,or rules on how claims should be processed or paid.indeed,vermont law does not require liberty to do anything.the burden of compliance falls on blue cross,which apparently provides the data without protest on behalf of other plans.see supra,at.
reporting and disclosure are no doubt required of erisa plans,but those requirements are ancillary to the areas erisa governs.reporting and recordkeeping incident to state laws of general applicability have been upheld as they bear on erisa plans.in de buono,at,for example,the court held that a tax on patient services provided by a hospital operated by an erisa plan was not preempted,even though administration of the tax required filing quarterly reports.and in dillingham,at,the court held that california law was not preempted as applied to apprenticeship programs established by erisa plans.laws typically require employees to keep records of the wages paid to employees and make them available for review by state authorities.see,cal.lab.code ann.west law in dillingham.the second circuit erred,then,in holding that erisa preempts any reporting obligation that is more than slight.see,at.
the vermont statute keeps company with the laws considered in de buono and dillingham it is generally applicable and does not involve a central matter of plan administration.egelhoff,at.and,as judge straub emphasized in his dissent,liberty failed to provide any details or showing of the alleged
