james northcutt and lewis smith brought this action seeking pension plan benefits withheld from them by their employer,general motors corporation gm.gm had suspended the payment of these benefits and was treating the amount otherwise due to the plaintiffs each month as reimbursement for past disability and pension plan overpayments.northcutt and smith claim that of the employee retirement income security act erisa,prohibits gm from invoking contractual remedies for reimbursement and instead requires gm to seek equitable relief before a court.the district court granted summary judgment for gm it determined that did not preclude the enforcement of the recoupment provisions.we agree with the district court and therefore affirm its judgment.
background 
in our de novo review of the district court grant of summary judgment to gm,we must construe all facts in the light most favorable to the party.keri bd.of trustees of purdue,cir.on the issues before us,there is no dispute as to the essential facts.
northcutt and smith were hourly employees of gm and,during their employment,were members of the international union,united automobile,aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw.the terms and conditions of their employment,including pension and disability benefits,were governed under the collective bargaining agreements between gm and the uaw.under the terms of these agreements,both pension and disability benefit payments otherwise due to plan participants were to be reduced by an amount equivalent to the federal social security benefits to which the employee was entitled.the agreements further provided that,if the employee received full benefits,unreduced by any social security income,and if the employee later received a retroactive award of social security benefits,that award would be considered as having been received throughout the time period for which social security eligibility was established.the plan thus would be considered to have overpaid for that period.
in the event that a retroactive award of social security resulted in such an overpayment of plan benefits,the agreements further mandated that the employee reimburse the plan.the supplemental agreement covering the disability program specifically provided 
section.recovery of benefit overpayments 
if it is determined that any benefit s paid to an employe e under a general motors benefit plan should not have been paid or should have been paid in a lesser amount,written notice thereof shall be given to such employe e and the employe e shall repay the amount of the overpayment.
if the employe e fails to repay such amount of overpayment promptly,the corporation,on behalf of the applicable benefit plan,shall arrange to recover the amount of such overpayment from any monies then payable,or which may become payable,to the employe e in the form of wages or benefits payable under a general motors benefit plan excluding the general motors employees pension plan incorporated under the national agreement or any exhibits thereto.
the agreement covering the pension plan contained similar language requiring repayment of benefits and authorized a deduction from future monthly benefits until the total amount suspended equals the overpayment,at.
on january,northcutt retired from gm.shortly before his retirement,he applied for monthly retirement benefits and an early retirement supplement through the plan.in connection with his application,northcutt signed an additional agreement regarding his benefits,which provided,in pertinent part 
if i become eligible for a social security disability insurance benefit or an unreduced social security benefit prior to attaining age,i immediately will furnish to the gm pension plan administration center evidence of the effective date of my entitlement to such benefit.
any overpayment of my gm pension benefits resulting from my receipt of such social security benefit must be refunded by me in a lump sum.otherwise,my gm pension benefits will be suspended in accordance with pension plan provisions until the total amount suspended equals the total amount of the overpayment.
in,northcutt was determined eligible for social security disability insurance benefits ssdib.in,he received a retroactive social security award amounting to.gm contacted him in july and requested reimbursement northcutt did not repay gm,claiming that his ssdib award had been dissipated in its entirety by the time gm made its demand.gm then began to recoup the overpayment by suspending prospectively northcutt benefits.
smith took a disability leave of absence beginning in.he began receiving full benefits under gm disability plan,and later,under the pension plan.on april,smith signed an additional reimbursement agreement with gm,acknowledging the provisions of the gm plan relating to other sources of disability income.specifically,the agreement acknowledged that benefits due under the plan would be reduced by other disability benefits retroactive awards of disability benefits would be treated as having been received throughout the period for which they were provided smith was obligated to request ssdib and to request reconsideration of any denial of such benefits any retroactive award of ssdib would result in an overpayment of benefits under the gm plan,for which reimbursement would be due within thirty days and if reimbursement were not made,smith authorized gm to make appropriate deductions from any future compensation or insurance benefits thereafter payable to him to accomplish repayment.
smith was thereafter approved for ssdib and received a ssdib award covering the period of february,through december.gm requested repayment of plan benefits overpaid by virtue of the retroactive award smith did not repay gm,and claimed,as northcutt had,that the retroactive award had been dissipated by the time that gm made its demand.gm also began to recoup the overpayment by suspending prospectively smith benefits.
on february,northcutt and smith brought this action under a b of erisa in the united states district court for the southern district of indiana.they sued the defendants gm,the gm disability plan and the gm employees pension plan,on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated gm plan beneficiaries.northcutt and smith alleged that gm contractually based reimbursement provisions contravened the statutory structure and policies of erisa,and sought recovery of benefits due to them under the plan 
the plaintiffs and gm filed for summary judgment.in ruling on the motions,the district court found no material facts in dispute and consequently addressed the interpretation of erisa.the plaintiffs contended that of erisa,establishes a single,comprehensive remedial scheme by which the plans may recover earlier payments to beneficiaries.they further submitted that,under the supreme court decision in life annuity insurance knudson,d,provides the only mechanism through which entities may obtain reimbursement from plan participants for violations of plan provisions.more specifically,in the plaintiffs view,because speaks exclusively to civil actions,plan fiduciaries are limited to seeking reimbursement through a civil action authorized by that statute terms.additionally,they maintained that limited remedies for fiduciaries,who are covered by the limitations of a,to those traditionally available at equity.accordingly,the plaintiffs contended that gm contractual reimbursement mechanism,providing for recoupment of unreimbursed overpayments by withholding of future benefit payments,evades the remedial restrictions of a it is the equivalent to obtaining the legal relief not permitted under.in short,under the plaintiffs view,gm action in reducing their benefits is a remedy not specifically authorized by the statute,and therefore must give way to the exclusive relief provisions contained in.
the district court did not accept the plaintiffs view of,as interpreted by.the court held that does not foreclose enforcement of the recoupment provisions of the plan.accordingly,it granted summary judgment to gm.
in reaching its decision,the court examined at length the decision of the supreme court in and concluded that
