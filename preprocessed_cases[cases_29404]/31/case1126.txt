introduction 
for more than thirty years,norma owens norma and phillip owens,phillip maintained a relationship in the state of washington.in,norma and phillip separated.on august,the superior court of king county,washington,issued a state court order order awarding norma a interest in the pension benefits being paid to phillip by automotive machinist pension trust automotive trust or trust.
automotive trust declined to implement the order on the ground that it was not a valid qualified domestic relations order qdro under of the employee retirement income security act erisa,d.specifically,the trust argued that the order did not relate to marital property rights pursuant to d b ii i and that norma was not an alternate payee under d k because she did not qualify as an other dependent.
we agree with the washington federal district court that,because norma and phillip lived together in a relationship for more than thirty years,the superior court order does in fact relate to marital property rights,that norma is an alternate payee under d b i i,and that the superior court order therefore qualifies as a valid qualified domestic relations order.we therefore affirm the federal district court denial of automotive trust motion for reconsideration.
background 
the important facts are not in dispute.for more than thirty years,norma owens and phillip owens lived together as husband and wife in a relationship in king county,washington.although norma and phillip were never legally married,they had and raised two boys together,purchased a home together,and held themselves out to their friends and to the public as a married couple.during their relationship,norma and phillip also acquired numerous joint assets including real property,furniture,furnishings,and vehicles.the owens jointly acquired funds were held in various financial institutions,and some of these funds were held in joint bank accounts.additionally,during their relationship,phillip,because of his employment,acquired interest in various retirement accounts.
norma formal education ended after the ninth grade.financially,norma contributed little or nothing to the household.instead,phillip provided the main financial support for the family.except for brief periods during which she worked for minimum wages,norma,a homemaker,devoted her time to caring for her husband and raising their two sons.phillip and norma filed joint tax returns.the tax returns for,and list norma as phillip wife.norma was also named as phillip wife and beneficiary in phillip life insurance application.though they were not legally married,norma and phillip lived together for more than thirty years in a relationship as husband and wife.
in march,norma and phillip separated.only two major assets of theirs remained the house in seattle that they had purchased together and phillip erisa pension plan with automotive trust.proceeds from the sale of the house were used to pay off the owens delinquent mortgage payments and other debts.the only significant remaining asset was phillip erisa pension plan with automotive trust.that erisa pension plan is the subject of this litigation.
in january,phillip submitted his claim for early retirement benefits to automotive trust.phillip claim became effective on february,and resulted in phillip retirement benefit being paid to him as a single life annuity phillip currently receives gross monthly pension benefit payments from automotive trust in the amount of the payments will continue for his lifetime.
on august,shortly after the owens separated,norma filed a petition for equitable distribution of property acquired during a meretricious relationship in the superior court for king county,washington.in the petition,norma claimed that she was entitled to fifty percent of each of phillip monthly pension benefit payments.on may,the parties participated in an arbitration hearing.automotive trust was not a party to that action.on june,an arbitration award was issued in favor of norma.
pursuant to the arbitration award,on august,the superior court issued an order assigning norma fifty percent of each of phillip monthly benefit payments from automotive trust plan based on norma relationship to phillip.the superior court considered the pension benefits that phillip accrued under the trust as part of the overall equitable distribution of property acquired during the couple relationship.because the order related to marital property rights,and because it named norma as an alternate payee,the superior court titled the order a qualified domestic relations order.
on october,automotive trust notified norma attorney that the superior court order did not,in fact,qualify as a qualified domestic relations order under d of erisa.despite the superior court findings,automotive trust refused to pay norma her share of the pension benefits.in a letter to norma attorney,harry reichenberg,automotive trust stated 
it is automotive trust understanding that norma and phillip were never married.therefore,it would not appear that the superior court august,order relates to the provision of child support,alimony payments,or marital property rights,and it would not be qualified as required by erisa d and internal revenue code d h.
in a response letter dated february,norma attorney asked automotive trust to its position on the ground that the superior court order was a valid qdro.specifically,norma asserted that the order related to marital property rights because norma and phillip lived together for more than thirty years in a relationship washington state law permitted such an equitable distribution of property following the termination of a relationship and norma satisfied the alternate payee requirement because she qualified as an other dependent under d h.on march,automotive trust replied to norma attorney and reaffirmed its original position that the order did not constitute a valid qdro because it did not meet the relevant erisa requirements.norma filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the western district of washington district court.
on october,automotive trust filed a motion for summary judgment.on november,norma filed a cross motion for summary judgment.on january,the district court,honorable thomas zilly,presiding,denied the trust motion and granted norma crossmotion for summary judgment.the district court held that the superior court order was a valid domestic relations order because it related to marital property rights and was a valid qdro because it recognized the existence of an alternate payee.on january,automotive trust filed a motion for reconsideration and amendment of judgment,which the district court denied on march.on march,automotive trust timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
the question before us is this did the district court correctly hold that the state superior court order qualified as a qdro pursuant to d that is,did the order relate to marital property rights pursuant to d b ii i and did norma qualify as an alternate payee pursuant to d k 
ii.discussion 
a.the parties contentions 
automotive trust contends that a relationship does not,under any circumstance,create marital property rights,that norma does not qualify as an other dependent,and that norma is therefore not an alternate payee under erisa.according to the trust,therefore,the superior court order is not a valid qdro and norma is not entitled to receive a portion of phillip erisa pension benefits.norma,on the other hand,maintains that the order did relate to marital property rights,and that she qualifies as an other dependent under d h and,therefore,as an alternate payee under d b i i.according to norma,the superior court order is a valid qdro.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court review of a plan administrator conclusions regarding legal obligations under a qdro.hamilton washington state plumbing pipefitting indus.pension plan,cir.whether a domestic relations order meets the statutory requirements for a valid qdro,and therefore is enforceable against a pension plan,is a question determined in the first instance by the pension plan administrator and,if necessary,by a court of competent jurisdiction.see tr.of dir.of guild of america producer pension benefits plan tise,cir see also d h i.
section d of erisa,d,generally prohibits the assignment of pension benefits.but d,d,contains an important exception to the general rule pension benefits may be assigned pursuant to a domestic relations order that qualifies as a qualified domestic relations order under d b i.
erisa enumerates the requirements for a valid qdro.a qualified domestic relations order is a domestic relations order which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee right to receive benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan d b i i p a.the term domestic relations order refers to any judgment or order which relates to the provision of child support,alimony payments,or marital property rights to a spouse,former spouse,child,or other dependent of a participant and is issued pursuant to a s tate domestic relations law.d b ii i p b.a dependent is defined as an individual other than the spouse who,for the taxable year of the taxpayer,has the same principal place of abode as the taxpayer and is a member of the taxpayer household.d h,amended by,stat.
therefore,for the king county superior court order to be a valid qdro,the order must recognize the right of an alternate payee to receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under the plan,hamilton,at quoting d b i i internal quotation marks omitted,and it must relate to marital property rights.
erisa requires pension plans like automotive trust to pay benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qdro.d a.the statute also entrusts pension plans with the authority to determine,pursuant to reasonable procedures,the validity of a qdro.id.d g ii 
automotive trust is a collectively bargained multiemployer pension plan plan that is governed by title of erisa.article viii,section of the plan provides that the trust will pay benefits in accordance with any qualified domestic relations order,and that such benefits are not otherwise assignable.importantly,section b of the plan limits the plan administrator discretion.where necessary,the trust determination of whether a qdro is valid is reviewable by a federal court to determine,inter alia,whether,in the particular instance the trustees were in error upon an issue of law.
district judge thomas zilly concluded that the order issued by the superior court of king county awarding norma a interest in phillip pension benefits constituted a valid qdro because the order relates to marital property rights under d b ii i and norma qualifies as a dependent of phillip,and therefore as an alternate payee,under d b i i.for the reasons stated below,we agree.
marital property rights 
automotive trust contends that the superior court order does not constitute a valid qdro because it does not relate to marital property rights within the meaning of erisa d b ii i.the trust bases its argument on the fact that norma and phillip were never legally married,despite the facts that the couple lived together in a relationship for more than thirty years that they had and raised two children together that they owned and maintained joint property together and that they held themselves out to the public as a married couple.
norma disagrees.she states that the order does relate to marital property rights because she and phillip lived together in a relationship for more than thirty years.to support her argument,norma relies on washington state domestic relations law,under which unmarried couples in relationships are deemed to jointly own all property acquired during the relationship.connell francisco.according to norma,the superior court order was a valid qdro under which she was properly awarded a interest in phillip pension benefits.
in family law cases,state courts are authorized to create enforceable interests in the proceeds of an erisa plan,so long as those interests comply with the qdro provision s.tise,at.the first requirement for a valid qdro is that it relate to marital property rights as contemplated by erisa.d b ii i.in hamilton washington state plumbing,we enumerated the method for interpreting erisa statutory provisions 
when interpreting erisa,our task is to construe what congress has enacted.we begin,as always,with the language of the statute.when looking to the plain language of a statute,we do more than view words or subsections in isolation.we derive meaning from context,and this requires reading the relevant statutory provisions as a whole.
hamilton,at internal citations and quotations omitted.
looking to the language of the statute,erisa does not explicitly define the term marital property rights.therefore,as hamilton instructs,we must look to the statute as a whole and derive meaning from context.id.
but automotive trust urges us to rely on another federal law the defense of marriage act,doma.according to the trust,doma precludes any relationship from resulting in marital property rights because,the trust argues,doma defines the word marriage as only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife id.on that basis,the trust contends that a federal definition for marital property rights albeit outside the statutory framework of exist one that precludes any relationship from resulting in marital property rights.
we reject the trust argument for two reasons.first,doma is not applicable here.doma legislative history reflects only congress concern for marriages it sheds no light on relationships such as the relationship between phillip and norma that is at issue here.second,as the district court underscored,washington explicitly recognizes relationships for purposes of determining property rights after an extended putative marriage.we agree with the district court that the defense of marriage act 
is not dispositive with regard to norma entitlement to benefits under the automotive trust plan.the definitions provided by doma do not address whether a domestic relations order following a relationship is a qdro under erisa,or whether property rights under washington state law fall within marital property rights as the term is used in erisa.
having determined that erisa does not explicitly define marital property rights,and that no federal definition exists for the term,hamilton directs us to derive meaning from context and read the relevant statutory provisions as a whole when interpreting erisa.at.reading erisa as a whole,section d b ii ii requires that a qualified domestic relations order be made pursuant to a s tate domestic relations law including a community property law.d b ii ii.on that basis,we turn to washington state domestic relations law to determine the meaning of the term marital property rights.
the state of washington recognizes relationships for purposes of property division.wholly unrelated to either kind of marriage,washington courts have recognized the existence of relationships,which this court has determined to be stable,cohabiting relationships.in re marriage of pennington.norma and phillip enjoyed just such a stable,relationship,where both parties cohabit ed with the knowledge that a lawful marriage between them did not exist.connell,at.in connell,the court concluded that washington state limit s the distribution of property following a relationship to property that would have been characterized as community property had the parties been married.id.at.
norma and phillip lived together in a relationship for more than thirty years.during that time,they jointly accumulated various forms of community property.in addition to purchasing a home together,the owens obtained numerous joint assets including real property,furniture,furnishings,and vehicles.the couple community property also included jointly acquired funds,some of which were held in joint bank accounts,as well as the interest that phillip acquired in various retirement accounts,including the automotive trust pension plan at issue here.
as the district court stated,connell is instructive on the question of property division pursuant to state community property laws,and on the limits of a relationship under washington law
