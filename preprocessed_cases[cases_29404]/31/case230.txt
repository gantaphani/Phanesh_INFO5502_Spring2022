mikael salovaara appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,granting summary judgment to state street bank and trust state street and entering a declaratory judgment that salovaara is not entitled to look to an investment fund he founded for indemnification of legal expenses incurred while pursuing six lawsuits ostensibly connected with that fund.salovaara also appeals the district court decision to award attorneys fees to state street.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
i.the formation of the fund 
salovaara is a former partner in a major investment bank and an operator and manager of private investment funds.he has a special expertise in distressed securities funds,which are investment funds that buy the stock or bonds of companies in financial trouble with the expectation that the companies performance will rebound,thereby increasing the value of their securities.
in,salovaara and his former investment banking partner,alfred eckert iii,formed an investment fund called the south street corporate recovery fund,south street or the fund,along with several other funds the other funds,to invest in distressed securities.the fund raised most of its capital from large institutional investors because more than of the capital it raised was from pension plans,the fund was subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa.see.
south street is organized in a structure.the bottom level is the fund itself,organized as a limited partnership under delaware law.the fund investors participate as limited partners within south street.the general partner within south street is ssp advisors,a in this case and itself a delaware partnership.ssp advisors in turn has as its general partner an entity known as ssp,ssp,also a in this case.ssp possesses all management authority for the fund,and is owned by salovaara and eckert.salovaara and eckert also established another entity known as greycliff partners greycliff,which served as the exclusive investment advisor for south street and the other funds.the terms of south street structure and rules are set forth in the agreement of limited partnership,executed june,the agreement.section of the agreement contains a clause broadly indemnifying the general partner ssp advisors and any affiliate or agent of the general partner for any and all expenses arising from the operation of the fund,including legal expenses.see agreement a,at.unlike the typical indemnification agreement,the indemnification clause in the south street agreement can be read to indemnify salovaara,not only for defensive legal fees,but also for the costs of bringing affirmative lawsuits related to the operation of the fund.moreover,because the indemnification shall be paid from the assets of the partnership,agreement e,at,salovaara reimbursement for any lawsuits that he might chose to initiate would be paid directly from the assets of the erisa pension plan investors.
the investors in south street include eight mutual fund companies,four trust funds,three insurance companies,two individuals,a foundation,and a college.all but two made initial investments of at least million,and the average investment was approximately million.the total initial capital came to million.the leading investor was the private market group trust dupont,a trust representing two erisa retirement funds.dupont invested million,more than four times as much as the next largest investor.state street bank and trust company state street,trustee for dupont,acts on the trust behalf in this action.
in,eckert became sole director and assumed day to day managerial control over ssp.salovaara and eckert subsequently had a because eckert began to participate in an unrelated fund formed by greenwich street capital partners,greenwich street,while still maintaining control over south street.meanwhile,in,a committee representing south street investors decided to liquidate the fund holdings.this concomitant dispute with eckert and fund liquidation precipitated a series of lawsuits that underpins the current appeal.
ii.the underlying litigation 
over the years between and the present,salovaara has been involved in seven lawsuits related in some way to south street and relevant to this appeal.we describe each in turn.
salovaara eckert.salovaara i 
salovaara eckert,salovaara i was filed in february.the complaint charged that eckert work with greenwich street was a conflict of interest that breached the duties he owed to greycliff.salovaara sought a preliminary injunction to prevent eckert from managing greenwich street,which the court denied.eckert asserted alleging that salovaara mismanaged funds controlled by greycliff and sought greycliff dissolution.after a bench trial,the court found in july for salovaara,awarding him million in damages and the right to direct greycliff dissolution.
salovaara eckert salovaara ii 
salovaara eckert.salovaara ii was filed in may of against eckert,greenwich street,and various affiliates.the complaint alleged violations of erisa and common law duties based on various investments made by south street.salovaara sought damages and equitable relief for himself and for south street.in january,the district court wood,granted salovaara motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered eckert either to resign from greenwich street,resign from south street,or arrange for an independent manager for investments that presented a conflict.eckert chose the last option.
in may,the court dissolved the injunction,granted eckert motion for summary judgment on the erisa claims,and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the claims.salovaara eckert,wl may.the court held that salovaara had failed to establish any loss to south street from eckert actions.id.at.this court summarily affirmed.salovaara eckert,cir table.
eckert moved for sanctions and attorneys fees,and salovaara for attorneys fees.the district court denied salovaara,stating that salovaara had never showed that there was any benefit conferred upon anyone other than himself by the court decision to grant a preliminary injunction.salovaara eckert,wl,at may.the court also awarded fees to eckert and imposed sanctions on salovaara and his counsel.id.at.this court affirmed the denial of fees to salovaara,but reversed the fee award to eckert and vacated the sanctions.salovaara eckert,cir.
greycliff partners ssp.greycliff 
in may,salovaara filed greycliff partners ssp,greycliff.he sued ssp,ssp advisors,and ssp partners,on behalf of greycliff of which he was still a owner,alleging that the ssp entities had not paid greycliff approximately in fees owed pursuant to the advisory agreement between the parties.the ssp entities counterclaimed,arguing that salovaara had breached his fiduciary duties to south street.on july,the court found for greycliff after a bench trial,awarded it the money sought,and denied the counterclaims.
salovaara hindes hindes 
in may of salovaara sued gary and denise hindes in the southern district of new york.salovaara hindes.salovaara alleged that the hindeses,who were officers and directors of ssp,breached their fiduciary duty to the fund by authorizing the sale of certain securities at an unreasonably low price.although the complaint was styled as a derivative erisa action,the only relief sought was damages for salovaara.salovaara,in his brief in opposition to a summary judgment motion,later dropped the personal claims.on march,the district court hellerstein,granted the hindeses motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint in an oral decision.this court summarily affirmed.cir table.

salovaara then sued jackson national life insurance,the party that had bought the securities in dispute in hindes,in federal court in new jersey.salovaara jackson life ins,d jackson life.the complaint was again styled as a derivative action brought on behalf of the fund and various ssp entities.the district court hughes,granted defendants motion for summary judgment on july.jackson ins,d,aff cir.the court found that salovaara was not an adequate representative of the funds and partnerships on whose behalf he sought to act,because he was actually antagonistic to south street interests due to the numerous pending cases against south street officers and directors.d at.
salovaara eckert.salovaara iii 
in february,salovaara sued eckert again in new jersey superior court,this time alleging that eckert attempted to condition the payout of certain funds to salovaara on salovaara signing various agreements that would modify the previous contractual arrangements.that case is still pending.
state street bank salovaara,de chancery the delaware action 
in july and august of,salovaara wrote to eckert demanding that the fund reimburse him for his legal expenses in the six lawsuits,pursuant to the indemnification clause.in response,south street filed an action in delaware chancery court seeking a declaration that salovaara was not entitled to indemnification under the agreement and under delaware partnership law state street bank moved to intervene on behalf of the erisa investors in february,seeking to assert that using any of the erisa funds to reimburse salovaara would violate the act.the delaware court denied the motion to intervene on july.the delaware plaintiffs then sought to dismiss the complaint without prejudice,because they wished to litigate only the erisa issue.salovaara to dismiss with prejudice.after judge hellerstein ruling in the instant case,the delaware court entered a judgment and order that declared that the plaintiffs had a contractual obligation to indemnify salovaara,but ordered that none of the funds used for any potential indemnification for the six underlying lawsuits could come from any of the fund assets.
iii.procedural history 
state street bank brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,on behalf of the erisa investors in september.it sought a declaration that use of state street assets to indemnify salovaara would violate erisa,and that the use of any of state street assets to reimburse ssp advisors for payments it made to eckert in relation to salovaara i would violate erisa.state street also sought attorneys fees and costs.state street moved for summary judgment in march of,and the district court granted the motion in an oral decision on april.in its decision,the court considered each of the six salovaara litigations and concluded in each case that the action had not been brought for the benefit of south street.it furthered ruled that erisa prohibited the transfer of fund assets to reimburse salovaara.state street then moved for attorneys fees,and on august,in a second oral decision,the district court awarded state street,approximately half the fees it sought.this appeal followed.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.opals on ice lingerie body lines,cir.under federal rule of civil procedure c,summary judgment may be granted only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see celotex catrett,d.while genuineness runs to whether disputed factual issues can reasonably be resolved in favor of either party,materiality runs to whether the dispute matters,whether it concerns facts that can affect the outcome under the applicable substantive law a reasonably disputed,legally essential issue is both genuine and material and must be resolved at trial.graham henderson,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby,d internal citation omitted.
discussion 
this appeal presents four issues in the circumstances of this case,whether erisa permits the use of fund assets to indemnify a fund manager for ostensibly litigation that the manager chose to initiate given the statutory restrictions,whether each of the lawsuits at issue qualify for indemnification whether the district court was correct that erisa further bars any remedy that would tax the fund for the pro rata share of the investors assets and whether the district court erred in awarding attorneys fees to state street.we consider each issue in turn.
erisa requirements 
a.the statutory scheme 
as this court has recently observed,erisa was enacted in order to protect employee pension and retirement plans.harris trust sav.bank john hancock mut.life ins,cir citing,at,reprinted in.one way the act pursues this purpose is by imposing certain general fiduciary duties applicable to the management of plans.varity howe,d.at oral argument,salovaara declined to concede that he was a fiduciary with respect to the plan.it is clear to us,however,that he is during all relevant times he was a of ssp,which is indisputably a fiduciary pursuant to erisa.furthermore,he represented himself as an erisa fiduciary in his complaints in salovaara ii,and hindes,two of the very court proceedings at issue in this appeal.finally,and most importantly,salovaara alleges that he is entitled to reimbursement from the assets of the partnership for the costs associated with independently bringing the six underlying lawsuits.thus,under his own interpretation of the south street partnership agreement,salovaara effectively exercised discretionary control over the disposition of erisa plan assets,so as to trigger erisa fiduciary duty requirements.
section a of the act contains a clause that imposes a general standard of duty on all fiduciaries 
a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and 
a for the exclusive purpose of 
i providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries.
a a i.this statutory duty of loyalty has been described by this court as requiring that a fiduciary act,in judge friendly felicitous phrase,with an eye single to the interests of the participants and beneficiaries.donovan bierwirth,cir.this requirement has also been described as the exclusive benefit rule.new england health care employees union,dist.mount sinai,cir.
erisa further seeks to safeguard the interests of fund recipients by imposing strict regulations on the ability of parties in interest with respect to a fund to transfer moneys from the fund to themselves or to third parties.the basic rule is set forth in erisa section 
a except as set forth in erisa section of this title 
a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not cause the plan to engage in any transaction,if he knows or should know such transaction constitutes a direct or indirect 
d transfer to,or use by or for the benefit of,a party in interest,of any assets of the plan.
section thus acts as a blanket ban,exempting only the specified transactions that are enumerated in section.section provides,in relevant part 
b enumeration of transactions exempted from section erisa prohibitions 
the prohibitions provided in section of this title shall not apply to any of the following transactions 
contracting or making reasonable arrangements with a party in interest for office space,or legal,or accounting,or other services necessary for the establishment or operation of the plan,if no more than reasonable compensation is paid therefor.
c fiduciary benefits and compensation not prohibited by section erisa 
nothing in section of this title shall be construed to prohibit any fiduciary from 
receiving any reasonable compensation for services rendered or for the reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred,in the performance of his duties with the plan 
b c emphasis added.
indemnification and erisa 
we believe that the indemnification of a fiduciary by a plan is clearly permitted by erisa pursuant to the plain language of section c nothing in section of this title shall be construed to prohibit any fiduciary from receiving any reasonable compensation for the reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred,in the performance of his duties with the plan the reimbursement envisioned by section c is not unlimited,however.where a party seeks reimbursement not only for defensive legal costs,but also for the legal costs of initiating lawsuits,erisa restricts such reimbursement to expenses that are properly incurred,in the performance of the fiduciary duties with the plan.where an inde
