opinion of the court 
retired employee melvyn pell and his wife,ellen pell collectively,pell initiated this litigation against dupont de nemours and and its board of benefits and pensions collectively,dupont under the employee retirement income security act erisa.pell claimed that his pension benefit is lower than dupont had led him to expect.after a bench trial,the district court enjoined dupont to use a credited service date of august,when calculating pell future benefits,resulting in a higher monthly pension benefit.the parties cross appealed.
for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court ruling that pell is entitled to relief under erisa.we will reverse the district court ruling that pell is not entitled to restitution for his past unduly low pension payments.additionally,we will reverse the district court injunction insofar as it requires dupont to calculate pell benefit using the august,service date,because we conclude that dupont must use a service date of february.
background 
on february,consol,a subsidiary of conoco,hired chemical engineer melvyn pell to work at its facility in pittsburgh,pennsylvania.according to the terms of the consol pension plan,pell was not eligible to participate in the consol plan until the first day of the month following his thirtieth birthday.pell turned thirty in july,and thus his pension benefit calculation date was august.in,conoco and consol merged with dupont.in,pell accepted a temporary position with dupont in wilmington,delaware.under the temporary assignment,pell remained a consol employee and continued to receive his salary and benefits from consol.
in,dupont,consol,and conoco jointly created a policy covering the transfer of employees between the companies.the transfer guidelines were not meant for general distribution,since relatively few employees transferred between the companies.all three companies followed the guidelines when effecting permanent employee transfers.the guidelines explained how pensions would be calculated for transferred employees 
continuity of service 
dupont will recognize a transferred employee service to the same extent recognized it at the transfer date this service will be used for benefit eligibility,vesting,and pension computation consol service for dupont pension calculation purposes will be recognized only from forward although all service recognized by consol will be used to determine pension and other plan eligibility.
the transfer guidelines also contained a provision stating that when dupont received a transferred employee,would furnish a letter to the transferred employee indicating the employee years of service,adjusted service date,beneficiary designations,creditable service,and eligibility for and participation in benefit plans.a sample of this letter contained in the guidelines stated that the company receiving the transferred employee will recognize the employee service to the same extent that the sending company recognized it at the time of transfer.this service will be used for eligibility,vesting and benefit computation in the receiving company benefit plans.
in late,pell dupont manager asked pell to permanently transfer from consol to dupont.pell was concerned that his salary would decrease upon transferring to dupont but believed that dupont more generous pension plan would offset the lower salary.pell principal concern about his prospective dupont pension was whether he would be credited for his time employed with consol.pell dupont manager and supervisor both assured him that his consol service time would be counted under the dupont pension plan.
while pell was considering whether to permanently transfer to dupont,he received a letter from william waddell,the director of employee compensation and benefits at consol the waddell letter.that letter,dated january,closely followed the transfer guidelines.it listed pell retirement plan credited service date as august,which was the same date that consol recognized as the start date under the consol plan.waddell letter further stated 
retirement plan your transfer will not be considered a termination of employment for retirement purposes.both creditable service and earnings used in calculating your benefit under consol retirement plan will be frozen effective with your date of transfer to dupont.service with dupont will be deemed membership service within the terms of the consol plan and counts only for vesting purposes.compensation earned during your employment with dupont will be used in determining your final average compensation for benefit purposes under the dupont plan.the pension you receive will be calculated under the dupont plan based on your total combined service.this retirement benefit will be offset by any payment you receive from the consol plan as a result of your accrued benefit as of the date of transfer.
after receiving these oral and written assurances about his pension benefit,pell accepted the permanent transfer to dupont with a retroactive transfer date of january.
in,pell received a document from dupont indicating that his adjusted service date was.pell was concerned and contacted doris uhde,a counselor for dupont,who assured him via email that his adjusted service date was,not and dupont would use this date for pell years of service under their formula when calculating his pension.
in,pell requested from dupont two estimates of his pension benefits,and each of these estimates listed february,as his adjusted service date.in,pell requested another pension estimate,and this estimate also stated that his adjusted service date was february.in,pell received a benefit resources statement from dupont indicating that he had years of service as of august,which was consistent with an adjusted service date of february.each estimate contained text at the bottom of the page indicating that it was an estimate subject to review and individual adjustments.
in august,pell inquired what his pension benefits would be if he retired on december.on december,dupont informed pell that it was changing his adjusted service date to august,thus reducing his recognized service by years.pell requested a reconsideration of his adjusted service date,and dupont benefit administration department provided him with a final pension estimate via email on december.
according to the final estimate,pell would receive a pension benefit for his consol employment that would be exactly the same as if consol had calculated and paid it,and a pension benefit for his dupont employment based on his service from november,until retirement,partially offset by the payments under the consol plan.the email to pell from the benefit administration department also noted 
all of your previous documentation does use adjusted service date asd equal to.however,asd is not a pension is used for many business specific uses such as vacation entitlement,service awards.the asd is also used to determine vesting and eligibility service under the plans,but may need to be adjusted to reflect pension benefit accrual service,and in your case it is t he estimate provided to you about eight years ago was in error.
upon receiving his final pension estimate,pell responded that he may not be able to retire as scheduled.
pell appealed his pension estimate to the dupont board of benefits and pensions,which upheld the determination.he retired on may.
in,pell filed a complaint against dupont in the district court for the district of delaware.he requested an injunction ordering dupont to pay the higher pension amount.after a bench trial,the district court ruled that pell was entitled to relief under erisa based on the theory of equitable estoppel.the court further determined that under a of erisa codified at a,pell was not entitled to restitution for the past pension payments that had been too low.the court issued an injunction requiring dupont to use august,as the service date for calculating pell future pension benefits.dupont filed a timely notice of appeal and pell filed a timely notice of cross appeal.
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction under and erisa,et.we have jurisdiction under.
erisa provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary a.a participant is any employee or former employee who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.dupont argues that the actions or omissions forming the basis of pell claim took place in and before he was employed by dupont.because pell was neither a participant in nor a beneficiary of dupont plan at that time,dupont asserts that he does not have standing under erisa civil enforcement provision.
dupont argument does not take into account pell retroactive dupont employment date.the waddell letter,dated january,misled pell about the amount of his pension benefits.pell accepted employment with dupont after january,with a retroactive effective date of january.using pell retroactive employment start date,he received the waddell letter during his time as an employee of dupont who may become eligible to receive a benefit.therefore,he has standing to sue under erisa.
in addition,the district court determined that pell reasonably and detrimentally relied on the informational statements estimating his pension benefits and showing february,as his service date.these estimates indisputably occurred while pell was a dupont employee in,and.therefore,the addition to the waddell standing upon pell.
equitable estoppel under erisa 
the district court correctly concluded that pell is entitled to relief under erisa based on an equitable estoppel theory.on appeal from a judgment entered after a trial,we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.hooven exxon mobil,cir internal citations omitted.
a beneficiary may obtain appropriate equitable relief to redress erisa violations or to enforce any provisions of erisa.a.a beneficiary can make out a claim for appropriate equitable relief,based on a theory of equitable estoppel.curcio john hancock mut.life ins,cir.to succeed under this theory of relief,an erisa plaintiff must establish a material representation,reasonable and detrimental reliance upon the representation,and extraordinary circumstances.id.
material misrepresentation 
a ny provision of a plan subject to erisa that establishes a benefit is a material term of the plan.id.at.a misrepresentation is material if there is a substantial likelihood that it would mislead a reasonable employee in making an adequately informed decision about if and when to retire.fischer phila,cir.
the district court correctly determined that,under our case law,dupont representations about pell pension benefit calculation date were material.pell dupont de nemours,wl,at.when evaluating whether he can afford to retire,a reasonable employee would consider the amount of his pension,which in pell case depended on his pension benefit calculation date.
previously,we have concluded that representations were material where they led an employee to wrongly believe that accidental death and dismemberment insurance was available.curcio,at.we have also determined that representations could be material where an employer stated that no early retirement incentives were on the horizon,when in fact management was considering such a program.fischer,at.as in curcio and fischer,dupont representations to pell about his pension benefit calculation date misled pell as he attempted to make an adequately informed decision about his benefits.
dupont argues that its misrepresentations about pell pension calculations were not material because pell discovered the errors before making his final retirement decisions.this argument is unpersuasive.the test for materiality does not depend on when an employee discovers the misrepresentations.the test is whether the information would mislead a reasonable employee in making an adequately informed decision about retirement.id.in this case,it is clear that the about the amount of a pension mislead a reasonable employee.the misleading nature of the information was demonstrated by the fact that pell changed his retirement plans,retiring on may,rather than december.that pell discovered the error while he still had time to alter his plans does not change the fact that dupont statements were material.
reasonable and detrimental reliance 
as the phrase reasonable and detrimental reliance implies,in order to prevail,pell must show reasonableness and injury.curcio,at.the district court correctly concluded that pell reasonably and detrimentally relied on the waddell letter and the pension estimates he received throughout the.
a reasonable reliance 
we have determined that when an individual acts with apparent authority to determine an employee status in relationship to a benefit plan,the plan fiduciary can be responsible for the individual material misstatements.taylor peoples natural gas,cir.in taylor,a former employee claimed that the supervisor of employee benefits led him to believe that an early retirement incentive plan would apply to him retroactively.id.at.when deciding whether the employee had reasonably relied on the supervisor statements,we invoked the doctrine of apparent authority,which results from a manifestation by a person that another is his agent and exists only to the extent that it is reasonable for the third person dealing with the agent to believe that the agent is authorized.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the supervisor in taylor had apparent authority because he had actual authority to perform ministerial functions such as advising employees of their rights and preparing reports,and the plan participants reasonably believed that the supervisor specifically had the authority to counsel plan participants about possible amendments to the plan.id.therefore,under erisa,the plan fiduciary was responsible for the supervisor material misstatements.id.
dupont argues that pell reliance on the letter from william waddell,consol director of employee compensation and benefits,was unreasonable because waddell had no authority to speak for dupont.the district court correctly determined,however,that as in taylor,waddell acted with apparent authority.the transfer guidelines were a manifestation by dupont that waddell was its agent.the guidelines stated that when an employee transferred from consol to dupont,consol would provide a letter to the employee and to dupont describing in detail the employee status with regard to both consol and dupont benefit plans.waddell,therefore,acted as dupont agent when he wrote the letter to pell.
it was reasonable for pell to believe that waddell was authorized to speak on dupont behalf.as the district court stated 
pell received the letter from waddell,the director of employee compensation and benefits of his employer consol,which was owned and controlled by dupont waddell was an appropriate person to promulgate that information the letter indicated on its face that it had been copied to dupont management,including the division head of personnel and employee relation s,and herron a supervisor in the employee compensation benefits division testified that he believed that he received the letter in the ordinary course of his position.it was reasonable for pell to understand that waddell was communicating on behalf of all the subparts of dupont corporate structure the information that dupont intended for him to act upon in deciding whether to accept a transfer.
pell,wl at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in sum,the district court correctly concluded,based on the elements of the taylor apparent authority test,that pell reasonably relied on the waddell letter.taylor,at.
the district court found that it was also reasonable for pell to rely on the pension estimates he received during the.pell,wl at.dupont asserts that because each estimate contained a disclaimer clearly labeling the calculation as an estimate that was subject to review and correction,pell could not have reasonably relied on the estimates.dupont argument fails because it does not take into account pell email exchange with doris uhde,a dupont counselor.in that exchange,pell inquired what date would be used for his pension calculation,and uhde replied 
consol pension will be calculated on their formula and their ss offset.your adjusted service date is not and du pont will use this date for your years of service under their formula when calculating your pension.the pension booklet in your green benefits binder explains the du pont formulas however,nothing written re offsets as each would be different.
after this exchange,pell subsequent pension estimates in,and listed as the date from which his benefit would be calculated.
for the same reasons that it was reasonable for pell to rely on the waddell letter,it was reasonable for him to rely on uhde apparent authority to act on dupont behalf.by giving uhde responsibility for assisting dupont employees with their retirement planning,dupont manifested that she was its agent.see taylor,at.it was reasonable for pell to believe that uhde had the authority to determine his adjusted service date.id.moreover,it was reasonable for pell to believe,going forward,that his conversation with uhde had set the record straight.having clarified his adjusted service date or so he thought,pell reasonably believed that his employment records had been corrected and that his pension benefit would be calculated based on the date.
if we were to accept dupont argument that pell could not rely on his pension estimates,employees such as pell would be required to continually question their benefits calculations,even if they agreed with their employers estimates.we decline to formulate such a burdensome rule.in the context of pell exchange with uhde and his subsequent pension estimates that reflected a adjusted service date,it was reasonable for him to rely on the estimates,despite their disclaimer language.
b detrimental reliance 
in order to show detriment,or injury,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he relied upon the employer representations in a way that later led to injury.curcio,at.pell detrimentally relied on the waddell letter when he decided to transfer permanently from consol to dupont.he did not finalize the transfer until after he had received the letter confirmation of his pension benefit calculation date.pell was injured because he accepted a lower salary and he permanently moved his family to delaware,despite concerns about the cost of living and the quality of his children schools.
dupont argues that pell did not detrimentally rely on the pension estimates,because he did not take any actions based on the information they contained.however,our case law recognizes that refraining from taking action can constitute detrimental reliance.
in curcio,we said that the plaintiffs detrimental reliance was giving up an opportunity to accommodate their insurance needs through an independent insurance carrier.at.in smith hartford insurance group,cir,we concluded that there was detrimental reliance,even though the reliance could be expressed as a failure to act not converting to an individual health care policy that would have provided adequate coverage or an action signing up for a new group health care plan that provided inadequate coverage.dupont argument does not convince us to draw a new distinction between active and inactive detrimental reliance.
pell relied to his detriment on the pension estimates he received in the by refraining from taking certain actions.pell testified that if he had known how his pension would be calculated,he would have explored whether he could return to consol,get another job with a better pension,or retire sooner and start a consulting business.he was injured because he did not take any of these actions that might have benefitted him 
pell has shown that the second element of equitable and detrimental present in this case.as the district court concluded,pell demonstrated that his reliance on the waddell letter and the pension estimates was reasonable and caused him injury.see curcio,at.
extraordinary circumstances 
the district court determined that pell met the third element of the equitable estoppel theory,concluding that the circumstances of his case are extraordinary and thus warrant relief under.dupont claims that the district court erred,because a finding of extraordinary circumstances usually results from the employer acts of bad faith and not from mere reporting errors.
in the past,we have determined that extraordinary circumstances existed in a variety of factual scenarios.kurz phila.kurz ii,cir collecting cases.extraordinary circumstances can arise where there are affirmative acts of fraud,where there is a network of misrepresentations over an extended course of dealing,or where particular plaintiffs are especially vulnerable.id.
in this case,the district court ruled in pell favor because of dupont repeated misrepresentations over an extended course of dealings.pell,wl at citing kurz ii,at smith.as the district court explained 
r epeated misrepresentations over an extended course of dealings between an employer and an employee are sufficient to demonstrate the existence of extraordinary circumstances,when,as here,it is clear that the employee has been diligent in inquiring into the employer representations,in seeking clarifications about those representations,and in obtaining reaffirmations of those representations.
pell,wl at.we agree with the district court that there were extraordinary circumstances.
in the kurz cases,kurz and other employees claimed that their employer had made material misrepresentations about the terms of an early retirement plan.kurz phila.kurz i,cir.the employees had attended individual retirement interviews in which some of them asked whether changes to the retirement plan were forthcoming.id.the employer retirement counselors answered in the negative,but in fact,management was actively considering an early retirement incentive plan.id.at.the plan was instituted shortly after the employees retired and did not apply to them retroactively.id.at.we concluded that despite the inaccurate information given by the retirement counselors,there were no extraordinary circumstances.kurz ii,at.we explained there is no conduct suggesting that the employer sought to profit at the expense of its employees,no showing of repeated misrepresentations over time,and no suggestion that plaintiffs are particularly vulnerable.id.at.
dupont argues that pell case is like kurz,and simple erisa reporting errors or disclosure violations,do not constitute extraordinary circumstances.contrary to dupont argument,kurz is distinguishable from this case.dupont did not commit a simple erisa reporting error.instead,it made affirmative misrepresentations to pell over an extended period of time.this case is therefore not like kurz,where the misrepresentation to each employee took place in a single conversation.id.
pell case,as the district court concluded,is more like smith.in smith,the employee husband sought information regarding the employer new health insurance plan and received multiple inaccurate assurances that the coverage his wife needed would be available.id.at.we concluded that on remand,a factfinder could find that extraordinary circumstances are established,in light of the employer repeated oral and written misrepresentations to the husband,his diligence in attempting to obtain accurate answers regarding his wife coverage,as evidenced by his persistent questioning of human resources and insurance company personnel,and the immense coverage expenses at stake.id.at.
like the smith plaintiffs,pell was diligent and engaged in persistent questioning about the significant benefits at stake.relying on smith,the district court correctly determined that dupont repeated affirmative misrepresentations,combined with pell diligence,demonstrate that there are extraordinary circumstances 
in sum,we agree with the district court that pell has established the elements of an equitable estoppel claim under erisa.dupont made material misrepresentations about the amount of pell pension benefit,pell reasonably and detrimentally relied on those misrepresentations,and dupont inaccuracies over an extended course of dealing constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting relief.
having determined that pell is entitled to relief under erisa based on an equitable estoppel theory,we turn to the parties disputes over remedies.dupont argues that the district court injunction was an impermissible form of relief under erisa.in addition,dupont asserts that the relief pell was granted goes beyond the terms of the pension plan and thus constitutes an impermissible informal amendment to the plan.
pell,for his part,argues that the district court should have awarded him restitution for his past unduly low pension benefit payments.he also claims that the district court erred when it determined that dupont should calculate his benefits based on the adjusted service date rather than.
determining what remedies are available under a statute is a question of statutory interpretation that requires de novo review.daniel scranton sch,cir.therefore,we review de novo the district court grant of an injunction and its denial of restitution for past low benefit payments.id.the district court determination that is the appropriate adjusted service date is a mixed conclusion of law and fact.see interfaith cmty.org.honeywell int l,cir.we break down such conclusions into their components and apply the appropriate standard of review to each component.universal minerals,hughes,cir.we must accept the trial court findings of historical or narrative facts unless they are clearly erroneous,but we must exercise a plenary review of the trial court choice and interpretation of legal precepts and its application of those precepts to the historical facts.id.
the district court correctly concluded that an injunction was an appropriate remedy,but it erred when it refused to award pell restitution for his past unduly low pension benefits.in addition,the court erred when it determined that,not,was the appropriate adjusted service date.
injunctive relief under erisa 
dupont argues that the injunction requires it to pay pell more money than it would have otherwise.dupont claims that the injunction is therefore a legal rather than an equitable remedy,and that such relief is not available under erisa.
in light of erisa detailed enforcement scheme,courts are especially reluctant to create remedies not specifically authorized by its text.life annuity ins.knudson,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.erisa provides for the issuance of injunctions in order to grant appropriate equitable relief to aggrieved employees such as pell.id.quoting a.the supreme court has reasoned that e quitable relief must mean something less than all relief,and therefore it has explained that a authorizes only those categories of relief that were typically available in equity.id.at.quoting mertens hewitt,d.thus,the main question in assessing injunctions such as the one before us is whether the injunction constitutes a permissible equitable remedy or an impermissible legal one.see eichorn v.at t,cir.
could be read as providing facial support for dupont argument that pell injunction actually constitutes a legal,rather than an equitable,remedy.but the injunction effectively creates a constructive trust on particular property in dupont possession,rather than imposing personal liability on dupont.therefore,as subsequent supreme court case law confirms,the injunction falls within the type of equitable relief that erisa authorizes.
in,knudson was rendered quadriplegic in an auto accident,and her husband health plan paid her medical expenses.at.a reimbursement provision gave the plan the right to recover its benefit payments from knudson if she recovered them from a third party.id.after the knudsons received a settlement from the auto manufacturer,initiated legal action under erisa to enforce the reimbursement provision.id.at.the supreme court examined whether the remedy sought would have been available from a court of equity i n the days of the divided bench.id.at.the court noted that equitable restitution was historically available where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.id.at.
the court denied relief to because the knudsons settlement proceeds were not in their possession,but had been distributed to attorneys,a special needs trust,and other parties.id.at.therefore,t he kind of restitution sought was not imposition of a constructive trust or equitable lien on particular imposition of personal liability for the benefits that conferred upon the knudsons.id.
sereboff mid atlantic medical services,d,followed and amplified upon.sereboff basic facts are identical to.erisa plan beneficiaries the sereboffs were injured in an auto accident and received a settlement from a third party.id.at.the health plan mid atlantic took legal action to claim part of the settlement proceeds pursuant to a reimbursement provision.id.at.the facts differed from in that the parties entered into a stipulation under which the sereboffs agreed to preserve of the settlement funds in an investment account,until the district court rule d on the merits of the case and all appeals were exhausted.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the supreme court decided that the impediment to characterizing the relief in as equitable was not present.id.at.because the funds in question had been set aside and were specifically identifiable in the sereboffs investment accounts,mid atlantic could recover through the traditional equitable remedies of constructive trust or equitable lien.id.at.
sereboff shows that a remedy can not be classified as legal merely because it consists of payments.id.a remedy involving payments is permissible so long as those payments would have historically been available in courts of equity.id.in fact,prior to sereboff,we had already determined that erisa relief may include payments of money if those payments are properly characterized as an equitable remedy.skretvedt dupont de nemours,cir.in skretvedt,we noted 
some have perceived in a per se pronouncement that where a plaintiff seeks an award that ultimately involves money,such an award is a claim for legal relief and is not available under a b our reading,however,is that did not adopt such a rule.instead,the supreme court indicated that,to determine whether a specific form of underlying relief requested is available under a b,we must consider whether the relief was typically available at law or in equity and,in the case of restitutionary relief,whether the relief requested was in fact a form of equitable restitution.
in this case,the relief is an injunction to calculate pell future pension payments using an earlier adjusted service date.injunctions are legal remedies if they compel the payment of money past due under a contract,or specific performance of a past due monetary obligation,a remedy that was not typically available in equity,at.the injunction imposed by the district court in this case is and entitles pell to an amount of money that can not be calculated with specificity since it is unknown how long he will survive and be entitled to benefits.therefore,the injunction is an equitable remedy that is permissible under erisa.
in addition to attacking the form of the remedy that pell received,dupont argues that erisa provides a cause of action only to recover the benefits that are due under the terms of an employee benefit plan.dupont states that because pell is already receiving the pension payment to which he is entitled under the terms of the plan,he is without relief under erisa.relying on,and sereboff,dupont claims that an employee such as pell can not receive relief beyond that specified by the plan terms.dupont argues that the district court injunction renders dupont erroneous representations to pell an impermissible informal amendment to the plan.confer custom eng g,cir.
we have previously considered and rejected this argument.see in re unisys.retiree med.benefit erisa,cir.although unisys dealt with a breach of fiduciary duty claim,our rationale for providing relief beyond a plan terms encompassed equitable estoppel as well 
imposing upon an employer a fiduciary duty in this case does not threaten or contradict our policy disfavoring informal plan amendments o ur equitable theories of relief under erisa breach of fiduciary duty and estoppel are not to
