reliance standard life insurance company reliance appeals the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of patrick gallagher in this action for wrongful denial of benefits under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.west.the issues on appeal are whether the district court erred in applying an abuse of discretion standard to reliance decision to deny benefits and whether the district court erred by reversing reliance decision to deny benefits and entering summary judgment in gallagher favor.we conclude that reliance decision to deny benefits to gallagher is subject to de novo review and uphold reliance decision under this standard of review.accordingly,we reverse the district court entry of summary judgment in gallagher favor and remand for entry of judgment in reliance favor.
gallagher worked as a corporate officer and publisher for goodwill publishing,gwp for years.his job required three to four hours a day of sedentary work,such as word processing,and some international travel.gallagher suffered on and off from back pain during most of the time he was employed by gwp.in,gallagher sought medical treatment for pain in his lumbar spine.when his condition did not improve,he underwent a suction discectomy.the surgery improved gallagher condition,but walking,standing,and sitting remained difficult.in,gallagher began treatment at the key biscayne medical clinic and eventually took a leave of absence to enroll in a rehabilitation program.during this time,gallagher began to suffer nerve pain in his neck and left arm and was diagnosed with diffuse degenerative disc disease,disc herniation,and spurring on the facets throughout his lumbar spine.in,gallagher cervical spine pain became severe.at.eismont,a neurosurgeon,diagnosed gallagher as suffering from arthritic changes and stenosis because of the pain caused by his chronic back condition,gallagher resigned from his job on may.
gallagher is covered by gwp disability policy the plan,an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa and funded by reliance.gwp is the plan administrator,and reliance is a fiduciary with responsibility for making claims determinations.on july,gwp forwarded gallagher disability benefit application to reliance.on february,reliance denied gallagher claim because it determined that his medical condition did not meet the definition of total disability under the plan.on february,the social security administration found gallagher to be totally disabled under the social security regulations.on june,gallagher requested reliance to review the denial of his disability benefits under the plan and submitted additional materials to support his claim.on october,reliance,after conducting an independent review,determined that denial of benefits was appropriate based on gallagher failure to satisfy the definition of total disability.specifically,reliance concluded that gallagher could perform one or more of the material duties of his regular occupation.having exhausted his administrative remedies,gallagher initiated this erisa action in the united states district court for the western district of north carolina.the district court concluded that reliance had abused its discretion and entered summary judgment in favor of gallagher.reliance filed a timely notice of appeal.
we examine the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal test as the district court.elliott sara lee,cir.it is that a court reviewing the denial of disability benefits under erisa initially must decide whether a benefit plan language grants the administrator or fiduciary discretion to determine the claimant eligibility for benefits,and if so,whether the administrator acted within the scope of that discretion.feder paul revere life ins,cir see also johannssen district coast district,cir explaining that if the language of the plan grants the administrator or fiduciary discretion to determine eligibility for benefits under the plan,the reviewing court determines whether a denial of benefits was an abuse of discretion no specific phrases or terms are required in a plan to preclude a de novo standard of review.feder,at i f the terms of a plan indicate a clear intention to delegate final authority to determine eligibility to the plan administrator,then this court will recognize discretionary authority by implication.the plan intention to confer discretion on the plan administrator or fiduciary,however,must be clear.sandy reliance standard life ins,cir neither the parties nor the courts should have to divine whether discretion is conferred.if a plan does not clearly grant discretion,the standard of review is de novo.feder,at.any ambiguity in an erisa plan is construed against the drafter of the plan,and it is construed in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured.bynum cigna healthcare,cir.of course,because de novo review is more rigorous,if a reviewing court upholds a benefits decision under de novo review,it also would uphold it under a deferential standard.feder,at explaining that under the deferential standard,the reviewing court should uphold an administrator decision if it is reasonable,even if the court would have reached a different conclusion.
with these principles in mind,we must determine whether the following language in the plan grants reliance discretion to determine gallagher eligibility for benefits we will pay a monthly benefit if the insured submits satisfactory proof of total disability to us.at.there are two possible ways to interpret this language that gallagher must submit to reliance satisfactory proof of his disability or that he must submit proof of his disability that is satisfactory to reliance the former interpretation would require gallagher to submit to reliance proof of a total disability that is objectively satisfactory to determine whether gallagher met this objective standard,we would review reliance denial of his claim de novo.feder,at requirement that claimant submit written proof of disability and proof to verify the continuance of any disability establishes an objective standard see also herzberger standard ins,cir explaining that merely requiring claimant to submit proof or satisfactory proof does not create a subjective standard.the latter interpretation,however,would require gallagher to submit to reliance proof of a total disability that reliance finds subjectively satisfactory to determine whether gallagher met this subjective standard,we would review reliance denial of his claim for abuse of discretion.bernstein capitalcare,cir concluding that an agreement gave discretion to the administrator because it provided that benefits would be paid out only if the administrator determined that certain conditions are met.we conclude that the language of the plan does not grant reliance discretionary authority.first,as noted above,a grant of discretion must be clear.sandy,at no matter how you slice it,requiring a claimant to submit satisfactory proof does not unambiguously confer discretion see also homestead mortgage,cir because it is not clear from the plain language which interpretation is the correct one,reliance failed to reserve discretionary authority.kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir t he needless ambiguity in the wording of the policy should be resolved against first reliance.second,an insured employee reading this language would most likely interpret to us as an indication of where to submit the proof,not as granting reliance discretion to determine whether the proof was satisfactory.the prepositional phrase to us,as written in the plan,is more naturally read as modifying submit rather than satisfactory.
accordingly,we hold that the proper standard of review of reliance denial of gallagher claim for benefits is de novo,and we must next determine whether the proof of total disability he submitted to reliance was objectively satisfactory.
under the plan,an insured employee is totally disabled when,as the result of an injury or sickness,the employee can not perform each and every material duty of regular occupation during the elimination period.at.an employee is unable to perform each and every duty if he is unable to perform all the duties of his regular occupation.elliott sara lee,cir.the elimination period under the plan is defined as consecutive days of total disability.at.gallagher claims his disability began on may.the elimination period,therefore,ran from that date through august.accordingly,to qualify for disability benefits,gallagher must submit objectively satisfactory proof that he was unable to perform all the material duties of his regular occupation between may,and august.elliott,at noting that the burden of proving a disability is on the employee.
where regular occupation is not defined in the plan,the fiduciary must adopt an appropriate description of the claimant occupation.see kinstler,at t he applicable definition of regular occupation shall be a position of the same general character as the insured previous job,requiring similar skills and training,and involving comparable duties.citation omitted.to this end,reliance requires the employer of the insured to give a description of the employee duties.in response to this inquiry,gwp described gallagher job duties in the following manner 
the employee was one of the company executives and held the title of vice chairman and publisher and had the powers that are normally exercised by an executive officer and performed services and duties for the company consistent with such position,with any additions to the scope of the duties of said employment within the field of operations of the company as may be reasonably specified from time to time by the company or the board of directors.without in any way limiting the foregoing,the employee engaged primarily in the domestic and foreign wholesale operation of the company.the employee also devoted time,energy and skill during regular business hours to the promotion of the company language skills and overseas operations.
gallagher was in charge of international sales which required frequent travel to miami,mexico,ireland,spain and germany.he was also in charge of publishing which required editing,proofreading and acting as the liaison with printers and others.
at.this job description fails to give much detail regarding gallagher specific duties.gallagher duties as vice president,for example,are simply defined as those consistent with such a position.at.reliance therefore turned to the department of labor dictionary of occupational titles the dot to define gallagher material duties as a publisher and vice president.deloatche heckler,cir t he secretary of health and human services may rely on the general job categories of the dot as presumptively applicable to a claimant prior work.specifically,reliance used the dot occupation description for the position of editor in the printing and publishing industry and for the position of vice president in any industry.at.the dot entry for editor describes the position as sedentary with frequent reaching,handling,talking,hearing,and occasional fingering.according to the dot,an editor has the following occupational duties 
confers with executives,department heads,and editorial staff to formulate policy,coordinate department activities,establish production schedules,solve publication problems,and discuss makeup plans and organizational changes.
determines theme of issue and gathers related material.
writes or assigns staff members or freelance writers to write articles,reports,editorials,reviews,and other material.
reads and evaluates material submitted for publication consideration.
secures graphic material from picture sources and assigns artists and photographers to produce pictures and illustrations.
assigns staff member,or personally interviews individuals and attends gatherings,to obtain items for publication,verify facts,and clarify information.

the dot also describes the position of vice president as sedentary,demanding frequent talking and hearing and occasional reaching,handling,and fingering.a vice president has the following occupational duties 
participates in formulating and administering company policies and developing long range goals and objectives.
directs and coordinates activities of department or division for which responsibility is delegated to further attainment of goals and objectives.
reviews analyses of activities,costs,operations,and forecast data to determine department or division progress toward stated goals and objectives.
confers with chief administrative officer and other administrative personnel to review achievements and discuss required changes in goals or objectives resulting from current status and conditions.

gallagher argues that the material duties set forth in the dot descriptions for gallagher occupation do not match his actual job and,thus,reliance analysis is fatally flawed.appellee br.at.he fails,however,to point to any specific duty in the dot description that was in some way different from his actual job duties.comparing gwp description of gallagher job with the dot occupation description used by reliance,we conclude that the latter involves duties comparable to the former.for example,while gwp states that gallagher job requires editing,proofreading,and acting as a liaison with printers and others,the dot describes these same duties with more specificity,such as marks dummy pages to indicate position and size of printed and graphic material,and r eviews final proofs and approves or makes changes.at citing dot,code.the only significant discrepancy between the job description adopted by reliance and gwp description of gallagher actual job is the failure of the former to include the travel requirement.this omission,however,is not a fatal flaw in reliance analysis.a general job description of the dot,to be applicable,must involve comparable duties but not necessarily every duty.deloatche,at.in this case,gallagher must establish that he is unable to perform each and every material duty of his occupation.accordingly,if he fails to demonstrate that he is unable to perform some duties that do not require travel,establishing an inability to travel would not save his claim the description of gallagher duties adopted by reliance is therefore not inappropriate despite the omission of a travel requirement 
having adopted an objectively reasonable job description to define gallagher material duties,reliance then evaluated gallagher medical condition against these duties.on december,reliance sent aizcorbe,gallagher primary treating physician,the dot occupation descriptions and asked him to highlight the duties from the dot description that gallagher could not perform although aizcorbe noted several duties that gallagher could not perform,he affirmed that gallagher could read and evaluate material,review final proofs,and approve or make changes.without further elaboration,aizcorbe wrote that gallagher could direct but not coordinate department activities.under the duty involving marking dummy pages,aizcorbe wrote maybe,and under the duty involving planning page layouts,he wrote depends.at.finally,aizcorbe response to the duty of directing activities of production,circulation,or promotion personnel suggested that gallagher could perform the duty but that he would have to spend some time at it.at.thomas hardy,a vocational specialist employed by reliance,also concluded that gallagher could perform several duties of his occupation.he explained that the medical evidence indicated that gallagher had a sedentary work capacity.hardy also noted that some of aizcorbe responses appeared to be inconsistent.for example,aizcorbe stated that gallagher could review f
