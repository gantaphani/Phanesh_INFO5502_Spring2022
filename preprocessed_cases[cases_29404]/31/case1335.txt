retired airways pilots brought suit against the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc or corporation,seeking to compel the pbgc to correct alleged errors in its calculation of estimated benefits due the pilots under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the airways pilots retirement income plan.the pilots contend that,in failing to correct those errors,the pbgc breached its obligations both as fiduciary and as.without reaching the merits,we conclude that the claims against the pbgc must be dismissed because the pilots have not yet exhausted their administrative remedies.
on august,airways group,and seven subsidiaries collectively,filed voluntary petitions in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia,seeking reorganization relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et.on january,airways filed with the pbgc a notice of its intent to terminate its pilots retirement income plan,a pension plan,citing a serious funding shortfall.in re airways group.airways simultaneously filed a motion in the bankruptcy court for the judicial findings required by erisa to permit a distress termination of the plan.see c b ii iv.
the bankruptcy court subsequently granted the motion,finding that unless the plan is terminated,the debtors will be unable to pay all of their debts pursuant to a plan of reorganization and will be unable to continue in business outside the chapter reorganization process.in re airways group,order at,citing c b ii iv.after airways gained the consent of the pilots union to terminate the plan,see a,the company entered into an agreement with the pbgc setting march,as the plan termination date.
prior to the termination date,airways,as the plan administrator,was responsible for revising benefit payments under the plan from levels to what it estimated would be the amount of benefits that would be covered by plan assets or guaranteed by the pbgc following termination.see c d ii iv c.revised benefit calculations are governed by erisa and pbgc regulations.see,a.airways completed these determinations and informed plan participants of their estimated benefits by letters dated march.see boivin airways,d.
the pursuant to title iv of a government corporation within the department of labor that insures pension plans.see.sponsors of such plans pay premiums to the pbgc,and the corporation acts as a statutory guarantor,paying benefits to participants of underfunded terminated plans subject to statutory limits.see id.when an underfunded plan is terminated,a successor trustee is appointed to administer the plan and to assume responsibility for its assets.erisa permits,but does not require,the pbgc to be appointed as the successor trustee.see id.b.in practice,the pbgc has always applied to serve as successor trustee for plans,and the courts have invariably granted its applications.see pineiro pbgc,d.following this path,the pbgc applied to serve as successor trustee of the airways plan,and its application was granted.
when the airways plan terminated on march,the pbgc began paying estimated benefits.at that point,the pbgc had not yet made its formal determination of each participant benefits,and it still has not done so.the parties do not dispute that the pbgc normally requires two to three years from the date it takes over a plan to issue a formal benefit determination to each plan participant.see boivin,d at decl.of candace campbell.once final benefit determinations are made,the pbgc either repays any shortfall in the amount of the participants interim benefits,with interest,or seeks to recoup any surplus.see.
on november,without waiting for the pbgc to complete its final determinations,the plaintiffs filed suit against the pbgc and airways.the gravamen of their complaint was that the estimated benefit calculations were incorrectly low as to them,and that waiting two to three years for a formal benefit determination would cause them great hardship.boivin,d at.they alleged four primary errors in the calculation of estimated benefits incorrect determination of the effective date of an amendment to the airways plan concerning early retirees improper consideration of previously paid partial benefits in calculating prospective monthly annuities underpayment of benefits to retirees over the age of,based upon the pbgc statutory guaranty levels and underpayment of benefits to other retirees,based on the pbgc application of an artificially low funding percentage in calculating benefits,appellants br.the plaintiffs contended that the pbgc breached its duties,both as a fiduciary and as a federal,by failing to correct the asserted errors in its calculation of estimated benefits.see am.compl.
the plaintiffs claims against airways were stayed as a consequence of the airline bankruptcy filing.see a boivin airways,order at,wl march.on december,the district court denied a motion for a preliminary injunction against the pbgc.in the months that followed,the pbgc took action to remedy two of the four errors alleged by the pilots.first,it corrected the benefit payments for retirees over the age of by increasing their benefits from to percent of their levels.second,it corrected payments for other retirees by raising their benefits from to percent of their levels.the pbgc took no action as to the other two alleged errors.
on march,after hearing motions filed by both sides,the district court issued an order granting summary judgment for the pbgc on the plaintiffs fiduciary duty claims,holding that there was no evidence that the corporation had breached any fiduciary obligation in calculating estimated benefits.see boivin airways,mem.op.at,wl.it dismissed for failure to state a claim the plaintiffs allegations against the pbgc as,on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.id.at,wl.at the plaintiffs request,the court then entered final judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
as noted above,the pilots complaint alleged that the pbgc had committed four errors in calculating their estimated benefits.the pilots agree that the pbgc has since corrected two of those to the percentage of payments made to that only two alleged errors remain for our consideration on this appeal incorrect determination of the effective date of an amendment to the airways plan concerning early retirees and improper consideration of previously paid partial benefits in calculating prospective monthly annuities.see appellants br,reply br.
the first remaining allegation concerns benefit reductions made by the pbgc based on its view that an amendment to the plan,which enhanced benefits for certain early retirees,had become effective less than months before the plan terminated.erisa provides that amendments resulting from a plan amendment which was made,or became effective,whichever is later,less than months before termination may not be fully credited.b b the parties appear to agree that the amendment at issue here was made on december,the date it was adopted.see appellants br.pbgc opp to pl.supplemental mem.in supp.of its mot.for partial summ.at.the dispute,therefore,is over when the amendment became effective.
the plaintiffs contend that,because correspondence setting forth the amendment stated that airways would offer the enhancement effective as of the effective date of the new collective bargaining agreement with the pilots union,early retirement incentive program,at,and because the agreement became effective on january,that date is the operative date.they further contend that,because january,was more than months before the plan was terminated,no reduction in benefits is appropriate.the pbgc,by contrast,has preliminarily concluded that the amendment did not become effective until may,than months before that was the date specified in the correspondence as the first date upon which a participant could retire and receive the enhanced benefit.see id.at.the plaintiffs argue that the pbgc position misconstrues the statutory phrase became effective,b,as well as the related regulatory phrase has been in effect,b 
the second alleged error concerns pilots who,prior to the plan termination,had taken a portion of their pension benefits as a lump sum,with the remainder to be paid out in monthly installments.the pbgc treated the partial lump sum as if it amounted to the purchase of a partial annuity,also to be paid out prospectively.the pbgc then applied the statutory guarantee limit against the total payments to the participant,including the portion taken as a lump sum in so doing,the plaintiffs allege,the pbgc misinterpreted its own regulations by making calculations on the basis of benefits paid rather than benefits payable as of the termination date.see referring to benefits payable id.same.
as this discussion indicates,both errors alleged by the pilots depend,at bottom,upon interpretations of erisa sections and pbgc regulations.the pilots assert that the pbgc misinterpreted the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions,and in so doing breached both its fiduciary duty as trustee and its responsibility as.see appellants br.citing,f.the pbgc responds in three ways.first,it argues that,in calculating estimated benefits,it owes no fiduciary duty to the pilots because it makes such calculations in its role as and not as a fiduciary.second,the pbgc asserts if it did act as a fiduciary in making the challenged calculations and even if the calculations were wrong it did not breach a duty to the pilots because it made the calculations in good faith.third,the pbgc maintains that,regardless of the capacity in which it acted and regardless of whether its calculations violated a fiduciary duty or agency responsibility,the pilots have not exhausted their administrative remedies and must do so before seeking judicial review.that administrative process requires the plaintiffs to wait until the pbgc completes its work and issues formal benefit determinations,at which point the plaintiffs must complete internal pbgc appeals before filing an action in federal court.
for the reasons set forth below,we agree with the pbgc exhaustion argument.the pilots must await formal determinations,and then challenge those determinations through the procedures that the pbgc has provided,before they may seek redress in court.since our holding regarding exhaustion resolves the case,we need not reach any questions concerning the existence or scope of the pbgc fiduciary duty.
although erisa does not expressly require exhaustion of administrative remedies where congress has not clearly required exhaustion,sound judicial discretion governs.mccarthy madigan,d see communications workers of am.v.at t.and as the plaintiffs correctly concede,c ourts generally hesitate to interfere in matters prior to final agency action in order to allow the expert agency to complete its work and to allow senior officials to authoritatively rule on issues.appellants br.indeed,this court has held that,in the case of ongoing pension plans,barring exceptional circumstances,parties aggrieved by decisions of pension plan administrators must exhaust the administrative remedies available to them under their pension plans before challenging those decisions in court under erisa.communications workers,at.
the pbgc has promulgated regulations providing administrative remedies for persons dissatisfied with its benefit determinations.as discussed in part i,when an underfunded plan terminates,the pbgc begins paying estimated benefits to plan participants.after completing a review of plan documents,data,and assets,the corporation issues benefit determination letters to participants setting forth its formal calculation of their benefits.the regulations refer to such a formal determination as an initial determination,and they require that it shall be in writing,shall state the reason for the determination,and shall contain notice of the right to request review of the determination.any person aggrieved by such an initial determination may file an appeal to the pbgc appeals board.see id.the decision of the appeals board constitutes the final agency action by the pbgc with respect to the determination which was the subject of the appeal.id.b.the regulations further state that a person aggrieved by an initial determination has not exhausted his or her administrative remedies until he or she has filed such a request for review.id.
the pilots contend that these administrative remedies were not intended to apply to their situation.as both sides agree,to date the pilots have received only estimated determinations and have not yet received the formal initial determination to which the regulations refer.because the regulations remain silent on exhaustion of claims against pbgc for actions other than final determination of benefits,the pilots contend that the regulations do not preclude their claims.reply br.
the pbgc,to whose interpretation of its own regulations we owe substantial deference,see thomas jefferson shalala,d,persuasively argues to the contrary.the corporation insists that,although the exhaustion regulations do not mention estimated benefit determinations,they are part of a process that begins with such determinations,leads to formal determinations,and culminates in appeals generating final agency actions.it would make little sense,the pbgc observes,to establish an elaborate process for appealing determinations and requiring the exhaustion of such appeals once the corporation reaches a formal conclusion,but to allow plan participants to pretermit that process by going to court before that stage is even reached.
in any event,regardless of whether the regulations authors consciously accounted for the possibility that a participant might want to challenge an estimated determination,there is no question that the regulations provide an administrative avenue for doing so an estimated determination inevitably leads to a formal benefit determination,and,if the latter does not satisfy the participant,the regulations provide for an administrative appeal.if the participant wins that appeal,he or she is entitled to recoup any underpayments along the way,with interest.see appellee br.
the supreme court has explained that courts generally require administrative exhaustion because it serves the twin purposes of protecting administrative agency authority and promoting judicial efficiency.mccarthy,at.with respect to agency authority,the exhaustion doctrine recognizes that agencies,not the courts,ought to have primary responsibility for the programs that congress has charged them to administer.id.the doctrine acknowledges the commonsense notion s of dispute resolution that an agency ought to have an opportunity to correct its own mistakes regarding the programs it administers before it is haled into federal court,and that frequent and deliberate flouting of administrative processes could weaken an agency effectiveness by encouraging disregard of its procedures,id.quoting mckart united states,d.with respect to judicial efficiency,by giving an agency the opportunity to correct its own errors,a judicial controversy may well be mooted,or at least piecemeal appeals may be avoided.id.and even where a controversy survives administrative review,exhaustion of the administrative procedure may produce a useful record for subsequent judicial consideration,especially in a complex or technical factual context.id.
the purposes identified by the court are well served by enforcing an exhaustion requirement in this case exhaustion would protect the pbgc authority to administer the complex program that congress has entrusted to its care,give it the chance to correct its own mistakes,and obviate what would otherwise be an incentive to to pbgc administrative procedures.indeed,allowing the pilots to proceed in court at this time would permit them to jump ahead of others who have patiently waited for the pbgc to reach final would no doubt encourage those others to file suit as well,disrupting the entire process and ultimately delaying determinations for everyone.requiring exhaustion would also promote judicial efficiency by giving the pbgc the opportunity to moot this appeal by correcting the errors alleged by the pilots it would at least require the pilots to consolidate in one appeal any objections they may have to the corporation final as well as estimated calcula
