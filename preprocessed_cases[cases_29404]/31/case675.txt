background 
plaintiff is the widow of joseph shields,a former employee of qsp,which is a subsidiary of reader digest.the plan,which is subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,is a retirement plan for the benefit of employees and former employees of reader digest and certain of its subsidiaries,including qsp.shields retired from qsp as a participant in the plan and hence was entitled to elect one of several pension benefit options,all of which are designed to be of equal actuarial value.
under the plan,the normal age of retirement is.an employee may elect to retire early,however,if he or she is at least years old or at least years old and his or her age plus his or her years of service equals.a participant electing early retirement may choose from any of the available benefit options,although the payment levels are actuarially adjusted to reflect the longer time period over which the benefits will be paid.
one option is a life annuity benefit,under which the retiree typically receives a fixed monthly sum paid for the rest of his or her life,but a surviving spouse receives no benefits for the balance of the spouse life two other available pension options are joint and survivor benefits.under these options,the retiree receives a monthly payment for the duration of his or her life,and if the retiree predeceases his or her spouse,the surviving spouse receives continued benefits for the balance of the spouse life in accordance with federal law,see a,the default pension option available to married retirees under the plan is the qualified joint and survivor annuity qjsa.under the terms of this option,amortized benefits are paid directly to the eligible retiree and,upon his or her death,one half of the remaining benefits are paid to the surviving spouse for the duration of his or her life.although plan participants are entitled to choose any of the available options,certain elections require spousal consent.for example,to select the life annuity benefit,a married participant must submit a qjsa waiver form signed by his or her spouse and notarized by a notary public.by executing this form,the spouse consents to waiving survivor benefits in exchange for higher payments to the retiree during the retiree lifetime.
many of the administrative functions of the plan are handled by an outside servicing company,william mercer,mercer,which performs the actuarial benefit calculations,processes the benefit paperwork,and fields telephone inquiries.in order to receive benefits,a retiring employee must notify the plan of his or her intent to retire and request the appropriate paperwork from mercer.mercer then makes the necessary calculations to determine the benefits owed to the employee and sends the appropriate paperwork to the employee.
on december,mercer sent shields a letter indicating the different benefit options available to him if he were to retire as of january.the letter stated that the default pension payment for a married participant is the qjsa,and that a different benefit option may require spousal consent.the letter specifically stated that to select a payment other than the qjsa,the election must be made prior to benefits commencing but not earlier than days before your benefit payments can begin.accompanying the letter were the many necessary forms that required completion and return,as well as a chart indicating the different payments shields and plaintiff would receive each month under each of the available options.
on january,at the age of,shields retired from qsp after more than thirty years of service.as an early retiree,he could have deferred receiving pension payments until the age of.in other words,the plan would accept shields decision to begin receiving pension benefits at any time during this approximately window and would begin payments at the next available date after the required paperwork was submitted.
shields submitted his retirement dated january,mercer.among the forms returned were an option election form specifying his selection of the life annuity benefit,and a qjsa waiver form bearing the signature gayle shields,terminating the plaintiff rights under the default qjsa option.on approximately january,the plan approved payment of benefits to shields retroactive to january,date of his retirement.this retroactive payment covered the time period of january,to january,and was in the amount of.the plan also arranged for regular processing of benefits to begin on february,with each check thereafter to be issued on the of each month in the amount of.in a letter dated february,mercer advised shields that his checks would be paid accordingly.in total,only six monthly checks were issued to shields prior to his death representing a total payment of in benefits 
shields died on may.following his death,plaintiff sought surviving spouse benefits from the plan.the plan,however,denied the claim.following this denial,plaintiff former attorney,benjamin hoffiz,sent correspondence to the plan suggesting that plaintiff signature on the waiver form had been forged by shields.despite the serious nature of this accusation,hoffiz submitted no evidence to support this assertion the plan again reviewed the file and again denied plaintiff request for survivor benefits.the plan denial was based on what the plan believed to be a validly signed election of benefits form and a properly signed and notarized qjsa waiver from the plaintiff.unable to convince the plan that shields committed forgery,hoffiz filed a state lawsuit on behalf of plaintiff.plaintiff case was removed to federal court because of the existence of a federal question under,and jurisdiction was established pursuant to.
after sitting as the trier of fact,the district court held that the plan did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in rejecting plaintiff allegations that her signature on the qjsa waiver form had been forged.in so holding,the court issued detailed factual findings that reflect careful deliberation of the extensive evidence submitted during trial.it was the district court conclusion that the plaintiff did not present any credible evidence to challenge the authenticity of the disputed form.the court also rejected plaintiff legal challenges to the validity of the waiver form.specifically,the court held that as a matter of law,the waiver was not defective due to issues relating to the timeliness of its submission.accordingly,the court found that plaintiff had waived her right to receive any survivor benefits under the plan.
ii.standard of review 
a challenge to an erisa plan denial of benefits is reviewed de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.if a plan grants such discretionary authority,the plan administrator decision to deny benefits is reviewed under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review.see perez aetna life ins,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.a decision is not arbitrary or capricious if it is rational in light of the plan provisions.yeager reliance standard life ins,cir quoting miller metropolitan life ins,cir.this standard is the least demanding form of judicial review of administrative action.when it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome,that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious.davis kentucky fin.ret.plan,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted,cert.denied,d.
in the instant case,the district court found,and the parties agree,that the plan confers discretion to the employee benefits committee to determine benefits and interpret the plan thus,we review the plan decision to deny plaintiff benefits under the arbitrary and capricious standard.of course,we review a district court findings of fact following a bench trial for clear error,and its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.davies centennial life ins,cir.
iii.analysis 
factual disputes 
on appeal,plaintiff continues to steadfastly deny ever signing the waiver form.however,she has not asked this court to review the district court factual findings.accordingly,because plaintiff has not directly challenged the district court factual conclusions,but rather has set forth the factual issues merely to put the legal issues in context,all factual controversies are deemed abandoned on appeal and the district court factual findings are hereby upheld.see bush dictaphone,cir issues not pursued on appeal are waived.
legal issues 
erisa analysis 
we are primarily asked to decide two interrelated legal questions of first impression on appeal,namely whether the applicable election period within c a i of erisa ends with a plan participant actual retirement date even when a plan is under no obligation to make benefit payments by the participant date of retirement and the annuity starting date,as that term is defined in h a i,is statutorily mandated to always be a plan participant date of actual retirement.with regard to the first question,we hold that when an plan is not under an obligation to make benefit payments by a plan participant actual retirement date,the applicable election period does not conclude with the participant date of actual retirement.accordingly,we find that under certain circumstances,a plan participant who retires early may waive qjsa benefits after his or her date of actual retirement.regarding the second issue,we hold that the annuity starting date is not statutorily required to always be a plan participant actual date of retirement.thus,the annuity starting date is not the retroactive date of a voluntary and benefit payment that reflects a participant actual retirement date rather,it is the date that a plan is under an obligation to begin making pension payments.accordingly,under the facts of this case,the qjsa waiver complied with the timing provisions set forth in erisa and therefore was enforceable as a matter of law.
the principal object of erisa is to protect plan participants and beneficiaries.boggs boggs,d citation omitted.in,congress amended erisa with the retirement equity act rea,to ensure that individuals whose spouses die before their retirement would nevertheless receive the spouses pension benefits.lefkowitz arcadia trading.benefit pension plan,cir.the supreme court has noted that rights conferred by the rea were intended to ensure a stream of income to surviving spouses.boggs,at.
as amended by the rea,erisa provides that benefits may be waived only if the participant obtains his or her spouse written consent for such a waiver.c a.the timing provisions of erisa provide that a plan participant may elect at any time during the applicable election period to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit.id.c a i.the term applicable election period is defined to mean,in the case of an election to waive benefits,the period ending on the annuity starting date.id.c a.the term annuity starting date means the first day of the first period for which an amount is payable as an annuity.id.h a i.generally,a sum of money is said to be payable when a person is under an obligation to pay it.moyle director,office of workers comp.programs,cir quoting black law dictionary ed emphasis added,cert.denied,d.therefore,under a straightforward reading of erisa timing provisions,a participant and spouse may only waive the qjsa option during the period ending on the date that a plan is under an obligation to begin making pension payments.attempting to implement these statutory requirements,the plan provides that an election not to take a qualified joint and survivor annuity must be delivered to the committee during the period of days before the date on which payment of the benefit commences.plan,b.
in the instant case,shields retired early,effective january.plaintiff insists that the annuity starting date was shields retirement date,january.from this premise,plaintiff argues that the applicable election period meaning the period during which a spousal waiver could be the period ending on january.the waiver signed by plaintiff was dated january.therefore,according to plaintiff,the qjsa waiver form was dated and submitted approximately three weeks after the close of the election period.thus,under plaintiff analysis even if plaintiff signed the waiver,it was defective as a matter of law because it was not signed during the applicable election period.
although superficially persuasive,plaintiff analysis ignores the fact that as shields was an early retiree,the plan was under no obligation to begin making pension payments to him until his normal retirement date at the age of,october,or,if before then,at the time shields specified he wished to begin receiving pension benefits.in other words,the choice to begin receiving benefit payments belonged to the as such,he could postpone his election of benefits until his normal retirement date therefore,contrary to plaintiff position,the fact that shields retired on january,is not dispositive of this court calculation of the applicable election period or the annuity starting date.as the district court explained,erisa does not require a retiree to elect a certain type of benefit on or about the annuity first possible starting date.rather,in the judgment of the court,erisa requires the retirement plan to allow the retiree to do so.emphasis added.thus,we find that shields was not required to submit the election of benefits form or the qjsa waiver form prior to his early retirement date because there was no obligation that the plan make benefit payments by that date.also,we find that although shields was free to elect an annuity starting date that corresponded to his retirement date,he was not mandated by erisa to do so.therefore,the qjsa waiver form was not invalid merely because it arrived after shields early retirement date.
furthermore,the fact that the defendants assumed that january,was the annuity starting date or that mercer calculated shields retirement benefit options with a january annuity start date does not prove that shields annuity starting date was in fact january when shields requested to receive an explanation of benefits package,mercer put together a chart setting forth the benefit payments that shields and plaintiff would receive every month under each of the four benefit options.because shields did not specify when he wished to begin receiving benefit payments,mercer had to independently assume an annuity starting date.mercer assumption that shields retirement date would also be his annuity starting date was a logical assumption.however,mercer guess did not convert shields silence into the actual annuity starting date,nor did it set in stone the date that shields annuity payments had to begin.the january date was merely a marker that enabled mercer to illustrate monetarily the different monthly payments available under the options.as mentioned above,shields was free to postpone his annuity starting date for almost three years after receiving the explanation of benefits package.when shields completed and returned the dated january,date was designated as the date that he wished his benefits to commence.accordingly,as the district court correctly found,t he only specified date for benefits to begin was an implicit o
