background 
suffered from depression and schizophrenia.in late,she attempted suicide and was hospitalized for six months.she was discharged from the hospital in june but again began contemplating suicide.although she asked to be rehospitalized,nicklin denied her request.on july,committed suicide.
following his wife death,jonathan lazorko,as administrator of her estate,brought suit in pennsylvania state court.lazorko alleged as to healthcare that under state law it was directly and vicariously liable for his wife death because the hmo imposed financial disincentives on nicklin that discouraged him from recommending her for additional treatment.
based on this claim,healthcare removed the case to federal court in the eastern district of pennsylvania,pursuant to b.healthcare argued that the denial of the hospitalization request was completely preempted by erisa under a b,which gives a member of an erisa plan an exclusive federal remedy for claims alleging the denial of benefits guaranteed by that plan.lazorko moved to remand the case to state court.the district court rejected lazorko motion,construing his direct liability claims as being for the improper denial of benefits,and thus completely preempted under erisa.lazorko pennsylvania,et,slip op.at,wl,lazorko i.in a subsequent decision,the district court dismissed the claims that were preempted by erisa civil remedy and remanded the rest of the case to state court.lazorko pennsylvania,et,slip op.at,wl,lazorko ii.
on this first remand,the state court dismissed four counts of lazorko complaint.three other counts,which alleged intentional misrepresentation,fraud,and violation of the state consumer protection law,were stricken without prejudice to amending.lazorko did amend,but he left intact his central contention that healthcare financial penalties interfered with nicklin professional judgment,causing death.
healthcare removed the case to federal court a second time in response,lazorko moved again for a remand.again,however,the district court denied the remand motion,concluding as it had previously that lazorko direct negligence claims against healthcare for denial of hospital benefits were completely preempted by erisa a b.the court did grant the motions to dismiss of the other defendants lazorko pennsylvania,et,ca,slip op.at,lazorko iii.
following the second removal to federal court,lazorko amended his complaint twice more.although he added new facts,he did not change his central contention.moreover,rather than add a new claim,based on erisa,to his existing claims of direct and vicarious liability,lazorko instead moved to strike healthcare erisa defenses,asserting that healthcare had not shown that his health plan qualified as an erisa plan.healthcare moved for summary judgment,arguing that,because his state law claims related to an erisa plan,they were superseded by erisa express preemption clause,a,a.
the district court denied lazorko motion to strike healthcare erisa defenses,reasoning that,under the law of the case,earlier proceedings had established the existence of a plan.lazorko pennsylvania,et,ca,slip op.at,wl.june,lazorko iv.the district court then granted summary judgment for healthcare on preemption grounds on all of lazorko direct liability claims against the hmo,including the claims in counts ii,iii and iv for intentional misrepresentation,fraud,and violation of pennsylvania consumer protection law the court remanded lazorko vicarious liability claims against healthcare,however,because they alleged medical malpractice,an area of tort law traditionally regulated by the states,which did not implicate the regulation of employer plans and,thus,was outside the scope of erisa express preemption.
healthcare also moved to sanction lazorko attorney,alleging that he had failed to reasonably investigate several of the charges levied against healthcare,including the allegations that the company issued sham benefit policies and that it intentionally denied patients treatment so as to maximize profits.the district court granted healthcare motion in a second june,order,which struck the offending allegations from the complaint and awarded the costs incurred to defend against the challenged allegations on july and,lazorko appealed both of the june orders.healthcare the remand to the state court of the vicarious liability claims against it.
following a hearing on the amount of sanctions,the district court awarded healthcare costs of in an order filed on august.lazorko did not appeal this order.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court purportedly had removal jurisdiction under a by virtue of erisa complete preemption provision,a b,codified at a b,which satisfies the arising under requirement for federal question jurisdiction under.see metropolitan life ins.taylor,d.we have appellate jurisdiction under.we review the district court decision to remand under c for abuse of discretion,but have plenary review of the underlying basis for remand to the extent that question is a legal one.see in re healthcare,at citing engelhardt paul revere life ins,cir.
although the district court relinquished jurisdiction over this case when it either dismissed or remanded all the claims before it,it still had jurisdiction to order sanctions.moreover,a district court has jurisdiction to impose rule sanctions on litigants and attorneys appearing before it even if the court is subsequently determined to have lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claim in which the sanctionable conduct occurred.see willy coastal,d in re jaritz industries,cir relying on willy.
concerning the award of sanctions,while we review a district court decision to impose sanctions for abuse of discretion,we have plenary review of the question of our jurisdiction over the appeal of the award.see shareholders sound radio,cir.an appellate court lacks jurisdiction over an appeal that is untimely filed,including premature appeals.see hindes federal deposit ins,cir.an award of sanctions is not a final order,and thus not appealable,until the district court deter mines the amount of the sanction.see napier thirty or more unidentified federal agents,employees or officers,cir.the district court did not make this determination until its subsequent order,filed on august.consequently,plaintiff july notice of appeal of the june sanctions order was premature and untimely.
nor does the fact that the district court subsequently entered its final order on the sanctions motion on august,cure this premature appeal and make it timely.a premature appeal can be cured by a subsequent final order if the untimely appealed decision would otherwise constitute a final judgment.see.a.because rule sanctions awards are interlocutory in nature,this rule does not extend to them.see firsti
