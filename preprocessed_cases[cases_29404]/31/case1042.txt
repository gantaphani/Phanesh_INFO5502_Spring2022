at issue in this case is whether certain provisions of missouri law are preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.the provisions regulate some aspects of how missouri health maintenance organizations hmos provide prescription drugs through network pharmacies.express scripts,express,which has a mail order pharmacy,and several business groups brought this action for injunctive and declaratory relief against keith wenzel,the acting director of the missouri department of insurance,arguing that the missouri provisions could not be enforced because they were preempted by erisa.after the district court granted wenzel motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs appealed and the united states secretary of labor filed an amicus brief supporting one of wenzel theories for affirmance.we conclude that the challenged provisions fall within erisa savings clause and therefore affirm.
the missouri legislation which led to this lawsuit was enacted in.prior to that time,some missouri hmos provided incentives to enrollees to fill maintenance prescriptions at mail service pharmacies,rather than at local retail pharmacies.a maintenance prescription is one providing medication to treat a medical condition for a period of greater than days,see.stats,and an enrollee might prefer to obtain a large supply of such medication to avoid the nuisance of more frequent purchase.prior to the enactment of the missouri statutes,an hmo could limit the quantity enrollees could obtain from retail pharmacies to a day supply while allowing them to obtain up to a day supply from a mail service pharmacy.an hmo also could charge enrollees a higher copayment to fill a maintenance prescription at a retail pharmacy than at a mail order pharmacy.such a mail service pharmacy provider would give discounts to the hmo in return for the benefit of becoming the preferred provider of maintenance prescriptions and the exclusive provider in the network of day prescriptions.
the missouri legislature enacted.and in.section requires hmos to charge the same copayment for prescription drugs from any network pharmacy which meets the hmo product cost determination 
every health maintenance organization shall apply the same coinsurance,and deductible factors to all drug prescriptions filled by a pharmacy provider who participates in the health maintenance organization network if the provider meets the contract explicit product cost determination.if any such contract is rejected by any pharmacy provider,the health maintenance organization may offer other contracts necessary to comply with any network adequacy provision of this act.however,nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the health maintenance organization from applying different coinsurance,copayment and deductible factors between generic and brand name drugs.
emphasis added.section prevents hmos from limiting the quantity of drugs an enrollee can obtain at one time unless the limit applies to all pharmacy providers 
health maintenance organizations shall not set a limit on the quantity of drugs which an enrollee may obtain at any one time with a prescription,unless such limit is applied uniformly to all pharmacy providers in the health maintenance organization network.

appellants express,associated industries of missouri,missouri chamber of commerce,and louis area business health coalition sued keith wenzel,the acting director of the missouri department of insurance.they sought an injunction against enforcement of the statutes and a declaratory judgment that the statutes and related regulation,are preempted by erisa.after discovery was complete,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court granted wenzel motion,and dismissed the case after concluding that the missouri statutes do not fall within the scope of erisa preemption because they do not relate to employee benefit plans.the court reasoned that the statutes do not act immediately and exclusively on such plans,but only indirectly,and that the existence of erisa plans is not essential to their operation.it also concluded that the statutes were saved from erisa preemption because they regulate hmos which are in the business of insurance.
appellants argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims.they say that the statutes are within the scope of erisa preemption because they relate to employee benefit plans since they directly regulate health benefit plans and impact plan structure,administration,and finances.they argue that the provisions are not saved by the insurance exception because hmos are not in the insurance business.wenzel responds that the statutes do not come within erisa preemption because they affect employee benefit plans only indirectly.he and amicus united states secretary of labor both argue that the missouri provisions are saved from preemption in any case because they regulate hmos which are in the business of insurance.
employee benefit plans are comprehensively regulated by erisa,et the act.such plans are established by employers and typically include retirement and health care benefits.at the time it enacted erisa,congress was concerned primarily with protecting employees from losing their anticipated retirement benefits.see congressional findings and declaration of policy.the act establishes minimum requirements to protect employee benefits.see,reprinted in,reprinted in.the act also includes a broad preemption provision,declaring that erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section a of this title and not exempt under section b of this title.a.the preemption provision was included to prevent states from interfering with the act intended protection of employees by inconsistent legislation or regulation.see,reprinted in,reprinted in.
the preemption provision has been construed broadly.a state law relates to an erisa plan and is preempted if it has a connection with or a reference to such a plan.new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.a state law does not have to act directly on an erisa plan to be preempted.see mcclendon,d.state laws that are not targeted at erisa plans,but which indirectly force a plan administrator to make a particular decision or take a particular action may be held to relate to employee benefit plans.see,metropolitan life ins.massachusetts,d massachusetts law requiring insurance companies to provide minimum mental health care benefits to insureds is related to erisa plans moran rush prudential hmo,cir,cert.granted,d illinois law requiring hmos to submit disputes over whether a treatment is medically necessary to independent review is related to erisa plans.
erisa also contains a savings clause to prevent certain state laws from being preempted nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.b a.erisa legislative history does not include a discussion of either employee health plans or the act savings clause.see metropolitan life,at.
in metropolitan life,the supreme court turned to the act,et,to inform its understanding of the erisa savings clause.see id.at.the act predates erisa,and it also protects state insurance laws from federal preemption.see id.at.the purpose of the act was explained in a policy statement in its legislative history 
congress hereby declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several states of the business of insurance is in the public interest,and that silence on the part of the congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several states.
congress thus chose to ensure that regulation of the insurance industry continue to be left to state governments.see metropolitan life,at.at,reprinted in.
under the act,state laws regulating the business of insurance are not preempted by a federal statute unless congress clearly communicates a specific intent to preempt.see b couch on ins.at.since the erisa preemption provision is broad enough to
