plaintiff maureen leyda,suing individually and as executrix of the estate of her late husband charles leyda leyda,appeals from so much of a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut,janet hall,judge,as denied her attorney fees as the prevailing party in this action against defendant alliedsignal,alliedsignal,for violation of its duty under the employee retirement income security act erisa,to disclose to leyda the terms of an employee benefit plan.alliedsignal from so much of the judgment as a ruled that alliedsignal failed to comply with erisa disclosure provisions,and b awarded leyda in damages under a b.alliedsignal contends principally that a b does not authorize an award of damages in excess of the amount of benefits to which a plan participant is entitled under the benefit plan extracontractual damages,and that,in any event,the district court erred in finding that alliedsignal failed to comply with erisa.on her appeal,leyda contends that the denial of attorney fees was an abuse of discretion.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
to the extent pertinent to these appeals,the events,as found by the district court,are largely undisputed and included the following.
a.the events 
from through september,leyda was employed by textron,textron,in its stratford,connecticut facility.leyda was eligible to participate in textron life insurance benefit plan,and he chose a level of benefits that would provide coverage at a rate three times his approximately annual salary.his coverage thus amounted to about.he designated leyda as the policy beneficiary.
in september,textron assets were purchased by alliedsignal.the asset purchase agreement stated that alliedsignal would offer most textron employees employment on substantially the same terms and conditions under which they were employed by textron on the date of the purchase.leyda was one of roughly textron employees retained by alliedsignal to work at the stratford facility.alliedsignal continued textron employee benefits through the end of but replaced the textron benefit plan with alliedsignal own benefit plan in january.alliedsignal plan provided life insurance coverage equal to only times an employee salary.employees had the option to enroll in,and pay the premium for,an alliedsignal group universal life gul insurance program that provided additional coverage of times the employee base salary.
in anticipation of the shift to the alliedsignal benefit plan,alliedsignal held meetings on november,and,for its employees who had been textron employees.those meetings focused on specific benefits available at alliedsignal,including basic life insurance.
alliedsignal mailed notice of the meetings to each employee using addresses from payroll records and posted notices on bulletin boards and video monitors.at these meetings,alliedsignal distributed summary plan descriptions,enrollment forms,and beneficiary designation forms.several hundred employees attended each meeting,and there were four meetings per day over the course of three days.no one took attendance at these meetings.
additional copies of all materials distributed at the meetings were left at the facility.supervisors tracked employees on sick leave,traveling,or on extended leave for the day assigned to that department meeting.a package of materials was sent first class to those employees home or work area.packages were also mailed to employees that notified the human resources department that they had a schedule conflict.at the request of specific employees,alliedsignal would hold meetings to discuss the benefits.
trial decision dated november,trial decision,at.
leyda,however,never received a summary plan description for the alliedsignal plan,which would have informed him that his textron life insurance had been replaced by alliedsignal coverage with far lower benefits.he did not receive a package of benefit materials at any of the meetings or in the mail he did not request or receive a session.he enrolled in the gul program in november and opted for coverage equal to his approximately salary,believing that this provided coverage in addition to the coverage for which he had opted at textron.
between and,leyda had opportunities to obtain additional life insurance coverage by increasing his gul coverage or by purchasing a policy offered in connection with a new mortgage.he declined these opportunities because he believed that the life insurance coverage he had already obtained totaled.leyda died in.leyda received approximately in benefits from his gul policy plus from alliedsignal basic life insurance coverage,for a total of,instead of the that leyda had believed the alliedsignal benefits provided.
leyda commenced the present action in alleging,inter alia,that alliedsignal,as administrator of its employee benefit plan,violated by failing to provide leyda with a summary plan description that would have disclosed the lower benefits provided by the alliedsignal plan,and that leyda,in not purchasing additional insurance,had relied on alliedsignal to his detriment.the complaint asserted that leyda was entitled to injunctive relief under a,the plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law complaint and it requested,inter alia,r estitution,attorney fees,and such other and further relief as the court may deem just id.wherefore.
b.the district court rulings 
following a bench trial,the district court found the facts set forth above.the court noted that federal law requires plan administrators to distribute summary plan descriptions to participants,trial decision at citing b,and that this means that the material must be sent by a method or methods of delivery likely to result in full distribution and that the administrator shall use measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt of the material by plan participants,trial decision at quoting b.the court stated that these regulations 
focus on actual receipt of the plan documents,not notice of an opportunity to obtain the documents or notice of the documents general availability.b i n no case is it acceptable merely to place copies of the material in a location frequented by participants.
trial decision at.the court concluded that the administrator process for disclosing the plan documents should be calculated to reach every individual without gaps where employees could potentially miss the distributed material.id.at.
the court found that alliedsignal method of distributing the notice of its scheduled the notices to the addresses in the employees payroll it likely that there would be full distribution of the meeting notices,id.emphasis in original,and that it was thus likely that leyda received notice of the meetings.but it stated that the court can not infer that he actually received the required plan documents because notice of availability does not equate to receipt.id.after describing the methods used by mailing the meeting notices,following up with respect to employees who had been on trips,sick leave,or extended leave on the meeting dates,providing an opportunity to approach the human resources department about meetings,and making plan documents generally available in the human resources court found that these methods were not reasonably calculated to result in actual distribution of the materials to all employees,because it was not reasonable to assume that,out of employees,the only persons not attending the meetings would be those on trips,sick leave,or extended leave.the court found that leyda was not on sick leave,traveling,or on extended leave on the days of the meetings,id.at,but that he did not attend any of the meetings,see id.at see also ruling on plaintiff request for attorney fees,dated march,fee decision,at the court reasonably inferred that leyda received notice of the meetings,but did not attend.the court found that leyda did not receive a copy of the summary plan description.see,trial decision at.it stated that 
f or any number of reasons,including a busy schedule or lack of awareness as to the importance of the meeting,employees that were not on sick leave,traveling,or on extended leave may not have attended the benefits meetings.therefore,the method used by alliedsignal was not calculated to result in full distribution because it did not take into account reasonable factors that would lead employees to miss the meetings.
id.at footnote omitted emphasis added.and because n o one took attendance at these meetings,id.at,alliedsignal had no way of knowing how many employees,other than those who were on sick leave,on extended leave,or traveling,had failed to attend.
the court noted that alliedsignal witnesses differed as to the reasonableness of taking attendance,but it found that the administrative burden imposed by requiring attendance sheets does not outweigh the reasonableness of such sheets for ensuring full distribution of the summary plan description.id.at.the court also noted that alliedsignal could,alternatively,have ensured full distribution simply by requiring participants to affirmatively enroll in its programs rather than providing automatic enrollment,and requiring them,on the enrollment form,to acknowledge receipt of the plan documents.the court found that it was unlikely that alliedsignal methods would result in full distribution and that i ts methods were not reasonably calculated to result in actual receipt id.as leyda had not received a summary plan description,the court concluded that alliedsignal had violated its duty of disclosure to leyda.see id.at.
the court also found that b ecause alliedsignal failed to disclose the summary plan description,leyda did not realize that his benefits changed after the takeover of textron that that lack of disclosure led him to believe that he still had the coverage he had under the textron policy and what he thought was the additional gul policy and that leyda declined offers of additional coverage because he believed he already had a total of in coverage.id.at.the court found that alliedsignal failure,in violation of erisa,to provide leyda with a summary plan description thus caused harm,and that leyda was entitled to damages under a b.
the court calculated that,in light of leyda final salary at alliedsignal,the damages totaled,see id.at,and judgment was entered in favor of leyda in that amount,plus interest.however,as discussed in part.below,the court declined to award leyda attorney fees.
ii.discussion 
leyda has appealed,challenging the district court refusal to award her,as the prevailing party,attorney fees under g.alliedsignal has,contending that as a matter of law a plan beneficiary can not recover extracontractual damages under a b,and that the district court erred in concluding that alliedsignal violated erisa disclosure provisions.for the reasons that follow,we decline to entertain alliedsignal first contention because it was not raised in the district court we reject its second contention because the district court findings are not clearly erroneous and we reject leyda contentions in support of her appeal because we are unpersuaded that the denial of attorney fees in this case was an abuse of discretion.because leyda appeal would be moot if alliedsignal challenges to the district court decision on the merits were sustainable,we address the first.
a.the availability of damages under a b 
the district court ruled that leyda was entitled to as damages under a b,representing the difference between the insurance coverage leyda believed he had and the insurance coverage he actually acquired under the alliedsignal plan.to the extent pertinent here,a b provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,or to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan.a b.alliedsignal contends that this section does not authorize an award of extracontractual damages,damages above the level of plan benefits to which the participant actually subscribed.for the reasons that follow,we decline to resolve this legal issue because alliedsignal did not make this argument in the district court.
alliedsignal correctly notes that the complaint itself did not cite a b but rather asked for,inter alia,injunctive relief under a and r estitution complaint and wherefore.however,leyda plainly sought damages beyond the insurance that leyda acquired under the alliedsignal plan,and her reliance on a b was made clear and explicit well in advance of trial.
some months prior to trial,the parties submitted their joint trial memorandum,in which leyda cited both a and a b.she stated that she sought relief based on the level of benefits that leyda believed he had secured.her proposed conclusions of law included the following 
failure to meet the disclosure requirements of b constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty actionable under a b and a when the failure to disclose prejudices the participant or beneficiary 
accordingly,the plaintiffs are entitled to equitable relief pursuant to a b and a.consequently,the plaintiffs are entitled to restitution in the form of benefits due under the former textron plan 
joint trial memorandum dated november,at,emphases added.in the section of the joint trial memorandum setting forth alliedsignal proposed conclusions of law,alliedsignal did not take the position that a b as a matter of law afforded no basis for the requested relief alliedsignal did not mention a b at all.
approximately one month before trial,leyda submitted a statement entitled plaintiff claim for damages,stating in part as follows 
in accordance with the order of the court on july,the plaintiff hereby submits the following summary of her claim for damages.
the plaintiff claims the sum of in restitution lost benefits.
plaintiff claim for damages dated august,at.alliedsignal thereafter submitted its r eply to plaintiff maureen leyda damage claim against alliedsignal,and took the position that leyda was not entitled to damages because alliedsignal had in fact performed its duties.alliedsignal reply to plaintiff damage claim,dated september,at alliedsignal met its obligations to the plaintiff and therefore alliedsignal does not owe the plaintiff any damages.emphasis added.there was no suggestion that leyda claim for damages was beyond the scope of a b because she sought a sum based on more coverage than leyda had acquired under the alliedsignal plan.instead,alliedsignal argued that,if it were found to have violated erisa,the allowable amount of damages would be a lower extracontractual sum than leyda requested because leyda coverage under the textron policy was really two,not three,times his salary.the reply stated that leyda maximum potential damages were,the difference between textron basic,no cost insurance of two times salary and alliedsignal basic,no cost insurance of times salary.id.at.as that was above the coverage that leyda had actually acquired under alliedsignal plan,this proposed measure of damages could not have alerted the court to alliedsignal present argument that a b does not authorize any award of damages above the level to which the plan participant subscribed.to the contrary,in that reply,alliedsignal stated,alliedsignal does not object to measuring damages if any are due by comparing either the no cost insurance levels times at textron times at alliedsignal,or the total insurance levels times at alliedsignal times at textron.id.
after trial,alliedsignal submitted additional proposed findings and conclusions,including the following 
a procedural violation of erisa reporting and disclosure requirements does not give rise to a damage claim absent some showing of prejudice or harm by the plaintiff.
alliedsignal supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law dated september,at,emphasis added.this alliedsignal submission,like its predecessors,contained no mention of a b,nor any suggestion that that section did not authorize leyda claim for damages.indeed,the implication of the absent some showing clause was that damages of the type she requested are in fact available to one who shows that a violation of the disclosure statements caused harm.
on november,the district court ruled in favor of leyda on the merits of her claim and awarded her damages,stating in pertinent part as follows 
since the court has concluded that allie
