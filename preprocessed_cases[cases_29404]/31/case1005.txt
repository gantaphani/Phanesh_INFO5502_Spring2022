edward chambers,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on his claims of age discrimination,breach of contract,and unjust enrichment against the defendants,metropolitan property and casualty insurance company met and paul fire and marine insurance company.we affirm.
we view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,as did the district court.from until,chambers was an employee of usf g company in various locations,ending up in florida.usf g merged with paul in and eliminated chambers position in the process.paul then hired chambers as the director of procedures and underwriting analysis and relocated him to minnesota in the summer of.the severance plan in effect at that time provided that if paul terminated chambers within months of this relocation,paul would pay the costs of one more relocation necessitated by the termination.this was amended in march of to provide relocation benefits if an employee was terminated within months of the initial relocation.
in the summer of,paul announced that it was selling its personal insurance operations to met as of october.as part of the terms of the sale,many of paul employees in the personal insurance operations were leased to met from the closing date of the sale until december.met had its own existing personal insurance operations employees,and all management positions were already staffed by met employees.therefore,the paul management positions were eliminated through the sale,including chambers position.met planned to hire some of the paul employees to facilitate the expansion of its underwriting department as a result of the acquisition.met agreement to lease some of the paul employees aided the transition and gave met time to evaluate its hiring needs.all of the leased employees were scheduled to be terminated from their employment with paul by december.chambers was retained past the closing date as a leased employee.
although no management positions were available in met underwriting department,chambers interviewed for other positions.in august,met chief underwriter and vice president,michelle dewine,interviewed each employee on paul corporate underwriting staff for nonmanagerial positions.dewine interviewed chambers,who was then years old,for a position in the compliance unit.dewine did not hire chambers for the position but instead hired pamela johnson,an employee who was under years old.chambers also interviewed with ken bokor,met assistant vice president of market strategy,for a position with met as a market strategist.three market strategist positions were available,one each in florida,minnesota,and illinois.chambers was most interested in the position located in florida but expressed a willingness to work at other locations as well.bokor did not hire chambers.instead,bokor hired will daniels for the florida position,tim smith for the minnesota position,and alice young for the illinois position,all of whom were under the age of.
in each instance,met set forth a nondiscriminatory reason for its hiring decision.the interviewers perceived chambers personality as somewhat aggressive and therefore not the best fit for working with regulators in the underwriting position and not the best fit for the team work required in the florida market.in minnesota,met chose a person with more experience with the particularities of minnesota laws.for the illinois position,met chose a woman with less analytical skills but more experience with the illinois market,and a strength in homeowner product and pricing that was of special interest because met had acquired from paul a large book of homeowner business in illinois.
on october,chambers received formal written notice that he would be terminated from his position with paul on december,and he would not be hired by met.chambers was not given any relocation benefits in his severance package because the relocation benefit had been eliminated for leased employees when paul amended the plan in september of in connection with the sale and leasing arrangement with met.also,he was required to exercise all vested stock options within days of his termination.chambers filed a charge of age discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc and the minnesota department of human rights.the eeoc dismissed his claim and issued him a right to sue letter.
chambers then filed suit against paul and met asserting breach of contract,violation of minnesota law concerning unpaid bonus earnings,unjust enrichment,and age discrimination in violation of both federal and minnesota law.met and paul moved for summary judgment on all counts.see.c.the district court granted their motion for summary judgment,and chambers appeals the judgment on the claims of breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and age discrimination.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,construing the record in the light most favorable to the party.heisler metro.council,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the record show s that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also anderson liberty lobby,d.rule c mandates the entry of summary judgment,after adequate time for discovery and upon motion,against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.we look to the substantive law to determine whether an element is essential to a case,and o nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.anderson,at.
breach of contract 
chambers first asserts that paul breached the terms of his severance plan by not paying him relocation benefits.the district court concluded that this claim relates to an employee benefit plan and is therefore preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa codified as amended at and in scattered sections of.chambers argues against preemption asserting that the relocation benefit was not an employee benefit plan but simply a benefit triggered by a single event.the district court alternately concluded that even if there was no erisa preemption of the state law contract claim,the contract claim would fail on its merits.because we agree with the district court alternate conclusion,we need not address the erisa preemption issue.
an employee policy handbook may become enforceable as an employment contract in minnesota if it meets the requirements for the formation of a unilateral contract and is more definite than a mere statement of policy.elliott montgomery ward,cir discussing minnesota employment contract law.e mployers may modify the terms of contracts created by employee handbooks without great difficulty.feges perkins.an offeror of a unilateral contract always retains the power to modify or revoke the offer so long as the offeree has not begun performance,but retention of that power does not preclude the offer from becoming a contract once accepted by the offeree by tender of performance.id.
at the time of chambers initial relocation from florida to minnesota in the summer of,the plan in effect promised to pay him for a second relocation if he was terminated within months of the initial relocation.the plan was amended in march to provide relocation benefits if terminated within months of the initial relocation.the general information section of the march plan provides that paul reserves the right to change coverage and to otherwise change,amend,or even terminate the plans,in whole or in part,at any time.at.paul amended the plan again in september to deal specifically with the reduction in force due to the sale of its personal insurance operations to met.the september amendments preserved relocation benefits for employees who were terminated immediately due to the sale to met but eliminated the relocation benefit for those employees leased to met and terminated after the closing date of the sale october,and prior to january.
chambers was leased to met,and he received his written notice of termination on october,after the closing of the sale.the september plan was in effect at that time and provided that chambers was eligible for severance payments but no relocation benefits.we agree with the district court determination that even considering the employee handbook as a contract in this case,chambers was not entitled to relocation benefits under the terms of that agreement.
chambers argues that he was entitled to relocation benefits because he had already begun performance in reliance on that benefit,citing feges,at.the feges case is distinguishable.the employee in feges claimed the right to a certain disciplinary procedure that had been listed in the human resources policy manual since she was hired.the employer did not follow the procedure before terminating the plaintiff,claiming it was not bound by the manual because it had retained the power to modify it at will.the court rejected that argument and concluded that retention of the right to amend a handbook does not render it unenforceable and that the employer in that case was contractually obligated to provide the procedure in the manual because it had not exercised its right to amend it.feges,at.
in the present case,paul used its retained power to modify the severance plan,and the benefit chambers seeks is not available under the plan applicable to him.the september plan clearly states that it supersedes and replaces any preceding severance plan.chambers can not claim reliance on the plan in effect at the time he moved to minnesota because that plan provided relocation benefits only if he had been terminated within months of his initial relocation.chambers was not terminated within that period,and he took no action in reliance on the amended relocation benefit of the march plan.we see no reason not to apply to chambers the version of the plan in effect at the time of his termination notice,and under the express terms of that severance plan,chambers is not eligible for the relocation benefits he claims.
in addition to the severance plan,the paul employee benefits program booklet provides an incentive bonus plan and a stock ownership plan.the general information section of the booklet states that the employer may not terminate an employee in order to prevent the employee from obtaining a benefit under any of these plans.at.chambers asserts that there is a genuine dispute of fact over whether paul terminated him to prevent his stock options from vesting,to force him to exercise stock options when the market was severely depressed,and to cause him to lose his incentive bonus for the year.
assuming that the employee handbook amounts to an employment contract under minnesota law,there is no indication that chambers was terminated for the purpose of denying him benefits.to the contrary,he was terminated as a result of a legitimate reduction in force due to the sale of paul personal insurance operations.additionally,chambers was not entitled to an incentive bonus under the terms of the amended plan because he was not an employee at the end of the year as required for a payout under the incentive plan,and the terms of the plan did not provide him a prorated bonus.there is no evidence to suggest that paul terminated chambers in a bad faith attempt to deny him benefits.
unjust enrichment 
chambers asserts that if the employee handbook is not a contract,he should be allowed to pursue recovery of his losses under the theory of unjust enrichment.chambers asserts that where there is no full agreement concerning the details of his compensation,he should recover the reasonable value of his services,and that by selecting him for termination and refusing him his promised benefits,paul was unjustly enriched.we agree with the district court conclusion that paul could not have been unjustly enriched by denying him the benefits of relocation expenses,an incentive bonus,or adequate time for his stock options to fully vest where,as a matter of law,chambers was not entitled to those benefits.also,the district court correctly noted that chambers put forth no evidence that paul was enriched at all by compelling him to exercise his stock options at a time when the market price was low.see servicemaster of cloud gab bus,stating unjust enrichment requires a showing that the defendant knowingly obtained something of value for which the defendant in equity and good conscience should pay internal quotation marks omitted.we conclude that the district court appropriately granted summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim.
age discrimination 
chambers asserts that he established a prima facie case of age discrimination and a genuine issue of fact raising an inference of age discrimination to withstand summary judgment.the age discrimination in employment act adea,a,prohibits an employer from discriminating on the basis of age if that person is over years old.age discrimination claims under the minnesota human rights act mhra,are considered under the same analysis as claims under the adea.yates rexton,cir.because chambers did not offer direct evidence of discrimination,we consider this case under the familiar framework of the mcdonnell douglas order of proof and presumptions.mathes furniture brands int,cir internal quotation marks omitted see mcdonnell douglas green,d.this framework requires chambers to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination,at which point the employer must come forward with a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct.mathes,at.it then becomes the plaintiff burden to demonstrate that the nondiscriminatory reason offered by the employer was really a pretext for discrimination.chambers asserts his age discrimination claim against both paul and met.paul terminated him in connection with the reduction in force brought about by the sale of its personal insurance operations to met.chambers discrimination claim against met stems from its failure to hire him after the sale.we will consider each claim separately.
to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination resulting from paul reduction in force,chambers must show that he is years old or older,he was qualified for the job,he was discharged,and age was a factor in the employer decision to terminate him.yates,at.replacement by a younger person is ordinarily sufficient circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that age was a factor in the termination decision,but not in a reduction in workforce case where those duties either have been eliminated or must be redistributed within the employer remaining work force.id.instead,to meet the prima facie burden in the reduction in force context,the plaintiff must come forward with some additional evidence that age played a role in his termination.id.a plaintiff may meet the last requirement by presenting either statistical evidence such as a pattern of forced early retirement or failure to promote older employees or circumstantial evidence such as comments and practices that suggest a preference for younger employees.hanebrink brown shoe,cir.
chambers presented the additional evidence that he was one of fifteen employees terminated in his division as a result of paul reduction in force,and thirteen of the fifteen were over the age of.this does not raise an inference of discrimination because the entire personal insurance operation was sold,and paul terminated all persons employed in that area,regardless of age.his statistical evidence is meaningless without some analysis of the age of the entire workforce at paul before and after the reduction in force.see holley sanyo,cir decrease in number of people over in plaintiff division not evidence of age discrimination where the percentage of protected employees to total employees and the average workforce age increased eeoc mcdonnell douglas,cir noting that an important statistic in a reduction in force case is the difference in the percentage of older employees in the work force before and after the reduction in force.chambers has submitted no evidence to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination with regard to the reduction in force.
chambers also challenges met decision not to hire him as a pretext for age discriminatio
