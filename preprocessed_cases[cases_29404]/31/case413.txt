plaintiff debbie mccravy sued defendant metropolitan life insurance company metlife,alleging,among other things,breach of fiduciary duty,and seeking damages under the other appropriate equitable relief provision of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a.the district court granted mccravy summary judgment,but limited her damages to the return of her premiums.both parties appealed.we now affirm.
mccravy works for bank of america.as a employee,she participated in bank of america life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment ad d plan,which was issued and administered by metlife.the plan provided that an insured could purchase accidental death and dismemberment coverage for eligible dependent children.under the plan,mccravy elected to obtain such insurance coverage for her daughter leslie mccravy and paid premiums,which were accepted and retained by metlife.
in,while named as a covered dependent on mccravy insurance plan,leslie was murdered at the age of.mccravy,who was the beneficiary of the policy insuring her daughter,filed a claim for benefits.metlife denied mccravy claim on the grounds that leslie did not qualify for coverage under the plan eligible dependent children provision.
the plan defines eligible dependent children as children of the insured who are unmarried,dependent upon the insured for financial support,and either a under the age of or b under the age of if enrolled in school.according to metlife,because leslie was at the time of her death,she no longer fit the definition of eligible dependent children.as a result,metlife denied mccravy claim and attempted to refund the premiums retained to provide coverage for leslie.mccravy,however,refused to accept the refund check.
instead,mccravy filed suit in federal court in may,alleging that metlife actions constituted a breach of fiduciary duty under erisa,and seeking recovery under a or a.mccravy also alleged various claims under state law,including negligence,promissory estoppel,and breach of contract.in september,metlife filed a memorandum in support of preemption.with the parties agreement,the district court treated the filing as a motion to dismiss.
on june,the district court ruled that mccravy state law claims were preempted by erisa.regarding mccravy breach of fiduciary duty claim,the district court ruled that mccravy could not recover under a.mccravy does not challenge the district court ruling on the preemption of her state law claims or the disposition of her a claim.
as for mccravy claim under a,the district court ruled that,although mccravy was not entitled to recover full benefits under this provision,mccravy could recover the premiums withheld by metlife for coverage that she never actually had on the life of her daughter.the district court therefore denied metlife motion to dismiss mccravy a claim and invited the parties to conduct further discovery.
on june,mccravy moved for summary judgment regarding the improperly withheld premiums,and reserved the right to appeal the district court limitation of her recovery under a.on january,the district court entered a final order and judgment awarding mccravy the improperly withheld premiums mccravy appealed,and metlife.
mccravy first argues that a allows the remedy of surcharge,which would permit recovery of the life insurance proceeds lost by mccravy because of metlife breach of fiduciary duty.a provides that a civil action may be brought 
by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan 
a.this case concerns the scope of the equitable relief provision 
surcharge is defined as t he amount that a court may charge a fiduciary that has breached its duty.black law dictionary ed.mccravy alleges that surcharge encompasses the remedies provided by section of the restatement of trusts,including charging a trustee with a any loss or depreciation in value of the trust estate resulting from the breach of trust or b any profit made by him through the breach of trust or c any profit which would have accrued to the trust estate if there had been no breach of trust.restatement of trusts.mccravy portrays surcharge as having a distinctly restitutionary focus and functioning as a sanction.
in considering mccravy claim for restitution,we are guided by the supreme court opinion in mertens hewitt associates.the petitioners in mertens former employees of kaiser steel sued the respondent kaiser actuary,alleging breach of fiduciary and nonfiduciary duties.id.at.the supreme court recognized that s ince all relief available for breach of trust could be obtained from a court of equity,limiting the sort of relief obtainable under a to equitable relief in the sense of whatever relief a court of equity could provide in such a case would limit the relief not at all.id.at emphasis omitted.the court held that the phrase other equitable relief refers only to those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.id.at emphasis omitted.
the supreme court refined the mertens rule in great west life annuity ins.knudson.there,the court stated that whether restitution is legal or equitable depends on the basis for the plaintiff claim and the nature of the underlying remedies sought.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a plaintiff could seek restitution in equity,the court explained,when money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.id.the court therefore held that for restitution to lie in equity,the action generally must seek not to impose personal liability on the defendant,but to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant possession.id.at applying these principles,the court allowed a claim of equitable restitution to proceed in sereboff mid atlantic medical services,when mid atlantic sought specifically identifiable funds that were within the possession and control of the sereboffs.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
this circuit considered a similar issue in larue de wolff,boberg associates,cir,vacated.the plaintiff in larue alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to implement the investment strategy he selected for his employee retirement account.id.at.relying on a and a,the plaintiff sought recovery of the amount by which his account would have appreciated had defendants followed his instructions.id.at.after holding that the plaintiff claim under a failed,we addressed the scope of equitable relief available under a.id.at.we pointed out that the plaintiff did not allege that funds owed him were in the defendant possession,but sought essentially to impose personal liability on the defendant to pay a sum of money.id.at.in light of mertens and its progeny,we concluded that this remedy was not available under a.see also rego westvaco,cir rejecting plaintiff attempt to recover difference in value of mishandled benefit plan when defendants possessed no particular fund or property that can be clearly identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff.the supreme court vacated our decision in larue on the basis that the plaintiff had a remedy under a.larue,at.
here,mccravy contends that because the supreme court reversed larue,we are not bound by our decision regarding a that rejected an argument similar to the one she now makes.see eeoc city of norfolk police dep t,cir precedential effect of vacated decision is not at all clear.united states dep t of health human servs.flra,f d,cir adopting reasoning of vacated opinion where vacatur did not address the issue,but refusing to determine extent of precedential weight.we need not determine whether we are bound by our reasoning in larue because our consideration of the supreme court precedent upon which it relied leads us to the same conclusion.
