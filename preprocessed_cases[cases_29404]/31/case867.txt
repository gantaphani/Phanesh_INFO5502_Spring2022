kevin bock sued platinum technology,platinum and computer associates international,computer associates for breach of a severance pay agreement.the defendants removed the case to federal court,asserting that the agreement was part of an employee benefit plan under the employee retirement income security act of,et erisa.the district court found in favor of bock,and the defendants appeal.
platinum and computer associates are businesses that service computer networks and sell software.platinum employed bock as a salesperson from through.during that time,he repeatedly surpassed his sales quotas and was ultimately promoted to the executive position of senior vice president of sales.his compensation plan with platinum consisted of a base salary plus commissions he did not receive a yearly bonus.bock salary for was,and his commission from completed sales for was.bock testified that in,he was credited with million in revenue for the company.
in,platinum set up a severance pay program for its executives.an important purpose of the plan was to keep key employees working hard for platinum in the face of rumors of a corporate takeover by another company.under the agreement implementing the program,an employee covered by the program would receive severance benefits if his or her employment was terminated without good cause within two years of a corporate buyout.larry freedman,platinum general counsel,submitted the severance agreement carrying out the plan to employees for their acceptance and signature in fall.the severance agreement,as submitted to bock,provided that employees would receive aggregate severance pay consisting of a bonus amount added to twice the sum of their highest base salary plus their highest amount of incentive compensation.bonus amount was defined as the remaining portion of an employee expected yearly bonus.incentive compensation was undefined.bock signed the agreement in september.
computer associates acquired platinum in the spring of.as a result of the change in ownership,bock employment was terminated on june.platinum later notified bock that his severance benefits would consist of his base salary of.because bock earned no yearly bonus,he received nothing from the bonus amount portion of the severance plan.
bock sued to enforce the severance agreement as including commission income under the umbrella of incentive compensation.he sought summary judgment,contending that the agreement unambiguously entitled him to severance pay equal to two times his base salary and commissions.he also claimed that platinum was estopped to deny him additional severance pay,based on alleged oral representations about whether commissions were included in the severance pay calculation.
the district court,finding the term incentive compensation ambiguous,denied bock motion for summary judgment.then,after a bench trial,the court found that platinum board of directors,in adopting the severance plan,did not intend to include commission income in the incentive compensation portion of the severance agreement.this interpretation of the term incentive compensation,the court concluded,was a reasonable one.first,the court concluded that it was not unreasonable for the term incentive compensation to be a reference to bonus alone.second,it looked to the summary plan document to support the reasonableness of that interpretation.the summary states that the amount of the severance payment would be calculated using the sum of base salary and bonus in addition to making up a lost bonus opportunity.the summary does not mention commissions or incentive compensation at all.the district court,in addition,found that the company decision to exclude commissions was not effectively communicated to the affected employees.thus,bock and at least one other participant in the plan questioned freedman as to whether their commission income was included bock did so before signing the agreement.the district court concluded that freedman,who had directed that all questions regarding the plan be submitted to him,gave answers in response to these questions that suggested,but did not state explicitly,that commission income was included in the definition of incentive compensation.see tr.at.it thus found that platinum had violated its fiduciary duty to bock under erisa to clearly disclose that exclusion.consequently,the court reasoned,the defendants were estopped from denying payment of severance benefits that took bock commission into account when calculating severance pay.bock was awarded a total amount of,consisting of benefits he had been denied,interest and attorneys fees and costs.
platinum severance payment plan is governed by erisa and is properly subject to federal jurisdiction because it is an employee benefit plan,which the supreme court has defined as benefits whose provision by nature requires an ongoing administrative program to meet the employer obligations.fort halifax packing coyne,d.this does not mean,however,that the individual severance agreements are to be construed entirely under trust principles,as platinum argues.platinum seeks to accord great weight to its own alleged intent through application of the trust principle that the settlor intent governs the interpretation of a trust agreement.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d indicating the importance of the intent of the settlor in interpreting terms of trusts restatement third of trusts t erms of the trust means the manifestation of intention of the settlor.but we are dealing here with severance agreements,contractual in form,conferring benefits on the employer as well as the employee and quite distinguishable from vested benefits under a pension plan.see bidlack wheelabrator,cir en banc plurality opinion easterbrook,dissenting pensions vest by law health and other welfare benefits are left to contract.taylor continental group,cir but trust law can not be imported wholesale into the erisa context.severance plans are often similar to employment contracts,whose interpretation requires determining the intent of both contracting parties.
it has been uniformly held that general principles of contract the federal common law that guides interpretation of erisa to be applied to the interpretation of the language of such severance agreements.see anstett,cir the claim for separation benefits under this erisa plan is really a claim to enforce a contract citation omitted grun pneumo abex,cir we construe the severance compensation agreement in accordance with the federal common law under erisa and general rules of contract interpretation collins ralston purina,cir murphy keystone steel wire,cir hickey staley,cir taylor,at.
platinum argues that,because we are interpreting a plan under erisa,the intent of the plan settlor governs the interpretation of the terms of the severance agreement.for this proposition,platinum cites firestone,in which the supreme court determined,inter alia,the appropriate standard of review of benefit determinations under erisa.at.the court concluded there that,for actions under a b challenging benefit eligibility determinations,courts are guided by principles of trust law,which make a deferential standard of review appropriate when a trustee exercises discretionary powers.firestone,at.however,unlike eligibility determinations in which an administrator is given the power to construe uncertain terms,or where a plan terms give the administrator eligibility determinations deference,where instead no discretion has been conferred,other settled principles of trust law point to de novo review of benefit eligibility determinations based on plan interpretations id.at.the court concluded as they do with contractual provisions,courts construe terms in trust agreements without deferring to either party interpretation.id.at.firestone clearly fails to provide support for platinum position that the intent of the settlor governs in the matter before us.it says nothing about applying the law of trusts to interpretation of simple contractual agreements governed by severance agreements.
likewise,hickey provides no assistance to platinum.platinum argues that hickey,in which this court construed terms of a severance pay plan,demands that courts must rely on the intent of the plan creator.see hickey,at.but in that case,the plaintiffs failed to produce any evidence to refute the employer interpretation of the plan terms it was not the intent of the settlor,as such,that governed in opposition to some other intent.instead,there was no evidence of any other relevant intent in the case.see id.at.it is true that the opinion is peppered with language hinting that its task was to determine the intent of the plan,but the ultimate conclusion rested on what light of extrinsic evidence presented to explain an ambiguous term only one possible interpretation of the term participant.id.at.the question was whether the employer proposed interpretation of the plan language was unreasonably narrow in excluding the plaintiffs from the plan.there was no evidence of an employer secret intent that was not clear to the plan participants thus,the question was merely a matter of interpreting the employer intent as understood by anyone who read the language of the plan.hickey is further distinguished by the important fact that,as far as we can discern,the plan there was not submitted to the plaintiffs for was an employee welfare benefit plan but was not implemented by a contractual agreement.
thus,we proceed to evaluate the agreement under general contract principles,without giving special weight to the intent of either party.
the issue in construing bock severance agreement is whether the agreement included in its prescribed calculations the commissions that comprised a large part of bock total compensation.the answer to this question turns on the meaning of the term incentive compensation.bock claimed that the term included commissions.platinum said it meant bonus.the district court ruled that both platinum and bock proffered meanings of this term were reasonable and,since a contract term capable of more than one reasonable meaning is ambiguous,see central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund kroger,cir,the district court found that the severance agreement was ambiguous and the court turned to extrinsic evidence to establish meaning.the court concluded that in the context of the agreement the term incentive compensation was subject to more than one interpretation.
the district court erred in apparently finding intrinsic ambiguity in the language of the agreement.the term incentive compensation,which is the operative term,considered within the four corners of the severance agreement,is not ambiguous.the issue of ambiguity here revolves around whether the term incentive compensation includes or excludes commissions.since under no theory that has been advanced do commissions fail to share the characteristics common to all examples of the generic category,incentive compensation,we can perceive no ambiguity in the use of the latter term.ambiguity can be present only if it is reasonable to read incentive compensation as excluding commissions.there is nothing in the language of the agreement itself to make this a reasonable interpretation.
there is no evidence that the term incentive compensation had any special meaning to contradict its plain and ordinary meaning as reflected in the dictionary.platinum general counsel larry freedman testified that,as far as he knew,the term incentive compensation had no defined content in the software industry.tr.at.outside the context of the severance pay program,incentive compensation did not have a meaning for platinum either,freedman testified.tr.at.far from undermining the unambiguous meaning that we have found for the term,we think that this testimony merely establishes that incentive compensation is not some term of art requiring departure from the plain dictionary definition.
in fact,although some authorities have questioned the efficacy of recourse in many cases to dictionaries,see allan farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts at ed citing,inter alia,guiseppi walling,cir,concurring,the question here involves a plainly descriptive term that lends itself straightforwardly to dictionary definition.thus,compensation means payment for value received or service rendered.webster third new international dictionary.incentive means serving to encourage,rouse,or move to action.id.at.combining these two words means payments that serve to move the payee to increase his or her efforts or output.incentive compensation is thus an umbrella term that includes,at least as relevant here,commissions and bonuses.it may also include,for example,for industrial workers,piecework compensation.sales commissions are the paradigmatic form of incentive compensation for salespersons and,applying the plain and ordinary meaning of words,commissions would necessarily be included in incentive compensation unless commissions were expressly excluded.supporting the plain meaning of the term is the definition adopted by labor experts.the term systems has been defined as a method of relating wages directly to productivity,a piecework system,with a fixed payment for each unit produced.labor relations expediter bna.further,commission payments have been defined as a simple form of incentive practice in the distribution industries.id.
this determination is reinforced by the merger clause in the severance agreement.paragraph e of the agreement provides 
subject to the rights,benefits and obligations provided for under any executive compensation plan of the company,this agreement represents the entire agreement and understanding of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements except as set forth under any executive compensation plan.
in this connection,bock had a compensation plan that was revised on a yearly basis.the plan defined his compensation as a combination of base salary and incentives in the form of commissions.platinum argues that this does not demonstrate that under the plan incentive compensation included commissions because that term itself does not appear in the compensation plan.this may be correct,but his compensation plan is certainly consistent with the plain meaning we have ascribed to the term incentive compensation.
written contracts are presumptively complete in and of themselves when merger clauses are present,this presumption is even stronger.see heath son,v.at t info,cir the presence of a merger clause is strong evidence that the parties intended the writing to be the complete and exclusive agreement between them sunstream jet,international air serv,cir noting under illinois law that if the contract imports on its face to be a complete expression of the whole agreement,it is presumed that the parties introduced into it every material item,and parol evidence can not be admitted to add another term to the agreement quoting pecora szabo,d.
however,here we must find the term incentive compensation to be ambiguous based on extrinsic evidence,in spite of the merger clause.extrinsic evidence can,in some circumstances,be admissible to establish an ambiguity when it is objective and does not depend on the credibility of the testimony of an interested party.see mathews sears pension plan,cir.objective evidence is admissible to demonstrate that apparently clear contract language means something different from what it seems to mean am int l,graphic mgmt,cir.this is called the doctrine of extrinsic ambiguity,which allows the consideration of extrinsic evidence to demonstrate that although the contract looks clear,anyone who understood the context of its creation would understand that it does mean what it seems to mean.mathews,at citations omitted.
we do not mean to belittle the importance of the terms outlined in the original agreement.under the objective theory of contract,agreements are generally analyzed in terms of the objective plain and ordinary meaning of the terms they contain.see farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts ed farnsworth.this is the meaning that is ascribed to the promisor,and the meaning that creates an expectation in the promisee.judge learned hand has instructed 
it makes not the least difference whether a promisor actually intends that meaning which the law will impose upon his words.the whole house of bishops might satisfy us that he had intended so
