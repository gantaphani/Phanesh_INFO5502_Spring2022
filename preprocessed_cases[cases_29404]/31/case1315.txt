this appeal involves the scope of state law preemption under the employment retirement income security act of erisa.specifically,the case presents two questions whether erisa saving clause applies to alabama bad faith law,saving it from preemption by erisa and whether a sole shareholder of a corporation can be a beneficiary,within the meaning of.we hold that alabama bad faith law is not saved from preemption by the saving clause,and that a sole shareholder can be a beneficiary and thus is subject to erisa preemption.
a.the factual background 
the plaintiff,bill gilbert is sole shareholder of winfield monument company,a corporation which purchased a health insurance policy from alta health life insurance company alta.gilbert alta health life ins,d.because the insurance policy covered at least one other employee of winfield monument company,besides gilbert and his wife,there is no dispute that it constituted an erisa plan.id.in october,gilbert had gallbladder surgery,incurring medical bills of.id.he properly filed claims for coverage under the insurance policy.alta denied the claims in part,agreeing to pay only of the total bill,an amount it said was usual and customary.gilbert responded by filing suit in alabama state court against alta and alta parent company,life annuity insurance company.the complaint alleged fraud,breach of contract,and bad faith denial of an insurance claim gilbert sought both compensatory and punitive damages,tab,complaint at.upon receipt of the complaint,alta paid the medical bill in full.
alta removed the state action to federal court on grounds of diversity and subject matter jurisdiction.it then filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the state law claims are preempted by erisa.gilbert argued that his state law claims are not preempted because the sole shareholder of a corporation can not be a participant or a beneficiary,as defined by erisa,and thus is not subject to erisa regulation.in addition,he argued that erisa saving clause applies to alabama bad faith law,saving that claim from preemption.
the district court dismissed the case in part.it ruled that gilbert is a beneficiary of an erisa plan,and subject to erisa preemption.d at.it dismissed gilbert breach of contract and fraud claims,but found that alabama bad faith law escapes preemption under the saving clause.id.this interlocutory appeal was granted pursuant to b to resolve the questions of whether alabama bad faith law is preempted by erisa or saved from preemption by the saving clause,and whether gilbert is a beneficiary within the meaning of.
b.the statutory background 
erisa creates a comprehensive regulatory scheme for employee welfare benefit plans,including health insurance.section establishes a civil enforcement scheme for benefit plans subject to erisa regulation.only participants or beneficiaries of a plan are authorized to file lawsuits seeking benefits due under the plan.a b.
the term beneficiary is defined as a person designated by a participant or by the terms of an employee benefit plan,who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.a beneficiary is authorized to bring a civil suit to recover benefits due,and to enforce or clarify his rights under the terms of the plan.a.a beneficiary may also file suit seeking equitable relief to redress violations or to enforce provisions of erisa and of the benefits plan.a.
the causes of action and available remedies under the civil enforcement scheme are limited by erisa preemption clause,a,which provides that the terms of erisa generally supersede state laws affecting employee benefit plans.the clause states 
except as provided in subsection b of this section the saving clause,the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter iii of this chapter shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter related to any employee benefit plan 
a.the exception to preemption is contained in section b a,the saving clause,which exempts from preemption any state law which regulates insurance 
except as provided in subparagraph b the deemer clause,nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.
b a.therefore,for a person who is a participant or beneficiary of an erisa plan to have a cause of action,it must either be a cause of action specifically included in erisa itself,or a state cause of action created by a law saved from preemption by the saving clause.we turn first to the saving clause issue.
ii.discussion 
alabama bad faith law 
in pilot life ins.dedeaux,the supreme court ruled that mississippi law of bad faith was not saved from preemption by erisa saving clause,d.the case before us bears great similarity to pilot life.like the mississippi law,the alabama tort of bad faith refusal to pay insurance benefits,codified at,allows for the award of punitive extracontractual damages if an insurance company knowingly or maliciously refuses to pay a legitimate insurance claim.we must apply the test established in metropolitan life ins,d,employed in pilot life,and most recently described in unum life ins.of am.ward,d.
our inquiry begins with the intent of congress.pilot life,at.at.the saving clause does not stand alone rather,it is only one piece of an entire regulatory scheme.it is axiomatic that i n expounding a statute,we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.id.at.at quoting kelly robinson,d additional citations omitted.in particular,our understanding of the saving clause must be informed by the legislative intent concerning the civil enforcement provisions provided by erisa a,a.id.at.at.we must consider the role of the saving clause in erisa as a whole.id.at 
the supreme court found that congress clearly expressed an intent that the civil enforcement provisions of erisa a be the exclusive vehicle for actions by participants and beneficiaries asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits.pilot life,at.at.the court recently reiterated this when it stated that differing state regulations affecting an erisa plan system for processing claims and paying benefits impose precisely the burden that erisa preemption was intended to avoid.egelhoff egelhoff,d quoting fort halifax packing coyne,d.the civil enforcement scheme represents a careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans.pilot life,at.at.this balance would be completely undermined if remedies rejected by congress were available under state law.see also corporate health.of,cir erisa civil enforcement scheme preempts supplemental state law remedies.congress intent thus provides the backdrop for the saving clause test laid out in metropolitan life,which consists of two prongs whether,under a view,the law regulates insurance and whether the act factors support the assertion that the law regulates insurance.pilot life,at.at metropolitan life,at.at.
the view of the tort of bad faith refusal to pay 
to pass the first prong of the under a view the law regulates insurance a state law must be specifically directed toward the insurance industry,and not just have an impact on it.pilot life,at.at.to determine whether a law is specifically directed at the insurance industry,we look at whether the roots of the law are firmly planted in the general principles of the state tort and contract law,or whether the law sets forth a rule mandatory for insurance contracts,not a principle a court may pliably employ when the circumstances so warrant.ward,at.at pilot life,at.at see also corporate health,at a law is specifically directed toward the insurance industry when the state has developed a specific scheme governing insurance,as opposed to a flexible rule used in many legal contexts.
because there is virtually no distinction between the issue before us and that in pilot life,our analysis of the roots of alabama law is guided by pilot life and its progeny.we have ruled,in light of the decision in pilot life,that alabama tort of bad faith refusal to pay benefits has the same roots in the general principles of tort and contract law as was the case in pilot life.belasco wilson sons,cir quoting pilot life,at.at see also amos blue shield of,cir.this holding is binding upon us today 
the factors 
next we look at the three factors used to determine if a state law regulates the business of insurance under the act.these factors are guideposts,not separate essential elements.ward,at.at quoting cisneros unum life ins,cir.no one of them is necessarily determinative in itself,rather they are considerations that must be weighed.ward,at.at quoting union labor life ins.pireno,d.there are three criteria to consider whether the rule at issue has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder risk whether the rule is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insured and the insurer and whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry.ward,at.at pilot life,at.at metropolitan life,at.at.the similarity between the cases means that our analysis is again guided by pilot life.
the first factor looks to whether the state law has the effect of transferring or spreading policyholder risk.there is nothing that distinguishes alabama tort from mississippi law in this regard.thus pilot life directs us to the conclusion that there is no spreading of policyholder risk.pilot life,at.at.
similarly,the connection to the relationship is attenuated at best.id.at.at.the bad faith tort does not define the terms of the relationship.id.at.at.rather,like the mississippi law,it declares only that,whatever terms have been agreed upon in the insurance contract,a breach of that contract may in certain circumstances allow the policyholder to obtain punitive damages.id.
finally,the third the practice is limited to entities within the insurance for the same reasons that the view of the tort fails to prove it regulates insurance and for the same reason the mississippi law failed to satisfy this factor.the tort of bad faith refusal to pay benefits has developed from general principles of tort and contract law.see belasco,at.
therefore,at most,the alabama tort of bad faith refusal to pay benefits satisfies only one of the factors.even recognizing that n one of these criteria is necessarily determinative in itself,ward,at.at,it is significant that the alabama tort of bad faith satisfies less than one of these factors.more importantly,given that our analysis is to be informed by the exclusivity of the erisa civil enforcement scheme,there is no doubt that this is the proper outcome.alabama tort of bad faith refusal to pay benefits,like mississippi law,seeks a remedy for improper processing of claims that goes beyond the remedies and causes of actions authorized by erisa.as in pilot life,the most important consideration here is the clear expression of congressional intent that erisa civil enforcement scheme be exclusive.pilot life,at.at.the facts of this case are virtually identical to pilot life we are bound to hold that alabama tort of bad faith refusal to pay is not saved from preemption by erisa saving clause.
eleventh circuit precedent 
our earlier cases also dictate this outcome.we have held on more than one occasion,in precedent binding on this circuit,that the saving clause does not apply to this tort amos blue shield of,cir belasco,at.we also noted in amos that any change in the law course will have to be charted by the congress or the supreme court.at.
the district court,however,followed a decision from the northern district of alabama,hill blue cross blue shield of,d,which erroneously concluded that the supreme court decision in ward was in conflict with our prior precedent.reading footnotes and of ward in tandem,the court in hill concluded that the path was open to revisit the question of whether alabama tort of bad faith refusal to pay was specifically directed toward the insurance industry.we believe that the hill court rationale for revisiting the issue is flawed for several reasons.first,in addressing the extent to which the alabama tort is limited to or identified with the insurance industry,the hill court failed to examine the roots of the alabama tort.the hill court failed to recognize the binding precedent of belasco,which held the alabama law of bad faith appears to us to have the same roots in the general principles of tort and contract law as was the case in pilot life.at quoting pilot life,at.at.also,the hill court focused solely on the alabama cases that have refused to generally extend the tort of bad faith to the area of contract law,and failed to examine the roots of the alabama tort of bad faith which we held in belasco to be similar to the roots of the mississippi tort of bad faith involved in pilot life.see also note,supra.second,the hill court erroneously perceived footnote in ward as being in conflict with the eleventh circuit precedent involving the alabama tort of bad faith.however,we see nothing in ward that is inconsistent with our binding precedent,belasco and amos,or indeed with pilot life.in any event,it is clear from ward that the language upon which the hill court relied is dicta indeed,the ward opinion did not discuss the congressional intent that erisa enforcement provisions be exclusive because the state law rule involved in ward did not implicate the exclusivity of erisa enforcement scheme.
finally,and most importantly,the analysis conducted by the hill court was flawed because of its total failure to consider the clear expression of congressional intent that erisa civil enforcement scheme be exclusive.pilot life,at.at.unlike the state law rule at issue in ward,the alabama tort of bad faith at issue in hill and at issue in this case does implicate the exclusivity of erisa enforcement provisions in precisely the same manner as in pilot life.
conclusion 
guided by the supreme court precedent in pilot life and by our precedent in belasco,we hold that the view of the alabama tort at issue here is that it does not regulate insurance.indeed,there is virtually no distinction in this regard between the issue before us and that in pilot life.similarly,with respect to the three factors,there is no material distinction between the instant case and pilot life.and most importantly,our analysis is informed by the clear expression of congressional intent that erisa civil enforcement scheme be exclusive.pilot life,at.at.in this regard too,the instant case is indistinguishable from pilot life.accordingly,we conclude,as did the supreme court in pilot life,that gilbert state law tort claim is not saved by the saving clause,and thus is preempted by erisa.
sole shareholder as beneficiary 
gilbert argues that because he is the sole shareholder of winfield monument,he can not be a beneficiary of an erisa plan,within the meaning of.if he is correct,he then argues that the state law causes of action related to his insurance claims would not be subject to erisa preemption.
