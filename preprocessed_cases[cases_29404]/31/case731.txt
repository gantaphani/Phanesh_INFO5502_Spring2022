in,when he was years old,charles jenkins started working as a senior account consultant for pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc.his tenure with the company was cut short four years later when he ceased working due to hiv.in,he started receiving disability benefits under a pwc plan governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.after making payments for a decade,pwc had second thoughts.despite a terminal illness that kept him sidelined for more than years,more accurately,the plan administrator,connecticut general life insurance company cglic decided jenkins could do some work so it cut off his benefits.jenkins appeals from the district court order affirming that decision.
when hiv the virus that causes aids was first reported in the united states in the early,it was viewed as a death sentence,and a quick one at that.that was probably an exaggeration,but not a ridiculous one.see andrew sullivan,fighting the death sentence,times,at discussing the state of treatment and society view of the disease in the early years.without treatment,a person who is lives on average only years after infection.world health organization unaids,aids epidemic update,at december,available at.org pub epislides epiupda.but new medicines where available have slashed the death rate and raised the life expectancy of a diagnosed individual dramatically.a patient diagnosed at today can expect to live to nearly,research shows.at average age of diagnosis in the expectancy is over.jeremy laurance,new drugs raise life expectancy of hiv sufferers by years,the independent july.so,while hiv remains a grave no cure has yet been have improved.jenkins is hopefully benefitting from these advances 
jenkins tested positive for hiv in,but he did have serious problems until.by the end of the year,he was no longer able to work.his symptoms included extreme fatigue,lower extremity neuropathy nerve damage,decreased sensation in his fingers,bilateral manual dexterity limitations,and other opportunistic infections including condylomata genital warts,myositis muscle inflammation,and allergic rhinitis more commonly known as a runny nose.
jenkins filed a claim under pwc long term disability plan ltd plan,which was underwritten and administered by cglic.he alleged that he met the plan definition of total disability inability to perform one own occupation and,later,to perform any occupation within one qualifications and cglic agreed.beginning in june,cglic paid jenkins per month,or percent of his salary.when the social security administration awarded benefits on top of that,cglic reduced its monthly payments by an equal amount,meaning the net pay to jenkins remained the same.and when the total disability standard shifted in,cglic confirmed that jenkins could not work any job for which he was qualified,and so he continued to receive benefits without interruption.thus it went until january,when jenkins benefits were terminated.
for some reason,cglic decided to take a second look at jenkins claim beginning in late.the record does indicate what aroused cglic suspicions,but one possibility is that cglic got wind of the fact that jenkins went on a sojourn to london a year earlier,a venture arguably at odds with his medical limitations.the medical evidence up to that point supported jenkins claim.just before he stopped work in,jenkins met with an aids specialist,steven pounders,who concluded he suffered from significant fatigue and advanced hiv infection such that his current job was not sustainable.one month later,jenkins count was measured at just cells per microliter of blood anyone with a count lower than is considered to have aids by the centers for disease control and prevention.eileen schneider,et,revised surveillance case definitions for hiv infection among adults,adolescents,and children december,available at r.pounders diagnosed jenkins with aids shortly noting the development of anal fissures and increased determined that jenkins was incapable of even minimal sedentary activity.in fact,pounders concluded jenkins would never return to work of any kind.pounders maintained this position until he transferred jenkins case to david prelutsky,jenkins current treating physician,in.
prelutsky echoed the prior findings in a disability form submitted in april of,noting limitations in standing,walking,climbing,bending,lifting,and psychological functions.like pounders,prelutsky thought jenkins would never return to a trial period was out of the question.at the time,cglic basically agreed.in a internal assessment,cglic categorized jenkins situation as a stable and mature claim in that his condition was deteriorating with no chance of improvement 
five years later,though,cglic began to question that assessment.again,the timing suggests that the london trip may have been the impetus.cglic asked scott taylor to look into things and,after reviewing jenkins file and speaking with prelutsky,taylor concluded that there was not adequate clinical information or medical documentation to support the disability claim.taylor conceded that jenkins had a low count but emphasized that it was stable.further,taylor observed that the viral load was undetectable as of december,and he discounted jenkins complaints of fatigue and poor concentration for lack of objective evidence.
for the time being,nevertheless,cglic continued to pay jenkins his benefits.that would last long.in january,cglic had barry kern do an additional review.like taylor,kern did not meet with jenkins,but rather reviewed his medical records and spoke with prelutsky.kern observed that,although jenkins weight and count had fluctuated considerably over the years,he always weighed over pounds and his count had stabilized at about.kern concluded,from a functional perspective,the hiv would not prevent jenkins from performing full time light duty or sedentary work.
the next step was an independent medical examination ime performed by karen shockley shockley met with jenkins for an ime in june.jenkins described his medical history,explaining that in addition to fatigue and rectal pain,he suffered over the years from chronic bronchitis,sinus infections,and nausea.but in,he reported,his condition improved with new medication his count went up his viral count down.therefore,at the time of the ime,jenkins described his condition as stable.that did mean he was a picture of health.jenkins said he could predict his energy level from day to day he usually struggled through one to two hours of nausea in the morning of the time he could only manage sitting on the couch all day and only on good days could he tackle something like shopping for groceries.on the other hand,jenkins told shockley he could probably work an day,just not on a regular basis.
after a physical examination,shockley diagnosed jenkins with moderately advanced aids,recurrent sinusitis,recurrent bronchitis,hyperlipidemia,and degenerative joint disease.but in line with jenkins own view of things,shockley suggested that he could perform sedentary work for an work day.shockley doubted whether he could do this without frequent breaks or absences,but she concluded that he was at least fit to attempt employment 
prelutsky disagreed.he thought shockley overestimated jenkins abilities,in part because she ignored the possibility of another affliction flowing from his compromised immune,or inflammation of the muscles.prelutsky wrote 
i agree with shockley that it is uncertain if the patient can perform full time sedentary work for hours per week without frequent work breaks or work absences.in fact,it is more than uncertain,it is without a doubt.also,shockley did not address the patient other illness,his myositis.just because we do not have a diagnosis per a muscle biopsy,does not mean that the patient does not have myositis,which is characterized by muscle pain and weakness.i agree that his malaise and fatigue can not be objectively verified,however,his elevated muscle enzymes certainly go along with the diagnosis of myositis.
in light of all this,prelutsky stood by his opinion that jenkins could not perform a sedentary occupation.
but at this point prelutsky was in the minority.a rehabilitation speci
