lyn everhart appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of allmerica financial life insurance allmerica.she argues that the district court was incorrect in concluding that erisa barred her suit against allmerica,its employee benefit plan insurer.because everhart may not bring suit to recover benefits against allmerica in its capacity as a insurer under the applicable erisa provisions,we affirm.

charles everhart was a plan participant.in his enrollment form,he listed his annual salary as.although this sum reflected his annual base salary,he earned a great deal more in the last months of his life he earned in commissions,which averages out to an additional per year.thus,his average yearly salary,including commissions,was roughly.

an employee welfare benefit plan is a plan an employer establishes or maintains to provide benefits for its participants.the plan provides these benefits through the purchase of insurance or otherwise.
erisa allows participants or their beneficiaries to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to them under the terms of their plan,to enforce their rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify their rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.id.a b.however,a money judgment for an action brought under a b may be enforced only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in his individual capacity.id.d.
additionally,erisa a allows a beneficiary to bring a civil action to enjoin any act or practice which violates any erisa provision or to obtain other appropriate equitable relief.liability under a is not limited to the plan itself or its fiduciary.harris trust savings bank salomon smith barney,d holding that a authorizes suit against a nonfiduciary party in interest to a breach of fiduciary duty gibson prudential ins.of america,cir stating that insurance company that served as the plan agent but was not an erisa fiduciary can not be sued to recover benefits or for damages for breach of fiduciary duty,but an equitable remedy may have been available under a.everhart did not bring her suit under a.she brought this action against allmerica solely under a b.
we held in gelardi pertec computer,cir,that erisa permits suits under a b to recover benefits only against the plan as an entity.subsequent cases in this circuit have relied on gelardi to limit benefit suits to the plan.see gibson,at madden itt long term disability plan for salaried employees,cir holding that inclusion of employer was improper in an erisa suit to recover benefits.other circuits,quoting gelardi,also have held that the plan itself is the only proper defendant in a suit to recover benefits.see jass prudential health care plan,cir erisa permits suits to recover benefits only against the plan as an entity lee burkhart,cir same.
however,under another line of cases,in this circuit and others,claimants may also bring erisa actions to recover benefits against plan administrators.see taft equitable life assurance soc y,cir holding that t he beneficiary of an erisa plan may bring a civil action against a plan administrator to recover benefits under a b layes mead,cir permitting suit under a b against plan administrator but not employer garren john hancock mut.life ins,cir the proper party defendant in an action concerning erisa benefits is the party that controls administration of the plan.daniel eaton,cir holding that an employer is not a proper defendant in an action for benefits under erisa unless it is shown to control administration of a plan.these lines of cases are summarized in hall lhaco,cir.
because credence,and not allmerica,was the plan fact both parties freely need not determine which line of cases more accurately states the law appellant released all her claims against the plan and the plan administrator,and has limited her claim against allmerica to a suit under a b.under either gelardi or taft and their respective progeny,she may not sue the plan insurer for additional erisa plan benefits 
everhart argues that the pronouncements in our cases limiting actions for benefits to suits against the erisa plan itself apply only to plans,under which the plan acts as an insurer to provide the benefits guaranteed to participants.she contends that when a plan purchases benefits from an outside insurance carrier,as here,plan beneficiaries are entitled to sue the insurance carrier to enforce their rights,as beneficiaries,to collect promised benefits from the insurer.
in support of this argument,everhart cites forsyth humana,cir,aff,d.in forsyth,a group of employee beneficiaries under an erisa plan sued the insurance company providing health insurance for the plan.their suit,brought pursuant to a b,alleged the insurance company had negotiated a discounted treatment rate with a hospital but failed to pass along that discount to the plan beneficiaries in the form of lower charges.forsyth,at.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim against the insurer,and this court affirmed.id.at 
everhart contends that in forsyth the court allowed the action against the insurance company because it recognized that plan beneficiaries could sue to ensure that the insurance company would comply with its contractual obligations.thus,she argues that the court limited,sub silentio,gelardi s broad pronouncement that erisa permits suits to recover benefits only against the plan as an entity.gelardi,at.but there is another,simpler explanation in forsyth,humana,the insurance company,functioned as the plan administrator suit against humana was therefore consistent with taft interpretation of a b as encompassing suits against plan administrators.see taft,at.
the distinction everhart proposes,based on the type of plan at issue,is not compelling.nowhere does explicitly distinguish plan types or indicate that plans utilizing outside insurance carriers permit suits against third parties whereas plans do not.moreover,neither gelardi nor forsyth turns on this distinction.the statement in gelardi that erisa permits suits to recover benefits only against the plan as an entity provides no indication that the type of plan is determinative in confining proper suits to those against the plan.forsyth did not purport to distinguish gelardi when it allowed a a b suit against humana to proceed indeed,forsyth does not cite gelardi at all.it may or without taft in the definition of permissible suits under a b to include actions against plan administrators,but it did not create a new rule for allowable suits premised on the type of plan funding at issue.nor has everhart cited any other cases to us that turn on the distinction between plans and those that purchase insurance from an outside carrier 
we find no reason to depart from the established precedent of this circuit,and of every other circuit that has expressly considered the issue,that a b does not permit suits against a insurer to recover benefits when the insurer is not functioning as the plan administrator 
thus,we conclude that the district court properly rejected appellant suit.
for the reasons explained below,i respectfully dissent.the majority holds that everhart may not bring suit to recover benefits against allmerica in its capacity as a insurer under the applicable erisa provisions because a b does not permit suits against a insurer to recover benefits when the insurer is not functioning as a plan administrator.op.at.the majority,however,can point to no provision of erisa either limiting the parties that may be sued under the statute to erisa plans and administrators,or prohibiting suits against insurers.therefore,applying the reasoning of the supreme court in harris trust and savings bank salomon smith barney,there is no limit on the universe of proper defendants,d where the statute does not establish one.i simply can not agree with the majority determination to strip from everhart and other erisa plan beneficiaries and participants their rights under the statute to sue parties that may be liable for the payment of the benefits owed them.
erisa permits a participant or beneficiary to bring suit to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.the statute does not state,as the majority claims it does,that 
a money judgment for an action brought under a b may be enforced only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in his individual capacity.quoting id.d 
the majority incomplete quotation of the statute introduces a significant error into its reading.the statute actually states,in a section entitled status of employee benefit plan as an entity,that an erisa plan may sue or be sued as an entity,id.d,that service of process upon a trustee or administrator of an erisa plan constitutes service upon the plan,id.d,and that 
a ny money judgment under this subchapter against an employee benefit plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in his individual capacity under the subchapter.emphasis added id.d 
this provision clearly applies only to suits against erisa plans,and not to suits that may be brought against other parties under erisa.contrary to the majority implication,the provision does not limit the ability of participants or beneficiaries to bring actions against parties other than plans under a b or any other part of.it simply makes clear that when a party does sue a plan,any money judgment it receives against the plan can be enforced only against that plan as an entity,and not against any other person,with the exception noted.this prevents parties from suing the plan as an entity,and then attempting to enforce the judgment against the individual trustees or other individuals associated with the plan the clear import of d is to put erisa litigants on notice that to obtain and enforce a money judgment against any party other than a plan,they must sue that other party directly.true,there may be few others who can be said to owe them the benefits,and thus few others who may be liable to suit under a b,but as i explain below,insurers qualify.
similarly,the majority misreads our precedent in gelardi pertec computer,cir.the facts in gelardi were as follows the erisa plan was a plan,funded by the employer,pertec computer corporation pertec.self insurance programs self was a separate corporation hired by pertec to administer the plan.pertec employee benefits committee was the entity to which the plan administrator pertec had delegated authority to make the final review of denied claims.there was no insurer involved.gelardi attempted to sue her employer pertec and the administrator self of the plan.the gelardi court refused to permit suit against the employer or the administrator because neither,according to the operation of the plan,had discretionary control over the disposition of claims,nor were they fiduciaries.the committee had been delegated that control.the court language that gelardi must sue either the plan or the fiduciary must be taken within the context of the facts and circumstances of the case.what the gelardi court clearly meant was that,given the provisions of the plan at issue,gelardi could not sue her employer or the administrator the only parties gelardi could sue were the parties with the authority or obligation to determine or pay the plan and the fiduciary.the gelardi language relied on by the majority referred to an employee right to sue under the circumstances of the particular plan,and did not establish a general rule as to whom employees may sue under different circumstances.gelardi said nothing about the existence or absence of a right of erisa beneficiaries to sue insurance companies,let alone insurance companies that are legally responsible,by contract,for providing erisa benefits.
following gelardi,a split developed in this circuit over whether an erisa beneficiary could sue a insurer.two cases,gibson prudential ins,cir,and madden itt long term disability plan for salaried employees,cir,held,without reasoning,but citing gelardi,that erisa beneficiaries could sue only plans or fiduciaries of plans.three cases,forsyth humana,cir,aff,d,ward management analysis company employee disability benefit plan,cir,cisneros unum life insurance company of america,cir,affirmed the rights of erisa beneficiaries to sue insurers by permitting suits against such insurers to proceed.because of this split,the proper course for us to follow would be to request that the case be heard en banc because the majority declines to do so,i will explain here why,were we free to disregard the conflict and decide the case from scratch,i would hold that an erisa beneficiary may sue a insurer who is legally responsible,by contract,for the payment of erisa benefits.
the recovery of benefits provision of erisa permits participants or their beneficiaries to sue only to recover benefits.under this provision,plaintiffs are not permitted to receive punitive relief or damages.in this sense,recovery under the provision is akin to equitable relief ordering payment of unpaid benefits,and the court reasoning in the recent harris decision is particularly applicable.in harris,the court found that a,permitting equitable relief to redress a violation of the fiduciary duty to refrain from certain transactions with parties in interest,did not contain a limit on defendants because it was meant as a broad remedy of redress,and because the statutory provision expressed no limit on possible defendants.at.similarly,a b was intended as a broad remedy of redress,and contains no explicit limit on possible defendants therefore,no such limit should be read into it.for this reason,both parties that legally owe the benefits and parties that have the legal power to determine or pay those benefits because they administer them,are proper party defendants in an erisa suit under a b.
the extensive line of cases permitting suits against plan administrators supports the proposition that erisa does not limit a b suits to suits
