janny kerkhof and her former employer,mci worldcom,worldcom,from the district court judgment resolving several disputes about employee benefits claimed by kerkhof.kerkhof was hired in may as a program coordinator in the vienna,virginia,office of the telecommunications company mfs international,mfs,which later merged with worldcom.she then became eligible not only to receive salary bonuses of up to percent but also to participate in two employee stock benefit plans.
one plan,the mfs stock plan the mfs plan,which the parties here construe under virginia law,gave a compensation committee comprised of mfs board members power to award stock options to qualified employees.in september,kerkhof was granted mfs options whose terms were set forth in a separate stock option agreement executed by kerkhof and worldcom.that agreement specified the exercise price and provided for gradual vesting over a five year period.when mfs later merged with worldcom,the mfs options were converted into options for worldcom shares with a restated exercise price.
the other plan,known as the shareworks grant plan,allowed participants to have mfs shares valued at up to five percent of base salary placed in a retirement plan,see a.the shareworks grant plan was governed by erisa,et.supp.v.kerkhof elected to participate in this plan and in received a grant of mfs shares equal to worldcom shares plus a fraction after the merger.under plan terms,these shares vested only when kerkhof attained three years of service.
under both plans,an employee forfeited unvested options or shares upon voluntary resignation forfeiture was immediate under the stock option agreement and at the end of the calendar year under the shareworks grant plan.the shareworks grant plan qualified this by providing that unvested shares would immediately vest if the company terminated the plan.a second qualification,contained in both that plan and the stock option agreement,provided for immediate vesting upon constructive involuntary termination within two years after a change of control,the former phrase being expressly defined to include any of three events a material reduction in the employee compensation including applicable fringe benefits demotion or diminution in the employee authority,duties,or responsibilities without cause or involuntary relocation.
worldcom and mfs merged on december,comprising a change of control for mfs,and this was followed by changes both for kerkhof and for the plans.on april,kerkhof was told that she was being reassigned to a new position under a new supervisor,judy cody.that same month,the mfs plan was terminated.in may,worldcom eliminated its annual salary bonus program,under which kerkhof had received cash bonuses in the two prior years instead kerkhof was told she would receive a small annual holiday bonus and,later that year,a grant of worldcom options.at the same time worldcom also announced that no further contributions would be made under the shareworks grant plan,and on june it terminated the plan.
on june,kerkhof resigned and submitted a claim for accelerated vesting of all her existing but unvested stock benefits the stock options under the mfs plan that remained unvested out of the original and all of the shareworks grant plan shares just over,which were due to vest after three years of service.kerkhof claimed that her reassignment was a demotion comprising constructive involuntary termination.the compensation committee ruled otherwise and forfeited the unvested shares and options.
in april,kerkhof brought suit in federal district court in maine.excluding counts later dropped,the complaint contained three basic charges that kerkhof was entitled to vesting of her mfs plan stock options after having been constructively involuntarily terminated count that she was entitled to accelerated vesting of her shareworks grant plan shares for the same reason and,in addition,because worldcom terminated that plan in june,before the shares were forfeited at year end counts and and that she was due civil penalties for worldcom failure to provide specified benefits information described below counts and.
on cross motions,the magistrate judge recommended summary judgment in kerkhof favor on counts and the shareworks grant plan shares and in worldcom favor on counts and the civil penalties.on count the stock options,the magistrate judge recommended a trial because a factual dispute existed as to whether kerkhof pay or duties had been diminished after the change in control.the district court adopted the recommendations,but denied a judgment request by kerkhof to obtain class action status for her successful claim for the shareworks grant plan shares under counts and.
at the ensuing trial in october,the jury delivered a general verdict on count in kerkhof favor,and the parties stipulated to an award of.each side has appealed adverse rulings against it.importantly,worldcom has appealed on multiple grounds from the judgment based on the jury verdict in favor of kerkhof on count its brief also attacks the summary judgment for kerkhof on counts and,but as we shall see that is no longer a live issue.kerkhof seeks review of the district court denial of her motion for class certification on counts and and the summary judgment against her on counts and.
while these appeals were pending,worldcom concluded that kerkhof was entitled to vesting of her shares under the shareworks grant plan on a ground previously unnoticed by either party that kerkhof years of employment may,to june,satisfied the service requirement because the plan defines a year of service as any calendar year in which an employee attains at least hours of service each work week counting as hours.kerkhof crossed this threshold in all three years.because worldcom then vested the shares,both sides agree that the claims as to counts and are moot,but they disagree as to whether we should vacate the judgment below.
unvested stock options under the mfs plan.as to count,worldcom says that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the compensation committee denial of kerkhof claim was not arbitrary and capricious.this standard is normally used where an plan clearly gives the plan administrator discretion as to the issue in question.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.here,neither side argues that the mfs plan or the stock option agreement is governed by erisa,and we do not independently address the question.see mauldin worldcom,cir.
instead,worldcom argument is that it is entitled to the arbitrary and capricious standard under trust and contract principles.at trial,the district court rejected the argument.it ruled that the agreement was a integrated contract which neither contained,nor adopted by to the mfs plan,any grant conferring discretionary authority on the committee to resolve disputed claims.
worldcom initially relied on the arbitrary and capricious standard only as to the shares under the shareworks grant plan,which is subject to erisa.kerkhof now says that failure to include this argument in the answer as a defense to the mfs plan claims or to raise it until shortly before trial constitutes waiver under.c.see knapp shoes,sylvania shoe,cir whether the arbitrary and capricious standard in this context comprises an affirmative defense subject to rule c might be debated.see generally wright miller,federal practice procedure.since we agree with the district judge that the stock option agreement was a completely integrated contract,we bypass the waiver claim.
worldcom argument on the merits begins with the fact that the mfs plan contains a somewhat broad provision granting the committee plenary authority in its discretion,subject to the express provisions of the plan,to determine the terms of all benefits granted under the plan,including without limitation an array of listed matters.most of these are directed to the terms on which stock or options might be granted,price,vesting,number of shares but a phrase allows the committee to interpret the plan and to make all other determinations deemed advisable in the administration of the plan.
however,the plan also provides that each option grant shall be evidenced by a written agreement containing terms and conditions set by the committee.in this case,the stock option agreement issued to kerkhof,and executed by both sides,appears on its face to contain everything needed to comprise an ordinary stock option agreement.nothing in the agreement speaks of discretion residing in the committee nor does the agreement expressly adopt by cross reference any of the plan provisions nothing in the plan itself is inconsistent with treatment of the agreement as a completely integrated document.if treated as completely integrated,this would exclude evidence of any other prior or contemporaneous understanding that varied or added to the terms of the option agreement.high knob,allen,restatement second of contracts.
both sides assume that whether the stock option agreement is treated as completely integrated determines whether the mfs plan provision affording the committee discretion applies to disputes under the agreement.although this is not certain,it is at least plausible,and in the absence of argument on the point,we will hold the parties to this premise.however,extrinsic evidence is often admitted for the purpose of showing that a seemingly complete agreement is not so intended.restatement,supra,cmt.
here,even if the extrinsic evidence is considered,nothing in it is of great help to worldcom.for example,worldcom places weight on its claim which kerkhof disputes that a form cover letter accompanied the stock option agreement sent to kerkhof the form letter,according to worldcom,referred to the plan and appended a copy of it.but the reference merely says that to participate in the plan,kerkhof had to sign the stock option agreement.this is perfectly consistent with the view that the agreement is a free standing obligation 
there is nothing odd in making decisions to grant options discretionary while embodying the grant itself in an independent contract.further,both documents in this case were drafted by the employer and it would have been easy to include a clause in the agreement giving the committee discretion or adopting the plan discretionary authority by cross reference.the district court properly treated the agreement as a completely integrated contract under ordinary rules of contract interpretation 
we turn next to a second issue of contract interpretation.kerkhof,it will be remembered,based her claim to immediate vesting under the stock option agreement on constructive involuntary termination,defined by the agreement to include inter alia material reduction in compensation or demotion or diminution in responsibilities.worldcom says that kerkhof had to show not only that one of these two events occurred but that kerkhof resignation was subjectively motivated by it.
the district court disagreed,concluding that if either event occurred,vesting was required even if the employee would have left anyway for other reasons.based on this reading,the district judge excluded substantial evidence proffered by worldcom that kerkhof planned to move to maine in the same time frame and therefore necessarily would have resigned regardless of any change in pay or duties.if kerkhof was required to prove causation,worldcom at the very least would be entitled to a new trial.
worldcom relies heavily on the word involuntary in the phrase constructive involuntary termination,saying that every term in a contract should be given meaning.see ames am.bank of portsmouth,restatement,supra,a.it also cites to a q a document,distributed by management shortly before the merger,which says the accelerated vesting clause would be triggered if the participant actually terminate d employment on account of a listed occurrence.worldcom might have added that,from the standpoint of purpose,immediate vesting is something of a windfall if the employee planned to resign anyway.
yet the quoted phrase expressly includes the list of three events without any further suggestion that causation need be shown the vesting provision then says that if a change of control occurs,and the employee subsequent constructive involuntary termination occurs within two years thereafter,the full number of the option shares shall immediately vest.it is hard to give much weight to a summary created well after kerkhof agreement was executed.see allen green.further,while causation is a staple of tort claims,contracts often contain provisions,liquidated damages to provide clear demarcations or simplify administration.in change of control provisions,it eases administration,and gives the employee more protection,to make the occurrence conclusive without a separate inquiry into employee motive.
on our facts the proper reading is debatable but absent disputed,admissible extrinsic evidence,interpretation is appropriately resolved by the court.torres vargas santiago cummings,cir.neither side offers any precedent closely in point and neither set of interpretive arguments is conclusive.under these circumstances,we think that the district court reading can fairly be justified,partly by literal language and partly by the canon that contracts of this sort are construed against the drafter,who could easily have included language to resolve the matter.see martin martin,bradley,
ranked in order of importance,worldcom next argument is that kerkhof claim of reduction in compensation should have been taken from the jury as a matter of law because the evidence introduced to support it was inadequate and,as a result,that a new trial should be granted solely on the issue of diminution in duties.this claim of error rests on the fact that kerkhof offered no evidence as to the value of the options that worldcom said it would substitute,along with an annual holiday bonus,when it abolished the salary bonus regime in may.
kerkhof says that we should apply the supreme court rule in criminal cases and uphold the verdict on the ground that the evidence was sufficient on another ground also available to the jury the rationale is that the jury can by common sense alone recognize insufficient evidence and should be presumed to have done so.see griffin united states,d.here,worldcom does not dispute that the evidence permitted a rational jury to find a reduction in kerkhof duties.
although it is not easy to explain the discrepancy,the supreme court has not used the same presumption in civil cases.instead,the general rule,adopted by this circuit,is that a new trial is usually warranted if evidence is insufficient with respect to any one of multiple claims covered by a general verdict.wilmington star mining fulton.maryland baldwin.lattimore polaroid,cir 
at first blush,worldcom evidentiary claim looks plausible kerkhof had the burden of proof,and one might think that her failure to offer evidence of value of a seemingly significant number of stock worldcom side of the before versus after doom the comparison.we think that kerkhof argument on the options were irrelevant because kerkhof never received remarkably unpersuasive.in comparing pre and compensation,what kerkhof would have gotten if she had stayed is plainly relevant.
the district court refused to withdraw the compensation issue from the jury for a related but different reason that could be justified in theory,namely,that the evidence did not compel the jury to find that kerkhof would have received the grant of options.but kerkhof does not repeat this defense,and more important,does not provide us with any record references that would support needed since the document announcing the grant appears unqualified.
yet the issue is more complicated than it seems.although kerkhof received a modest increase in salary after the merger from in to in,before her departure the company eliminated or announced the elimination of three continuing plans,over and above salary,that had substantially benefitted kerkhof in the past the mfs plan under which she had received stock options in september the shareworks grant plan under which she had received stock shares worth in and the annual bonus program under which she had received and out of a possible bonus of percent of annual salary in and,respectively.
by contrast,the proposed grant of options was described as a bonus.whether there wa
