unum life insurance company of america unum appeals the district court award of disability benefits and attorneys fees to ellen lain lain.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
lain is a former partner in the law firm of schlanger,mills,macer grossberg schlanger in houston,texas.she specialized in real estate,banking,and finance law.in late,lain began to suffer severe chest pains and on november,she sought treatment from john bergland bergland,an internist.in january of,bergland,noting that lain was having chest problems day and night,prescribed inderol,which lain contends did not alleviate her chest pains.the following month,lain consulted patrick cook cook,a cardiologist.cook reported that lain chest pains had progressed and could last from seconds to hours.shortly thereafter,on march,lain consulted philip bentlif bentlif,a gastroenterologist,who administered an endoscopy of lain esophagus.the test revealed that lain esophagus had normal epithelium,the lining of her esophagus appeared normal and not damaged by stomach acid,but her esophagus had disordered motility thus,bentlif recommend a esophageal motility study.
on march,conducted a esophageal motility study on lain at luke episcopal hospital in houston.reported that the motility study was normal,but that lain peristaltic contractions were top normal with an amplitude of mm hg and several of the contractions were greater than mm hg 
in april of,lain visited ira klein klein,another specialist in gastroenterology.klein,finding that lain suffered from severe chest pains,prescribed procardia and tofranil.subsequently,klein discontinued the use of procardia,because lain believed it was making her symptoms worse,and increased her dosage of tofranil.on august,lain returned to bentlif,who,after reviewing the results of the esophageal motility test,diagnosed her condition as esophageal motor dysfunction,a form of esophageal motility disorder,and prescribed valium and nitrostat.
by november,lain condition had progressed and she complained that the medication prescribed was not effective.as a result,lain visited the mayo clinic in rochester,minnesota where she was examined by michael and hughes hughes.they discovered that lain also suffered from hiatal hernia and prescribed prilosec.on april,bentlif diagnosed lain with zenker diverticulum and gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd.he then started lain on an program,including a prescription for axid.the following month,lain contacted bentlif and reported that the axid was not effective.
in july of,lain visited david axelrad axelrad,a psychiatrist,who diagnosed her with p ain disorder associated with psychological factors and general medical condition,and major depressive disorder secondary to chronic pain syndrome.axelrad prescribed zoloft and desyrel.
sometime in or,schlanger selected unum as the firm disability insurance carrier.unum issued legal services group insurance trust policy the policy for the employees of schlanger,effective january.on april,lain stopped working with schlanger due to her deteriorating condition,and on july,she filed a disability claim under the policy.lain alleged that she was unable to work due to severe chest pains,esophagus motility disorder,and esophagal spasms.
along with her claim,lain submitted a physician statement written by bentlif,which stated lain symptoms were substernal pain his objective findings were esophageal motility disorder and reflux the symptoms first appeared in late bentlif had first seen lain on march,he believed that lain was first unable to work on april,lain saw him every two to three months lain medical condition was such that she could not do normal legal professional work and his prognosis for recovery was hopeful after a period of time.lain also submitted a statement from schlanger stating that lain stopped work on april,due to illness 
steven feagon feagon,one of unum staff physicians,reviewed lain file.feagon reported that g iven what unum had,he could neither validate nor refute the claimant subjective pain complaints though the consistency across multiple providers and the presentation of pyscho logical eval uations suggest a real ongoing problem.feagon also stated that he did not believe unum would be able to refute,with an independent examination,the findings of bentlif and axelrad regarding lain impairment.id.
nonetheless,on november,unum denied lain claim.it gave four reasons for the denial the doctors description of her restrictions and limitations was insufficient to support a finding of disability lain was able to retain bodily nourishment,and she had not produced any evidence of persistent anemia she had not been receiving regular ongoing treatment for her condition and there was no evidence of a severe mental condition that would have prevented her from performing her job duties at the time she stopped working.
on december,lain received notice of the denial of her claim.because unum acted as both the insurer and the employee retirement income security act erisa administrator of the policy,lain sent a letter to unum appealing the decision.thereafter,carolyn jackson jackson,another one of unum staff physicians,reviewed lain file and determined that lain intermittent symptoms were not frequent or severe enough to prevent her from working.on february,the day after jackson made her recommendation,unum sent a letter to lain rejecting her appeal.however,unum stated that it would submit lain file to unum home office for further review.after lain file was reviewed for the third time,unum finally denied her appeal for the following reasons the medical restrictions assigned to her did not support disability the objective test results performed by bentlif and the mayo clinic were normal and lain was not under psychiatric care when she ceased active employment.
lain filed suit against unum in state court and unum removed the action to federal district court asserting that erisa preempted lain state law claims.it also filed a counterclaim for attorneys fees.thereafter,lain filed an amended complaint asserting seven causes of action breach of contract,equitable or promissory estoppel,fraud and intentional misrepresentation,violation of the texas deceptive trade practices act,violation of article of the texas insurance code,breach of fiduciary duty and duty of good faith and fair dealing,and in the event that her claims are preempted,she asserted denial of benefits and breach of fiduciary duty under erisa.
subsequently,lain filed a motion for partial summary judgment asking the district court to declare that erisa did not preempt her claims against unum and unum filed a motion to strike lain jury demand.the district court found that lain state law claims related to an plan and were therefore preempted.it also denied lain demand for trial by jury.at the conclusion of trial,the district court held that lain was disabled within the meaning of the policy and awarded benefits from april,to the date of final judgment.the district court also awarded lain attorneys fees this appeal followed.
standard of review 
an administrator denial of benefits under an erisa plan is reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d citation omitted.because the language in the policy does not give unum such discretion,we apply the de novo standard of review.however,unum factual determinations during the course of lain benefit proceeding are reviewed for abuse of discretion.estate of bratton nat.l union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir.when applying the abuse of discretion standard,we analy ze whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily or capriciously.sweatman commercial union ins,cir quoting salley dupont de nemours,cir.a decision is arbitrary when made without a rational connection between the known facts and the decision or between the found facts and the evidence.bellaire hosp.blue cross blue shield of,cir.an administrator decision to deny benefits must be based on evidence,even if disputable,that clearly supports the basis for its denial.vega life ins,cir.we must find that w ithout some concrete evidence in the administrative record that supports the denial of the claim,the administrator abused its discretion.id.at emphasis added.

in the instant case,the district court held that unum had an inherent conflict of interest because it was both the insurer and the plan administrator,which determined whether to pay claims under the policy.accordingly,the district court found that unum decision to deny lain claim was subject to a modicum less deference.id.unum argues that the district court erred in allowing unum only a moderate or medium amount of deference on the sliding scale.we are not required to apply the vega sliding scale analysis to this case because we agree with the district court that g iven the overwhelming evidence of lain disability and the absence of any concrete evidence to the contrary,the decision in this case would not be different even if unum factual determination s were entitled to all but a modicum of deference.

discussion 
disability 
in assessing whether to grant or deny benefits,an administrator must make two determinations.first,he must determine the facts underlying the claim presented and then he must determine whether the facts establish a claim to be honored under the terms of the policy.schadler anthem life ins,cir.in the instant case,unum argues that,based on the established facts,lain is not disabled as defined under the policy.
the policy provides 
disability and disabled mean that because of injury or sickness 
the insured can not perform each of the material duties of her regular occupation or 
the insured,while unable to perform all of the material duties of her regular occupation on a basis,is 
performing at least one of the material duties of her regular occupation or another occupation on a or basis and 
earning currently at least less per month than her indexed earnings due to that same sickness or injury.
note for attorneys,regular occupation means the speciality in the practice of law which the insured was practicing just prior to the date the disability started.emphasis added.
unum asserts that lain is not disabled under the of the definition of disability because she has failed to present any evidence that she was unable to perform all of her material duties as an attorney there is no dispute that lain attempted to practice law while she sought treatment.lain initially began seeking treatment in november of,but did not completely stop working until april.unum avers that there is no better evidence that lain was able to perform at least one or more of her material duties than the fact that she worked while undergoing treatment for chest pains.
further,unum maintains that there is a complete absence in the record of any objective medical evidence of an illness rendering lain unable to practice law in her specialized field.it notes that lain was tested extensively,but all of the tests were essentially normal.accordingly,unum concludes that lain is not disabled under the definition set forth in the policy and the district court erred in awarding her benefits.
this circuit applies a test when reviewing an administrator denial of benefits.first,we determine the legally correct interpretation of the policy.tolson avondale,cir.if it is found that the administrator failed to give the plan the legally correct interpretation,this court must then determine whether the administrator decision was an abuse of discretion.id.
a.the legally correct interpretation 
in ascertaining the legally correct interpretation of the policy,we must consider whether a uniform construction of the policy has been given by the administrator,whether the interpretation is fair and reasonable,and whether unanticipated costs will result from a different interpretation of the policy.gosselink am,cir citing wildbur arco chem,cir.
in the instant case,there has been no allegation or evidence as to whether unum gave the policy a uniform construction.the only potential unanticipated cost resulting from a different interpretation of the policy would be that unum will have to pay benefits to lain and possibly other employees or former employees eligible prior to early the crucial issue in this case is whether unum interpretation of the policy is fair and reasonable.under the policy,an employee is eligible for disability benefits if that employee meets the definition of disability,which in this case means that because of injury or sickness the insured can not perform each of the material duties of her regular occupation.emphasis added.
in a seven page letter of appeal,lain explained that her regular occupation requires the ability to concentrate mentally for long periods of time on complex and detailed factual and legal matters involving significant real estate transactions for clients.lain maintained that her chest pains were so severe that she was unable to concentrate,think,and act in a manner necessary to perform each of the material duties of her regular occupation.as a result of her severe chest pains,bentlif reported that lain ability to work was limited and she was unable to perform normal legal work,and thus,could not practice law.also,axelrad documented that lain was unable to work because of chronic pain sydrome,which interfered with her cognitive activity.
in denying lain appeal,bruce dominick dominick,a senior benefit analyst at unum,testified that he interpreted the of the definition of disability as requiring lain to be unable to perform all of her material duties before she would be considered disabled.this is contrary to the plain language of the policy and to unum interpretation of the same definition in other cases.
a fair reading of the policy supports the view that in order to be considered disabled,an insured must be unable to perform only a single material duty of her occupation.in fact,one of unum own disability benefits specialist,gayle harrison bledsoe bledsoe,who reviewed lain claim on the first level,admitted that this is the way that the policy is interpreted further,unum has previously interpreted the policy in other cases containing a similar definition of disability as requiring a person to be unable to perform only a single material duty of her regular occupation before she is disabled and entitled to benefits.see also dishman unum life ins.of,jsl,wl,at.may,when interpreting an unum policy containing language similar to the language of the policy in this case,the court held that t he disability and partial disability provisions of the policy,read together,evidence the fact that an employee is disabled if there is a single material duty of her occupation which she can not perform.
furthermore,even assuming the definition is ambiguous,under texas law it is that ambiguities in insurance policies are construed against the insurer.jarvis christian coll.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir.accordingly,dominick incorrectly interpreted the terms of the policy and held lain to a higher standard by requiring her to prove that she was unable to perform all of the m
