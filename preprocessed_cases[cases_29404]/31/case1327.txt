this case concerns a transfer of money from the prudential life insurance company to the national education association members insurance trust nea trust when prudential converted from a mutual life insurance the insured mutually own the a stock life insurance company.on appeal from the dismissal of the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,the trustees of the estate of philip stewart stewart contend that he is entitled to benefit from the demutualization.stewart maintains that the district court erred in ruling that the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,applied to the nea insurance benefit plan and,alternatively,that he failed to state a cause of action under erisa for benefits and for breach of fiduciary duty.in view of the allegations in the amended complaint,stewart is estopped from arguing that erisa does not apply to the nea insurance benefit plan.further,stewart identifies no term of the group contract that entitles him to receive the demutualization proceeds,which represent the capitalization of future dividends,as a benefit.additionally,because stewart does not allege that he was entitled to the demutualization proceeds as a dividend,but only that no provision in the group contract allowed the nea trust to take control of the insureds alleged equity interest in the demutualization proceeds,he can not show that the nea or nea trust collectively,the nea breached a fiduciary duty under erisa.accordingly,we affirm.
the nea is a national organization of education professionals.in,it established a members insurance plan plan to operate voluntary programs providing benefits in the event of a death,accident,sickness,disability,or other occurrence affecting participants or their families,either through the benefits or by buying group insurance policies.at the same time,the nea set up the nea trust to hold the plan assets.the plan is governed by a plan document and the trust is governed by a trust agreement.the nea trust entered into a group life insurance contract group contract with prudential to provide insurance to participating nea members.the group contract incorporates a group insurance certificate and individual applications and provides that the nea trust is the contract holder.
nea members are eligible for life and accident insurance coverage under the group contract,subject to approval by prudential.under the terms of the group contract,prudential fixes the premium amount,which the pays to the nea trust,which in turn makes a group payment equal to the sum of those premiums to prudential.claims are submitted directly to prudential.in recognition of the ownership stake of prudential policyholders,the group contract further provides that prudential will determine the share,if any,of its divisible surplus allocable to the group contract as of each contract anniversary.at some point,prudential maintained separate accounts for each,crediting paid up life insurance with a cash surrender value to each account.the group contract gave the right to obtain an individual insurance contract if the group contract was terminated.
in december,prudential approved a plan to convert from mutual ownership to stock ownership.the reorganization plan was approved by the state of new jersey,where prudential is domiciled.see plan of reorganization of the prudential ins,order no.dep t of banking ins.when the conversion occurred on december,prudential mutual insurance policies were converted to policies in the name of the new stock company.at this time,prudential transferred to the nea trust million in demutualization proceeds,which stewart describes as the residual value of prior premium payments.appellants br.at.the nea trust treated the demutualization proceeds as a general plan asset to be used for the benefit of all plan participants,regardless of whether they participated in the prudential group contract.because the plan documents did not specifically refer to the treatment of demutualization proceeds,the nea amended the plan document to specify how such a transfer of money was to be treated.
stewart sued the nea in a putative class action on behalf of other in the same prudential life insurance program sponsored by the nea.stewart basic claim was that the demutualization proceeds constituted the share of prudential attributable to premiums from group contract participants and that the nea trust accordingly was required to distribute the funds to the individual or to segregate the funds for their benefit.the nea trust had treated the funds as plan assets that could be used for the benefit of plan members not participating in the group contract.stewart also claimed that the demutualization terminated the preexisting policies,triggering privilege to convert their group contract certificates to individual insurance contracts.in the alternative,stewart alleged claims under erisa,federal common law,and state law.appended to the amended complaint were the group contract,the group insurance certificate,the individual contract enrollment form and certificates,the plan document with its amendment,and the trust agreement.upon the nea motion,the district court dismissed all of stewart claims,ruling that erisa applied and preempted the six claims and that stewart failed to state a claim under erisa.stewart educ.ass n,d.stewart appeals the dismissal of the two erisa and the counts.
erisa sets out an interlocking,interrelated,and interdependent remedial scheme.mut.life ins.russell,d,for violations of its substantive regulatory requirements relating to employee benefit plans.when erisa applies,it supersede s any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.the district court found that it was factually undeniable that the group contract and the plan are employee welfare benefit plans within the meaning of erisa and that each of stewart causes of action relate d to the plan such that they were preempted by erisa federal causes of action.stewart,d at.on appeal,stewart challenges whether his pleadings require the conclusion that the group contract is an employee benefit plan covered by erisa.he does not challenge whether the causes of action relate to those plans.
we review de novo both the district court statutory interpretation,see kaseman district of columbia,and its dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a cause of action,see barr clinton.of course,a complaint should not be dismissed unless the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle the plaintiff to relief,see conley gibson,d,construing the complaint liberally in the plaintiff favor with the benefit of all reasonable inferences derived from the facts alleged,see kowal mci commc ns.but the court need not accept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.id.in determining whether a complaint states a claim,the court may consider the facts alleged in the complaint,documents attached thereto or incorporated therein,and matters of which it may take judicial notice.see eeoc francis xavier parochial.
erisa shall apply to any employee benefit plan if it is established or maintained by any employee organization or organizations representing employees.a.the terms employee welfare benefit plan and welfare plan mean any plan,fund,or program established or maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries,through the purchase of insurance or otherwise benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment id.stewart complaint,on its face,places the plan,and the group contract,within erisa ambit.he alleges that the nea is an organization representing school teachers,that the nea established the members insurance plan of which the group contract is part,and that the nea was an administrator of the plan.this ends the matter,as the district court concluded,because stewart has affirmatively pleaded the precise legal conclusions he must avoid for coverage under erisa and has incorporated these allegations into each of his claims.similarly,because stewart has pleaded the statutory requirements for an employee welfare benefit plan,he is estopped from relyi
