tracy marks appeals from an order of the district court denying her the benefits from a k plan of alliant techsystems,which her former stepfather james marier had maintained.tracy and james mother,rose marier,made competing claims for the benefits following james death.the plan initially determined that tracy was entitled to the benefits,but,after rose appealed,it filed this interpleader action to determine the correct beneficiary.the district court granted summary judgment and awarded the proceeds of the plan to rose.tracy appeals the order of summary judgment,and we reverse.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to tracy in this review of the order of summary judgment entered against her.johnson v.at t,cir.james marier was married to kathleen marier for twelve years and developed a close relationship to kathleen adult daughter,tracy marks,both during the marriage and after the divorce.james and tracy treated each other as father and daughter,as he had no children and she had no father.tracy children called james grandpa jim,and he spent holidays with kathleen and tracy family.tracy had often accompanied james to medical appointments when his health declined,and she watched over his care.james executed a power of attorney in favor of tracy in,and he named her as personal representative of his will in and.
james cared for his widowed mother,rose,by looking after her financial affairs and making periodic trips from his home in minnesota to her home in pittsburgh to check on her.rose has been adjudicated incapacitated,and the irwin bank has been appointed guardian of her estate.the record suggests that she has considerable assets.james also had three siblings,but he was not close to them.indeed,the record suggests that there was significant tension between tracy and james siblings.when james became ill,kathleen and tracy notified his brother and sisters.they declined to visit at that time,but the sisters did come to minnesota in november at james request to discuss his financial affairs.before this meeting,james had decided to remove his siblings from his will and to name tracy as his sole residuary beneficiary.stating that he was not unmindful of rose and his siblings,he executed a will to that effect in september.at the family meeting in november,james sisters learned that he had named tracy as the beneficiary of his estate,and the meeting ended badly.afterwards,james wrote a letter to james attorney suggesting that james should revoke tracy general power of attorney and make sure any inheritance he might receive from rose would stay in the marier family.to placate his siblings concerns,james executed a new will in january that increased the specific bequests to his nieces and nephews.
for most of his career,james worked as an engineer at honeywell.although the record does not indicate how the corporate change occurred,james later became employed by alliant techsystems,without changing jobs.james participated in alliant k plan,a retirement savings plan governed by erisa.alliant is both the sponsor and the administrator of the plan.the plan documents gave james,as a participant,the specific right to designate a beneficiary and the exclusive right to change or revoke earlier beneficiary designations.the plan provides that a beneficiary designation becomes effective when executed by the participant and received by the plan.the plan specifies that it will give effect to any designation of a nonspouse beneficiary by name that is accompanied by a description of the beneficiary relationship to the participant,even if that relationship does not exist at the time of execution or distribution.fidelity investments performed functions for alliant plan.
in,james completed a beneficiary designation form naming his kathleen as the primary beneficiary of his k plan and his stepdaughter tracy as his secondary beneficiary,listing her relationship as.after james and kathleen divorced in,james submitted a new beneficiary designation form designating his mother rose as the primary beneficiary and again listing tracy as his secondary beneficiary,describing her relationship as former stepdaughter.on september,james submitted a third beneficiary designation form,this time listing tracy as the primary beneficiary.james did not name a secondary beneficiary.he completed all parts of the third form except the blank for the beneficiary relationship to him.it appeared that he may have written something in that space and then whited it out before submitting it.
in october,james had surgery to remove a brain tumor.on october while james was still hospitalized,fidelity returned the third beneficiary designation form to him with a corrections checklist instructing him to complete the blank for tracy relationship.fidelity instructions indicated that is not accepted to make corrections.an notation on the checklist classified the form as nigo,or not in good order.fidelity never received a corrected beneficiary form from james,but,on december,he called the plan customer service line to find out who was recorded as his beneficiary.fidelity operates the service center on the plan behalf.after authenticating james identity,the fidelity representative looked at a scanned image of the september form and told him that tracy was listed as his only beneficiary.james confirmed that that was his desire.in a november letter to james concerning his estate planning,james attorney recited the current state of his planning documents which reflected the fact that tracy would be the only beneficiary of the k account.although james sisters questioned his capacity to have made changes to his estate plans in september near the time of his last beneficiary designation,james treating physician had found him to be completely neurologically normal and fully competent as of his examination on december.
james died on september.looking to the beneficiary designation form,fidelity initially notified rose that she was the beneficiary of the k account.fidelity later froze the account when tracy claimed that she was the proper beneficiary according to james beneficiary designation form.the plan provides that an administrative committee made up of alliant employees,appointed by alliant pension and retirement committee,is vested with the responsibility to determine competing claims for benefits under the plan.the pension and retirement committee has the ultimate and sole discretion concerning entitlement to benefits.
in light of rose and tracy competing claims for the benefits of james account,alliant was called upon to decide the matter.alliant administrative committee issued an initial determination that,based upon the terms of the plan,the beneficiary designation naming tracy as sole beneficiary is substantially complete in material respects,and will be enforced.alliant reasoned that james failure to fill in the relationship line was not a material omission and that the plan was on notice of james relationship to tracy from the two earlier beneficiary designations.it further stated that the plan did not require that a beneficiary be related to the participant,explaining that the relationship information is just a useful device for helping to locate the beneficiary if needed.alliant also noted that,when fidelity returned the beneficiary designation form to james,its letter did not state that his designation of tracy had been rejected or that his failure to fill in the relationship blank invalidated the designation.it cited the telephone communication between james and the plan representative in december as confirmation of his intent to name tracy as the primary beneficiary,and it speculated that he may have omitted the relationship information because he was uncertain how to describe it following his divorce from kathleen.in addition to providing rose and tracy notice of their erisa appeal rights in its initial determination,alliant reserved its right to interplead the claims to james account.
irwin bank and trust,as guardian of rose estate,appealed this initial determination to alliant pension and retirement administrative committee,claiming that the designation did not actually or substantially comply with plan requirements,the substantial compliance doctrine was no basis for enforcing the form in this jurisdiction,james lacked capacity when he executed the form,and the form was the product of undue influence by tracy.tracy filed a response with affidavits contesting these allegations.believing litigation was inevitable,the committee chose to file this interpleader action rather than rule on the appeal.the district court considered the case on motions for summary judgment filed by both parties.it denied tracy motion for summary judgment and granted the bank motion on behalf of rose estate after finding that james final beneficiary designation in tracy favor was invalid.
we review de novo the district court decision granting summary judgment to the bank on behalf of rose,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to tracy.johnson,at.
tracy first argues that the district court applied the incorrect standard of review to alliant initial determination in her favor.the district court conducted a de novo review of alliant initial determination that the beneficiary designation was enforceable in favor of tracy.we review de novo the district court determination of the proper standard of review.seman fmc.ret.plan for hourly employees,cir.we conclude that alliant initial determination was entitled to deferential review under the abuse of discretion standard.
where an erisa plan grants its administrator discretion to decide questions of eligibility for benefits or construe plan terms,judicial review of the administrator determinations generally is limited to the abuse of discretion standard.seman,at see also firestone tire rubber bruch,d.judicial review is de novo,however,where an administrator did not exercise the discretion granted to it,auto.dealers assocs.ret.trust arbeitman,cir,and for issues that were within the administrator discretion but on which the administrator failed to render a decision.mansker tmg life ins,cir.
in this case,the plan vested alliant pension and retirement committee with sole discretion to construe the plan statement and to determine all factual and legal questions under the plan,including beneficiaries entitlement to account proceeds.the committee,acting through its administrative committee,exercised that discretion when it made the initial determination based upon the terms of the plan that james beneficiary designation was valid and would be enforced even though james failed to list tracy relationship in the blank provided.the district court,however,concluded that alliant decision to file an interpleader action rather than rule on rose appeal effectively negates any exercise of its discretionary authority,and thus it reviewed alliant initial determination de novo.
this circuit has not had occasion to resolve the issue of which standard of review applies where an erisa plan administrator makes an initial determination of competing claims but later elects to file an interpleader action rather than rule on the disappointed claimant appeal.the bank argues that arbeitman controls this question.in arbeitman,however,the plan administrator filed an interpleader action before rendering any determination on entitlement to benefits.at.because the administrator failed to exercise any of the discretion granted to it by the plan,we had nothing to defer to,leaving the de novo standard as the only applicable standard of review.see id.in this case,alliant did exercise its discretion in rendering an initial determination that,based upon the terms of the plan,the designation was enforceable.unlike the administrator in arbeitman,alliant has exercised authority that we can review the issue is the appropriate amount of deference to give to alliant interpretation of its plan.
the bank argues that we owe no deference to the plan administrator initial determination because an interpleader action effectively removes the administrator from the case and it has no further stake in the matters being litigated.this argument overlooks the administrator interest in interpreting its own plan terms we grant deference to that interpretation because we have a general hesitancy to interfere with the administration of a benefits plan.layes mead,cir.alliant,as administrator,acted to interpret its plan in its initial determination,but,when the bank challenged that determination,it stopped short of deciding the issues of undue influence,incapacity,and substantial compliance.we reject the bank characterization of this interpleader as completely removing the administrator from the case.rather,the administrator viewed the interpleader action as a way to minimize costs to the plan where litigation between the competing claimants seemed inevitable and the new issues the bank raised were outside the administrator area of expertise.alliant pension and retirement committee felt that a court was in a better position to decide the factual issues regarding incapacity and undue influence and the potential legal issue regarding substantial compliance,and reasonably concluded that it was in the plan best interest to invoke the interpleader device at that point.where an erisa plan gives a plan administrator discretion to decide certain issues and the administrator or fiduciary fails to do so,a reviewing court will decide those issues de novo.mansker,at.this principle does not preclude judicial deference toward issues the administrator did decide before filing its interpleader action.
tracy cites seman to argue that,under this circuit law,an erisa administrator failure to act on an appeal does not raise the standard of review to de novo.her citation is incomplete.in seman,we held that an administrator failure to act on an appeal does raise the standard of review from abuse of discretion to de novo if the review panel inaction raises serious doubts about the administrator decision.seman,at see also mcgarrah hartford life ins,cir.serious doubts can be raised by a procedural irregularity that suggests the initial determination was the product of an arbitrary decision or the plan administrator whim rather than an exercise of judgment.mcgarrah,at.
the bank argues that alliant conduct raises serious doubts,pointing to its inconsistent conclusions about who was the proper beneficiary and the fact that this matter prompted it to review its method for processing beneficiary designations.keeping in mind that the bank has a rigorous standard to meet,mcgarrah,at,we conclude that alliant process does not contain the type of procedural irregularities that raise serious doubts about its initial determination that the beneficiary designation in favor of tracy was enforceable under the plan.while fidelity actions in granting the account to rose then freezing it when tracy made her claim indicate some confusion about who was entitled to the account just after james death,they do not suggest arbitrary,especially in light of alliant efforts to investigate james communications with the plan to determine the proper beneficiary.the administrator invited the competing claimants to provide information,and it conducted an investigation into the relevant circumstances before rendering its initial determination.the bank argues that alliant had no input from rose when it made its initial determination that tracy was the designated beneficiary of the account.if that is the case,it is because the bank failed to articulate its position.on february,alliant sent a letter to the bank inviting it to submit anything to assist us before we issue an initial determination of the beneficiary of the account.alliant made its determination the following month and memorialized it in a written decision that was based upon the terms of the plan.in light of the steps alliant took to determine the proper beneficiary,none of the bank arguments raise serious doubts about the integrity of alliant decision making process.mcgarrah,at.
in its appeal to the committee on rose behalf,the bank argued and produced some evidence that james lacked capacity and labored under undue influence from tracy when he executed the beneficiary designation.in seman,a plan administrator initial denial of benefits was subject to
