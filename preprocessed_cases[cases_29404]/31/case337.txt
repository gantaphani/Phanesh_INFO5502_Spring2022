opinion of the court 
we must decide in this matter whether,under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,the district court erred in ruling that former employees,who were participants in a defined contribution plan,may not prosecute a derivative action on behalf of an employees savings plan to recover losses sustained by the savings plan because of alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.we conclude that the plaintiffs may seek money damages on behalf of the fund,notwithstanding the fact the alleged fiduciary violations affected only a subset of the saving plan participants.
accordingly,we will reverse and remand for further proceedings.
the complaint alleges the following facts.jingdong zhu and adrian fields the plaintiffs are former employees of corporation schering.during their employment with schering,the plaintiffs elected to participate in the employees savings plan the savings plan or the plan.under the savings plan,a schering employee agreed to reduce his or her compensation in order to invest that amount in one or more investment funds on a basis the savings plan authorized a participant to select from different investment funds.one of the investment funds was the schering plan company stock fund the company stock fund,which consisted of company stock.under the savings plan,a participant was not permitted to invest more than of his or her future contributions in schering stock.some of the plaintiffs deferred compensation included an investment in the company stock fund.
as of december,schering stock made up approximately of the value of the saving plan assets.more than of the employees who participated in the saving plan had at least some of their assets allocated to the company stock fund.in fiscal year the loss in the value of schering stock constituted of the drop in value of the saving plan assets,and in the loss in schering stock value constituted of the saving plan net loss.the loss to the savings plan was approximately.by june of the price of schering stock had fallen below per share from a high of better than a share.
on october,the plaintiffs filed this class action pursuant to a on behalf of the savings plan and a ll persons who were participants in or beneficiaries of the saving plan at any time between july,and the present the class period,and whose accounts included investments in schering stock.the complaint named as defendants and as fiduciaries of the savings plan schering,richard kogan,its former ceo,members of the schering board pension committee,the employees benefits committee and one of its members,the benefits investment committee and three of its members,the counsel of the investment committee,and vanguard group,the trustee of the savings plan collectively the defendants.
the complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties of prudence,care,and loyalty by continuing to offer the company stock fund as one of the savings plan alternatives when they knew that schering stock price was unlawfully and artificially inflated.additionally,the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to disclose negative material information about schering,which induced participants in the savings plan to elect to invest in the company stock fund.the complaint also alleges that some of the defendants did not loyally serve the saving plan participants by taking steps to avoid a conflict of interest such as making appropriate public disclosures,divesting the savings plan of schering stock,discontinuing further investments in schering stock,consulting independent fiduciaries,or resigning as savings plan fiduciaries.
in lieu of answering the complaint,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim under a the defendants argued that b ecause section a authorizes relief only for the plan,a participant can state a claim only if he proceeds in a representative capacity on behalf of the plan as a whole and seeks to recover for all plan participants allegedly injured by the fiduciary breach.emphasis in the original.in addition,they asserted that the plaintiffs do not seek relief on behalf of the plan as a whole because the complaint allegedly excludes current employees who were part of the that invested in the company stock fund.
they further maintained that the consolidated complaint improperly seeks individual relief for each plan participant because it prays for an allocation among the participants individualized accounts in proportion to the accounts losses.emphasis added in the defendants motion.finally,the defendants contended that the plaintiffs failed to allege facts showing detrimental reliance by the saving plan participants on the defendants alleged misrepresentations and.
the district court granted the defendant motion and dismissed the consolidated complaint with prejudice.it held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to prosecute this action under a and a because the consolidated complaint alleges only harm suffered by the individual plan participants and not the savings plan,and seeks relief measured by the harm to individuals and tailored for the benefit of individuals,and not the savings plan.the district court summarized its conclusion in these words 
even assuming that each defendant is an erisa fiduciary,that each of plaintiffs allegations concerning defendants conduct were true,and that this conduct rose to a level to breach erisa fiduciary duties without the court opining as to merits of these assumptions,plaintiffs can not demonstrate how any defendant would be personally liable for damages to make good to the plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach to the saving plans because it is only plan participants who might be able to show that they suffered individualized losses.
the district court commented further that because plaintiffs can point to no set of facts that would demonstrate losses to the plan the court need not reach defendants further arguments in favor of dismissal.
the plaintiffs have timely appealed.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to e of erisa.this court has appellate jurisdiction under.
the plaintiffs contend that t he district court erred in failing to distinguish between the nature of the losses caused by defendants fiduciary breaches,and the fact that the losses caused by those breaches are reflected in the plan individual participant accounts.they argue that the district court erred in concluding that their contributions were kept in separate,segregated accounts and never became a part of the saving plan assets.instead,the plaintiffs maintain that the savings plan was a unitary trust that purchased and maintained stock in the company stock fund,which was one of the fourteen investment alternatives in a defined contribution employee benefit plan.the plaintiffs also assert that the district court erred in determining that the company stock fund was an individual account plan and an employee stock ownership plan esop.
we exercise de novo review over the dismissal of claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.bedell wholesale philip morris,cir.furthermore,we must take all factual allegations and reasonable inferences as true and view them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.id.the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs complaint only if plaintiffs could have proved no set of facts entitling them to relief.id.

under a of erisa,a,those having discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of a plan are fiduciaries.section imposes upon them fiduciary duties including the duties of care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances.section a makes plan fiduciaries personally liable to make good to the plan any losses to the plan resulting from each breach of fiduciary duty.a.and,finally,a provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary for appropriate relief under section.
the issue presented here is whether the complaint states a claim under,whether the complaint seeks relief for the employees savings plan based on allegations that there were losses to the plan resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty.we believe it clearly does.
the complaint alleges that a s a consequence of the defendants breaches of fiduciary duty,the plan suffered significant losses and seeks a monetary payment to the plan to make good to the plan the losses to the plan resulting from those breaches of fiduciary duty.section allows the plan to recover any losses from a breach of fiduciary duty.emphasis added.the fiduciary liability is not limited to plan losses that will ultimately redound to the benefit of all participants.the plan held stock as an asset and that asset was greatly reduced in value allegedly because of breaches of fiduciary duty.this clearly was a loss to the plan within the meaning of 
just as the fact that the assets at issue were held for the ultimate benefit of plaintiffs does not alter the fact that they were held by the plan,so,too,the fact that plaintiffs may have to show individual reliance on the defendants alleged misrepresentations to prevail on some claims does not mean they do not seek recovery for plan losses.as the court aptly put it in in re honeywell int l erisa litigation,civil,wl,june,at 
l osses to the plan may have resulted from decisions by individual participants,but that does not mean that those losses were not losses of the plan it simply means that some of the decision making for plan investments was conducted by the participants who contributed to it.
it is a non sequitur to say,as the district court did,that plaintiffs can not demonstrate any losses to the plan because it is an individual account plan which includes an esop investment alternative.first,while the plan is,indeed,an individual account plan,this does not preclude the plan from having losses.second,the plan is not an employee stock ownership plan or an esop.under d a,an employee stock ownership plan is designed to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities.d a.as this court explained in moench robertson,cir 
esops are device s for expanding the national capital base among effective merger of the roles of capitalist and worker.donovan cunningham,at.thus,the concept of employee ownership constituted a goal in and of itself.to accomplish this end,congress enacted a number of laws designed to encourage employers to set up such plans.id.
the plan before us was designed to provide opportunities for saving and investment.it was not designed to invest primarily in securities of the employer.indeed,the plan was not required to offer stock as one of its investment opportunities.
the district court conclusions that plaintiffs contributions were never assets of the savings plan and never aggregated,and that plaintiffs only seek damages for their individualized losses,directly conflict with the express terms of the savings plan as well as other allegations of the complaint.
the savings plan provides in article a that contributions to the savings plan 
shall be invested in one or more investment funds authorized by the investment committee,which,from time to time,may include such equity funds,international equity funds,fixed income funds,money market funds,a company stock fund,and other funds or investment vehicles as the investment committee elects to offer.
article provides as follows 
a participant shall make one investment election covering his or her accounts in accordance with the following options 
a percent in one of the available investment funds 
b in more than one investment fund allocated in multiples of percent 
provided,however,that in no event may a participant allocate more than percent of future contributions to the company stock fund.if a participant fails to make an investment election with respect to percent of his or her accounts,the portion of such accounts not subject to the participant investment election shall be invested in a money market fund or equivalent investment vehicle.
section reads as follows 
each participant is solely responsible for the selection of his or her investment options.the trustee,the committee,the investment committee,any employer,and the officers,supervisors and other employees of any employer are not empowered to advise a participant as to the manner in which his or her accounts shall be invested.the fact that an investment fund is available to participants for investment under the plan shall not be construed as a recommendation for investment in that investment fund.
pursuant to article,
a participant may elect to reallocate his or her accounts among the investment funds,in multiples of percent,by giving such notice as the committee or its delegate shall prescribe provided,however,that in no event may a participant allocate more than percent of the value of his or her accounts at the time of the reallocation to the company stock fund.the reallocation shall be effective as soon as administratively practicable after the trustee receives such notice.
article requires the trustee of the savings fund to value each of the investment funds each business day.on each valuation date there shall be allocated to the accounts of each participant his or her proportionate share of the increase or decrease in the fair market value of his or her accounts in each of the investment funds.article requires the trustee to furnish each participant with a statement setting forth the value of his or her accounts each calendar quarter.
article provides that until the accounts of a participant who is entitled to distribution because of the termination of employment or after the anniversary of the participant date of birth,are completely distributed,the accounts of a participant who is entitled to a distribution shall continue to be invested as part of the funds of the plan 
in section,the savings plan provides that t he committee or its delegate shall maintain,or cause to be maintained,records showing the individual balances in each participant accounts.however,maintenance of those records and accounts shall not require any segregation of the funds of the plan.
in section,the savings plan provides that a ll the funds of the plan shall be held by the trustee appointed from time to time by the investment committee or its delegate under a trust agreement adopted,or as amended,by the board of directors.
pursuant to article,company stock held by the trustee shall be voted by the trustee at each annual meeting and at each special meeting of stockholders of the company as directed by the participant to whose accounts such company stock is credited.emphasis added.
thus,contrary to the district court interpretation of the provisions of the savings plan,each participant deferred payroll compensation was held in trust as the assets of the savings plan.each participant in the savings plan was provided with an individualized account and periodically informed of the individual balance in his or her account.the savings plan also makes clear the fact that each participant has an individual account does not require any segregation of the funds of the plan.article.
the district court cited this court decision in moench in support of its determination that a plan that permits employees to become part owners of their employer is an esop and not a traditional pension plan governed by erisa.as noted above,the defendants have conceded that the savings plan we are considering is not an esop.in moench,this court held that in limited circumstances,esop fiduciaries can be liable under erisa for continuing to invest in employer stock according to the plan direction id.at.it went on to say that w hile fiduciaries of pension benefit plans generally must diversify investments of the plan assets,fiduciaries of esops are exempted from this duty.id.at.in reversing the district court holding that an esop can not be held liable for investing solely in employer common stock,this court explained that an esop fiduciary who invests the assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with erisa by virtue of that decision.however,the plaintiff may overcome that presumption by establishing that the fiduciary abused its decision by investing in employer securities.id.at.the principle announced in moench has no application to the duty of a fiduciary of pension benefit plans to diversify investments so as to minimize the risk of large losses.id.at.esops,unlike pension plans,are not intended to guarantee retirement benefits,and indeed,by its very nature,an esop places employee retirements assets at much greater risk than does the typical diversified erisa plan.id.at.because the savings plan in this case was not an esop,the moench decision does not resolve the issue presented in this matter 
in a letter to this court filed pursuant to rule j of the federal rules of appellate procedure,the defendants cited a recent decision of the fifth circuit,milofsky american airlines,cir reh g en banc granted,wl.lexis,cir.july,in support of their argument that a participant lacks standing to bring an action on behalf of an individual account pension plan if he or she does not seek relief.
in milofsky,the plaintiffs were employed as pilots by business express,bex when it was acquired by amr eagle holding corporation,the holding company of american eagle,american eagle.while employed by bex,the plaintiffs participated in its individual account pension plan.id.at.at the time of the acquisition of bex,the plaintiffs were given notice that the balance of their accounts in the bex plan would be transferred to a comparable american eagle plan.the notices advised the plaintiffs when the transfers would occur.the transfers did not occur,however,until months after the time written in the notice.id.at.
the plaintiffs filed a class action against american airlines and towers perrin,a benefits consulting firm hired by american airlines to render administrative services in connection with the plan.id.at.the action,which was filed under a,alleged that american airlines and towers perrin had violated fiduciary duties in misrepresenting how and when their accounts would be transferred to the american eagle k plan.id.they alleged that because of the failure to effect the transfer of the class members account balances in a timely and prudent manner,the values of their accounts decreased because the assets remained invested in the floundering bex plan longer than expected.id.at.the plaintiffs requested actual damages to be paid to the american eagle uper aver plan,to be allocated among their individual accounts proportionately to their losses resulting from the alleged breach.id.
the majority of the panel in milofsky held that plaintiffs lack standing because this case in essence is about an alleged particularized harm targeting a specific subset of plan beneficiaries,with claims for damages to benefits sic members of the subclass only,and not the plan generally.id.at.
the facts in milofsky are clearly distinguishable from those in the matter sub judice.in milofsky,the plaintiffs alleged that the value of their investments in the bex plan decreased because of the failure of the defendants to transfer the funds to the american eagle k plan.id.at.thus,this alleged loss occurred prior to the transfer of the bex plan participants investments to the american eagle k plan.in milofsky,the plaintiffs sought damages on behalf of the bex plan members,and did not seek to restore assets of the american eagle k fund.here,the plaintiffs seek damages from the fiduciaries for their violation of their duty to a subclass which had transferred its funds to the trustee of the savings fund.
in kuper iovenko,cir,the sixth circuit held that a subset of employee benefit participants has standing to bring an action for breach of fiduciary duty under.the court rejected the same argument presented by the defendants in this matter that an action under must be brought on behalf of a plan as a whole and that a claim brought by a subclass of plan participants fails to satisfy this requirement.id.at.the sixth circuit in kuper concluded that the plaintiffs had standing to bring this action pursuant to a.citing moench,however,it affirmed the dismissal of the action on the merits,adopting this court rule that a fiduciary who invests in an employer stock is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that it acted consistently with erisa in continuing to invest in an employer securities.kuper,at.the sixth circuit affirmed because it concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to rebut the presumption that defendants acted reasonably in continuing to hold quantum stock.id.at.in sum,the court concluded in kuper that a does not authorize a plaintiff to recover damages on his or her own behalf.instead,a plaintiff must seek to have the fiduciary reimburse the plan.id.at 
the majority in milofsky stated that the court reasoning in kuper is directly contrary to the principle announced in supreme court decision in massachusetts mutual life insurance company russell,d,that a participant action filed pursuant to a must seek remedies that provide a benefit to the plan as a whole milofsky,at.in her dissent,chief judge carolyn dineen king wrote that 
russell never reached the conclusion that the majority reaches,that standing can exist under a only if all plan participants would benefit from the litigation.instead,it only held that a single plan participant,seeking individual recovery for damages payable directly to her,could not proceed with her lawsuit under a.russell,at,d.accordingly,the majority holding goes far beyond the holding of russell.
id.at emphasis added footnote omitted.
in footnote of her opinion,chief judge king also stated 
the majority correctly notes that russell distinguishes between relief for individuals and relief for the plan as a whole.majority opinion.russell does not,however,stand for the proposition that the plan as a whole is synonymous with all participants of the plan,and several courts have rejected this definition of the plan as a whole.
id.we agree with chief judge king interpretation of russell,and decline to follow the majority opinion in milofsky.
in russell,the plaintiff was a beneficiary under two employee health benefit plans funded by her employer and governed by erisa.at.she became disabled and received plan benefits until october.she requested internal review of the termination decision.the plan administrator reinstated her benefits on march,and she was paid retroactive benefits in full.id.
the plaintiff in russell filed an action in state court seeking damages for mental and emotional distress under state law and erisa claims resulting from the interruption of her benefit payments,as well as punitive damages.id.at.the defendant removed the action to the district court and moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion.it held that the claims were preempted by erisa,and that erisa barred claims for and punitive damages.id.the ninth circuit affirmed the district court determination that the state law claims were by erisa,but also concluded that the complaint alleged a cause of action under a and that punitive damages could be awarded.id.at.
the supreme court reversed the judgment of the ninth circuit.it held that does not authorize extracontractual or punitive damages.the court also rejected the plaintiff argument that a private right of action for extracontractual damages was implied in.id.at.in rejecting the employee claims,the court stated that a fair contextual reading of the statute makes it abundantly clear that its draftsmen were primarily concerned with the possible misuse of plan assets,and with remedies that would protect the entire plan,rather than with the rights of an individual beneficiary.id.at.
unlike the circumstances presented in this matter,in russell the plaintiff did not file a class action on behalf of an erisa employee benefits plan to require the defendants to pay damages to the health benefit plan because of their alleged breach of their fiduciary duty.instead,she filed a private cause of action for extracontractual and punitive damages the court did not hold in russell that a subgroup of plan participants can not file derivative action on behalf of an erisa employee benefits plan if the fiduciaries alleged breach did not affect the investments of participants in other subgroups.that issue simply was not before the court.
the district court relied in part on ru
