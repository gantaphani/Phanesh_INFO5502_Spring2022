the question in this case is whether an erisa plan administrator denial of disability benefits is entitled to deference when the administrator failed to render a decision within the time limits and the claim was deemed denied by operation of law.
background 
louise gilbertson began working for alliedsignal as an administrative support coordinator in.in march,gilbertson consulted her family physician,gwen robinson,complaining of chronic pain in her neck,shoulders,and arms,as well as frequent headaches,sleep disturbance,and difficulty concentrating.based on these symptoms,and on the discovery of certain pressure points in gilbertson neck,shoulders,arms,and legs,robinson rendered a diagnosis of fibromyalgia gilbertson took disability leave,which lasted through september.on that date,alliedsignal terminated her employment.
following her termination,gilbertson promptly applied for disability ltd benefits under alliedsignal salaried employees pension plan the plan.the plan is covered by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.the plan names alliedsignal as the plan administrator and provides the administrator with discretionary authority to administer the plan,interpret its terms,and delegate its authority to third parties.alliedsignal hired a third party claims administrator,life insurance company of north america lina,to administer the plan and to determine eligibility for benefits.
in support of her application for ltd benefits,gilbertson submitted documentation prepared by robinson setting forth the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.lina then requested that robinson provide additional information,including any abnormal clinical test results.in her response,robinson submitted test results,including blood analysis and urinalysis,all of which were normal,and reaffirmed her diagnosis of fibromyalgia based on trigger points and gilbertson reported symptoms.robinson also provided treatment records,in which gilbertson reported that,though her condition had improved somewhat due to her participation in water aerobics,tai chi,and chiropractic treatments,she remained unable to return to work.
on december,lina denied gilbertson application for long term disability benefits on the ground that she had failed to provide adequate objective medical evidence demonstrating that she was disabled according to the plan definition in the denial letter,lina explained that,though gilbertson supporting documentation indicated symptoms of fibromyalgia,it did not adequately address how those symptoms affected her capacity to perform her work.lina also noted that the documentation did not explain how symptoms of more than fifteen months duration had suddenly rendered her unable to work and that robinson notes actually indicated some improvement from exercise and other treatments.
the denial letter notified gilbertson of her right to request that lina review the denial.the letter encouraged gilbertson to submit additional information promptly,because lina would issue a final decision within either days of receiving a request for review,or days,if lina specified that special circumstances required the extra time.lina explanation of this timeline mirrors a provision in the plan requiring the administrator to make a final decision within the applicable or deadline.the plan provision in turn follows a department of labor erisa regulation that articulates the applicable deadline and provides further that claims not decided within the deadline are deemed denied on review 
i a decision by an appropriate named fiduciary shall be made promptly,and shall not ordinarily be made later than days after the plan receipt of a request for review,unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing,in which case decision shall be rendered as soon as possible,but not later than days after receipt of a request for review.
if the decision on review is not furnished within such time,the claim shall be deemed denied on review.
on january,lina received gilbertson request for review.lina responded on january,assuring gilbertson that she would be notified of a final decision within days of lina receipt of the request.on february,lina sent a fax to gilbertson extending the deadline for additional submissions of medical information until march.the february fax was the last communication gilbertson received from lina.
gilbertson hired an attorney,who sent a letter to lina on february notifying lina of his representation.on march,gilbertson attorney provided lina with additional medical records from gilbertson chiropractor,bender,and statements from gilbertson family,friends,and supervisor attesting to her disabled condition.on april,one week after the agreed upon deadline for such submissions,gilbertson attorney provided more material from robinson documenting gilbertson fibromyalgia and explaining how its symptoms prevented her from performing her prior job at alliedsignal.
lina apparently took no action on the claim until early may,when the company referred the file to its medical consultant,thomas franz,for review.on may,franz provided lina with his physical case review.franz agreed that gilbertson symptoms met the criteria for fibromyalgia,but he found the functional limitations asserted by gilbertson and her doctors to be implausible and inconsistent with her ability to derive therapeutic benefit from aerobics and tai chi.his review recommended that gilbertson be scheduled for an independent medical examination to include functional capability testing.franz report was not communicated to gilbertson or her attorney,nor did they receive any other communication from lina or alliedsignal regarding the claim.
on june,gilbertson attorney sent a letter to lina asking the company to advise whether it would accept or reject the claim.lina opted to do neither,deciding instead to refer gilbertson for an independent examination.lina,however,neglected to inform gilbertson or her attorney of this decision,and she therefore had no way of knowing the status of her claim.finally,on august,gilbertson received a certified letter from healthsouth,an institution hired by lina to perform the independent medical examination,informing her that she was scheduled for an appointment on september.gilbertson canceled the healthsouth appointment and,treating her claim as having been deemed denied by operation of the regulatory deadline for decision on an appeal,filed suit on august.
in federal district court,lina and alliedsignal moved for summary judgment,arguing that lina denial of benefits was entitled to judicial deference under the arbitrary and capricious standard.gilbertson contended that lina failure to meet the erisa deadline should trigger de novo review.the district court acknowledged that lina had failed to meet the deadline,but nevertheless applied the deferential standard of review.the district court seems to have determined,based on the cases cited by the parties,that where an administrator with discretionary authority renders an initial decision and does not subsequently change its reasoning,the courts should apply a deferential standard even if the appeal is deemed denied as a result of delay.the district court also found it important that gilbertson herself had acted outside the plan time limits in that she asked for extensions of the deadline to submit materials,continued to submit materials past the deadline,and in general continued to participate in the appeals process.order granting defendants motion for summary judgment,dated november,at,appellant app.
the district court therefore reviewed lina deemed denied decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard.it found substantial evidence in the record supporting the denial and granted summary judgment to lina and alliedsignal.gilbertson now appeals the grant of summary judgment,arguing that the proper standard of review in this case is de novo.we agree.
discussion 
standard of review 
gilbertson complaint arises under a,which provides that a beneficiary may bring suit to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.although erisa does not explicitly specify the standard of review that district courts should employ in reviewing such claims,the supreme court has held that a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.where the plan grants such discretionary authority to the administrator,the court reviews the administrator denial according to an arbitrary and capricious standard.chambers family health,cir.
alliedsignal plan expressly vests discretionary authority to determine benefits eligibility in the plan administrator alliedsignal,who has delegated its discretion to lina.such delegation is permitted by the plan.therefore,because the plan,albeit indirectly,grants discretionary authority to lina,lina decisions on benefit claims should generally be reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard.
gilbertson contends,however,that the arbitrary and capricious standard is inapplicable when the claim has been automatically deemed denied by operation of erisa regulations.she takes the position that if the administrator fails to issue a decision before the applicable deadline as required by erisa,and the claim is thereby deemed denied,the court must review the denial de novo.
the parties positions as to when gilbertson claim could be deemed denied as provided in erisa regulations are somewhat unclear.gilbertson seems to argue that the claim should be deemed denied as of days after lina receipt of the appeal on january.this,however,is not necessarily the proper date.the regulations provide for an additional days if the administrator articulates a special need.h.gilbertson requested and was granted an extension of the deadline by which she was required to submit supporting medical documentation to march.lina grant of the extension could be construed either as notice to gilbertson that lina would need the extra days or as a tacit agreement between both parties to the clock on march the deadline or april the date of gilbertson final submission.this latter interpretation is supported by gilbertson written request for review,in which she states,i understand that i will receive a decision on my claim no later that sic days after i provide you with the additional information that is being gathered.appellant app.the deemed denied date could therefore be as late as late july or august 
the exact date does not really matter in this case because lina never issued a decision denying gilbertson appeal.lina and alliedsignal have conceded their failure to render a decision prior to the deadline whatever it is and do not contest gilbertson contention that the claim must be deemed denied pursuant to erisa regulations.nevertheless,lina and alliedsignal argue that the deemed denial of an erisa claim does not affect the deferential standard of review.
the question presented is therefore whether a plan administrator with discretionary authority whose delay in deciding a claim results in its being deemed denied is entitled to judicial deference.the issue is of first impression in this circuit.we hold that when substantial violations of erisa deadlines result in the claim being automatically deemed denied on review,the district court must review the denial de novo,even if the plan administrator has discretionary authority to decide claims.
the supreme court ruling in firestone seems to require this holding.firestone establishes de novo review as the default standard for reviewing erisa claims,with deferential review only in those instances where an administrator decision is an exercise of a discretion vested in them by the instrument under which they act.firestone,at.emphasis in original internal quotations omitted.therefore,to be entitled to deferential review,not only must the administrator be given discretion by the plan,but the administrator decision in a given case must be a valid exercise of that discretion.it follows that where the plan and applicable regulations place temporal limits on the administrator discretion and the administrator fails to render a final decision within those limits,the administrator deemed denied decision is by operation of law rather than the exercise of discretion,and thus falls outside the firestone exception.when the administrator fails to exercise his discretion within the required timeframe,the reviewing court must apply firestone default de novo standard.
the underlying rationale articulated by the supreme court in firestone also supports this holding.because erisa is silent with respect to the standard of review,the court looked to applicable common law principles to decide the question.firestone held that erisa language,legislative history and interpretive precedents required that in determining the appropriate standard of review,we are guided by principles of trust law.firestone,at.citations omitted.thus,the firestone decision was essentially an application of the common law of trusts to judicial review of erisa claim denials.trust law traditionally did not sanction judicial interference with a trustee discretion when the original parties,by means of the trust instrument,authorized the trustee to exercise discretionary powers.id.at.citing restatement second of trusts.the purpose of this principle is evident trust settlors and trustees may,for a number of reasons,prefer that the trustee render individualized,decisions without a court the trustee judgments.the most obvious reason for such an arrangement is that the trustee or administrator expertise and familiarity with the overall scheme,as well as the details of each case,make him more likely to get the decision right than a court.
this purpose,however,is not served by judicial deference to automatically deemed denied decisions.such decisions are not exercises of discretionary power vested in the trustee,as intended by the trust instrument,because in these instances the terms of the plan and its governing regulations require that a decision be rendered within a specified time.deference to the administrator expertise is inapplicable where the administrator has failed to apply his expertise to a particular decision.thus,because lina never used its discretionary authority to make and issue a final,reasoned decision on gilbertson appeal,lina has provided no actual exercise of discretion or application of reasoned judgment to which a court can defer.
our holding is in harmony with a recent decision of the ninth circuit,jebian hewlett packard company,cir.in jebian,a plan administrator denied an employee claim for long term disability benefits after the claim had already been deemed denied under the terms of the plan and applicable erisa regulations.the district court reviewed the denial under the arbitrary and capricious standard because the plan vested the administrator with the discretionary authority that,under firestone,triggers arbitrary and capricious review.jebian,at.the ninth circuit reversed,holding that where a claim is deemed denied on review after the expiration of a given time period,there is no opportunity for the exercise of discretion and the denial is reviewed de novo.id.at.
the jebian court also relied heavily on the logic of firestone to reach its conclusion.according to jebian,firestone affords deferential review only to discretionary decisions that conform to the limits placed upon the administrator discretionary authority by the plan and erisa regulations.at.thus,d ecisions made outside the boundaries of conferred discretion are not exercises of discretion and are not entitled to deferential review.jebian,at.
another,analogous case,this one in the third circuit,supports the principle that deemed denied decisions should be reviewed de novo.in gritzer cbs,cir,a plan administrator with discretionary authority failed to respond to a claim until after it was deemed denied.the third circuit reversed the district court application of the arbitrary and capricious standard,holding that,under firestone application of trust law principles to erisa cases,if a trustee fails to act or to exercise his or her discretion,de novo review is appropriate because the trustee has forfeited the privilege to apply his or her discretion it is the trustee analysis,not his or her right to use discretion or a mere arbitrary denial,to which a court should defer.id.at 
other circuits,however,have decided the issue differently.the fifth circuit has held that the standard of review is no different whether the claim is actually denied or deemed denied.southern farm bureau life ins.moore,cir.the court,however,provided no explanation or authority for this statement.in mcgarrah hartford life,the eighth circuit reviewed a plan administrator denial of benefits for abuse of discretion,even though the administrator never responded to the claimant appeal,cir.the court acknowledged that the plan administrator failure to respond was a serious procedural irregularity,but nevertheless held that the mere presence of a procedural irregularity is not enough to strip a plan administrator of the deferential standard of review.id.at.because the plan administrator initial decision thoroughly explained the basis for the adverse decision and the claimant submissions on appeal contained no new medical evidence contradicting the initial decision,the court held that the claimant appeal required no response by the administrator to permit meaningful judicial review.id.
mcgarrah,then,holds that even deemed denied decisions can be afforded judicial deference if the reviewing court determines that the administrator initial denial and statement of reasons can effectively be applied to the claimant appeal.id.that is,the court should interpret the administrator silence on the claimant appeal as implicitly affirming the original denial for the reasons set forth therein.lina urges us to adopt a similar interpretation of its to gilbertson appeal and insists that the reasons it provided in the initial denial are clearly applicable to and dispositive of the appeal.
even if the mcgarrah approach is permissible under firestone,it should be limited to situations where the claimant does not provide meaningful new evidence or raise significant new issues in the appeal.in mcgarrah,the administrator initial denial contained overwhelming evidence that mcgarrah was no longer disabled,including videotaped surveillance of mcgarrah moving furniture and carrying other heavy objects,and mcgarrah submitted no meaningful new medical evidence on appeal.id.
the facts here are quite different.lina initial denial explained that gilbertson had failed to produce sufficient evidence regarding how her condition affected her capacity to perform functions.in response,she submitted information both from her physician and her chiropractor that addressed her inability to perform job functions,as well as affidavits from friends and colleagues attesting to the same.in this situation,it makes no sense to apply the reasoning of lina initial denial to gilbertson submissions on appeal.the initial claim was denied for failure to submit certain kinds of evidence,and gilbertson then submitted evidence purporting to satisfy lina objections.the court therefore can not infer from the initial denial what lina thought of gilbertson subsequent submissions.because lina never issued a reasoned evaluation of the new evidence,it is impossible for a court to discern,much less properly review,the basis for lina adverse decision.this precludes deferential review of lina decision on appeal.
lina also argues that applying a de novo standard of review to deemed denied decisions is inconsistent with the plain meaning and broader purposes of the applicable erisa regulations.according to lina,the only purpose of the mandated deadlines and the deemed denied provision is to make it clear that,upon expiration of the deadline,the claimant has fully exhausted her administrative remedies and may then file suit.lina thus suggests that the deemed denied provision serves simply as an admission ticket to court,and not as a deadline that,if violated,should strip the administrator of his discretion.accordingly,depriving the administrator of his discretion for a minor procedural irregularity that did not substantively harm the claimant would reflect a that is inconsistent with the flexibility and discretion contemplated by the plan and erisa regulations.
this argument is not wholly without merit.the supreme court has held that the deemed denied provision allows the claimant to bring a civil action to have the merits of his application determined,just as he may bring an action to challenge an outright denial of benefits,but that an administrator delay is not necessarily a substantive violation giving rise to a private right of action.massachusetts mut.life ins.russell,d.see also heller fortis benefits ins,cert.denied,d.courts have also been willing to overlook administrators failure to meet certain procedural requirements when the administrator has substantially complied with the regulations and the process as a whole fulfills the broader purposes of erisa and its accompanying regulations.see,sage automation.pension plan and trust,cir n ot every procedural defect will upset the decision of plan representatives halpin grainger,cir in determining whether a plan complies with the applicable regulations,substantial compliance is sufficient.kent united of omaha life ins,cir upholding denial that violated procedural requirements because,despite violations,claimant was notified of reasons and was given fair opportunity for review donato metro.life ins,cir substantial compliance with regulations is sufficient when claimant received enough information to allow effective review sheppard enoch pratt,travelers ins,cir plan decision that violated applicable deadlines of substantially complied with regulation because the claimant was not prejudiced.
we agree that a substantial compliance approach is appropriate in this case.accordingly,our holding does not require that every decision that comes on the or day following the claimant notice of appeal must be subject to plenary review in federal court.such a rule could inhibit collection of useful evidence and create perverse incentives for the parties.even in cases where additional medical information is clearly necessary for a proper decision,administrators would have an incentive to issue a final denial on the inadequate record in order to preserve their right to deferential review,rather than to wait for the information and risk losing deference.on the other side,claimants might be encouraged to delay a final decision by suggesting that they intend to produce additional information,only to pull the plug and demand de novo review in federal court on the day.this result would be antithetical to the aims of erisa.erisa procedural regulations are meant to promote accurate,cooperative,and reasonably speedy,not to generate an endless stream of business for employment lawyers.see varity howe,d congressional purpose in enacting erisa was not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs,or litigation expenses,unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans.thus,in the context of an ongoing,good faith exchange of information between the administrator and the claimant,inconsequential violations of the deadlines or other procedural irregularities would not entitle the claimant to de novo review.
in order to determine when an administrator who fails to render a timely decision might nevertheless be in substantial compliance with the regulatory requirements,we must consider the purpose of the mandated deadlines in the context of other erisa procedural requirements.donato,at in determining whether there has been substantial compliance,the purpose of and its implementing regulations,f,serves as our guide.fortunately,the broader purpose of the relevant erisa regulation seems fairly clear.the regulation requires that plan administrators follow certain procedures within the specified deadlines when they deny claims.among other things,the administrator must provide the claimant with a comprehensible statement of reasons for the deni
