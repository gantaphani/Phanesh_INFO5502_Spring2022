unum began paying disability benefits to holcomb on may.unum advised her that its payments were under reservation of rights,meaning unum did not concede present or future liability.in august,one of unum physicians reviewed holcomb medical file and filed a report that concluded that her complaints of pain were not supported by physical exam,testing or radiological findings.the report noted,however,that her medical records were insufficient to allow for an independent assessment of the claimant functional capacity.in september,unum determined it was liable under the policy and it removed its reservation of rights.it then informed holcomb that it would continue to pay her benefits during a limited pay period up to months because her claim fell under the policy provision for d isabilities primarily based on symptoms,and disabilities due to mental illness in october,holcomb primary care physician office reported that although holcomb could occasionally lift between one and ten pounds,bend,kneel,and climb stairs,she could not perform even one hour of sedentary work during an workday.
from late through early,unum regularly requested updated medical records from holcomb and her treating physicians.these records generally indicated that she was suffering from fatigue,diffuse pain,intermittent headaches and rashes,joint swelling,vision problems,and memory difficulties.in february,unum notified holcomb that 
a s of may,you will have reached months of benefit payments.as we discussed,so that we can ensure that we are making the most appropriate decision with regards to the adjudication of your claim and taking into consideration your current medical condition,we will be reviewing your file to determine if you qualify for continued benefits.
after may,unum continued to pay benefits to holcomb under a reservation of rights.in june,unum physician tony smith the osp conducted a clinical review of medical records unum had obtained from several of holcomb physicians.he found no significant change in holcomb reported symptoms from to.he also found no significant change in holcomb exams,laboratory tests,or imaging studies.based on the data in holcomb medical file,he concluded that it was reasonable to assume she would have difficulty with prolonged walking,heavy lifting,frequent bending,and heavy pushing and pulling.he also concluded that her file did not document a complete lack of work capacity.
following the osp clinical review,unum requested additional medical information from holcomb primary care physician,craig carson.carson office responded with a report indicating that holcomb had been diagnosed with lupus,memory loss,headaches,fibromyalgia,depression,gastroesophageal reflux disease,sjorgren syndrome,and fatigue.the report stated that her principal complaint was fatigue and that her cognitive deficits were not supported by objective evidence.in addition,the report advised that in the absence of objective data concerning holcomb functional abilities,it was necessary to rely on the patient history of present illness and take her word for it when she report s that she is unable to walk,talk,sit,lift,for any period of time.although the report counseled against holcomb returning to work,its conclusions about her cognitive deficits and functional disability were generally based on symptoms.
in july,robert anfield,another unum physician,evaluated both the osp review of holcomb medical records and several assessments by carson and his staff.anfield agreed with the osp analysis,concluding that holcomb was capable of engaging in work activities.in addition,anfield stated that holcomb incapacitating symptoms are primarily the feature of fibromyalgia and the label fibromyalgia provides no pathophysiologic foundation upon which to base a set of restrictions and limitations.
also in july,unum requested holcomb medical records from the social security administration,which had conducted a disability determination and transmittal ddt.the ddt identified holcomb primary diagnosis as affective mood disorders.it stated that no secondary diagnosis could be established due to insufficient medical evidence the ddt was accompanied by a psychiatrist evaluation and conclusion that m edical evidence shows holcomb can do simple tasks,but she can not do complex work.she can not cope with the stress of a work environment or a work schedule.
in august,carson sent unum a letter to clarify a few matters.carson wrote,y our antagonistic letters and disclaimers suggest a remarkable lack of understanding for systemic lupus erythematosus and its ability to cause functional limitations in patients who are so unfortunately affected.he wrote that unum was try ing to make a case that holcomb problems are all subjective and thus mental.he summarized the abnormal laboratory studies that have been a consistent feature of holcomb disease,and he urged 
what i wish you to understand is that the mental aspect of her illness is only a minor aspect.far greater are the problems of widespread systemic inflammation in the connective tissues.this is most marked by a pronounced arthritis and her episcleritis not by her mental problems my recommendations for medical retirement based on total and permanent disability are based solely on functional limitations apart from any mental disorder.she can no longer engage in any work related activities such as sitting,standing,walking,lifting,carrying or handling objects using her hands.
in september,the osp reviewed carson letter,reports from holcomb ophthalmologist,and pages of medical records holcomb had submitted to unum during the previous three months.the osp reported that b ased on a review of the additional medical information and with a reasonable degree of medical certainty,the additional me
