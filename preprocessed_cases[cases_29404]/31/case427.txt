tamara bowman,a broadspire peer reviewer specializing in internal medicine,reviewed smith records from april to september,the resource questionnaire,and smith july,statement.in her review dated december,bowman concluded that there were insufficient objective clinical findings to support the conclusion that donovan was unable to perform any occupation.specifically,bowman found that although the claimant is noted to have low back and leg pain,there was no documentation of objective muscle weakness,signs of radiculopathy,abnormal deformity or effusion or synovitis.she also found that there was no documentation of any radiographic abnormalities,and no evidence of a herniated disc or spinal canal stenosis.broadspire issued a denial letter on february,and indicated that,based on an employability assessment report,donovan could work as a claims clerk,waitress,and counter attendant in a cafeteria.

on june,donovan filed a second appeal.she submitted an affidavit outlining her subjective complaints about her daily activities.further,donovan challenged broadspire functional capacity evaluation,which concluded that she was able to work eight hours a day,contending that the evaluation only lasted several hours,and she was unable to do anything the next day because she was sore.as such,she alleged,the evaluation only established that she could perform certain tasks on a good day.
