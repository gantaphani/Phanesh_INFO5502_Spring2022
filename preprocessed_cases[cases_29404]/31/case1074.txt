statutory text 
california health safety code was enacted in and amended in and the original statute read

application 
pacificare denied garcia claim based solely on an express exclusion in its policy it did not contest the medical necessity of myoelectric prosthetic devices for garcia medical condition.garcia agrees the plan expressly excludes coverage for myoelectric prosthetic devices,but she argues that a requires plans to cover any prosthetic device if it is medically necessary and prescribed by a physician.

the parties agree that,as enacted in,the original version of the statute only required plans to offer coverage for prosthetic devices the statute afforded complete discretion to the plans to negotiate the terms and conditions of prosthetics coverage thus,if the version of the statute were still in effect,there would be no question about the correctness of pacificare position plans would be obliged to offer coverage for prosthetic devices,but the type of prosthetic devices offered would be negotiable as a term or condition to be agreed upon by the parties.
section has been amended twice since it was adopted,and those amendments are the focus of the parties briefing.the amendment limited the ability of plans to cap the amount of benefits for prosthetic devices it did not address the scope of coverage,the type or types of devices that plans must offer,or cover.accordingly,the amendment is not dispositive of garcia argument,which hinges instead on the extent to which the amendment changed the plan discretion to negotiate the types of prosthetics it will cover as a term and condition of coverage.
pacificare argues that has always required and continues to require that prosthetic coverage must be offered on terms and conditions mutually agreed upon,and that the amendment only requires that whatever coverage is offered must extend to both original and replacement devices.garcia views the amendment much more expansively.she argues that the amendment transformed the statute from a mandate to offer into a mandate to cover.far from the unfettered discretion permitted by the original terms and conditions language,garcia reading of the amendment prevents plans from adopting terms and conditions that defeat what she interprets to be the california legislature decision to mandate that medically necessary prosthetics,prescribed by physicians,must be covered.specifically,garcia argues that the amendment requires the provision of all original and replacement prosthetic devices prescribed by a physician that are medically necessary.
there is some basis for both interpretations of the statute,but for several reasons we ultimately agree with pacificare.to begin,garcia interpretation of the amendment requires coverage for all prosthetic devices prescribed by a physician subject to a review for necessity,and,as pacificare notes,the ame
