plaintiffs,former employees of west,and qwest communications international,qwest,filed this putative class action pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,challenging certain amendments to an employee benefit plan that purported to eliminate a pensioner death benefit.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.plaintiffs now appeal from that ruling.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
a.the west and qwest pension plansthe west pension plans 
effective january,west was created as a result of a divestiture of the american telephone telegraph company at t local telephone operations.the divestiture transaction also created two separate pension plans,both of which were established as successors to similar at t pension plans the west pension plan occupational pension plan and the west management pension plan management pension plan.these two pension plans included what was called the death benefit plan,which provided for death benefits to be paid to certain survivors of employees and retirees.the death benefit plan included three components the sickness death benefit,which provided death benefits in the event an active employee died as a result of sickness or injury the accidental death benefit,which provided death benefits in the event an active employee died from an accident and the pensioner death benefit.the pensioner death benefit provided death benefits to certain qualified beneficiaries,if they existed,of retired employees receiving a service or disability pension.more specifically,the pensioner death benefit,which was generally equivalent to twelve months wages as of the retired employee date of retirement,was paid to a mandatory beneficiary,which included an eligible surviving spouse,a spouse living with the retiree at the time of the retiree death,eligible dependent children dependent children up to age,an eligible dependent parent,a dependent parent living with or near the retiree,or other beneficiaries which encompassed a wider circle of dependent family members.app.at.if no mandatory beneficiary existed,then the benefit was not paid,except for a discretionary burial expense of up to.also,if a retiree otherwise eligible mandatory beneficiary filed suit against qwest in connection with the retiree death,no benefit was paid.
the two pension plans each contained a reservation of rights clause reserving for the respective plan sponsor the power and authority to alter the benefits thereunder.those clauses each stated,in pertinent part 
the west employees benefit committee,with the consent of the chairman of the board and subject to the approval of the board of directors may from time to time make changes in the plan as set forth in this document,and the company may terminate said plan,but such changes or termination shall not affect the rights of any employee,without his consent,to any benefit or pension to which he may have previously become entitled hereunder.
the revisions to the west pension plans 
effective january,west merged its two pension plans into one the pension plan,and,in doing so,effectively revised certain provisions of the two plans.in particular,of the pension plan,entitled termination of death benefits,provided as follows 
effective february,the provisions of this article vii covering death benefits shall not apply to individuals first hired on or after march.the survivors of any individual first hired on or after march,shall not be entitled to any benefits under this article vii.individuals who have a term of employment that includes any period prior to march,including individuals who are on or after march,and whose term of employment is bridged so that it includes periods before march,shall be entitled to a frozen benefit under this article vii as of february.for purposes of calculating the frozen benefit,wages under section shall be based on the last twelve months of employment preceding march.
id.at.in short,limited eligibility for the pensioner death benefit to individuals hired on or before march,and it prospectively froze the payment level for the benefit.
the pension plan,like the two preceding plans,included a reservation of rights clause 
u s west expects this plan to be permanent,but as future conditions can not be foreseen it reserves the right to amend the plan at any time,without prior notice to anyone.amendments may modify the rights and interests of employees who are participants in the plan at the time thereof as well as future participants but amendments may not diminish the accrued benefit of any participant as of the effective date of such amendment or divert any funds in the trust to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries.
lastly,the pension plan,unlike the two preceding plans,expressly defined the term accrued benefit to exclude any death benefits.id.at.
the revision to the west pension plan 
effective january,the pension plan was amended to allow certain management employees to elect a lump sum payout of their retirement benefits,and to include in that lump sum payout a discounted version of the pensioner death benefit the dls equivalent that assumed the retiree would be survived by a beneficiary.if a management employee elected to receive this discounted version of the pensioner death benefit in his or her lump sum payout,no other death benefit wa s payable at any time,including the participant death id.at.these amendments to the death benefit provisions applied only to ordinary retirements,and not as part of any early retirement program.further,the amendments did not materially alter the definition of accrued benefit in other words,death benefits were not considered to be accrued benefits under the plan.
the qwest plan 
in,qwest acquired and merged with west.as a result of this merger,the pension plan as amended in was replaced by the qwest pension plan the plan,and qwest became the plan sponsor.the qwest employee benefit committee the committee was the plan named fiduciary and was responsible for,among other things,administration of the plan,including appointment of other fiduciaries and interpretation of the plan provisions.
the plan was similar in all relevant respects to its predecessor plans.in particular,the plan included a death benefits section that effectively provided for payment of a pensioner death benefit to the qualified beneficiary of any employee hired prior to march.id.at.also,consistent with the amendments to the pension plan,the plan allowed for certain employees to receive,as part of a lump sum payout at retirement,the dls equivalent.further,the plan expressly defined the phrase accrued benefit to exclude any death benefits.lastly,the plan included a reservation of rights provision that read 
the company expects this plan to be permanent,but as future conditions can not be foreseen it reserves the right to amend the plan at any time,without prior notice to anyone amendments may modify the rights and interests of employees who are participants in the plan at the time thereof as well as future participants but amendments may not diminish the accrued benefit as defined in section d of the code of any participant as of the effective date of such amendment.
amendment to the plan 
in late,the plan design committee enacted amendment.amendment,in pertinent part,amended the plan to eliminate the pensioner death benefit,including the dls equivalent option,for employees retiring on or after january.

c.this litigation 
on march,kerber,phelps,west,meister,and ingemann the plaintiffs filed suit against the qwest pension plan,qwest employees benefit committee,and qwest.plaintiffs twice amended their complaint,first on may,and again on november.
in the preliminary statement section of their second amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged that f or many decades,a stable feature of the qwest pension plan and predecessor plans ha d been the pension er death benefit,id.at,and that qwest and its predecessors ha d a long history of treating the pension er death benefit as an accrued or protected pension benefit payable from trust fund assets,id.at.plaintiffs noted that,pursuant to amendment,qwest had amended the plan so as to eliminate the pension er death benefit for persons retiring on or after january,and alleged that a n actual controversy exist ed between themselves and defendants as to whether this amendment wa s illegal and whether the pension er death benefit should be treated as a vested,protected or accrued defined pension benefit under the plan.id.accordingly,plaintiffs alleged they were asserting claims for relief under erisa to clarify plan participants rights to future pension er death benefits under the terms of the p lan and for other declaratory,injunctive and appropriate equitable relief.id.at.
the second amended complaint asserted four claims for relief.the first claim for relief asserted a breach of fiduciary duty and equitable estoppel arising out of defendants alleged failure to disclose material information.id.at.more specifically,this claim alleged that p rior to december,none of the defendants made a formal disclosure in the spds summary plan descriptions distributed to the plaintiffs and other plan participants advising that the pension er death benefit was not a vested or protected benefit or that the pension er death benefit could either be reduced or eliminated even in the absence of a plan termination.id.at.the claim further alleged that the position adopted via amendment that the pension er death benefit c ould be either reduced or eliminated was never disclosed to the plaintiffs or other plan participants when they were making their respective retirement choices.id.at.in connection with this claim,plaintiffs sought,in pertinent part,a declaration that the pension er death benefit was a vested,protected or accrued pension benefit,not subject to reduction or elimination absent a plan termination,and an order forbidding defendants and successors from ever altering,modifying,or eliminating or terminating the plaintiffs and other plan participants expected pension er death benefits in the absence of a plan termination.id.at.
the second claim for relief,entitled violations due to illegal elimination of pension er death benefit,id.at,alleged that in four consecutive years beginning in,the plan sponsor,acting pursuant to the provisions of section h and of the internal revenue code,made qualified transfers and use d excess assets in the pension plan to fund retiree medical benefits for persons who we re retired participants in the plan.id.at.the claim further alleged that,i n accordance with the requirements of internal revenue code,and applicable federal regulations,each such qualified transfer resulted in the plaintiffs pension benefits,including the pension er death benefit,bec oming nonforfeitable id.at.in turn,the claim alleged that amendment violate d the provisions of erisa section g,g,since accrued benefits ha d been reduced or eliminated.id.at.based upon these allegations,the second claim for relief sought a an order reforming the plan by striking amendment and b an order requiring the plan to notify and make payment of the correct amount of the pension er death benefit to each plan participant and qualified beneficiary to whom the pension er death benefit became payable after january.id.
the third claim for relief,entitled erisa section a b claim to clarify future rights to the pension er death benefit,sought a declaration that those persons receiving a monthly pension annuity and their mandatory beneficiaries,to the extent there we re any at time of death,we re entitled to the pension er death benefit from the plan,id.at,and that all persons who retired on or after january,and received a lump sum distribution we re entitled to an additional lump sum payment representing the unpaid pension er death benefit,plus interest,id.at.
the fourth claim for relief,entitled erisa section a claim to correct faulty plan documents,including spd,alleged that qwest ha d issued a current spd which falsely state d the pension er death benefit wa s a welfare benefit,subject to reduction or elimination at any time,and sought an order requiring defendants to correct the faulty language in the spd and issue a corrected spd with language disclosing the pension er death benefit wa s a vested,protected or accrued defined pension benefit,not subject to reduction or elimination absent a plan termination,id.at.
defendants moved to dismiss,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the second and third claims for relief set forth in the second amended complaint,as asserted by plaintiffs kerber and phelps.the motion noted that kerber and phelps,both retirees,d id not allege that qwest announced any intention to discontinue providing the pensioner death benefit to retirees id.at.on october,the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants motion to dismiss.id.at.in doing so,the district court concluded that kerber and phelps lacked standing to bring the second claim for relief because they each retired in,yet claim two assert ed violations caused by,and s ought remedies for,the adoption of amendment which eliminated the death benefit for plan participants who retired on or after january.id.at.the district court also concluded,with respect to the third claim for relief,that kerber and phelps had asserted a valid claim in that they allege d that they ha d made irrevo c able retirement decisions based on the prior definition of pensioner death benefit as a protected one and we re unable to adjust their retirement plans to address the benefit as one that c ould be eliminated at any time.id.at.
defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment with respect to all remaining claims.on september,the district court issued an order granting defendants motion in its entirety.turning first to claim three of the second amended complaint,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to establish that the pensioner death benefit was either an accrued pension benefit or a welfare benefit that contractually vested by virtue of the plan language and was,therefore,protected from reduction or elimination by erisa rule.id.at.more specifically,the district court concluded the pensioner death benefit d id not meet erisa definition of a pension benefit because it d id not provide retirement income to employees,or result in a deferral of income.id.at.further,the district court noted that plaintiffs had failed to offer any authority to support their assertion that the pensioner death benefit change d its character upon inclusion in a lump sum pay out of accrued retirement benefits upon early retirement,selection of the dls equivalent,id.at,and it concluded that i nclusion of the pensioner death benefit in the lump sum election d id not change it into an accrued pension benefit.id.at.the district court also rejected plaintiffs argument that the pensioner death benefit was a subsidy under erisa provision,g a.finally,the district court rejected the notion that the pensioner death benefit had contractually vested by way of the payment priority status of the pensioner death benefit in the plan termination clauses,or as a result of language in the various plans and spds stating that the pensioner death benefit w ould be paid and that beneficiaries were entitled to collect the pensioner death benefit.
the district court next turned to claim two of the second amended complaint.the district court noted that the plaintiffs,in their response to defendants summary judgment motion,did not address their assertion that the pensioner death benefit vested when the plan sponsor transferred assets under section of the irc,and,t o the extent the plaintiffs continue d to assert this claim,they d id not cite any plan language that constitute d the clear and express language of vesting required under this court decision in chiles ceridian,cir.id.at.
in addressing claim one of the second amended complaint,the district court first noted that plaintiffs,in their response to defendants summary judgment motion,assert ed that since amendment violate d the provisions of erisa section g,they could prove their claim that plan fiduciaries ha d violated erisa section a duties to comply with erisa statutory requirements.id.the district court rejected this theory,noting that under the supreme court decision in hughes aircraft jacobson,d,p lan sponsors who alter the terms of a plan do not fall into the category of fiduciaries,and in turn concluding that defendants were not acting as fiduciaries when implementing amendment id.as for plaintiff claim for equitable estoppel,the district court first noted that this court ha d neither adopted nor rejected an equitable estoppel rule in the erisa context.id.at quoting cannon group health serv.of,cir.assuming for purposes of argument that this court would adopt such a rule,the district court concluded that plaintiffs equitable estoppel claim fail ed as a matter of law because there wa s an absence of misrepresentation of any term of the plan which would trigger the plaintiffs reasonable detrimental reliance.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,addressing claim four of the second amended complaint,the district court concluded it was redundant of claims one and two,and that defendants were thus entitled to summary judgment on the claim.id.at.
judgment was entered in the case on september.plaintiffs subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.
plaintiffs challenge,on five separate grounds,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the party.potts davis county,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.
did amendment violate erisa rule 
in their first issue on appeal,plaintiffs contend the district court erred in concluding that amendment,to the extent it eliminated the dls equivalent,did not violate erisa rule.according to plaintiffs,the uncontroverted facts establish that amendment violated the rule because,by eliminating the dls equivalent,it either impermissibly eliminated an early subsidy or impermissibly reduced an early retirement benefit.aplt.br.at.
w hen congress enacted erisa it wanted to mak e sure that if a worker ha d been promised a defined pension benefit upon if he ha d fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested actually w ould receive it.lockheed spink,d quoting nachman pension benefit guar,d.erisa rule,set forth in g,is crucial to this object cent.laborers pension fund heinz,d.the rule provides,in pertinent part 
the accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan,other than an amendment described in section d or of this title.
for purposes of paragraph,a plan amendment which has the effect of 
a eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a subsidy as defined in regulations,or 
b eliminating an optional form of benefit,
with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits.in the case of a subsidy,the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies either before or after the amendment the preamendment conditions for the subsidy.
the general question thus posed here is whether amendment,by eliminating the dls equivalent for employees retiring on or after january,effectively decreased an accrued benefit of plaintiffs under the plan erisa defines the phrase accrued benefit to mean,in the case of a defined benefit plan,the individual accrued benefit determined under the plan and,except as provided in section c of this title,expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age id.a.the phrase defined benefit plan,in turn,is generally defined under erisa as a pension plan other than an individual account plan id.lastly,the rule itself expressly includes early retirement benefits and subsidies within the definition of accrued benefit.thus,in short,an accrued benefit is an individual right to a retirement benefit,including early retirement benefits and subsidies,under an erisa pension plan.
plaintiffs assert that the dls equivalent qualifies as an accrued benefit because it is either an early subsidy or an early retirement benefit.for the reasons outlined below,however,we reject both of these assertions.
the phrase subsidy,though employed in the provision,is not otherwise defined in erisa.in steiner.retirement plan johnson higgins of,cir,this court concluded,after examining the legislative history of erisa,that the term subsidy,as employed in the phrase subsidy,refers to a benefit that continu es after retirement,and thus does not include a lump sump payment payable in full to an employee upon retirement.id.at quoting,sess,reprinted in.the legislative history referred to by this court in steiner states,in pertinent part,as follows 
the bill provides that the term subsidy is to be defined by treasury regulations.the committee intends that under these regulations,a subsidy that continues after retirement is generally to be considered a subsidy.the committee expects,however,that a qualified disability benefit,a medical benefit,a social security supplement,a death benefit including life insurance,or a plant shutdown benefit that does not continue after retirement age will not be considered a subsidy.
at,reprinted in,emphasis added.
although the district court did not cite to steiner,it took specific note of the legislative history and concluded,on the basis thereof,that congress did not intend to include death benefits within the definition of subsidies.app.at.plaintiffs indirectly attack this conclusion by arguing that a regulation adopted by the secretary of the treasury on august,has effectively overruled steiner interpretation of the phrase subsidy.that regulation,d g iv,defines the phrase subsidy to mean 
the excess,if any,of the actuarial present value of a benefit over the actuarial present value of the accrued benefit commencing at normal retirement age or at actual commencement date,if later,with both such actuarial present values determined as of the date the benefit commences.examples of subsidies include a subsidized early retirement benefit and a subsidized qualified joint and survivor annuity.
d g iv.in turn,the secretary of the treasury,in the same regulation,has defined the phrase benefit to mean a t he payment of a distribution alternative with respect to an accrued benefit or b t he payment of any other benefit under a defined benefit plan that is permitted to be in a qualified pension plan,continues after retirement,and is not an ancillary benefit.d g iii.lastly,the phrase defined benefit plan is defined under erisa to mean a pension plan other than an individual account plan.
notably,the district court expressly acknowledged this regulatory definition of subsidy in its order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.after quoting the regulatory definition,the district court noted that the plaintiffs had include d the definition in a footnote,but d id not explain how it applie d to the facts of this case.app.at citing response,at.the district court ultimately concluded that t he plaintiffs argument wa s conclusory and inadequately developed.id.more specifically,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had fail ed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that the pensioner death benefit fits into the department of treasury definition or any other definition of a subsidy,and in particular they fail ed to create a material fact dispute regarding whether the pensioner death benefit wa s a subsidy subject to erisa provision.id.
although plaintiffs continue to cite the regulatory definition of subsidy in their opening appellate brief,they have again failed to provide any substantive explanation as to why the pensioner death benefit fits within this regulatory definition.instead,they simply assert,in conclusory fashion,that this clarifying definition should be applied to the facts of this case and the dls equivalent declared to be a bona fide subsidy.aplt.br.at.we therefore reject,as inadequately briefed,plaintiffs argument that the dls equivalent constitutes a subsidy.see generally gross burggraf constr,cir holding that issues not adequately briefed will not be considered on appeal.
even if we were to overlook the shortcomings in the plaintiffs appellate brief,we would readily conclude that the dls equivalent does not constitute a subsidy for purposes of erisa provision.to begin with,nothing in the treasury definitional regulation undercuts,and indeed could not undercut,the relevant legislative history of the provision cited in steiner,which clearly suggests that the term subsidy was intended to refer to benefits that continue over a period of time following retirement.in other words,the holding in steiner that lump sum payments do not qualify as a subsidy remains valid,notwithstanding promulgation of the treasury definitional regulation.and,applying steiner holding to the facts of this case,it is indisputable that the dls equivalent does not continue over a period of time following retirement,but rather is a payment.
further,the dls equivalent does not fall within the treasury definition of subsidy because it does not qualify as a benefit.although the dls equivalent could arguably be called a distribution alternative to the normal method of payment of the pensioner death benefit,the pensioner death benefit itself does not qualify as an accrued benefit under erisa.at the time the dls equivalent was created in,the pension plan the plan then in place expressly defined the term accrued benefit to exclude any death benefits,including the dls equivalent.thus,a person reading the plan,as amended in,could not reasonably conclude that the dls equivalent relate d to an accrued benefit by paying out an accumulated amount of accrued benefits.in re lucent,cir.moreover,as the term accrued itself suggests,a n accrued benefit under erisa represents the interest in a retirement benefit that a participant earns each year ashenbaugh crucible,salaried ret.plan,cir quotation omitted.in this case,it is undisputed that neither the pensioner death benefit in general,nor the dls equivalent in particular,accrue in any fashion with an employee years of service.thus,neither can reasonably be deemed an accrued benefit for purposes of erisa.
early retirement benefit 
plaintiffs argue,in the alternative,that the dls equivalent constitutes an early retirement benefit under the provision erisa does not contain a definition of the phrase early retirement benefit.instead,congress contemplated that the treasury department would promulgate regulations setting forth a definition of this phrase.bellas cbs,cir citing g a.on august,the secretary of the treasury promulgated a regulation defining the phrase early retirement benefit to mean the right,under the terms of a plan,to commence distribution of a benefit at a particular date after severance from employment with the employer and before normal retirement age.d g i.as previously noted,that same regulation,in turn,defined the phrase benefit to mean a t he payment of a distribution alternative with respect to an accrued benefit or b t he payment of any other benefit under a defined benefit plan that is permitted to be in a qualified pension plan,continues after retirement,and is not an ancillary benefit.d g iii.lastly,the phrase defined benefit plan is defined under erisa to mean a pension plan other than an individual account plan.
although the dls equivalent,by its express terms,was payable to certain management employees at the time of their retirement,it otherwise does not fall within the treasury definition of the term early retirement benefit.in particular,for the reasons discussed above in the analysis of plaintiffs argument that the dls equivalent qualifies as a subsidy,it is clear that the dls equivalent does not qualify as a benefit,and thus,in turn,can not qualify as an early retirement benefit.
was the pensioner death benefit contractually vested 
plaintiffs next contend,in challenging the district court grant of summary judgment,that even if amendment did not violate erisa rule,it violated the terms of the plan reservation of rights clause,which they contend effectively served as a private clause.aplt.br.at.in support of this contention,plaintiffs note that the reservation of rights clause prohibited any amendments to the plan that served to diminish the accrued benefit as defined in section d of the code of any participant as of the effective date of such amendment,id.at quoting app.at,and they argue that the dls equivalent was an accrued benefit that was not only diminished,but indeed eliminated,by amendment.
we readily reject plaintiffs arguments.as the language from the plan indicates,the phrase accrued benefit,as employed in the plan reservation of rights clause,carries the same meaning as in section d of the internal revenue code.section d of the irc,d,is the irc duplicate version of erisa rule.see cent.laborers pension fund,at.noting that erisa and the irc have a curious duplicate structure with regard to their provisions regarding employee pension plans internal quotations omitted.and,as discussed in substantial detail above,it is clear that neither the pensioner death benefit,nor its dls equivalent component,qualify as accrued benefits under erisa and the relevant treasury regulations.thus,for those same reasons,the dls equivalent can not qualify as an accrued benefit under the plan reservation of rights clause.
plaintiffs also make passing references that could perhaps be generously construed as asserting that the pensioner death benefit the dls equivalent were welfare benefits that were contractually vested for other reasons and thus protected from being reduced or eliminated,aplt.br.at even if the pdb is a welfare benefit,it was inseparably tied to the formula for the protected early retirement benefit,s ince the single sum benefit with the dls equivalent of the death benefit is a protected benefit which causes the pdb to be a protected benefit,due to the irc section transfers there should be a declaration identifying plan participants for whom the benefits are fully vested.notably,however,plaintiffs fail to flesh out these arguments sufficiently to create genuine issues for purposes of appeal.moreover,the district court rejected the notion that the pensioner death benefit had contractually vested,and plaintiffs have made no attempt to challenge any of the particular bases for the district court conclusion in that regard.
dismissal of kerber and phelps from count two for lack of standing 
in their second issue on appeal,plaintiffs contend the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs kerber and phelps from count two of the second amended complaint on the basis that each retired in,and the complaint does not allege that they have suffered any concrete,particularized,and actual injury from the implementation of amendment.id.at quoting app.at.according to plaintiffs,section a of erisa,a,provides a cause of action to any participant or beneficiary to seek equitable relief.aplt.br.at.because kerber and phelps sought injunctive relief to redress violations of the plan terms and violations of the statute,plaintiffs argue,they have both article iii constitutional and erisa section a statutory standing to pursue count two.id.lastly,plaintiffs argue that kerber and phelps need not demonstrate actual harm in
