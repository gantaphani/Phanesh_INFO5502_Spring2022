john martin,john samuels,and william shoaf collectively appellants,retirees from wheeling national bank,both individually and on behalf of a class of retirement plan participants,brought this action under the employee retirement income security act erisa a,a,claiming additional pension benefits attributable to employee contributions they made to the american bancorporation pension plan prior to.four years after the suit was commenced,the parties each moved for summary judgment.the district court denied appellants motion for summary judgment due to the preclusive effects of res judicata and its finding that the plan administrator correctly calculated the benefits of all named plan participants.however,the district court granted american bancorporation retirement plan american bancorporation motion for summary judgment because of its finding that the plan administrator had correctly calculated the benefits of all named plan participants.id.
because we find that appellants claims were not barred by res judicata,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for american bancorporation and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
a.the retirement plan.
established in,the aetna retirement plan aetna plan,predecessor to the american bancorporation retirement plan challenged in this case,was a contributory defined benefit plan,meaning that it provided pension benefits as defined by a formula set forth in the retirement plan.the aetna plan also contained an employee contribution provision,which mandated that participants contribute toward funding their benefits,with the balance of the funding and the risk of investment losses falling on the employer.under this type of plan participants have a right to a certain level of accrued benefits,but no right to the assets of the plan.
in march and december of,the aetna plan underwent a series of important amendments.these amendments involved the adoption of a plan developed by state mutual life insurance company,and created the incarnation of the retirement plan currently before this court the plan.first,this series of amendments eliminated the employee contribution provision of the aetna plan.additionally,the march altered the retirement compensation scheme such that employees received a flat percentage pension equal to of their average salary for the last five years of their employment.however,and critical to the issues in this case,both company documents and executive statements belie a flat compensation program.a summary plan description spd entitled your retirement plan,dated august,described the benefits as of a participant monthly earnings plus an amount equal to the amount of contributions made by any participants who were active in the plan before a specific date.a similar interpretation was expressed when an executive committee of the board of directors of wheeling national bank met to discuss the retirement plan.at that meeting,as described by the district court,the committee noted 
that the original proposal called for a plan with a retirement benefit of of base salary.however,the committee further noted that what had been installed was a plan which would provide a benefit of of annual salary.the committee explained that employees who were participants in the aetna plan would receive plus their contributions to the aetna plan with accrued interest.the combined benefits to participants of the aetna plan would be approximately of the annual salary at retirement date for those employees.
the aetna plan was further amended in december of.under these amendments,employees received a flat percentage pension equal to of their average salary for the last five years of their employment the american bancorporation retirement was further amended in,such that all benefit accruals ended on december.
mckain suit.
william mckain mckain retired from wheeling national bank on march,at the time of his retirement,mckain had acquired over years of service for american bancorporation.id.at.in april of,mckain applied for the distribution of his pension benefits and received a check in the amount of.american bancorporation used the benefit calculation to arrive at this figure.upon receipt of this check,mckain filed a claim for additional benefits under the plan,maintaining that he was entitled to a benefit or a benefit with interest.the plan administrator rejected this challenge.mckain subsequent appeal of that decision was also denied.when mckain then expressed his intent to file suit on the matter american bancorporation filed a declaratory judgment action to resolve the proper earnings formula to determine mckain pension benefits.
in that declaratory judgment action mckain moved for summary judgment contending that the resolutions adopted in march of by the board of directors of wheeling national bank constituted an amendment to the retirement plan.mckain argued that this amendment established a benefit equal to of compensation.american bancorporation countered that the benefit plan was never implemented as clarified during the earlier referenced meeting of an executive committee of the board of directors of wheeling national bank,and that mckain was estopped from relying upon the benefit because the spd stated that the benefit was.the district court granted mckain motion for summary judgment,finding that the aetna plan was properly amended in march of to provide benefits of,and again in december of to provide benefits id.at.ultimately,the district court ruled that mckain had a vested benefit equal to of his compensation.id.at.
thereafter,the parties settled upon a calculation method and the exact amount of mckain benefits.in its order approving of the settlement between the parties,the district court described the plan as calling for the benefit to be a percentage of earnings averaged over five consecutive years of plan participation,which will give the participant the highest benefit possible.id.at.brent richmond richmond,the plan administrator,employing the calculation approved by the district court,determined mckain benefit under the settlement by calculating the benefit under two separate formulae one of which was based on percent of compensation and a second formula,which was based on a percent of compensation.id.at.applying these formulae to mckain earnings,richmond determined that the first calculation produced a higher benefit.therefore,mckain received a benefit.
to reach the actual amount of mckain benefit,the analysis becomes more complex the plan basic retirement benefit is generally stated as an amount payable if the participant remains in covered employment until his normal retirement date nrd,generally age.those who terminated employment before age received less than full benefits.the plan calculated this benefit reduction through a mathematical factor known as an accrued benefit adjustment aba factor.the aba factor is a ratio in which the numerator represents the participant actual years of service,and the denominator represents projected service through the nrd.the ratio is balanced where the same start date is used to calculate both the numerator and denominator,unbalanced where it is not.under a balanced ratio,any time a person retires before their nrd the aba factor would be less than,resulting in less than full benefits after the participant benefit is multiplied by that factor.
appellants contend that mckain benefit was calculated incorrectly,using an aba factor of the equivalent of having a fully accrued benefit,despite the fact that mckain benefit was calculated using a date that was a full five years before his nrd.specifically,in calculating mckain benefit,american bancorporation employed an unbalanced ratio,using his actual start date as opposed to the date he began participation in the pension program for the numerator,and the date he began participating in the pension program for the denominator.the end date used to calculate the numerator mckain actual years of service was given that mckain began working at american bancorporation on,his numerator was projected nrd was.therefore,because mckain began participating in the program on,his denominator mckain projected service through his nrd was.this unbalanced ratio produced an aba factor of,entitling mckain to full benefits 
according to appellants,this calculation granted mckain a larger benefit than that to which he was entitled.in fact,american bancorporation own expert,michael pisula,testified that given mckain raw data,and the parameters of the plan,the only way to achieve an aba factor of for mckain was to simply make it up or to use an unbalanced aba.id.at.importantly,he further testified that the language of the plan in no way supports the use of an unbalanced aba.id.
general recalculations.
after the mckain settlement,american bancorporation applied the same calculation it used for mckain to all other plan participants.similar to mckain calculation,where an employee had years of service prior to the inception of the aetna plan,an unbalanced aba was used.additionally,richmond calculated benefits under both the and formulae,awarding employees the larger of the two,as was done in the mckain matter finally,the numerator end date of was used,as it was in mckain,because the program was no longer in effect in december of that year.
current action.
on september,appellants brought this action both as a class and as a derivative action,claiming additional pension benefits attributable to employee contributions they made to the plan prior to.appellants main contention before the district court was that employees other than mckain received benefits that were less than those promised by the plan because the recalculations did not pay employees their rightful benefits as set out in the august spd and produced arbitrary results.appellants allege that american bancorporation employed this calculation because they knew they would save by paying out benefits without repaying contributions.
specifically,appellants brought suit under a b of erisa,a b,seeking to recover benefits due to them under the terms of their plan,to enforce their rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify their rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan,alleging that american bancorporation miscalculated mckain benefits and that the result of said miscalculations was that members of the class are due additional benefits.appellants also sought equitable relief under a of erisa,a,seeking to enjoin american bancorporation practices such as the failure to give notice required under erisa h,the failure to file certain documents with the department of labor,the failure to provide appellants with an adequate explanation for the denial of their benefits as required by of erisa,and the failure to comply with the benefit accrual requirements of of erisa.appellants finally charged that american bancorporation failed to administer the plan in accordance with their fiduciary duties under erisa,and violated of erisa,by administering and interpreting the plan in a manner contrary to its written terms.
american bancorporation eventually moved for summary judgment under,contending that appellants claims were effectively decided by the mckain order establishing the law regarding the plan and its calculations.in august of,the district court granted the motion in part.specifically,the district court granted the motion with respect to issues concerning the amendment of the plan and the use of the and benefit factors,finding that collateral estoppel barred further litigation.however,the district court denied the motion with respect to the remaining issues,in particular the calculation of benefits under the aba factor.after the issuance of this order,appellants almost immediately requested findings of fact and conclusions of law.
in relevant part,the district court made the following findings of fact the mckain order concluded that the amendment was properly adopted in march of and that the amendment was properly adopted in december of the same year the mckain order made no reference to the aba factor or how to determine such a factor and appellants in this case provided some degree of financial support to mckain in his litigation.id.at.importantly,the district court concluded as a matter of law that 
the only amendments to the plan to which collateral estoppel applies are the march,december and january amendments that are the subject of discussion in the mckain case orders entered march,and september.by stating that collateral estoppel applies as to the amendment of the plan under such amendments,the court is referring to the plan having satisfied its own written terms with which compliance is required for an amendment to have actually taken place,which issue was specifically reviewed by judge stamp in the mckain case.
id.at emphasis added.
appellants subsequent request for clarification of these findings of fact and conclusions of law was denied,with the court stating fourth circuit precedence sic,res judicata,collateral estoppel and the facts in this matter and the mckain matter sufficiently deter the court from allowing the parties to relitigate the h notice issue surrounding the march,december and january plan amendments.id.at.
finally,both sides moved for summary judgment in january of.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation r r on the opposing summary judgment motions.specifically,the r r recommended that american bancorporation motion for summary judgment be granted because the plan administrator correctly followed the district court previous orders and correctly calculated the benefits of all named plan participants.id.at.the r r also recommended that appellants motion for summary judgment be denied due to the preclusive effects of res judicata and this court finding that the plan administrator correctly calculated the benefits of all named plan participants.id.on march,the district court adopted the r r on the summary judgment motions.this ruling barred appellants claims.from that decision,appellants bring this appeal.
appellants first challenge the district court grant of summary judgment to american bancorporation based on its finding that res judicata bars appellants claims.our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo,applying the same legal standards applied by the district court.elliott sara lee,cir.
res judicata or claim preclusion precludes the assertion of a claim after a judgment on the merits in a prior suit by the parties or their privies based on the same cause of action.pueschel united states,cir.for the doctrine of res judicata to be applicable,there must be a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and the later suit and an identity of parties or their privies in the two suits.id.appellants argue that the third element of res judicata,identity of parties or their privies,is not satisfied on the facts of this case.specifically,appellants argue that the district court erred in finding the existence of privity in this case because the district court applied the more liberal virtual representation standard enunciated by the eighth circuit in tyus schoemehl,cir,as opposed to applying the more stringent virtual representation standard enunciated by this circuit in klugh united states,cir.we agree 
to be in privity with a party to a former litigation,the must be so identified in interest with a party to former litigation that he represents precisely the same legal right in respect to the subject matter involved.jones sec,cir citing nash county bd.of educ.biltmore,cir.however,an exact definition of privity is an elusive concept.see nash,at.as this court stated in nash,privity is merely a word used to say that the relationship between the one who is a party on the record and another is close enough to include that other within the res judicata.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted 
there are three generally recognized categories of who will be considered in privity with a party to the prior action and who will therefore be bound by a prior adjudication a who controls the original action a to a prior party and a whose interests were adequately represented by a party to the original action.see generally wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure jurisdiction ed.the third category,that of adequate representation,also known as virtual representation,is that which is contested here.see american forest resource council shea,d,the doctrine of virtual representation,which falls under the adequately represented category.
in this circuit,virtual representation has been defined narrowly.in klugh,we stated 
because the doctrine of virtual representation applies principles of res judicata to nonparties to a judgment,the doctrine must cautiously be applied in order to avoid infringing on principles of due process the doctrine of virtual representation does not authorize application of a bar to relitigation of a claim by a nonparty to the original judgment where the interests of the parties to the different actions are separate or where the parties to the first suit are not accountable to the nonparties who file a subsequent suit.in addition,a party acting as a virtual representative for a nonparty must do so with at least the tacit approval of the court.
at citations omitted emphasis added defining the tacit approval requirement,we cited to the restatement second of judgments,which states the essential question is whether there is a disclosed relationship in which the party is accorded authority to appear as a party on behalf of others.id.citing restatement second of judgments,cmt.b.
in spite of this clear,binding precedent,the r r,which the district court adopted,applies the rule employed by those courts that permit wider use of virtual representation,and specifically cited tyus schoemehl,cir.however,as the r r correctly notes,courts are sharply divided on how to implement virtual representation.in fact,tyus expressly disagrees with our own precedent,citing klugh as placing our circuit within a group of courts who would permit a nonparty to be bound by a prior judgment under a theory of virtual representation only in very limited,technical situations.tyus,at.the tyus court went on to state w e agree with those courts that give wider use to virtual representation.this liberal use better accommodates the competing considerations of judicial economy and due process.id.at.given the existence of binding circuit precedent to the contrary,following tyus was not a viable option.
applying our much more stringent standard to the facts of this case,we find that identity of parties does not exist.under our precedent in klugh,there can be no virtual representation where one of the parties to the first suit was not accountable to the nonparties who filed a subsequent suit and where the virtual representative for a nonparty did not have at least the tacit approval of the court.see at.the record discloses no point at which the district court in the mckain suit provided tacit approval to mckain to represent the other employee participants in the plan.in fact,it discloses exactly the opposite.long after the district court had already granted summary judgment to mckain on the substantive issues of the case,it denied mckain request for an injunction to protect the benefits of the other plan participants.specifically,it noted that t his issue was not addressed by the parties in the briefs or in any brief filed prior to the entry of judgment in this case.in other words,during the substantive portions of the case,the entire focus of the court was on mckain as an individual participant and there was no disclosed relationship in which mckain was accorded authority to appear as a party on behalf of appellants.thus,there was no tacit approval.
in apparent recognition that they can not satisfy the klugh standard,american bancorporation argues that klugh conflicts with our definition of privity in nash,and points to this court decision in mcmellon united states,cir en banc.in mcmellon,this court concluded that when there is an irreconcilable conflict between opinions issued by panels of this court,the first case to decide the issue is the one that must be followed.id.at.however,we find no such irreconcilable conflict here.nash presents a broad definition of the concept of privity,defining it as merely a word used to say that the relationship between the one who is a party on the record and another is close enough to include that other within the res judicata.nash,at.internal quotation marks omitted.klugh simply defines what it means to have a sufficiently close relationship in the context of virtual representation.we see no conflict here.
finally,we note that the mere fact that appellants helped to finance mckain suit is not sufficient,without other facts,to warrant the application of res judicata to this case.see general foods.of public health,cir noting the general rule that a is not bound by a judgment merely because he paid the expenses of a litigation.
as such,the district court erred in granting summary judgment on res judicata grounds.
american bancorporation contends that even if this court finds that the application of res judicata was not proper here,this court should still affirm the grant of summary judgment on the basis that collateral estoppel is appropriately applied to appellants claims.collateral estoppel forecloses the relitigation of an issue of fact or law if certain requirements are met.sedlack braswell services group,cir.in order to apply the doctrine,the proponent must establish that the issue sought to be precluded is identical to one previously litigated the issue was actually determined in the prior proceeding the determination of the issue was a critical and necessary part of the decision in the prior proceeding the prior judgment was final and valid and the party against whom estoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous forum.id.
american bancorporation argument fails because the issue of whether appellants are entitled to benefits was never actually determined.the record is unequivocal in that regard.as an initial matter,we note that the r r explicitly states that the issue of whether the participants were entitled to receive eec benefits was not directly litigated in the motions for summary judgment in the mckain case.further,the district court explicitly noted the narrow nature of the issue decided in the mckain order.there,the court noted that 
by stating that collateral estoppel applies as to the amendment of the plan under such amendments,the court is referring to the plan having satisfied its own written terms with which compliance is required for an amendment to have actually taken place,which issue was specifically reviewed by the district court in the mckain case.
id.at.in other words,the district court did not read the mckain order as having actually determined the issue of whether the employees were entitled to benefits,but instead read it as only finding that the plan was in fact amended in accordance with its own terms.
a reading of the mckain order supports this conclusion.the specific subject of that order was whether the amendments of march and december of were adopted in accordance with plan documents.under erisa,all plans must be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,which must describe the formal procedures by which the plan can be amended.a,b.after noting that mckain had originally maintained that he was entitled to either a or benefit,the mckain court framed the issue as follows 
in the motion for summary judgment,mckain contends that the resolutions adopted on march,by the board of directors of wheeling national bank constitute an amendment to the retirement plan.this amendment provides a benefit equal to of compensation.in the response to the motion for summary judgment,the plaintiffs contend that the benefit plan was never implemented as clarified by the executive committee meeting on november.
id.at.that issue is exactly what the mckain court decided,finding that the plan was properly amended in march of to provide benefits,and again in december of to provide benefits.
that,however,is a very different issue from whether or not appellants are entitled to benefits because the august spd so stated.as such,because this issue was not actually determined,we find that collateral estoppel is not properly applied here
