the court hereby vacates its prior opinion,filed july,and substitutes this opinion in lieu thereof.
dorothy hamilton hamilton appeals the grant of summary judgment entered in favor of company,allen.hamilton had sued allen for breach of fiduciary duty under the employee retirement income security act erisa.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
hamilton was employed by allen as a repair service operator,a job that required her to repeatedly manipulate heavy objects.sometime in she developed carpal tunnel syndrome,and by october,she was completely unable to perform her job as a result of her carpal tunnel syndrome and diabetes.she had surgery for her carpal tunnel syndrome,but with poor results.in february,she returned to work briefly,but had to quit after a couple of days,and never returned to work after that.hamilton applied and was granted social security disability benefits.
after hamilton realized that she could no longer work,she inquired of melba lee lee,allen human resources director,about whether she could qualify for disability.hamilton asserts that on this occasion and on several more occasions from until,lee stated that hamilton did not qualify.according to hamilton,lee also refused to give hamilton a claim form,and did not inform hamilton of the identity of the insurer for the disability plan.at allen,employees are required to go through the human resources department when they seek to apply for disability benefits.lee does not remember ever having turned hamilton away,but admits that she fields about calls every week and therefore,hamilton may have asked her for an application without her remembering the event.allen claims that pursuant to company policy,on march,a letter was mailed to hamilton containing the disability application.lee stated in her deposition that she did not know if that letter was ever sent and hamilton states that she never received it.
in,after another request by hamilton for a disability application,lee forwarded to her a health insurance claim instead.hamilton contacted the health insurer,cigna,which told her that all requests for benefits had to go through lee.cigna was not the insurer for the disability plan.therefore hamilton contacted lee again,who allegedly did not respond to hamilton further solicitations.
in,hamilton encountered several former allen employees who were all receiving disability benefits under allen disability plan.at this point,hamilton contacted lee again and this time received the correct application form for her disability insurer,unum insurance.hamilton returned the form to lee who sent it onto unum which denied hamilton claim on the basis that hamilton had not properly complied with the notice and requirements of the policy,claim was untimely.
in december,hamilton appealed the denial of her claim to unum.her basis for the appeal was that hamilton was required to go through lee before she could file a claim,had done so in a timely fashion,but was prevented from sending unum her application by lee.in fact,hamilton asserted that allen knew in september,that hamilton was having medical problems,and actually separated hamilton from work in october,for being unable to return to work.unum rejected her appeal,and hamilton filed suit against unum and allen in georgia state court.unum and allen removed to federal court and moved for summary judgment which the district court granted.hamilton only appeals the ruling as it pertains to allen and argues that she should prevail because allen is culpable for wrongfully denying hamilton her benefits and allen breached its fiduciary duty by failing to provide her with the necessary information needed to file her disability claim.
we review de novo an order granting summary judgment,applying the same legal standards as the district court.see wolf,cir.as such,the record has to be viewed in the light most favorable to the party.see holbrook city of alpharetta,cir.
wrongful denial 
the federal rules of civil procedure provide that a complaint contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,and a respective demand for that relief.see frcp a.a complaint need not specify in detail the precise theory giving rise to recovery.all that is required is that the defendant be on notice as to the claim being asserted against him and the grounds on which it rests.sams united food commercial workers international union,clc,cir evans mcclain of georgia,cir quoting sams,at plumbers steamfitters local vertex,cir same.
allen primary contention in the context of hamilton wrongful denial claim is that she has failed to raise it until now and therefore it should be deemed waived.the complaint which hamilton filed in state court states that the defendant company is hamilton former employer and the sponsor and administrator of the group disability plan.see complaint at.hamilton complaint further avers that this plan states that when the company receives proof than an insured is disabled due to sickness or injury and requires the regular attendance of a physician,the company will pay the insured a monthly benefit after the end of the elimination period.see complaint at.hamilton complaint seeks a reinstatement of her disability benefits based on a wrongful denial,and names both unum and allen as defendants.see complaint at.allen is also alleged as not having appropriately provided hamilton with the requested benefits application forms and thus not having appropriately forwarded hamilton request for benefits to unum.see complaint at.even though the complaint is not a model of clarity,the above allegations,along with the fact that allen was named as a defendant and the only relief sought was reinstatement of disability benefits based on a wrongful denial,should have put allen on notice that this claim was being leveled against it by hamilton.we conclude that hamilton complaint was sufficient to state a cause of action against allen for wrongful denial of benefits and that hamilton did not waive that claim.therefore,we will review hamilton appeal for wrongful denial of benefits on the merits.
erisa provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due under the terms of the plan.see a b.in the eleventh circuit,this section confers a right to sue the plan administrator for recovery of benefits.see rosen trw,cir.therefore,if the employer is administering the plan,then it can be held liable for erisa violations.see id.at.proof of who is the plan administrator may come from the plan document,but can also come from the factual circumstances surrounding the administration of the plan,even if these factual circumstances contradict the designation in the plan document.see id.at.
the key question on this issue is whether allen had sufficient decisional control over the claim process that would qualify it as a plan administrator under rosen.this requires an analysis of the facts surrounding the administration of the disability plan.the first fact is that the plan booklet states that any claim must be made to unum.this would seem to cut in allen favor.
however,hamilton offers testimony by lee to the effect that allen requires its employees to go through its human resources department in order to obtain an application for disability benefits.this fact places allen in sufficient control over the process to qualify as the plan administrator notwithstanding the language of the plan booklet.see law ernst young,cir.moreover,allen benefit choice booklet states plan,employee benefit programs,allen bradley company,the plan administrator has designed the identified insurance companies and the allen bradley company as its agents to administer the plan,to process all claims and appeals,and to provide other administrative services.emphasis added.hamilton points out that allen did carry out its administrative designation by handing out the claim forms itself without getting prior permission from unum,and by fielding questions about the plan from employees.hamilton also includes an excerpt of lee deposition that identifies milwaukee allen headquarters as the headquarters of the plan administration.under the factu
