background 
this long,contentious litigation stems from a benefits dispute under an employee benefits plan the plan insured by defendant counter claimant cross defendant appellee group health insurance,ghi and administered by village fuel.plaintiff nicholas scarangella scarangella was provided insurance under the plan as an employee of village fuel.the plan provided family coverage,which applied to scarangella wife.after scarangella wife incurred substantial medical expenses,ghi initiated an investigation into whether scarangella was an eligible employee under the plan based on its investigation,ghi determined that scarangella was not an eligible employee as a result,ghi purported to retroactively rescind the entire insurance policy issued to village fuel and denied reimbursement for medical expenses claimed by scarangella wife.ghi then brought suit in new york state court seeking rescission and restitution from village fuel under contract claims.prior to trial,village fuel removed the case to federal court,claiming ghi causes of action were preempted under erisa.ghi moved to remand the case to state court,but while the motion was pending,scarangella filed an action against ghi and village fuel under erisa,alleging that his wife was wrongfully denied benefits under the terms of the plan.the parties eventually agreed to voluntarily dismiss the state action and instead assert as defendants in scarangella federal action.
in response to scarangella complaint,ghi asserted three counterclaims seeking rescission reformation of the plan so as to exclude scarangella and his dependents from coverage in addition to restitution of previously conferred benefits.ghi also against village fuel for of its policy to exclude scarangella from the plan as well as restitution for previously conferred benefits finally,village fuel against ghi for restitution in the event that village fuel was required to pay any damages to scarangella both ghi and village fuel filed for summary judgment.in a detailed opinion,the district court dismissed both ghi and village fuel claims for restitution,holding that the money damages sought were not equitable remedies and therefore not permitted under erisa.it also noted concern with some of ghi remaining claims to the extent that they sought the same relief of money damages,a form of relief the district court found likely not permitted under erisa,even when equitable rescission or reformation might be allowed.in particular,the district court found that no court within the southern district of new york had equitably reformed an insurance plan contract so that an insurance company could then recover benefits via restitution,calling ghi claim to recover benefits paid to providers even more dubious.it also noted,with respect to ghi rescission claim,that courts rarely permit equitable rescission where the court can not easily restore the status quo.because the court found that material facts related to ghi rescission and reformation claims remained in dispute however,it denied village fuel motion for summary judgment as to these claims.
following summary judgment,ghi continued settlement negotiations with scarangella.after briefing and a hearing addressing which remaining issues would be tried,ghi and scarangella settled their respective claims.the settlement paid a confidential sum to resolve the claims brought by scarangella in his complaint.as a result,ghi and scarangella voluntarily dismissed with prejudice their remaining claims against each other,and scarangella dismissed its outstanding claims against village fuel.ghi also dismissed its remaining claims against village fuel,and the district court entered an order dismissing the action with prejudice but without costs.subsequently,village fuel moved for attorney fees,and the matter was assigned to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.
in its application for attorney fees from ghi,village fuel contended that it was entitled to fees as a prevailing party,although it claimed that a lower standard applied in erisa cases.ghi contended that village fuel was not a prevailing party,both because village fuel had lost its own on summary judgment and also because village fuel could not claim success based on the settlement between ghi and scarangella,to which village fuel was not a party.the magistrate judge found that under hardt village fuel had achieved some degree of success on the merits,and applying the factors set out in chambless recommended a partial award of attorney fees both parties objected to aspects of the magistrate judge report and recommendation.upon review,the district court determined that village fuel was ineligible for attorney fees under erisa first,the district court held that village fuel could not claim the dismissal of ghi restitution claim as success on the merits,because the dismissal was procedural in nature and both parties had failed on their respective restitution claims.second,the district court found that the voluntary dismissal of the remaining claims lacked the judicial imprimatur necessary to qualify as litigation success,emphasizing that neither party won on summary judgment.as a result,without reaching the magistrate judge discussion of the chambless factors,the district court found village fuel statutorily ineligible for an award of attorney fees and denied its application.
village fuel appealed,contending that the district court erred in its interpretation of the appropriate standard for an award of attorney fees in erisa cases.it urges us to reverse the district court and award it attorney fees,and to adopt the analysis of the chambless factors as set forth in the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge.ghi argues that the district court properly determined that village fuel had not achieved any success on the merits and therefore correctly denied attorney fees.it further contends that a proper application of the chambless factors results in no fee award,especially when combined with other claimed deficiencies in village fuel fee request.because the district court did not rely entirely on the correct legal standard in evaluating village fuel eligibility for attorney fees,we vacate and remand to the district court.
