the class action plaintiffs in this case brought their claims under the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,through they alleged that their medical benefits insurer,defendant gem insurance company,had wrongfully refused to fully pay certain hospital room and board charges.specifically,plaintiffs alleged that defendant was liable under the provisions of a b for violating the terms of the insurance policies,and equitable relief was requested under a for defendant failure to follow erisa claims procedure and notice requirements they also alleged that defendant had failed in its fiduciary duties under 
the district court granted summary judgment to defendant,and plaintiffs appeal.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background facts 
the facts relevant to the insurance plans in question do not appear to be in dispute.plaintiffs entered into hospital insurance contracts with the defendant.plaintiffs claimed that gem paid only an internally calculated daily rate which it set for hospital room and board expenses,without disclosing what that rate would be in the policies.plaintiffs alleged that defendant breached its contracts by limiting reimbursement of hospital room and board rates and by failing to follow industry practices relating to such charges.
there are ten types of policies at issue here,and the case hinges on the language found in the contract plans which insured the plaintiff class.the district court described this language in the following manner 
covered eligible expenses unless otherwise negotiated,we will pay the lesser of the billed charges or the usual and customary charges as set forth in the schedule of benefits for the following necessary medical care,treatment,services and supplies 
hospital room and board hospital room and board including all customary daily services and nursing charges.the room and board charge shall be limited to an average room rate.
in the policies,the term usual and customary is defined as 
t he currently prevailing charge made for a medical service or item by a majority of health care providers of the same discipline or type within the same geographical area as determined by the company.emphasis supplied 
the policies clearly stated that benefits were not provided for charges which are in excess of usual and customary.
the trial court noted that while s ome policies contain the word the rather than an average room rate,the parties agreed that the difference was not material to a resolution of the dispute,slip opinion 
plaintiffs claimed that the above language was ambiguous and subject to clarification by evidence of industry practices.gem contended that the contract terms are clear and unambiguous,and under those terms gem had the clear right to limit payment of hospital room and board charges to prevailing rates in a geographic area.
the trial court ruled that the contract language was not ambiguous 
giving the policy language its common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person in the position of a plan participant would have understood the words to mean,gem policy language is not ambiguous.the phrase an average room rate must be read in conjunction with the language of the covered eligible expenses provision,which imposes a limitation that gem will pay the lesser of the billed charges or the usual and customary charges as set forth in the schedule of benefits.usual and customary is defined as t he currently prevailing charge made for a medical service or item by a majority of health care providers of the same discipline or type within the same geographical area as determined by the company.thus a reasonable person in the position of a plan participant would understand the words to mean that gem would pay the lesser of the billed charge or,the prevailing,usual,or average charge made for a room as opposed to a private room rate by a majority of health care providers of the same type within the same geographical area as determined by gem.slip opinion.
while plaintiffs claimed that gem method of computing an average room and board rate was irregular and limited in scope because it surveyed only a few facilities and was not a fair representation of average,the trial court determined that under the terms of the insurance plans,gem had the discretion to set average amounts and that its method of figuring averages was reasonable and fair.
in this appeal,plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in finding that the contract language was not ambiguous,and that it further erred in approving the discretionary rates set by gem.
in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,at,the supreme court ruled that a denial of benefits under a b should be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the insurance contract gave the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for such benefits 
the plaintiffs contend that this court should first address their notice arguments before construing the language found in defendant insurance plan.this question of notice is based upon plaintiffs contention that gem failed to provide notice of its denial of hospital benefits,according to.
section provides in pertinent part that 
a a summary plan description of any employee benefit plan shall be furnished to participants and beneficiaries as provided in section b of this title.the summary plan description shall include the information described in subsection b of this section,shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,and shall be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan 
under paragraph b of,the summary plan description must contain the plan requirements respecting eligibility for participation and benefits and circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial or loss of benefits 
we find that the trial court followed the correct procedure in first resolving the question of ambiguity before proceeding to examine the question of an alleged violation of the notice requirements.this procedure is appropriate in erisa cases,where the plan language should be construed first in order to determine whether that language was clear and unambiguous.see chiles ceridian,cir.
the court will review plaintiffs claim as it would any other contract claim by looking to the terms of the plan and other evidence of the parties intent.if plan documents are reviewed and found not to be ambiguous,then they may be construed as a matter of law.chiles,supra,at.language is to be given its common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person in the position of the plan participant would have understood the words to mean.blair metropolitan life ins,cir quoting mcgee,cir.
the presence of ambiguity in a contract term must be determined as a matter of law an ambiguous contract term is one reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation carland metropolitan life ins,cir,cert.denied,d citations omitted.
plaintiffs contend that certain words and phrases have specialized meanings which create ambiguity,depending upon extrinsic matters,beyond the clear language found in the terms of the insurance plan.for instance,plaintiffs insist that gem use of the term average room rate creates ambiguity because hospital billing practices vary.the district court correctly found that the term average did not render the contract ambiguous 
while plaintiffs have argued that the word average is ambiguous because it actually could mean the mode,the median,or the mean,and the parties have spent considerable time on and have provided extensive expert testimony regarding the various meanings of the word average,and whether and how the word differs in meaning from the words usual,customary,prevailing,and what the average person would interpret average to mean,the court finds that there is no material ambiguity created by the use of these various words,particularly when gem retains the discretion to determine the rate it will pay by use of the phrase as determined by the company.simply put,a reasonable person in the position of a plan participant would not be sic interpret
