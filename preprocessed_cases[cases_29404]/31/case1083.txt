named plaintiffs,on behalf of thousands of retired county employees participating in health care plans collectively,the retirees,filed this lawsuit against the county of orange the county,challenging changes it made to the structure of two health benefits.the retirees appeal the district court order granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the county.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse and remand.to decide this case,we must address four issues whether we take judicial notice of a declaration and five memoranda of understanding mous whether the district court erred in holding that the retirees subsidy claim was barred by claim preclusion whether the district court erred in holding that there was no explicit authority requiring the county to provide a benefit in perpetuity and whether the district court erred in holding that the retirees failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.
factual and procedural background 
the retirees allege that the county restructuring of their health benefits violated the united states and california constitutions,and was a breach of contract,and constituted discrimination against the retirees on account of their age,in violation of california fair employment and housing act,california government code et feha.
retiree health benefits 
from through,the county subsidized health insurance premiums for its retired employees by pooling active and retired employees into one collective group of health plan participants the retiree premium subsidy or the subsidy.although the county program provided retirees and active employees the same benefits at the same costs,the pooling of the two groups had the effect of lowering retiree premiums below what their actual rates would otherwise have been,the program subsidized retired employees.from through,retired employees also received a monthly grant to be applied toward the cost of their health insurance coverage,referred to as the retiree medical grant the grant.the terms and conditions of the grant were set forth in separate sections of the collective bargaining agreements,known as mous,governing the relationship between the county and its active and retired employees.for the small number of retirees not represented by unions,the terms and conditions were described in personnel and salary resolutions.the monthly grant for retirees was calculated by multiplying the employees years of service at the time of retirement by a amount the grant multiplier.the initial grant multiplier was,but it increased every year by up to to reflect inflation.
b.the county restructures the retiree medical program 
beginning in,the county engaged in negotiations with labor unions to restructure its retiree medical program which was underfunded and in danger of insolvency.on september,the county board of supervisors formally approved an agreement with the orange county employees association.the agreement provided,in pertinent part,that effective january,the county would separate retired and active employees into different health plans or pools to set premiums the maximum increase for the grant multiplier would be reduced from to and once a retiree became eligible for medicare,the grant would be reduced by.in order to obtain the unions agreement to forego the pooling structure that created the subsidy and to reduce the grant benefits,the county agreed to pay active employees higher wages,but the retirees received nothing.the retirees allege that as a result of the county decision to stop pooling active and retired employees and to reduce the grant,their health care premiums increased significantly.the retirees allege they can not afford the increases and that they have had to abandon their health insurance plans,and obtain coverage that costs less but provides lesser benefits.
c.the retired employees association of orange county,reaoc lawsuit 
on november,reaoc,a california corporation representing more than county retirees and their spouses,filed suit in the central district of california on behalf of thousands of retired county employees,challenging only the county decision to stop pooling active and retired employees,and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.reaoc alleged the existence of an implied promise to continue the subsidy.on december,the county moved to dismiss reaoc suit,alleging,in part,that reaoc lacked standing to sue for damages on behalf of its members.the district court,in denying the county motion to dismiss,observed that reaoc complaint did not and could not seek damages.on december,reaoc and the county argued for summary judgment.on june,the district court granted the county motion for summary judgment,finding that the county was not contractually obligated to provide retirees with pooling throughout their lifetimes,because there was no evidence of any explicit legislative or statutory authority requiring the county to do so,and because that obligation could not arise by implication from past practices and course of dealing.retired emps.ass of orange,cnty.of orange,d.reaoc appealed that judgment to this court.on june,after oral argument,this court certified to the california supreme court the question of whether,as a matter of california law,a california county and its employees can form an implied contract that confers on retired county employees vested rights to health benefits,and the appeal from the district court was stayed pending the california supreme court determination of the certified question.see retired emps.ass of orange,cnty.of orange,cir.on november,the california supreme court answered the certified question,holding that under california law,a vested right to health benefits for retired county employees can be implied,under certain circumstances,from a county ordinance or resolution.see retired emps.ass of orange,cnty.of orange,cal th,d.
retirees lawsuit 
on january,while summary judgment motions were pending in the reaoc lawsuit,the retirees filed a class action in the central district of california,and it was assigned to the same district judge presiding over the reaoc lawsuit.the retirees filed an amended complaint on february,alleging,on behalf of thousands of retirees including reaoc members and,that the county restructuring of its retiree medical program constituted an impairment of contract and denial of due process,in violation of the united states and california constitutions,and was a breach of contract,and constituted discrimination against the retirees on account of their age,in violation of the feha.the retirees sought damages and injunctive and declaratory relief.they alleged that the subsidy was an implied term of the mous and that they had a contractual right to receive the grant,as its terms were reflected in the mous in place on the dates they retired.the suits filed by the retirees and reaoc overlapped,to the extent both sought declaratory and injunctive relief related to the county elimination of the subsidy,alleging the same theories of contract and constitutional law.one of the class representatives,james mcconnell,had filed a timely administrative complaint with the california department of fair employment and housing on december.in his administrative complaint,he stated that 
for years the county maintained one set of health care plans for active and retired employees,and charged premiums for coverage under those plans based on a combined pool of all active and retired employees.beginning in the county removed retired employees from the plans and split the pool,for the express purpose of eliminating older,less healthy participants from the plans.the premiums for retired employees rose dramatically as a result,including my own premiums,which increased by hundreds of dollars per month.
on april,the county moved,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,for judgment on the pleadings.on march,the district court granted the motion,without giving the retirees leave to amend.the district court found that the retirees subsidy claims were barred by claim preclusion,because there was an identity of claims between those in the retirees lawsuit and the reaoc lawsuit,and because there was privity between the retirees and reaoc.the district court determined that the retirees had been adequately represented by reaoc,because the retirees and reaoc interests were aligned and because reaoc understood itself to be acting in a representative capacity.the district court also found that the retirees grant claims should be dismissed,because the retirees had not pled that any explicit legislative or statutory authority required the county to provide the grant in perpetuity.finally,the district court found,for purposes of the feha claim,that the retirees failed to exhaust administrative remedies because mcconnell administrative complaint did not state it was on behalf of other class members.the retirees timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
request for judicial notice 
the retirees request that we take judicial notice of a declaration filed by the county in the reaoc litigation,and five of the mous that were attached as exhibits to that declaration.the county has not opposed the request for judicial notice.
under federal rule of evidence,t he court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it is generally known within the court territorial jurisdiction or can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned.we may take judicial notice of undisputed matters of public record,lee city of los angeles,cir,including documents on file in federal or state courts.see bennett medtronic,cir.moreover,documents not attached to a complaint may be considered if no party questions their authenticity and the complaint relies on those documents.lee,at.
therefore,pursuant to rule and ninth circuit authorities,we take judicial notice of these documents that are on file in federal court in the reaoc litigation and because the retirees make reference to the mous in their complaint.
retirees appeal of the district court dismissal of the subsidy claims 
the retirees contend that the district court erred by holding that the reaoc litigation precluded them from pursuing their claims for damages related to the county elimination of the subsidy because,among other reasons,reaoc could not adequately represent the retirees.we agree.
claim preclusion requires three things identity of claims a final judgment on the merits and the same parties,or privity between the parties.cell therapeutics,lash grp,cir amended.
a court is to apply four criteria to decide whether there is an identity of claims whether rights or interests established in the prior judgment would be destroyed or impaired by prosecution of the second action whether substantially the same evidence is presented in the two actions whether the two suits involve infringement of the same right and whether the two suits arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts.united states liquidators of european fed.credit bank,cir.the fourth criterion is the most important.id.at.
the retirees challenge the county decision to no longer pool active and retired employees for purposes of determining health premiums,thereby eliminating the subsidy,and assert that the county past practice of pooling created an implied contract to continue pooling.the retirees acknowledge that the county elimination of the subsidy is also the subject of the reaoc litigation.we find that there is an identity of claims in the two cases with respect to the subsidy.
the second factor for claim preclusion is also met,because there was a final summary judgment on the merits in the reaoc litigation.retired emps.ass of orange,cnty.of orange,d see also tripati henman,cir per curiam stating that t he established rule in the federal courts is that a final judgment retains all of its res judicata consequences pending decision of the appeal quoting wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure,at internal quotation marks omitted.
however,we find that reaoc and the retirees are not in privity,so the third factor is not met.although the retirees were not named parties to the reaoc litigation,in certain limited circumstances,a nonparty may be bound by a judgment because she was adequately represented by someone with the same interests who wa s a party to the suit.taylor sturgell,d internal quotation marks omitted.a party representation of a nonparty is adequate for preclusion purposes only if,at a minimum the interests of the nonparty and the representative are aligned and either the party understood itself to be acting in a representative capacity or the original court took care to protect the interests of the nonparty.id.at.internal citation omitted.relying on anderson waddle,d,the retirees argue that reaoc could not adequately represent them because,as an association,reaoc lacked the legal capacity to seek damages on their behalves,and thus,the interests of reaoc and the retirees are not aligned.in anderson,individual members of an association sought damages,when the association had previously brought suit for injunctive and declaratory relief for the same alleged violation.id.at.the defendant urged dismissal of the individual plaintiffs claims based on claim preclusion.id.the court held that preclusion did not apply because,under the doctrine of associational standing as set forth in warth seldin,d,an association may only seek injunctive or declaratory relief,and therefore,the association could not adequately represent its individual members in claiming damages.id.at.
the restatement second of judgments c is also relied on by the retirees.section c states that claim preclusion does not apply to extinguish a claim,and part or all of the claim subsists as a possible basis for a second action by the plaintiff against the defendant when 
t he plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts or restrictions on their authority to entertain multiple theories or demands for multiple remedies or forms of relief in a single action,and the plaintiff desires in the second action to rely on that theory or to seek that remedy or form of relief.
the comment to the provision explains that the doctrine of claim preclusion 
is largely predicated on the assumption that the jurisdiction in which the first judgment was rendered was one which put no formal barriers in the way of a litigant presenting to a court in one action the entire claim,including any theories of recovery or demands for relief that might have been available to him under applicable law.
restatement second of judgments,c cmt.
we find the reasoning of anderson and section c persuasive.therefore,we conclude that claim preclusion does not bar a second action for damages,where a damages remedy was unavailable in the first action.see bio tech.genentech,finding that where a plaintiff was precluded from recovering damages in the initial action by formal jurisdictional or statutory barriers,not by plaintiff choice,a subsequent action for damages will not normally be barred by res judicata even where it arises from the sa
