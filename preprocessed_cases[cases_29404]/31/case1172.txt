at issue here is an alleged violation of section a of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a,and the equitable relief awarded pursuant to erisa section a,a.chevron corporation chevron appeals from the injunction requiring it to modify its retirement plan records to reflect that six plaintiffs were involuntarily terminated by chevron product company richmond,california,refinery richmond and thus eligible for payment of a special involuntary termination enhancement site benefit.eight plaintiffs who were denied pursuant to summary judgment and four following.
the district court jurisdiction was based on e.we have jurisdiction over chevron timely appeal and the timely pursuant to,and we affirm in part and reverse in part.
as part of an effort to reduce the workforce of its subsidiaries,chevron officially adopted site in an important announcement on february.site provided a benefit enhancement to any chevron corporation retirement plan participant involuntarily terminated without cause between march and december.chevron use of site at richmond is the source of controversy here.richmond is part of the refining division of the chevron products company,an unincorporated division of chevron,which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of chevron.plaintiffs were all employees at richmond whose retirements from chevron became effective between september,and june.
although only involuntarily terminated employees were eligible for site,local management could send their preference letters to solicit expressions of interest in the program.in theory,employees who indicated a desire to be considered for involuntary termination,those who would not be guaranteed termination and the consequent benefit.in practice,however,the vast majority of workers who were involuntarily terminated and received site.indeed,the parties stipulated that had the plaintiffs been volunteers,they would have qualified.
despite availability,the decision whether to send site preferences least as far as chevron employees were made by local management.at richmond,this authority rested with bill steelman,the refinery general manager.although chevron initially adopted site,steelman continued to rely on personnel rearrangements and attrition to improve efficiencies and achieve necessary downsizing.his unwavering mantra had been that,in return for a pledge of cooperation from richmond workforce with any downsizing and rearrangements,richmond would not terminate any employee involuntarily except for cause.
therefore,when richmond employees inquired about site on its rumor buster website a forum to submit questions anonymously,richmond responses conveyed steelman edict.the topic of layoff retirement packages was first broached in a posting dated february.richmond acknowledged that chevron was developing a severance plan,but explained that,as the decision on its implementation would be made locally,richmond was not planning to have a severance package voluntarily or involuntarily in the foreseeable future brackets in original.a march,rumor buster again recognized the need to reduce the number of richmond employees,but repeated that the refinery had no plans to introduce site and that attrition would produce workforce reductions once the refinery could operate safely with fewer employees.several weeks later,a third rumor buster reiterated steelman belief that richmond was not yet capable of operating with less employees.notably,each rumor buster explicitly stated it expressed richmond intentions at this time.in addition to his rumor busters,steelman conveyed his resolve not to utilize site at richmond orally during refinery meetings.
meanwhile,steelman faced pressure from his superiors to reduce richmond bloated workforce through site.despite steelman considerable discretion over richmond personnel policies,he still had to report to lance gyorfi,a chevron executive who coordinated employment policies at chevron united states refineries via quarterly refinery guidance team team meetings and intermittent conference calls.the team first discussed site on february,three days after site unveiling.gyorfi stated that human resources hr personnel and group management over whom chevron exercised more centralized control may be offered site.the team attempted,as its members traditionally did,to decide the site issue by consensus.during subsequent conference calls,the other five local managers warmed to the idea of utilizing site to cut hr employees.steelman position did not change,and on march,he obtained the team approval to send a letter to a richmond union communicating the refinery current intent not to use site among the union members.
on april,alan preston,the general manager of chevron products company hr,sent an to steelman and other general managers proposing a plan to offer all hr personnel the option of.steelman replied that making site available only to richmond hr staff would contravene his policy of treating all employees equally.steelman reversed course the next day april,however,and agreed to mail site preference letters to richmond hr employees.he emphasized,though,that he was not committing himself to respond to their preferences due to his lingering equality concerns.
during a team meeting in pascagoula,mississippi meeting,the team decided to extend site to all employees over whom they customarily exercised control.steelman initially objected with regards to those currently stationed in richmond,but acquiesced since he knew this decision was the team to make,not his.at this point,steelman concluded that he would have to offer site universally at richmond to avoid discriminating against employees.he therefore instructed richmond hr manager to notify imminent retirees of the policy change,sent out a formal notice to all employees on may,and scheduled a meeting to discuss site.since most plaintiffs had already retired,they no longer were eligible for the attractive site benefit.this lawsuit ensued.
the interpretation of erisa is a question of law reviewed de novo.shaver operating eng rs local pension trust fund,cir.to establish an action for equitable relief under erisa section a,a,the defendant must be an erisa fiduciary acting in its fiduciary capacity,varity howe,d,and must violate fiduciary obligations,id.at.
it is uncontested that chevron was and remains the plan sponsor and administrator of the chevron corporation retirement plan.see a providing that a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan,or iii has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.on appeal,chevron challenges the district court holding that the misinformation disseminated by richmond management was done in its role as a fiduciary within the meaning of erisa.the determination of chevron fiduciary status is a conclusion of law,see varity,at.deeming a legal conclusion the lower court decision that an employer was acting as a fiduciary,that we review de novo.fiduciary conduct encompasses c onveying information about the likely future of plan benefits,thereby permitting beneficiaries to make an informed choice about continued participation to offer beneficiaries detailed plan information in order to help them decide whether to remain with the plan is essentially the same kind of activity.bins exxon,cir en banc,quoting varity,at.
chevron contends that categorizing their dissemination of information as fiduciary conduct would work an unwarranted expansion of erisa obligations.these communications,chevron alleges,did not pertain to administration,but merely addressed employment matters with some relevance to pension benefits.the supreme court in varity,however,rejected a similar argument attempting to parse the communications too finely.varity,at.although one strand of richmond management communications concerned employment matters,the prospect and method of workforce reductions,when taken as a whole and in context,the primary purpose of the statements was to c onvey information about the likely future of plan benefits site,and thus permit beneficiaries to make an informed choice about continued participation.see id.at.
indeed,the questions posted on the rumor buster website show richmond employees were principally interested in the likelihood of a severance package such as site,not whether the workforce would face involuntary terminations.for example,richmond february,rumor buster addresses the question are there any plans for a retirement package to be offered for some of the layoffs and cutbacks emphasis added.the corresponding answer echoes the question primary concern over retirement package s,and not layoffs,stating in part that we are not planning to have a severance package here at richmond voluntarily or involuntarily in the foreseeable future.i can confirm that the corporation is working on some form of severance plan.id.brackets in original.the march,rumor buster confronted another question involving site as a severance package why ca we open up the severance program to all eligible employees although i am not close to retirement age,it would be a nice incentive to take the money and market my skills elsewhere.once again,the response stressed the benefits package the refinery does not have plans to utilize the enhanced corporate severance plan.finally,a comment posted april,queried why is it that richmond employees who would happily volunteer to be part of this program are being excluded emphasis added.
the significance of site enhanced benefit,as opposed to its connection to possible involuntary terminations,was not unknown to chevron.once steelman decided at the meeting to offer site universally at richmond,he promptly telephoned the refinery and directed that all employees who were about to retire be informed regarding site pending availability.he hastened to make the call because he wanted imminent retirees to know that they soon might be able to and receive site benefit,not that site may have increased the chances of using involuntary terminations to cut workers.
given that the obvious concern driving these communications was the availability of site benefits,the district court did not clearly err in finding that the whole point of the dialogue was to help plan participants make informed choices about plan options.our holding,therefore,is identical to that of varity the factual context in which the statements were made,combined with the nature of the activity,engaged in by those who had authority to do so,together provide sufficient support for the district court legal conclusion that chevron was acting as a fiduciary.varity,at.in doing so,we need not reach chevron contention,on which we express no opinion,that congress carefully confined erisa remedies for mere employment communications to.
having concluded that chevron was acting in its fiduciary capacity when it discussed the likelihood of site at richmond,the next inquiry is whether making the statements breached the fiduciary duties imposed by erisa.varity,at.in general,the core obligation of an erisa fiduciary is to discharge its duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.bins,at brackets in original,quoting a.one component of this core obligation is the duty not to make affirmative material misrepresentations to plan participants who inquire regarding possible changes in the plan.two specific formulations of erisa fiduciary duty not to provide materially misleading information are alleged to have been violated here.
we agree with the district court position that these determinations are properly characterized as mixed questions of law and fact.see in re indian gaming related cases,cir a mixed question of law and fact exists where the relevant facts are undisputed and the question is whether those facts satisfy the applicable legal rule.james pirelli armstrong tire,cir whether an affirmative misrepresentation was material is a mixed question of law and fact.quoting fischer phila,cir hockett sun,r m,cir the question of when serious consideration began is a mixed question of law and fact.mullins pfizer,cir same fischer phila,cir declaring that the court expressly reserve s the question of the appropriate standard of review,although recognizing that it previously described it as a mixed question of law and fact.but see wilson bell,cir the determination when serious consideration began is a question of fact.mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo however,the underlying factual findings are reviewed for clear error.cal.ironworkers field pension trust loomis sayles,cir.as to the latter,we are mindful that t his clearly erroneous standard is significantly deferential,requiring a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed before reversal is warranted.mcclure thompson,cir,quoting easley cromartie,d.
serious consideration 
plaintiffs assert that chevron violated the duty to disclose material information that we identified in bins when a plan participant inquires about potential plan changes,an has a duty to provide complete and truthful information about any such changes then under serious consideration.bins,at emphasis added.serious consideration occurs when a specific proposal is being discussed for purposes of implementation by senior management with the authority to implement the change.id.at,quoting fischer,at.these three related elements must be analyzed together in an inherently review.bins,at,quoting fischer,at.
focusing on bins first issue,the district court determined that chevron did not generate a specific proposal for richmond until the meeting before then it was merely gathering information,developing strategies and analyzing options within the meaning of bins.see bins,at.plaintiffs argue that chevron began seriously considering site at richmond much earlier on february,the day a memorandum proposing implementation coincided with the team initial discussion of the matter.
considering bins first issue in isolation,we agree with the plaintiffs that a specific proposal existed on february.chevron had moved beyond the antecedent steps of gathering information,developing strategies,and analyzing options,and had generated something sufficiently concrete to permit a discussion about implementation.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.indeed,virtually all of site features,from the benefits offered to the opportunity,had crystallized.the only major aspect of the program yet to be determined was employee eligibility.
that lingering unresolved aspect,though,prevents us from concluding bins second issue was met.that is,although steelman and the rest of the team may have discussed various alternatives for making site available to hr personnel and various managers,site was not discussed for purposes of implementation among the at richmond until the meeting.see fischer,at positing that the second element further distinguishes serious consideration from the preliminary steps of gathering data and formulating strategy vartanian monsanto,cir modifying the first prong of the serious consideration test to require a specific proposal which would affect a person in the position of the plaintiff emphasis added.before the meeting,steelman steadfastly refused to consider implementing site at richmond in any form,and the team initially appeared to respect his position.the refinery function hr manager generated a potential refining site applications by group chart on march,that not only indicated no site terminations were expected at richmond,but also was explicit that richmond w ill not use site.on march,chevron approved the letter steelman planned to send to one of richmond unions expressing his intent not to use site.
any departure from steelman pledge was confined to the extension of site to hr employees.an april,from chevron products company hr general manager sought permission to solicit information from potential in the hr sector.steelman agreed on april,but nonetheless did not agree to act on the preferences.
at the meeting,however,the team overcame steelman resistance and decided to implement site for hr and other employees at all refineries.as a consequence,steelman felt compelled by his equal treatment policy to offer site to richmond entire workforce.only upon this mid may meeting capitulation did the subject turn to the practicalities of implementation at richmond and surpass the preliminary,deliberative stages.see bins,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
our analysis of bins third issue is implicit in our consideration of the second.under bins,not only must a specific proposal be discussed for purposes of implementation,but these discussions must be conducted by senior management with the authority to implement the change.id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.in applying this element,we keep its intended function in mind to ensure that the analysis of serious consideration focuses on the proper actors within the corporate hierarchy.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the proper actor with the authority to implement site for richmond was steelman,and he,to repeat,first considered making site available at richmond at the meeting.in addition,whereas the team may have had greater clout over hr and employees,nothing in the record suggests they sought to override steelman plans for the in fact,the record indicates that steelman had virtually unchecked authority in this regard.see id.at the issue is not ultimate authority instead,the issue is whether the proposed policy is within the scope of the divisional executives delegated management authority such that the corporation will most likely approve their recommendations.
since chevron did not seriously consider offering site to employees at richmond until the meeting,it follows from bins that if chevron made a misrepresentation about the likelihood of future plan benefits before then,it was not material and hence not an actionable violation of the duty to respond accurately and straightforwardly to inquiries from the plaintiffs on chevron preliminary plans to offer severance benefits.id.at.we thus disagree with the plaintiffs argument that the occurrence of any discussions would certainly be material to richmond employees given they stood to see the cash value of their retirement benefit packages increase by as much as ten percent.
the plaintiffs further contend that chevron violated a consideration duty to correct any misinformation plaintiff dreesman may have received from his union representative concerning the union site negotiations.after richmond informed its employees that it was seriously considering site,dreesman declined hr june,invitation to rescind his voluntary termination in light of this announcement.since dreesman indicated that his reason for keeping his retirement date unchanged was that he thought his union was not going to approve site,plaintiffs argue chevron should have advised him that negotiations were still ongoing and that he should wait until they officially concluded to retire.however,plaintiffs cite no legal authority to support their novel theory that erisa requires employers to keep employees abreast of their own unions assessment of pending negotiations.the judgment against dreesman is affirmed.
active misinformation 
although the district court determined that site was not seriously considered until the meeting,the court also concluded that several prior chevron misrepresentations were material and thus amounted to breaches of its fiduciary duties.our holding in wayne pacific bell,cir,recognized actionable material misrepresentations are not necessarily limited to periods of serious consideration even before serious consideration begins,an has a duty not to actively misinform its employees about the availability of future retirement benefits in an attempt to induce them to retire earlier than they otherwise would.id.at,citing ballone eastman kodak,cir.chevron appeals from the judgments in favor of the plaintiffs who prevailed on this theory,while the unsuccessful plaintiffs the denial of relief.
chevron incorrectly asserts that steelman statements must have been false for chevron to be held liable.the active misinformation standard in wayne is clear a person actively misinforms by saying that something is true when it is not true.but the person also misinforms by saying that something is true when the person does not know whether it is true or not.wayne,at emphasis added.
chevron further insists that the district court erred in holding that an employer need not subjectively intend to induce earlier retirements under erisa,employers are deemed to intend the reasonably foreseeable consequences of their misinformation when that misinformation induces retirements.chevron contends that this standard is too low and that instead the plaintiffs must show scienter as they would if they were suing under the common law cause of action for deceit.the scienter requirement would be met,according to chevron,by establishing k nowledge or belief on the part of the defendant that the representation is false.page keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at ed.
we fail to see the logic in transplanting the element of scienter from the tort of deceit into a statutory erisa claim with roots in the law of fiduciaries and trusts.see varity,at.w e recognize that erisa fiduciary duties draw much of their content from the common law of trusts,the law that governed most benefit plans before erisa enactment.mut.life ins.russell,d brennan,concurring congress intended by a to incorporate the fiduciary standards of trust law into erisa.trust law imposes a duty,when dealing with the beneficiary on the trustee own account,to communicate to the beneficiary all material facts in connection with the transaction which the trustee knows or should know.restatement second of trusts cmt.d emphasis added see also bixler cent.teamsters health welfare fund,cir looking to comment d of section in stating that erisa section duty to inform entails a negative duty not to misinform.thus,by holding steelman and chevron liable for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of their misinformation,the district court accords with the common law of trusts that attaches liability for information the trustee should have known.in articulating ninth circuit law in this area,we have followed a line of cases from our sister circuits that does not require a showing of intent,james pirelli armstrong tire,cir a fiduciary breaches his duty by providing plan participants with materially misleading information,regardless of whether the fiduciary statements or omissions were made negligently or intentionally.internal citation omitted.
on the other side,the plaintiffs would have us go further and hold chevron liable for negligent misstatements.such a standard would be an oxymoronic command not to negligently actively misinform and would provide confusing guidance to erisa fiduciaries.we have cautioned in the past that too low a materiality standard risks being overly burdensome and could easily become by discouraging employers from considering such proposals in the first place.bins,at see also fischer,at erisa does not impose a duty of clairvoyance on fiduciaries.an erisa fiduciary is under no obligation to offer precise predictions about future changes to its plan.internal quotations and citations omitted.
the district court properly concluded that there ceased to be a reasonable basis in fact for the not at richmond policy no later than april when steelman reversed himself and agreed to send out site letters for the hr staff at richmond.the district court unchallenged factual findings establish that richmond management including steelman represented,via rumor busters and town hall meetings,that site would not be offered to any of its employees.likewise,it is undisputed that steelman,on april,succumbed to the team pressure to permit richmond hr workers to receive site preference letters and faced further insistence from gyorfi and the team to implement site for richmond management.at this point,steelman no longer kn ew whether it was true or not,wayne,at,that site would not be implemented at richmond.it also became possible that site would be extended to the given steelman strict adherence to his equality principle.thus,by not removing the rumor busters postings,steelman was saying that something w
