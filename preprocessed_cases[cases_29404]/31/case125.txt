background 
the plaintiffs 
in describing each plaintiff,we draw the following facts from the allegations in the plaintiffs amended complaint and documents incorporated by reference therein.see eades kennedy,pc law offices,cv,wl,at cir.june.
nyspa is a professional organization of psychiatrists practicing in new york state.it alleges that united unlawfully imposed financial requirements and treatment limitations on mental health benefits for patients of nyspa members.that said,nyspa only specific allegations relate to an insurance plan that is not subject to erisa,and its other allegations are generalized recitations of its members complaints about united.
denbo,an employee of the cbs sports network,has health insurance benefits through the cbs medical plan the cbs plan,which incorporates the requirements of erisa and the parity act.as the claims administrator for the cbs plan,united administers claims for behavioral health benefits,such as mental health benefits,and for medical health benefits.under the terms of the cbs plan,united has exclusive authority and sole and absolute discretion to interpret and to apply the rules of the plan to determine claims for plan benefits.joint app x.as required by erisa,the cbs plan has an appeals process for adverse benefits determinations,pursuant to which united decides any appeals of its benefits determinations.united appeal decision s are final and binding,and no further appeal is available.joint app x.the cbs plan also describes what plan participants must do to file suit against united and how to serve united with legal process.
denbo,who suffers from dysthymic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder,submitted benefits claims to united for his weekly and,later,semiweekly outpatient psychotherapy sessions with an psychologist.although united initially granted denbo claims,it conducted a concurrent medical necessity review while denbo was still undergoing treatment but after he submitted claims for twelve sessions within six weeks.as a result of that review,in may united told denbo that his treatment plan was not medically necessary and that united would no longer provide benefits for his psychotherapy sessions.united upheld its decision on appeal.
in the amended complaint,denbo alleges that united improperly administered the cbs plan by treating claims submitted for routine,outpatient,care medical claims more favorably than claims for ongoing,routine,outpatient,psychotherapy sessions mental health claims,in violation of the parity act.for example,united subjected the mental health claims,but not the medical claims,of cbs plan participants to preauthorization requirements or concurrent review.in determining the medical necessity of denbo psychotherapy sessions,moreover,united applied review standards that were more restrictive than both generally accepted mental health standards and the standards united applied to medical claims under the cbs plan.denbo also claimed that united contravened the terms of the cbs plan itself.among other things,denbo alleges,the cbs plan expressly permits retrospective review of submitted mental health claims for sessions lasting less than fifty minutes,but does not appear to sanction either preauthorization or concurrent review of such claims.and denbo claimed that some of united conduct in administering the cbs plan violated both the parity act and the terms of the plan for example,conducting a concurrent review of mental health claims based solely on the frequency of mental health office visits is,denbo claimed,neither endorsed by the cbs plan nor done with medical claims.
menolascino 
menolascino,a psychiatrist,provides psychopharmacology evaluation and management services to united plan beneficiaries,who in turn assign their plan benefits to her.united denied or reduced benefits to menolascino for these services.but the amended complaint does not specify how united treated evaluation and management services for care.nor does it identify the health insurance plans of menolascino patients or even the terms of those plans.
procedural history 
on december,the district court granted united motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety,holding principally that nyspa lacked associational standing to sue on behalf of its members as a claims administrator,united could not be sued under a for alleged violations of the parity act or under a b and relief under a would not be appropriate because the plaintiffs alleged injuries could be fully remedied under a b.this appeal followed.
discussion 
nyspa standing 
we first consider whether nyspa has properly pleaded associational standing.an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.hunt.state apple advert.comm n,d.by contrast,an association lacks standing to assert claims of injunctive relief on behalf of its members where the fact and extent of the injury that gives rise to the claims for injunctive relief would require individualized proof.all.for open soc y int l,agency for int l,cir,aff,d.this is not to say that the participation of a limited number of individual members will negate standing the association will maintain standing if the nature of the claim and of the relief sought does not make the individual participation of each injured party indispensable to proper resolution of the cause.united food commercial workers union local brown,d see also state org.for women terry,cir.
nyspa alleges,and there is no serious dispute on appeal,that its members have standing to sue united in their own right,both as assignees of erisa benefits and to prevent interference with their provision of mental health treatment.there is also no serious dispute that this action implicates interests germane to nyspa purpose.the parties dispute only whether at the motion to dismiss stage nyspa has plausibly alleged that its claims do not require individualized proof.it has.nyspa challenges united systemic policies and practices insofar as they violate erisa and the parity act,and it seeks only injunctive and declaratory relief.see all.for open soc y int l,at.at this stage in the litigation,it remains plausible that the participation of a limited number of nyspa members will allow nyspa to prove that united practices violate the re
