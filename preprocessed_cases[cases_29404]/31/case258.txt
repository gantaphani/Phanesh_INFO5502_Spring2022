background 
hmi is a business with about workers that is engaged in mechanical,plumbing and hvac contracting,and it often performs work on publicly funded projects in new york.pursuant to new york labor law,when hmi performs public work projects,it is required to pay employees working on those projects the locally prevailing wage most generally,area collective bargaining agreements serve as a benchmark for the locally prevailing wage amount.the prevailing wage not only encompasses hourly cash wages but also includes supplements,which are compensation benefits such as health and welfare,retirement,disability,vacation and apprenticeship training.see lab.law b.the state determines a contractor compliance with section by using,among other things,an annualization formula that calculates the hourly cash equivalent of public work supplements that contractors pay by dividing the actual cash value of a contractor supplement contribution by the total number of hours employees worked annually on both public and private jobs.see regs.tit,d 
since at least september,hmi has paid its supplemental benefits in the form of irrevocable contributions to benefit plans that cpi administers.all parties agree that the cpi plans are qualified welfare benefit plans under erisa.between may and october,hmi performed work on a public project at midlakes high school in ontario county.according to plaintiffs complaint,the project involved hours of work and a payroll.nysdol received complaints about hmi compliance with section on the midlakes high school project,and the state began an investigation in september.the purpose of the investigation was to determine whether and to what extent the cpi plans to which hmi made supplement contributions on behalf of employees for work on public work projects pay out benefits to hmi employees for work other than on public work projects.such a situation,sometimes called pooling,allows an employer to dilute the supplement benefits due each public work employee by spreading the benefits out to cover both public and private work.in connection with its investigation,nysdol requested hmi payroll records for the project.then in january,the state requested a list of all hmi employees that participated in the cpi plan,information about hmi contributions to the plan,and whether employees not shown on public work payrolls benefitted from contributions made on behalf of employees on public work projects.cpi responded to this request on behalf of hmi in february and refused to supply the information,claiming that the state was acting beyond its authority.the state ultimately issued a subpoena dated march,requiring hmi to supply the requested information.during this same period,the state requested information from cpi president,peter strong,as part of a more general investigation of the practices of contractors using cpi plans.in a subpoena dated march,the state requested from strong information tending to show whether supplement contributions that an employer made on behalf of public work employees benefitted other employees.
in response to the subpoenas,plaintiffs filed a complaint in federal court on march,seeking,among other things,a declaration that erisa preempted the state investigation into the internal allocation of supplemental wages within the cpi plans.after denying plaintiffs initial requests for injunctive relief,the district court granted them a preliminary injunction by a and order filed on july.between the time of plaintiffs complaint and their successful request for an injunction,nysdol issued a notice in april regarding enforcement of section the april notice.the notice states in relevant part 
the purpose of this notice is to remind all interested parties of the manner in which the new york state department of labor enforces article of the labor law the prevailing wage law with regard to the payment of prevailing supplements.specifically,questions have arisen with regard to the payment of prevailing supplements into certain benefit plans.these questions have been exacerbated due to recent preemption litigation in federal court.the department has prepared this notice concerning regulations found at new york code of rules and regulations part to correct any misunderstanding of the department policy and remind all affected parties of their obligations under the law.
labor law section et,the prevailing wage law requires the payment of prevailing wages and supplements by contractors performing work on public work projects.while the department of labor does not require the payment of any specific supplement,it does require,through the prevailing wage rate schedules it promulgates on an annual basis,a total supplement amount to be paid on behalf of each worker.a contractor obligation to pay such supplement amount may be met by paying into a qualified benefit plan,paying cash to the worker,or some combination of these options.
it has come to the attention of the department that certain benefit plans used by contractors may not comport with the requirements under the labor law or the department regulations.specifically,some contractors,while making payments into benefit plans purportedly on behalf of individual workers engaged on prevailing wage projects,use such payments to obtain benefits for individuals other than those on whose behalf the payments were made.alternatively,contractors may make payments for the period of time during which a worker is engaged on a public work project,yet use the payments to obtain benefits for a period of time during which the worker was engaged on a private project.in the above circumstances,it is clear that the contractor has not met the requirements of the labor law with regard to the payment of prevailing supplements.
because of the confusion over whether the department could,under federal law,enforce these requirements,only contractors using such plans after june,will be found in willful violation of the law.
the benefit plan structure described in the april notice as violating section purportedly was the same arrangement that hmi had with cpi.based on the april notice,the district court held that plaintiffs established irreparable harm because cpi is in danger of suffering a loss of its customer base if contractors reading the notice withdrew from the plan to avoid nysdol enforcement actions.the district court also held that plaintiffs showed a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim because the state appeared to be using an improper alternative enforcement mechanism to erisa when it examined how wage supplement moneys deposited into an erisa plan are put to use and improperly intruded on plan administration when it focused on the distribution of payments made to erisa benefit plans.because federal law exclusively governed this area of law,the state actions appeared to be improper,the district court held.
the parties conducted discovery and filed for summary judgment.by and order filed on march,judge scullin granted summary judgment to defendants nysdol,lifted the preliminary injunction and closed the case.in its march decision,the district court held that it no longer appeared that the state was attempting to control or regulate the monies deposited into the cpi plan by hmi.instead,the district court held that the state could use an annualization formula to determine hmi compliance with section because the only information needed for the state investigation was the total amount of
