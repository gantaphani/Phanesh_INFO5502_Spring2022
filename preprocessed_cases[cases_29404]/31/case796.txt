backgrounda.facts 
the pension fund is a multiemployer pension plan within the meaning of erisa.the trustees have discretionary and final authority with respect to the administration of the pension fund and the construction of its terms.
this case involves the application of the provisions of erisa to certain provisions of the plan governing the pension fund that deal with prohibited unemployment.the plaintiffs are participants of the plan who believe that their pensions were reduced by application of the reemployment provisions of the plan in a manner that violates the provisions.at the outset,therefore,we shall set forth the provisions involved.
on march,the trustees amended the terms of the plan the march amendments.these amendments became effective on july.for ease of reference,we shall refer to the plan as it existed before the march amendments as the old pension plan and to the plan as modified by the march amendments as the new pension plan.
prohibited reemployment 
at all relevant times,the plan has prohibited pensioners from working in prohibited reemployment.the plan defines prohibited reemployment as 
employment in any position,including a managerial or supervisory position,by a contributing employer or 
employment by an employer,other than a governmental agency,in any position covered by a teamster contract between that employer and any affiliate of the international brotherhood of teamsters or 
employment in any position,including a managerial or supervisory position and including,but not including government employment,either in the same industry in which the participant or pensioner earned any contributory service credit while covered by the pension fund,or in any other industry if the participant or pensioner is in the same job classification as are other participants then employed by a contributing employer located within the same standard metropolitan statistical area sma.
at the new pension plan employs the term teamster industry reemployment,at,to cover the same activities that were termed prohibited reemployment under the old pension plan,at.
reimbursement of benefits paid during prohibited reemployment 
under the old pension plan 
under the old pension plan,pensioners were penalized for working in prohibited reemployment.the following provisions governed 
section a of the old pension plan provided a pensioner shall have his benefit payments suspended for any calendar month in which he works in prohibited reemployment a pensioner shall permanently lose his rights to any benefit payments which are suspended because of his work in prohibited reemployment.id.at.
section c of the old pension plan required a pensioner to notify the pension fund if he returned to work in any capacity and to inform the pension fund of information related to the pensioner work including the pensioner specific job duties so that the pension fund could determine whether the reemployment constituted prohibited reemployment.furthermore,a pensioner could be requested to certify,in writing,that he has not been working in any capacity which would result in the suspension of his benefit payments.id.at.if a pensioner failed to furnish information related to his work,old pension plan section c also provided for benefits to be suspended until the required information was supplied.
under section m of the old pension plan,a pensioner who fail ed to notify the pension fund that he has returned to work in prohibited reemployment shall be obligated to reimburse the pension fund for all retirement pension benefit payments he received for any month,or part of a month,in which he was reemployed.id.at.
old pension plan section a made any misrepresentation in a claim for pension or other benefits grounds for recovery by the pension fund of any benefit payments made in reliance on the misrepresentation.section b of the old pension plan gave the board the right to recover excess payments that had been made due to a mistake.id.at.
section e of the old pension plan permitted a pensioner to request from the pension fund a determination on whether the work he is contemplating shall result in the suspension of his benefit payments.id.at.
under the new pension plan 
the following provisions govern the same area under the new pension plan 
section a of the new pension plan provides 
the pension fund shall permanently suspend all periodic benefit payments of a pensioner during periods of his reemployment to the following extent 
all periodic benefit payments to a pensioner shall be permanently suspended during all periods of prohibited reemployment 
section b of the new pension plan requires pension fund participants,as a prerequisite to any receipt of periodic benefit payments,to keep the pension fund fully and promptly informed of any employment in which he was or is engaged during any time period for which he claims or has received periodic benefit payments.id.at.new pension plan section b also notes that the pension fund could require pensioners to provide information about past and present employment and could require signed responses from pensioners regarding whether a pensioner was engaged in prohibited reemployment.
under the new pension plan,failure to comply with these disclosure obligations would result in temporary suspension of benefits.in such a case,however,the new pension plan states that,upon the pensioner compliance with the disclosure obligations,his periodic benefit payments will be resumed including full restoration of all payments that had been temporarily suspended unless there is then in effect a permanent suspension of his periodic benefit payments id.
on the other hand,with respect to the permanent suspension just mentioned,the new pension plan provides that 
a ny failure to comply with any disclosure obligation described in section b,or with any related disclosure request by the pension fund,shall,if the pensioner has been or is engaged in any reemployment,create a rebuttable presumption of an existing factual basis for a permanent suspension of the pensioner periodic benefit payments during all periods of his reemployment,provided that such presumption will become inoperative if and to the extent the presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence or is otherwise shown to be unreasonable under the circumstances each such permanent suspension of the periodic benefit payments shall continue in effect and until the pension fund has received what it determines to be both notice and clear and convincing evidence that the basis for the permanent suspension is no longer applicable,at which time the suspension will be ended and the periodic benefit payments will be resumed on a prospective basis only without any restoration of payments for the period prior to that end of the suspension,subject to possible offset pursuant to section e.
section e of the new pension plan states that t he pension fund is entitled to restitution of all periodic benefit payments that are distributed to a pensioner for any period for which the pensioner was not entitled to receive such payments.id.at.section e allows the pension fund to obtain restitution by making an offset or deduction consisting of one hundred percent of the gross amount of the first three benefit payments following the end of a suspension,and twenty five percent of the gross amount of each benefit payment thereafter.id.
according to new pension plan section f,a pensioner can submit a written request to the pension fund at any time for a determination whether or not specific employment constitutes prohibited reemployment.id.
district court proceedings 
the plaintiffs filed this action on february,based on the march amendments to the plan and on the termination of individual plaintiffs benefits claims which we discuss in further detail below.the plaintiffs first amended complaint advanced seven counts.against the trustees,the plaintiffs alleged breach of fiduciary duty violation of erisa rule,see g and violation of erisa offset rules,see b.against the pension fund,the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief based on the plaintiffs individual benefit determinations,see a b,a,and sought damages for violation of erisa notice provisions,see id.h,and violation of erisa claims procedures,see b,b.the first amended complaint also alleged that the trustees interfered with the plaintiffs rights protected under erisa in order to improve its financial condition,see the district court dismissed this count with prejudice before the case reached the summary judgment stage.
the pension fund moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted its motion.the district court deemed the claims related to erisa offset rules and claims procedures to have been abandoned,on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to address either claim in their response brief.see palmer marion county,cir.
the district court then turned to the plaintiffs claims,based on the march amendments,concerning the pension fund ability to obtain reimbursement of benefits paid to a pensioner while he was engaged in prohibited reemployment the court determined that the amendment was entirely consistent with earlier summary plan descriptions spds allowing for reimbursement from future benefits.therefore,the court reasoned,the rule was not implicated.furthermore,because the march amendments did not violate the rule,the court also determined that the plaintiffs claim for breach of fiduciary duty,as well as their claim that erisa notice requirements had been violated,failed as well.
the court next considered the claim that individual plaintiffs benefits wrongfully had been denied.the court reviewed the denial of benefits according to an arbitrary and capricious standard because the plan governing the pension fund gave discretionary authority to the administrator in making benefit determinations.the court determined that none of the benefit denials had been arbitrary or capricious because there was no evidence that the defendants stated reasons for denying benefits were false and no evidence that the trustees had interpreted plan terms in contravention of the plan plain meaning.
after the district court summary judgment decision,the trustees and the pension fund sought an award of attorneys fees.see g.the district court denied the motion.the district court determined that the plaintiffs had brought their claims in good faith.the court refused to infer bad faith from the defendants allegations that the plaintiffs claims had been brought for political reasons because,although the litigation was contentious,the plaintiffs made consistent arguments throughout the case and did not stubbornly attempt to relitigate failed claims.at.
furthermore,the court concluded that the plaintiffs suit was neither frivolous nor vexatious rather,it was substantially justified.id.the court reasoned that the plaintiffs lack of success does not suggest their claims had no basis in law or fact.id.indeed,in the court view,the challenge to the amended reimbursement provisions was based on a plausible construction of erisa.

erisa rule 
according to erisa rule,p lan amendments are permitted,but an amendment may not decrease benefits that have already accrued.heinz cent.laborers pension fund,cir.the rule derives from g,which provides that t he accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan.accrued benefit means,in the case of a defined benefit plan,the individual accrued benefit determined under the plan and expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.id.furthermore,the statute provides that a plan amendment which has the effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a subsidy with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits.id.g see also ahng allsteel,cir determining that early retirement benefits are accrued benefits within the meaning of erisa.
the plaintiffs argue that the march amendments violate the rule because section e of the new pension plan allows the pension fund to recover a greater amount of benefits paid in error than was allowed under section a of the old pension plan.specifically,they argue that their accrued benefits are being reduced because the offset allowed by new pension plan section e makes it more difficult to receive the payments.the pension fund,on the other hand,contends that the old pension plan permitted precisely the same recovery of wrongfully paid benefits that is allowed under the new pension plan.
in our view,the march amendments did not change a participant entitlement to benefits under the plan.both the old pension plan and the new pension plan suspend a pensioner benefits in any month in which he engages in prohibited reemployment.as well,both old pension plan section c and new pension plan section b allow the pension fund to suspend benefits payments when a pensioner fails to certify that he has not been working in prohibited reemployment or when he fails to provide requested information about his employment activities.moreover,both before and after the march amendments,the plan permitted the pension fund to recover any benefits that had been paid in error.the the pension fund can recover benefits paid in the same despite the fact that the old pension plan simply stated that the trustees had the right to recover benefit payments exceeding the amount determined by the provisions of the pension plan that were made due to mistake,at,whereas the new pension plan authorizes restitution of payments that the pensioner was not entitled to receive,according to the schedule set forth in section e,at.the march amendments do not make ineligible for benefits any person who would have been eligible prior to the changes.the amendments simply prevent a pensioner from receiving a windfall to which he has no right.
this reading is consistent with pension fund spds that emphasized recoupment as a possibility if benefits are paid in error.for instance,an spd issued in and provided to participants in the pension fund stated if you are working in prohibited reemployment your pension benefits will be suspended until you stop working.additionally,your future benefits may be reduced to reimburse the plan for any benefits improperly paid to you while you worked in prohibited reemployment,at emphasis in original.in light of all the evidence which we have reviewed,we conclude that the march amendments,as they relate to recoupment of wrongfully paid benefits,violate neither the plain wording nor the purpose of the rule 
b.the individual plaintiffs claims 
four of the.helvey,paule,arwood and rose,all had their benefits terminated and seek to recover the benefits lost.we shall review the circumstances surrounding the termination of each man benefits in greater detail below.
standard of review 
if,as was the case here,the administrator of a pension fund is granted discretion in making benefit determinations,then a reviewing court is limited to asking whether the decision to deny benefits was arbitrary or capricious.see fenster tepfer spitz,cir.under the arbitrary and capricious standard,we will overturn a plan administrator decision only if it is downright unreasonable.carr gates health care plan,cir internal quotation omitted,cert.denied,d.that is,this court will not su
