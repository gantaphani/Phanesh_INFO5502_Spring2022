backgrounda.
patrick was senior and chief actuary of montgomery ward company,ward.as a result of a scuba diving accident,is hearing impaired.in,he enrolled in the ward disability plan.by then,he was required to use hearing aids in both ears.the plan provided coverage for this condition.hearing progressively worsened and,in,he filed for disability benefits under the plan.the physician statement accompanying claim for disability diagnosed him with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and reported that had d ifficulty hearing,understanding,particularly in noise,in group situations and large listening areas,ex a.position required him to attend group meetings,a function his condition made impossible.
hartford life accident company hartford,the plan underwriter,approved his claim for benefits.mary fisher of hartford group disability department spoke with in january and suggested that he meet with jim radke,a specialist,to discuss modifications which could help perform his work.hartford received several reports from radke describing limitations.according to radke,indicates that he has really no difficulty with the communication,especially in an office setting.it is in loud or distracting environments that he experiences this problem,ex.radke also took note of demeanor and outlook at their meetings,because also was suffering from depression,brought on by his hearing loss and inability to work.
in march,filed a claim for disability benefits.on may,hartford sent a letter to informing him that his benefits were approved,retroactive to february.monthly pay was.his monthly benefits under the plan would be of that,less of any salary earned.informed hartford that he was earning a month as an internal consultant to ward.therefore his monthly benefit would be.was required to submit a copy of his monthly paystub to hartford.
on february,after a routine internal review as the initial period concluded,hartford sent a letter informing him that his benefits would terminate after february,because he was no longer disabled within the meaning of the plan joanne wiskow of hartford had reviewed medical information,radke reports and paystubs before concluding that he was no longer disabled.the letter informed of his right to appeal and to submit additional information.requested some documents from hartford before he filed his appeal and received medical information and radke reports.
retained counsel and appealed,submitting a transferable skills analysis tsa performed by avocational consultant whom had retained for the appeal.tsa,conducted by vocational consultant rita wolven,could find no job paying more than per year which was available to him.however,the tsa took into account depression,which was not covered under the plan.patricia swanson,regional manager of hartford claims office handled the appeal.swanson or her deputies reviewed the same material that had been before wiskow and did some additional research.wiskow spoke with an official at ward who confirmed consulting job fisher spoke again with radke who concluded that physical condition alone did not prevent him from doing his job fisher reviewed the tsa performed by consultant swanson spoke with the actuarial department at hartford and jim weiss of the chicago society of actuaries.hartford actuarial department and weiss identified numerous positions a person with experience and physical limitations could perform.some of these paid more than per year.with this information before her,swanson denied the claim.
filed suit under section of the employee retirement income security act erisa which provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights for future benefits under the terms of the plan.a.after discovery,hartford moved for summary judgment and the district court granted hartford motion.first,the court excused from erisa exhaustion requirement because the executive who would hear his appeal had already approved the denial of benefits,any further appeal would be futile.second,the court found that hartford denial of benefits was within a reasonable interpretation of the plan.
discussiona.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see quinn blue cross blue shield,cir.in determining whether an individual is entitled to benefits,a court normally examines the plan documents and interprets them de novo under federal rules of contract interpretation.hammond fid.guar.life ins,cir.however,if the plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to interpret the plan and to make eligibility determinations,a court will overturn that decision only if it is arbitrary and capricious.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d.
the plan at issue states that the hartford has full discretion and authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe and interpret all terms and provisions of the policy,ex at.therefore,we shall review hartford decision deferentially.see carr gates health plan,cir quoting butler encyclopedia brittanica,cir.under the arbitrary and capricious standard,we shall not set aside the denial of a claim if the carrier denial is based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant plan documents.cuddington.pub.serv,cir citations omitted.concedes the applicability of this standard of review,but argues that we should scrutinize hartford decision more carefully because of its alleged conflict of interest.
the presence of a conflict of interest does not change the standard of review.see firestone,at.perlman swiss bank.comprehensive disability protection plan,cir chojnacki,cir.it is a factor to be considered when deciding whether an administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.see firestone,at.in the absence of specific evidence of bias,we shall not presume that there is a significant bias.see mers marriott int l group accidental death dismemberment plan,cir cuddington,at.has not presented any specific evidence of a conflict of interest and,therefore,we shall not consider that factor in our determination of the reasonableness of hartford decision.
challenge to hartford decision runs along two tracks.first,contends that hartford interpretation of the plan was unreasonable because it failed to find him totally disabled when he was not capable of earning at least of his income.his second line of argument urges us to reverse hartford decision because it failed to engage in an intensive and scrupulous independent investigation to insure that it acted in the best interest of the plan beneficiaries.see hightshue aig life ins,cir internal quotations omitted.because of this failure to investigate,argues,hartford could not have based a reasonable decision on the evidence before it.
we first address contention that hartford interpretation of the plan was unreasonable because it failed to find him totally disabled when he was not capable of earning at least of his income.at the outset,it is important to note that the plan has two different disability periods.during the first disability period,which lasts one year,benefits are provided to a beneficiary who is prevented by a disability from doing each and every duty of his occupation,ex.in contrast,for the time following this twelve month period,benefits are provided for as long as the beneficiary is prevented by disability from doing any occupation or work which he is or could become qualified by training education or experience.id.the first period is not at issue here received benefits during that period because hartford agreed that his hearing loss had prevented him from performing every duty of his position as chief actuary.the dispute here focuses on the second period and the determination that is not totally
