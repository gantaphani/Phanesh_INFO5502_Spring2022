approximately airways current and retired pilots are in the midst of a lawsuit challenging benefit determinations of the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc.a subset of plaintiffs the pilots requested a preliminary injunction to prohibit the pbgc from implementing its benefit determinations while the suit is pending.after considering the four factors for a preliminary injunction,the district court denied the motion.because the pilots show neither a substantial likelihood of success on the merits nor irreparable harm,we affirm.
background 
on august,airways filed for chapter reorganization in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia.see generally in re airways group.the bankruptcy court found the reorganization plan would create a serious funding shortfall for the company defined benefit pension plan.id.at.the company moved for judicial findings to permit distress termination of the pilots retirement plan and notified the pbgc of its intent to terminate the plan.the bankruptcy court approved distress termination,and airways agreed with the pbgc to set march,as the termination date of the plan.
the pbgc is a federal government by the employee retirement income security act of erisa that insures private sector pension plans.see.the pbgc acts as guarantor of underfunded pension plans,paying benefits to participants such as the pilots in this action.see id.when a plan is underfunded,the pbgc benefit payments are subject to statutory and regulatory limits.see,id.erisa permits the pbgc to serve as trustee to administer an underfunded plan in addition to its role as guarantor.b.the pbgc has applied to serve as trustee in every terminated plan,and courts typically grant its application.pineiro pbgc,d.following this pattern,the pbgc was appointed to serve as trustee of the airways retirement plan.
under its usual practice,the pbgc began making initial payments to pilots based on an estimate of what the benefits would be.see boivin airways,d.the parties agree that it normally takes the pbgc between two and three years to make a final,formal determination of benefits for each participant.see id.without waiting for the final determination,a group of pilots challenged the estimated benefits.this court dismissed the claim for failure to exhaust,holding the pilots must await the final determination.boivin airways.
when a final benefits determination differs from the estimate,the pbgc either repays the shortfall or collects the surplus.if a participant was initially paid a estimate and the pbgc later determined the estimate to be too high,it requests repayment of the surplus amount in a process it calls recovery.if a participant is still receiving monthly benefit payments based on an initial estimate but the pbgc has determined that the estimate was too high,it reduces the amount of future monthly payments to recover the surplus in a process it calls recoupment.
in february,the pbgc finalized its formal benefit determinations and notified out of the plaintiffs that it would be seeking recovery or recoupment,depending on the circumstance.according to the pbgc,of the pilots,were sent recovery notices.jones decl.at.those pilots,on average,received payments of over.id.on average,the pbgc is seeking in recovery,and no pilot recovery amount is more than of the initial amount.id.the other pilots are still receiving monthly payments as to them,the pbgc is seeking an average recoupment of per month.id.no pilot recoupment is more than of their current monthly payment.id.
the pilots sought a preliminary injunction against the pbgc recovery and recoupment efforts.the district court denied the injunction,davis pbgc,d,and we affirm.
ii.standard of review 
the denial or grant of a preliminary injunction is classified as an immediately appealable interlocutory order.a.on a motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court must balance four factors the movant showing of a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,irreparable harm to the movant,substantial harm to the nonmovant,and public interest.cfgc england.this court review s a district court weighing of the four preliminary injunction factors and its ultimate decision to issue or deny such relief for abuse of discretion.id.legal whether the movant has established irreparable reviewed de novo.id.
the four factors have typically been evaluated on a sliding scale.davenport int l of teamsters.if the movant makes an unusually strong showing on one of the factors,then it does not necessarily have to make as strong a showing on another factor.for example,if the movant makes a very strong showing of irreparable harm and there is no substantial harm to the,then a correspondingly lower standard can be applied for likelihood of success.see,wmatc holiday tours.alternatively,if substantial harm to the nonmovant is very high and the showing of irreparable harm to the movant very low,the movant must demonstrate a much greater likelihood of success.it is in this sense that all four factors must be balanced against each other.davenport,at.when seeking a preliminary injunction,the movant has the burden to show that all four factors,taken together,weigh in favor of the injunction.cfgc,at.
the pilots,misreading our precedent,insist they need only establish that serious legal questions are at issue in order to succeed on appeal.appellants br.at.they reach that conclusion by focusing on language in holiday tours,where this court noted a movant need not necessarily show a likelihood of success on the first prong of the preliminary injunction analysis.at.but holiday tours did not eliminate the other factors.the court simply acknowledged that a lessor likelihood of success might suffice if each of the other three factors clearly favors granting the injunction.id.the pilots argue that,because the other three factors are not contrary to a preliminary injunction,they need only raise serious legal questions.appellants br.at.they are wrong.
the supreme court has recently addressed the standard for a preliminary injunction.see winter nrdc,d holding that irreparable injury must be likely,not just a possibility.we note that the analysis in winter could be read to create a more demanding burden,although the decision does not squarely discuss whether the four factors are to be balanced on a sliding scale.see id.at ginsburg,dissenting c ourts have evaluated claims for equitable relief on a sliding scale,sometimes awarding relief based on a lower likelihood of harm when the likelihood of success is very high.this court has never rejected that formulation,and i do not believe it does so today.we need not decide whether a stricter standard applies,because the pilots fail even under the sliding scale analysis of davenport.
iii.discussion 
of the eleven substantive claims in the lawsuit,only three are proffered in support of a preliminary injunction.first,the pilots argue the pbgc incorrectly interprets an erisa provision prioritizing benefits.the relevant language from erisa limits priority category prioritization level relevant benefits based on the provisions of the plan as in effect during the period ending on the plan termination date under which such benefit would be the least.a a.the pbgc has determined the plan has sufficient assets to cover all benefits in priority category,but the pilots believe the pbgc has improperly excluded the airways early retirement incentive program from priority category.
the program authorizes incentives for early retirement.the question is whether the program was in effect during the period ending on the plan termination date.id.emphasis added.the phrase is not defined in a a.the parties do not dispute the relevant dates the program was adopted by airways on december.the program included a effective date of january.by the terms of the program,no pilots could retire or collect payments under the program until may.the pension plan in this case was terminated on march,so the statutory period began on march.if the early retirement plan was in effect before march,then it satisfies the statutory requirement of being in effect for the full period.if,however,the early retirement plan did not g
