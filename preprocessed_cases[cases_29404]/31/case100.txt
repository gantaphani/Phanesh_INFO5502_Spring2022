linda lalonde and machelle,acting on behalf of a putative class of participants in and beneficiaries of an employee stock ownership plan esop known as the textron savings plan,brought lawsuits that were eventually consolidated against the plan textron,the plan sponsor the textron executives who allegedly administered the plan the textron savings plan committee and the plan trustee,the putnam fiduciary trust company.insofar as is relevant the operative complaint asserts that,between january,and december,defendants violated the employee retirement income security act erisa by breaching fiduciary duties owed to the class,see a,and by violating erisa provision,see c plaintiffs seek to remedy these statutory lapses through erisa enforcement provisions,a and,which authorize certain actions by plan participants and beneficiaries.
throughout the class period,defendants directed of employee contributions and of employer matching contributions into a stock fund that held only textron common stock.plaintiffs claim that,in investing so much of the class funds in textron stock during the class period,defendants violated duties of loyalty owed to the class and acted in an unlawfully manner because defendants knew or had reason to know that textron faced troubles that were certain to cause and did in fact cause a significant decline in the value of its stock.in support of these claims,plaintiffs allege with varying degrees of specificity that,during the class period,defendants were fiduciaries within the meaning of a textron earnings per share declined by over textron initiated a restructuring that was expected to culminate in the termination of over of its workforce textron artificially inflated the price of its stock by concealing internal problems that led to its lost earnings and restructuring malfeasance that was alleged to have been the subject of a federal securities lawsuit brought by textron shareholders and textron common stock significantly underperformed in comparison to the market as a whole measured in terms of the standard poor and textron peer group.despite this bleak scenario and in dereliction of their duties,plaintiffs say,defendants continued to fund the textron stock fund and prohibited the class from diversifying its retirement accounts 
defendants elected to challenge these claims under.b.in support of their arguments that the claims were not viable,defendants asserted that plaintiffs had pleaded insufficient facts to establish that any one of them was an erisa fiduciary that any one of them breached any fiduciary duties owed to the class putnam additionally argued that,as a directed fiduciary,see a,it lacked the investment discretion that must be found to have been abused if a viable breach of fiduciary duty claim is to lie.central to defendants arguments was the fact that the plan was an esop and,as such,designed to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities.see e a d a.in essence,defendants pleading rhetorically asked,how can defendants be found to have violated erisa in connection with the textron esop when they did nothing more than what congress contemplated would happen when an employer establishes an esop 
in a thorough opinion and order,the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss.with respect to the breach of fiduciary duty claims against the textron defendants,the court adopted the reasoning of moench robertson,cir,and kuper iovenko,cir,and held that an esop fiduciary is entitled to a presumption that its decision to remain invested in employer securities was reasonable.d at.accordingly,the court continued,in order to state a viable claim,plaintiffs must plead facts that,if proven at trial,would establish that the textron defendants abused their discretion in failing to diversify textron stock during the years and.id.
in defining the boundaries of the textron defendants discretion,the district court attempted to reconcile congress concern that fiduciaries must always act in the interests of plan beneficiaries with congress endorsement of employee stock ownership through the esop mechanism.see id.at in doing so,the district court looked to moench,kuper,and wright oregon metallurgical,d,aff cir,all of which grappled with this same problem.see d at.building from the facts and holdings of these cases,the court concluded that,in exercising its discretion to continue purchasing company stock,an esop fiduciary enjoys a presumption of reasonableness that may be overcome when a precipitous decline in the employer stock is combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.id.the court then granted the textron defendants motion to dismiss because t his is not one of those cases.id.in support of its ruling,the court stated that the complaint had alleged only a drop in stock price,a decline in corporate profits,and a restructuring of the company during the class period.see id.the court also speculated that,had the textron defendants decided not to remain fully invested in textron stock per the terms of the plan,they might have triggered an even steeper invited a lawsuit when the stock later appreciated.see id.
although this line of reasoning applies with equal force to the breach of fiduciary duty claims against putnam,the district court also went on to analyze whether putnam was a directed fiduciary within the meaning of a.see id.at.following the course charted in beddall,at,the court parsed the plan documents and concluded that putnam was a directed fiduciary as a matter of law.see d at.as such,the court reasoned,putnam lacked the discretionary authority to do what plaintiffs say it should have done ignore the directions of the plan administrator to keep investing and to remain invested in textron stock.see id.at.the court did not,however,go on to discuss plaintiffs alternative argument that,even if putnam were a directed trustee,it still could be held to have violated a if it followed directions from the textron defendants that were contrary to erisa.id.
with respect to plaintiffs claims,the district court granted textron motion to dismiss on the basis of a line of cases holding that c does not prevent an employer from enjoying indirect benefits associated with plan investment decisions.id.at collecting cases.the court granted putnam motion on the basis of its prior ruling that putnam lacked discretion with respect to investment decisions and therefore was not a fiduciary subject to liability under erisa provision.id.at.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erroneously scrutinized their allegations as if defendants had moved not to dismiss the complaint under.b,but rather for summary judgment under.in pressing this claim,plaintiffs make a subsidiary argument that the court defined an esop fiduciary duty too narrowly when it stated that a discontinuation of plan funding is required only where there is a precipitous decline in the value of the company stock combined with evidence of an impending collapse or serious internal mismanagement textron responds by suggesting in a footnote that the court formulation of an esop fiduciary duty is not adequately deferential to congress intent to foster esop investment in employer stock,but otherwise is content to defend the court dismissal under the rule the court derived from moench,kuper,and wright.
we turn first to plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claims against textron.as set forth above,the district court concluded that the allegations in the complaint and the reasonable inferences they give rise to were insufficient because the facts in stock price and corporate profits and a significant corporate could support a finding that the rule had been satisfied.see lalonde,d at.as an initial matter,we share the parties concerns about the court distillation of the breach of fiduciary standard into the more specific decisional principle extracted from moench,kuper,and wright and applied to plaintiffs pleading.because the important and complex area of law implicated by plaintiffs claims is neither mature nor uniform,see supra,we believe that we would run a very high risk of error were we to lay down a
