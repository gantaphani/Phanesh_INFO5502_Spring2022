facts and proceedings below 
on august,chevron corporation chevron acquired unocal corporation unocal stone was employed by unocal at the time as a senior staff machinery engineer.upon acquiring unocal,chevron extended stone two different job with identical compensation packages.
chevron offered stone a base pay equal to his base pay at unocal.additionally,chevron success sharing program css replaced the annual incentive program aip in which stone participated as a unocal employee.under css,stone potentially qualified for a target bonus equaling of his base pay,while under the aip,stone was only eligible for a target bonus of of his base pay.further,chevron matched of stone k contributions,compared to unocal match.chevron also recognized stone years of service and preserved his unocal pension benefits.though chevron established a plan equivalent to unocal long term incentive plans ltip,stone was not eligible for the plan,and thus lost his long term incentive award lti.to offset this reduction,chevron provided stone with a continuation bonus equal to of his base pay,so long as he remained employed through march.this bonus exactly matched the discretionary award of restricted stock and stock options stone would have received under unocal ltip.
stone accepted a position with chevron as a senior staff machinery engineer.he conditioned his acceptance on a review of the offer,which he believed might not provide benefits and compensation equivalent to those he received while employed at unocal.in october,stone received a raise in his base pay.
chevron acquisition of unocal constituted a change of control for purposes of any employee arrangement and for all other company benefit plans.former unocal employees could qualify for special,enhanced change of control benefits if,within months of the acquisition,the employee was either involuntarily terminated or resigned within sixty days after the occurrence of a constructive discharge event.the unocal retirement plan,in article e,defined constructive discharge as follows 
a n employee resignation of employment with a participating company,with a controlling entity,or with a successor entity within days of the occurrence of any of the following events,provided that such event was initiated by a participating company,a controlling entity,or a successor entity 
a reduction in the employee base pay.
a reduction in the employee annual incentive target award s under an applicable annual cash bonus program in which the employee participates,which is included as earnings under section of the unocal retirement plan.
a reduction in the employee eligibility for or amount of benefits available to the employee under this article,or under the change of control event provisions of any other benefit plan of the company,or the employee annual incentive target amount under the change of control event provisions of any or annual incentive compensation program of the company.
a reduction in the benefits or perquisites available to the eligible employee or his dependents as of the day immediately before the change of control benefits include,without limitation,qualified or nonqualified defined benefit or defined contribution pension benefits or annual incentive compensation programs however,a reduction in benefits or perquisites shall not include a modification of benefits or perquisites which results from a change effected in the ordinary course of business which is applicable to all employees of the controlling entity or the successor entity and which does not result in a material reduction in the aggregate value of benefits and perquisites available to the eligible employee 
in january,stone submitted a constructive discharge application to chevron change of control administrator administrator.he alleged the following constructive discharge events under article e chevron job offer eliminated his lti award,resulting in a reduction in benefits under article e the continuation bonus offered by chevron was insufficient and reduced the benefits previously available to stone and chevron offer disregarded his annual lump sum increase lsi payment,resulting in a reduction in base pay and establishing constructive discharge under article e.to satisfy eligibility requirements for change of control benefits,stone resigned from his position at chevron on february,
on february,the administrator denied stone claim.the administrator found that the elimination of the lti did not reduce stone eligibility for benefits under article e,which applied only to change of control benefits.the administrator explained that under the lti change of control provisions,upon a change of control event,stone lti awards vested and became immediately exercisable.the administrator explained that chevron executed the ltip change of control provisions thus,stone received his benefits for and did not qualify for a constructive discharge under article e.
the administrator also found that the elimination of lti did not materially reduce stone benefits as required by article e.the administrator explained that,as a prerequisite to eligibility under article e,stone must have suffered a material reduction in aggregate benefits.the administrator compared the value of benefits to which stone was entitled the day preceding the change of control and the aggregate value of benefits to which he was entitled the day after the alleged constructive discharge events and determined that the continuation bonus offset the elimination of stone lti for.thus,the administrator concluded,stone did not experience a material reduction in benefits for.the administrator declined to speculate about material reductions in future years.
finally,the administrator found that stone lsi loss did not constitute constructive discharge under article e.the administrator noted that stone did not qualify for constructive discharge under article e because stone received a higher target bonus under chevron cash program.the administrator also found article e inapplicable to the elimination of lsi because under unocal policies lsi did not constitute base pay.lastly,the administrator found article e inapplicable.the administrator compared the base pay increase stone received from chevron with his lsi loss,and because stone salary increases exceeded any lsi reduction,the administrator held that a material reduction did not occur.
stone appealed the administrator decision to the change of control appeals committee committee,which had exclusive and final discretionary authority to interpret and apply plan provisions.stone argued that the administrator wrongfully denied his claim concerning the loss of lti and argued that article e requires the administrator to account for future losses.the committee reviewed the decision provided by the administrator but did not defer to his determination.the committee,like the administrator,interpreted the provision to require consideration of potential benefits available the day before the change of control and the day constructive discharge is claimed thus,speculative future losses would not be considered when making the comparison.the committee denied stone appeal.
neither the administrator nor the committee inquired into or considered the cost of granting or denying constructive discharge benefits.the committee compensation was not affected by the number of appeals granted or denied.it did not report,directly or indirectly,to the chevron employee with corporate responsibility for constructive discharge claims.all members of the committee were knowledgeable professionals with experience in human resources and employee benefits,and they had independent counsel to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities.
stone filed suit in federal district court seeking to overturn the committee determination.stone alleged that he was unlawfully denied plan benefits in violation of erisa,specifically a b.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants,holding that the administrator and committee interpretation of the plan was legally correct.the district court also held that the fact that chevron employed the administrator and committee was insufficient evidence to show a conflict of interest,and in any event,no abuse of discretion was made.stone now appeals.
discussion 
this court reviews summary judgments in erisa cases de novo.crowell shell oil,cir.because the plan gives the committee discretionary authority to construe plan terms and apply its provisions,its decision is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.see white luke episcopal health,wl cir,unpublished.we apply a process when conducting this abuse of discretion review.crowell,at.first,we determine whether the administrator and committee determination was legally correct.id.if so,the inquiry ends and there is no abuse of discretion.id.alternatively,if the court finds the administrator interpretation was legally incorrect,the court must then determine whether the administrator decision was an abuse of discretion.employee benefits,cir.only upon reaching this second step must the court weigh as a factor whether the administrator operated under a conflict of interest.see white,slip op.at crowell,at.
stone finds fault with this analysis.he argues that the supreme court decision in metropolitan life insurance,glenn,d,requires a reviewing court to consider conflicts of interest as a factor in their analysis thus,he maintains that the fifth circuit analysis,which allows a reviewing court to ignore a conflict of interest in the event of a legally correct interpretation,directly contradicts the supreme court holding.we disagree.
in metropolitan life,the supreme court was faced with the issue of whether a plan administrator that both evaluates and pays claims operates under a conflict of interest in making discretionary benefit determinations,and if so,how that conflict should be taken into account on judicial review.at.the court held that a conflict of interest does exist where the entity that administers the plan both determines whether an employee is eligible for benefits and pays benefits out of its own pocket.id.at.the court further held that a reviewing court should consider that conflict as a factor in determining whether the plan administrator has abused its discretion in denying benefits.id.the significance of the conflict depend s upon the circumstances of the particular case.id.
thus,metropolitan life announced a new standard for evaluating a conflict of interest however,that new standard does not affect the first step of this circuit analysis and only comes in to play during the second step in considering whether an abuse of discretion has occurred,white,slip op.at crowell,at.this circuit does not consider a conflict of interest until the second stage of the analysis because if an administrator interpretation is legally correct no abuse of discretion could have occurred.white,slip op.at.therefore,metropolitan life has no relevance to the district court determination that the administrator and committee decision was legally correct.if we agree with that conclusion,we need not consider whether there was a conflict of interest or an abuse of discretion.
legally correct interpretation 
this court considers three factors when deciding whether an interpretation is legally correct whether the administrator has given the plan a uniform construction,whether the interpretation is consistent with a fair reading of the plan,and any unanticipated costs resulting from different interpretations of the plan.crowell,at.the most important factor in this analysis is whether the administrator interpretation was consistent with a fair reading of the plan.id.at.
uniform construction 
stone first complaint is that the administrator and committee did not consistently apply the plan to similarly situated applicants.stone alleges that the administrator and committee acted inconsistently with regard to two groups of applicants earners,like stone,claiming a constructive discharge due to a loss of lti benefits and earners claiming a constructive discharge due to a reduction in base pay for travel time.
as to the first group,stone argues that the committee acted inconsistently when it granted the claims of four applicants alleging a loss of lti benefits.these four applicants were a part of a group of individuals claiming constructive discharge benefits due to lost lti benefits.among that group,only four applicants were ultimately successful.two of those applicants did not receive a continuation bonus or any other additional benefits to offset their lost lti award.the committee determined that absent this bonus,the applicants suffered a material reduction in aggregate benefits,resulting in a constructive discharge.the other two applicants did receive a continuation bonus however,their lti benefits had equaled of their base pay,which amounted to more than each.because the bonus did not offset lost lti benefits,the committee determined that they had suffered a material reduction in aggregate benefits as well.
in contrast,stone was offered a bonus to offset the loss of his lti this bonus exactly matched his lti benefits which amounted to only of his base pay at unocal.thus,stone was not similarly situated to the four applicants whose constructive discharge claims were granted.and the denial of his claim was consistent with the administrator and committee treatment of the other applicants whose claims were denied because they received a continuation bonus that adequately offset lost lti benefits.
as to the second group,stone alleges that the administrator granted the claims of applicants by inconsistently treating their claims as a reduction in base pay under article e rather than requiring a material aggregate reduction in benefits under article e.these earners worked at offshore locations.as unocal employees,they were paid between and thirty dollars per hour for travel to and from those locations.after the change of control,chevron paid these workers only eighteen dollars per hitch,which was the rough equivalent of paying the workers minimum wage for their travel time.the administrator interpreted this reduction to fall under article e thus,equating it to a reduction in base pay,and he granted all applicants constructive discharge benefits.
stone argues that the employees aggregate loss of income associated with travel should have been treated similarly to losses associated with stock options,restricted stocks,and bonuses.there is nothing in article e to suggest that payment for travel time was considered a benefit under the plan,and because unocal employees were paid by the hour,it is reasonable to assume that their base income included payment for travel time to and from work.unlike these travel time payments,stone lti award was not part of his base,it was interpreted as a benefit because it consisted of stock options and restricted stock benefits.additionally,stone made no administrative claims concerning a reduction in base pay,and he admitted that his base pay at chevron was higher than it had been at unocal.because the lti award constituted a benefit,it was consistent for the committee to review its loss under article e.and because the earners were not similarly situated to stone,the grant of their constructive discharge claims does not evidence an inconsistent construction of the plan provisions.
thus,stone has failed to point to any similarly situated individuals whose constructive discharge claims were treated differently from his own,and based upon the record,it appears the administrator and committee uniformly construed and applied the plan provisions.
fair reading 
stone also argues that the administrator and committee did not give article e a fair reading
