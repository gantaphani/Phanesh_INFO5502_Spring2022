the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a law meant to guarantee that employees will receive the retirement benefits they are promised,governs pension plans.we determine whether the calculation of retirement benefits that the united refining company and who appeal and are collectively referred to throughout this opinion as united provided in a pension plan to a specific class of former employees collectively,employees varied,as united argues,depending on how old they were when they elected to receive the benefits.because united reading finds no support in the text of the plans,we affirm the rulings of the district court.
factual background and procedural history 
john cottillion worked at united for years,from until.he was years old when he quit,and his benefits had vested under the plan,which is the version of united pension plan for salaried employees that applies to people whose benefits vested,became under erisa after but before.because his employment at united was long enough to vest benefits and he was too young on leaving united to receive those benefits,cottillion belongs to the subset of former united employees involved in this lawsuit terminated vested participants or tvps in united pension plan.tvps are distinct from early retirees,who are not a part of this litigation the latter are people who retired directly from united at an age older than or depending on the applicable plan but younger than.
when cotillion left the company,united wrote a letter informing him that a s a terminated pension plan participant with a vested interest,you are eligible for a deferred retirement benefit from the united refining company pension plan for salary sic employees.the letter further stated that he may elect to have his monthly retirement benefit begin at anytime sic after october,the month in which cottillion would turn,and that his monthly retirement benefit will be at age.the letter did not state that the amount of cottillion benefit depended on whether he elected to receive it at age or later.tvps under the plan were likewise informed of their pension amounts and told they could receive them the month following their birthday without any reduction for early retirement,beverly eldridge,application for commencement of deferred vested benefits,terminated vested participants.
on january,united amended and restated the plan,backdated to january,the plan,to comply with amendments to erisa.the internal revenue service informed united that certain changes needed to be made to the plan before it could issue a letter confirming that the plan would receive favorable tax treatment in response,united amended the plan,effective january,the plan.both the and plans included a c,absent from the and plans,stating that the benefits of tvps who receive pensions before age would be actuarially reduced to reflect the earlier starting date thereof.neither the plan nor the plan applies to any in this case,but they are relevant because of what happened next.
in,plan actuaries professionals who perform a variety of services relating to implementing and maintaining erisa plans at the firm towers perrin informed lawrence loughlin,the plan administrator,that united had erroneously paid to tvps vested under the and plans pensions that were not actuarially reduced,calculated in light of the tvp age.the younger a beneficiary is,the longer she will receive benefits,and thus retirement plans often lower benefits for people who take them early so that the benefits are worth the same regardless when they begin to be paid.because operational deviations from the terms of plans can jeopardize their favorable tax treatment,john owsen,united now deceased longtime outside counsel for benefits matters,sent a letter to the irs in november proposing to recoup the excess funds paid.owsen letter followed the irs voluntary correction program through which employers may notify the service of proposals to fix mistakes in administering erisa plans and receive assurance that the irs will not disqualify a plan from favorable tax treatment.the letter cited and attached the version of c,but it did not call attention to the absence of this language in the and plans.in march the irs issued a compliance statement,which affirmed that the irs will not pursue the sanction of plan disqualification on account of the qualification failure described in the submission,but cautioned that it does not express an opinion as to the accuracy or acceptability of any material submitted with the application and should not be construed as affecting the rights of any party under any other law,including erisa.
in july and august,after notification from towers perrin but before the irs correspondence,united sent letters to tvps who had not yet begun to receive benefits to clarify when you can receive your pension from united refining company and under what terms.this letter stated that if a tvp elected to receive retirement benefits before turning,the benefit would be reduced to reflect the early election date in accord with the following table 
about a year later,united sent letters to tvps who were already receiving pensions.these letters stated,the plan document requires that all pension benefits paid to terminated vested participants prior to their normal retirement age of years must be actuarially reduced to the earlier payment date emphasis in original.indeed,some retirees were told that in two weeks from the date of the letter their monthly pension would be lowered until the excess payments have been recovered,after which you will begin receiving the amount that should have been provided to you based on the correct calculation.others were told that in two weeks your monthly pension benefit payment will stop and you will not receive any future payments.additionally,in order to recover excess payments,you should repay the plan the amount of money already paid that exceeded the actuarially reduced benefit.in cottillion case,his pension of per month was eliminated,and he was told he should pay the plan.the letters represented that the reductions were necessary for the plan to retain its favorable tax treatment under the internal revenue code and that the statements in the letter were based on the irs published revenue procedures and compliance statement which the plan retirement committee must follow.
after receiving this letter,the employees represent that cottillion had a telephone conversation with loughlin,the plan administrator and author of the letter,during which cottillion complained about the reduction in pension benefits.loughlin told him that the reduction corrected a mistake that had resulted in excessive payments.several other aggrieved tvps wrote to loughlin,who replied by letter that the plan documents required the correction to maintain the plan favorable tax treatment.some,but not all,who complained were informed that they could file a written appeal of loughlin decision.
the employees sued in the western district of pennsylvania alleging,as relevant here,that united actions deprived them of a benefit to which they were entitled under the plan,in violation of a b,and that they violated erisa rule,g,which prohibits employers from amending a plan in a way that reduces benefits accrued under a defined benefit plan such as the plans at issue here.judge sean mclaughlin denied united motion to dismiss and later granted the employees motion for summary judgment in part and denied united motion for summary judgment,holding that united actions violated the rule.when judge mclaughlin resigned to enter the business world,the case was assigned to judge cathy bissoon.she granted the employees motion for class certification,granted in part their motion for final remedy enjoining united from actuarially reducing employees benefits and awarding damages to make whole those who had been receiving too little,but declining to order united to pay anything to tvps who had not yet elected to receive benefits,and granted united motion for judgment on the pleadings,dismissing with prejudice the employees remaining counts because any relief would be duplicative.
united appeals mclaughlin summary judgment decision and judge bissoon order on remedies.the employees the latter order and the award of judgment on the pleadings.
ii.the district court properly excused the employees from exhausting plan remedies.
united argues that it was entitled to summary judgment because the named plaintiffs failed to exhaust the remedies available to them under the plan.see,harrow prudential ins.of,cir.the employees do not dispute that ordinarily the named plaintiff in an erisa class action must exhaust plan remedies before bringing suit and that cottillion and beverly eldridge did not,but they argue that they were not required to exhaust remedies because of the nature of their claim exhaustion is an affirmative defense and united has not met its burden of persuasion on the issue and there is undisputed record evidence that exhaustion would have been futile.
while we review de novo the legal standard that a district court applies in determining whether an employee must exhaust plan remedies before coming to federal court,the court ultimate decision whether to require a plaintiff to exhaust is committed to its sound discretion.harrow,at see also cbs,cir dishman unum life ins.of,cir stevens employer teamsters joint council pension fund,cir springer wal mart,cir janowski int l of teamsters local pension fund,cir,judgment vacated on other grounds,d.
the employees argue that the exhaustion requirement does not apply to their claim based on g,as there is a distinction between claims based on pension rights created by contract,which must be exhausted if the plan provides for remedies,and claims based on purely statutory rights created by erisa,which may be asserted in federal court directly.delgrosso spang,cir.we need not resolve whether in general the exhaustion requirement applies to an claim or whether this particular suit states a simple contract claim artfully dressed in statutory clothing.drinkwater metro.life ins,cir.as discussed below,the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that exhaustion would prove futile.
the employees misconstrue the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement when they argue that,because exhaustion is an affirmative defense,united bears the burden of proving that it would not be futile.true,t he exhaustion requirement is a nonjurisdictional affirmative defense for united.metro.life ins.price,cir.yet futility is an exception to the exhaustion requirement,and a party invoking this exception must provide a clear and positive showing of futility before the district court,at accord harrow,at.therefore,this argument against dismissal for failure to exhaust also fails.
in any event,the district court held that the employees had shown exhaustion of their plan remedies would have been futile.as we wrote in harrow 
whether to excuse exhaustion on futility grounds rests upon weighing several factors,including whether plaintiff diligently pursued administrative relief whether plaintiff acted reasonably in seeking immediate judicial review under the circumstances existence of a fixed policy denying benefits failure of the defendant to comply with its own internal administrative procedures and testimony of plan administrators that any administrative appeal was futile.of course,all factors may not weigh equally.
the district court excused the employees from the exhaustion requirement because they showed that united had a fixed policy of denying benefits.cottillion united ref,cv,wl,at.the employees made this showing by supplying the district court with extensive correspondence between loughlin and aggrieved tvps.loughlin sent form letters out to all tvps apprising them of the reduction in their benefits.when anyone wrote back to him to complain,loughlin would reply that the change in benefits was mandated by the irs.many of the letters failed to inform recipients of the possibility of an appeal.there is no evidence in the record that any tvp got anywhere by seeking further review from loughlin,and that united continues to adhere to the position that tvps are only entitled to actuarially reduced benefits further supports the inference that exhaustion was futile.at least one tvp frederick hane followed the instructions in loughlin letter and the plan appeals procedures.but rather than demonstrate that the issues raised in hane letter were considered an appeal of an earlier determination,loughlin on behalf of the retirement committee treated hane objections as questions and offered him no relief or opportunity for further review.
the failure of hane appeal,the existence of a fixed policy denying benefits as evidenced by the correspondence between loughlin and the many tvps with letters in the record,and the absence of any evidence before us to suggest that an appeal from loughlin letter was anything other than time wasted,lead us to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement.thus we continue.
iii.the plans unambiguously afforded tvps retirement benefits without actuarial reduction.
the and plans gave the plan administrator discretion in interpreting their terms.thus,in evaluating the employees claim,we review loughlin interpretation under a deferential standard and will uphold it unless it is arbitrary and capricious.firestone tire rubber bruch,d fleisher standard ins,cir.however,the parties dispute the standard of review for the employees claim that loughlin interpretation of the plan adopted in his letters to tvps that the plan provided only actuarially adjusted benefits,contrary to united earlier representations violated the rule.the employees urge that the district court correctly deferred to loughlin first interpretation of the plans that they provided benefits in the same dollar amount to tvps who elected to receive them before age as to those who began receiving them at age or later and correctly did not defer to the second one as the reinterpretation was really a sub rosa plan amendment to reduce accrued benefits in violation of the rule.united argues that under conkright frommert,d,loughlin final interpretation the one allowing reduction of benefits is entitled to deference.
we need not determine who has the better of this argument.as we shall see,no amount of deference can rescue loughlin second interpretation from its flat contradiction with the terms of the and plans.we therefore assume without deciding that the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard applies,under which a court may overturn a decision of the plan administrator only if it is without reason,unsupported by the evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.mitchell eastman kodak,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting abnathya hoffmann laroche,cir,abrogated on other grounds by metro.life ins.glenn,d.even under that standard,an administrator interpretation may not controvert the plain language of the document.dewitt penn del directory,cir.
a.the plans texts support the employees position.
to determine whether loughlin second interpretation contradicts the actual words of the and plans,we quote the relevant provisions.
article vii of the plan reads 
required service for vesting 
if a participant employment shall terminate prior to his normal retirement date age,or an early retirement date age,for any reason other than death,he shall be entitled to a deferred vested retirement income if he is credited with at least ten years of vesting service at the time of his employment termination 
amount and commencement of deferred vested retirement income 
the amount and time of commencement of a deferred vested retirement income to a participant who satisfies the requirements of section shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section,based on the participant benefit service and average compensation at the time of employment termination 
section provides 
a participant who retires on an early retirement date may elect to receive one of the following 
a his accrued retirement income computed as of his early retirement date commencing at the end of the month in which his normal retirement date would have occurred.
b a reduced amount of retirement income to begin at the end of the month in which his early retirement date occurs,computed so as to be a percentage of the benefit provided for him under paragraph a of this section,in accordance with the following table 
on october,united put in place amendment to the plan,effective july.amendment,which applies to all class members covered by the plan,in relevant part rewrites of the plan to read in its entirety 
a participant who retires on an early retirement date will receive his accrued retirement income computed as of his early retirement date commencing at the end of the month in which his early retirement date occurs.
accrued retirement income as of any particular date is defined under as an amount to be computed in accordance with,which lays out the method of calculation for the annual rate of retirement income.section describes the method of calculation as roughly speaking a percentage of average compensation multiplied by time of service with united,with qualifications and complications not at issue in this appeal.
to summarize,per a tvp gets retirement income in accordance with,which states that a participant who retires is entitled to accrued retirement income,which is calculated under with respect to a participant average compensation and length of service with the company.
the plan is quite similar as it concerns this appeal.article vii provides 
required service for vesting.
if a participant employment shall terminate prior to his normal retirement date for any reason other than death,he shall be entitled to a deferred vested retirement income if he is credited with at least five years of vesting service at the time of his employment termination 
amount and commencement of deferred vested retirement income.
the amount of a deferred vested retirement income to a participant who satisfies the requirements of section shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section,based on the participant benefit service and average compensation at the time of employment termination 
section provides 
early retirement annual accrued retirement income.
a participant who retires on an early retirement date will receive his accrued retirement income computed as of his early retirement date commencing at the end of the month in which his early retirement date occurs.
accrued retirement income is the amount specified in,which,as in the plan,is the amount computed in accordance with section,which in turn provides a formula roughly based on a percentage of average compensation multiplied by the employee tenure at united.
the early retirement date under the plan initially occurred the month after an employee turned,but it was lowered effective february,to age.
a straightforward reading of the and plans,consistent with united early interpretations of these plans,leads to the conclusion that tvps were entitled to pensions in an amount that did not include an actuarial adjustment for the number of years younger than that they were when they retired.under both plans,tells us that a tvp gets retirement income in accord with,which states that a retiree is entitled to accrued retirement income,which is calculated under with respect to a participant average compensation and length of service with the company.not one of these provisions treats tvps differently from people who retire directly from united,and no provision requires actuarial adjustment read reduction for taking retirement benefits early.loughlin second interpretation conflicted with the plain meaning of the terms of the plans and thus denied the employees benefits due them in violation of a b,notwithstanding the plans conferral on him of discretion to interpret plan provisions.epright envtl.res.health welfare plan,cir by imposing a requirement which is extrinsic to the plan s,defendants have acted arbitrarily and capriciously.
the second interpretation also violated the rule,which occurs when an accrued benefit is eliminated or reduced by a plan amendment.g.there is no question but that a standard early retirement benefit,provided exclusively upon the satisfaction of certain age service requirements,is an accrued benefit that is protected by g bellas cbs,cir.sections and of both plans provide precisely the early retirement benefits described in bellas and are thus accrued benefits.
united argues,however,that the early retirement benefits are not accrued benefits because of both plans provide calculations for t he annual rate of retirement income payable to a participant who retires on or after his normal retirement date.emphasis added.thus,according to united,anyone who retires before his normal retirement date has no accrued retirement benefits.what this argument ignores is the combined effect of,and.section vests retirement income in tvps directs the administrator to calculate tvps accrued retirement income as of the date of early retirement,while states that the amount of accrued retirement income is computed in accordance with section.in other words,and provide the method for computing tvps benefits,while actually confers the benefits,making them accrued within the meaning of erisa.
our court view of what constitutes an amendment to a pension plan has been construed broadly to protect pension recipients.battoni ibew local union employee pension plan,cir.an erroneous interpretation of a plan provision that results in the improper denial of benefits to a plan participant may be construed as an amendment for the purposes of g.hein,cir 
the critical question in this case,in light of the absence of a formal plan amendment,is whether loughlin interpretation of the plan improperly denied accrued benefits to the employees.id.at.the answer is yes.in,united understanding of the plans accorded with the plain reading of the plans that we have discussed above.by,united had reinterpreted the plans and decided that they required actuarial adjustments to the amounts paid to tvps who took early retirement.this incorrect interpretation resulted in the improper denial of tvps accrued early retirement benefits and thus violated erisa rule.
united counterarguments fail to persuade.
united makes several arguments to the contrary,none convincing.its arguments can be grouped into four categories internal textual arguments the text of the and plans supports united external textual arguments the text of documents other than the plans supports united structural the plans address early retirees and tvps in separate sections,and thus they treat differently these different kinds of participants and statutory because erisa sets a floor for benefits,we should interpret the plans to provide only that floor absent a clear and express plan provision to the contrary.we address each in turn.
the internal textual argument 
united argument from the plans text is that entitles only a participant who retires on an early retirement date to benefits emphasis added.they argue that retire means retire from united,because retirement date expressly required actual retirement from the company with an immediate right to draw down a pension benefit.opening br.at.recall that by definition all tvps left united before they were old enough to retire from the company at age or.but no definition in any plan defines retire or retirement date with reference to separation from united.instead,both the and plans at define retirement date as the date of actual retirement,but not actual retirement from united.
for support,united cites pages and of the joint appendix.both citations lead to united statement of material facts in support of its motion for summary judgment,and that document in turn cites an expert report by nancy keppelman an erisa lawyer interpreting the plans.setting aside the problem of considering expert testimony on the interpretation of a pension plan,which is a purely legal question and not properly the subject of expert testimony,nieves villanueva soto rivera,cir collecting circuit cases haberern kaupp vascular surgeons.defined ben.plan trust agreement,the expert does not even support united interpretation of the meaning of retire.keppelman writes,the from to did not confer early retirement benefits on tvp keppelman report,ecf.it m
