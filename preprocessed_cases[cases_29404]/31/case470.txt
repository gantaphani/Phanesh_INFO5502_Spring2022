joseph griggs brought an action against his former employer dupont de nemours company dupont under section a of the employee retirement income security act erisa,see a west.griggs claimed that dupont breached its fiduciary duty by leading griggs to believe that he was eligible for a lump sum distribution of early retirement benefits under dupont temporary pension system and then failing to notify griggs when dupont learned that griggs election to receive such a distribution was not permitted by federal tax laws.instead,dupont made the distribution directly to griggs which resulted in an immediate tax and defeated the reason that griggs elected to retire early.the district court concluded that dupont breached its fiduciary duty but held that erisa does not provide the relief that griggs seeks.we agree that,under these circumstances,dupont breached its duty as an erisa fiduciary.however,we conclude that griggs is not necessarily without a remedy under erisa,and we remand for the district court to explore the issue further.
dupont serves as the administrator for its pension and retirement plan the pension plan,a defined benefit pension plan under the internal revenue code tax code,see a west supp,and erisa,see,west.dupont also administers a qualified contribution plan known as the savings and investment plan sip.the sip is a retirement savings vehicle akin to a k plan through which an employee benefits accumulate on a basis.
in,dupont amended the pension plan to create a program called the temporary pension system tps.according to dupont,tps was designed to assist dupont employees who were leaving their jobs at dupont,but not necessarily retiring.a participant in tps was entitled to one month of pay for every two years of service,not to exceed one year salary,in addition to any other benefits from the pension plan to which the participant might be entitled.the tps benefit could be received as either a lump sum payment or as an additional amount added to the employee regular monthly pension payment.benefits under tps,however,were not universally available to dupont employees at all times.instead,tps benefits were offered to employees for a limited window period,and the decision to make tps benefits available occurred on the regional level.
griggs was a employee of dupont.he began his employment in and eventually became operations manager for dupont nylon fibers division.griggs was serving in this capacity when he elected early retirement in.during the year or so preceding griggs retirement,dupont was closing one of its nylon plants and,as a result,decided that a workforce reduction was necessary.it was griggs understanding that because of the decreased need for employees,dupont decided to make tps benefits available to employees in the nylon division as an incentive to retire early.dupont,however,disputes that the purpose of tps was to encourage early retirement rather,the essential aim of tps was to provide transition assistance as employees move from a career with dupont to a career elsewhere.
whatever the primary aim of tps,everyone agrees that tps benefits were made available in to a group of dupont employees that included griggs.and,given his service,griggs was among those employees who would be entitled,in addition to his regular pension,to a tps benefit equivalent to a full year salary.
initially,griggs was reluctant to consider leaving his position with dupont and retiring early.griggs was not being forced out of dupont,and there is nothing before us that suggests griggs was being pressured to accept the tps offer.in may,however,griggs received a written communication from dupont providing details about tps that caused him to reevaluate whether he should retire early.for griggs,what really made the tps offer attractive was the option to receive his full tps benefit in a lump sum that could be rolled over from the pension plan into his sip account with dupont or another qualified vehicle where it would grow on a basis.in its description of the tps program,dupont explained that 
tps provides a benefit from the pension and retirement plan in addition to the other pension benefit s that you are currently eligible to receive.the additional benefit is as follows 
one month of pay for every two years of service.pay to include base pay,shift differential pay,sunday premium,scheduled overtime pay and any incentive compensation award made in the previous twelve months.the minimum benefit is equal to two months pay,the maximum is twelve months pay.
this additional tps benefit may be taken as a lump sum,or may be added to the monthly payments under an immediate or deferred pension.if taken as a lump sum,all or part of the lump sum can be rolled into the dupont savings and investment plan sip,or any qualified ira,within days.
because this benefit is paid from the pension trust,in some cases taking the lump sum without rolling it over will cause you to incur an early payment excise tax.if that applies to you,a tax gross up allowance will be paid to offset any overall addition to your taxes.
this was general,form language that was provided to all potential participants in tps.other than this may communication,dupont did not make any representations to griggs concerning the tax implications of his decision to take a lump sum distribution,nor did griggs request any information from dupont regarding the potential tax impact on him individually.
after receiving dupont written description of tps benefits,griggs opted for early retirement and elected to receive his tps benefit in a lump sum,believing that he could roll it over into the dupont sip without incurring immediate tax liability.in july,griggs received a written statement indicating that,if he were to apply for tps benefits,the amount of his lump sum distribution would be,which is about what he expected.
on august,griggs applied for tps benefits and filled out an application form for a lump sum payment of his tps benefit.on the form,griggs elected to receive a lump sum payment of the additional pension benefit amount payable under section xii of the pension and retirement plan.griggs was presented with various options for the form his lump sum payment would take he selected the rollover settlement which indicated griggs desire to rollover his total lump sum benefit in accordance with the deposit information in section.in turn,griggs indicated in section of the application that the d eposit is to be made to sip fixed income.
the reverse side of the application form contained instructions for completing the lump sum payment application.with respect to the lump sum election,the form instructed that y ou have elected a lump sum payment pursuant to section xii of the pension and retirement plan.in making this election,you understand that it is your responsibility to obtain independent financial and tax advice.griggs concedes that he sought no such independent tax advice.
griggs officially retired in late september,and in october dupont sent griggs a notice indicating that dupont was preparing to process his pension payments in accordance with his election.dupont,however,did not honor griggs election to roll over his lump sum payment into the sip plan,even though dupont had said in its description of the tps program that this could be done.in fact,as early as july griggs even submitted his tps lump sum payment performed by dupont showed that section of the tax code would not permit griggs to roll over his entire tps benefit into the sip account.these calculations were apparently performed during the process of providing griggs with an estimate of the lump sum amount he could expect to receive if he participated in tps.no one informed griggs,however,that there was a possibility that the tax code would not permit the entire lump sum to be paid from a qualified plan like dupont pension plan and that any portion not paid from a qualified plan could not be rolled over and would be taxed immediately 
after griggs submitted his lump sum payment application in august,dupont performed additional calculations required by section of the tax code and determined that various limits imposed by section barred griggs from electing to roll over his entire tps distribution into the sip or an individual retirement account.during this process,dupont generated internal reports warning that griggs was not eligible for the tps election he made.by,approximately two weeks before griggs officially retired,dupont had been put on notice by its internal calculations that most,if not all,of griggs lump sum distribution could not be rolled over into the sip.griggs was never advised of this critical fact.griggs remained unaware of any problem with his election until he received a check in for approximately,his full tps benefit.because of the limits imposed by section of the tax code,dupont paid griggs lump sum payment not from the pension plan but from its pension restoration plan,a plan.as a result,griggs was not able to roll the payment into the sip and was forced to pay a tax of approximately.
griggs sued dupont in north carolina superior court for negligent misrepresentation.griggs alleged that dupont made an offer of early retirement to him,using an incentive lump sum payment in the amount of one year salary as an inducement.the complaint further alleged that dupont falsely represented that griggs lump sum benefit could be rolled over into the dupont savings and investment plan sip,or any qualified ira,within days thereby avoiding significant tax liability.griggs asserted that he suffered tax liability because dupont negligently failed to exercise reasonable care and competence in obtaining or communicating information relating to griggs ability to roll the lump sum benefit into a qualified plan and thereby avoid taxes.
dupont removed the action to federal court and moved to dismiss on the grounds that griggs negligent misrepresentation claim under state law was preempted by erisa.the district court denied the motion,relying on the ninth circuit decision in farr west,cir farr i,which held that erisa did not preempt the plaintiffs claim that their employer either fraudulently or negligently misled them regarding the tax consequences of a lump sum distribution under an early retirement program included in the employer pension plan.see id.at.the ninth circuit,however,revisited the issue after the supreme court subsequently handed down its decision in varity howe,d,and held that,under the reasoning in varity,erisa preempted the state law fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims.see farr west communications,cir farr ii,cert.denied,d.
not long after farr ii was issued,dupont moved for summary judgment,again contending that erisa preempted griggs state law negligent misrepresentation claim the district court reexamined the preemption issue in light of farr ii and concluded that erisa preempted griggs claim however,the district court properly permitted griggs to amend his complaint to include a claim,based on the same facts,for breach of fiduciary duty under erisa a.see a.
in his amended complaint,griggs alleged that dupont was a fiduciary in relation to the pension plan and had breached its fiduciary duty to griggs by falsely representing to griggs that his lump sum benefit could be rolled over into a qualified ira or savings investment plan failing to disclose to griggs,prior to his retirement,that he would not be able to roll over his lump sum payment into a qualified plan because of the limits imposed by section of the internal revenue code,notwithstanding dupont knowledge that this was the case and generally failing to disclose to griggs the potential impact of section limits on his ability to roll over his lump sum distribution.griggs sought appropriate equitable and restitutionary relief,including back pay and loss of benefits which griggs lost by virtue of being induced to elect early retirement,and reinstatement to his former position with dupont.
the parties agreed there were no issues of material fact requiring a trial and made for summary judgment on the issue of dupont liability under erisa.additionally,dupont sought summary judgment on the basis that erisa did not provide the remedies that griggs was pursuing.the district court agreed with griggs that dupont had breached its fiduciary duty however,the court concluded that erisa did not provide for any of the remedies sought by griggs and therefore left him the victim of a wrong without a remedy.
griggs appeals the district court determination that he is without a remedy for dupont breach of fiduciary duty.alternatively,griggs contends that if the district court correctly held that erisa affords him no remedy,then the district court mistakenly concluded that erisa preempted griggs state law claim because preemption is not appropriate when congress fails to provide relief.dupont the district court conclusion that it breached a fiduciary duty under erisa.
although griggs advances his preemption argument in the alternative,asking us to reach it only if we agree with the district court that griggs has a viable claim but no remedy,we will address first things first.thus,we turn to the issue of whether erisa preempts griggs state law negligent misrepresentation claim,keeping in mind the presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law.coyne delany selman,cir quoting new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.
erisa preemption clause provides that erisa provisions supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a west.a state law relates to an employee benefit plan,in the normal sense of the phrase,if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.shaw delta air lines,d.in fact,erisa any state law that refers to or has a connection with covered benefit plans even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans,or the effect is only indirect.district of columbia greater washington bd.of trade,d quoting mcclendon,d.of course,s ome state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous,remote,or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law relates to the plan.shaw,at.but,as long as the nexus between the state law and the employee benefit plan is not too tangential,a state law of general application,with only an indirect effect on a pension plan,may nevertheless be considered to relate to that plan for preemption purposes.smith,cir.
a state law includes all decisions of any state.c west.thus,in appropriate circumstances,state common law claims fall within the category of state laws subject to erisa preemption.see,at.pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.when a cause of action under state law is premised on the existence of an employee benefit plan so that in order to prevail,a plaintiff must plead,and the court must find,that an erisa plan exists,at,erisa preemption will apply.alternatively,a state law claim is preempted when it conflicts directly with an erisa cause of action.id.at.see powell chesapeake potomac.of,cir to the extent that erisa redresses the mishandling of benefits claims or other maladministration of employee benefit plans,it preempts analogous causes of action,whatever their form or label under state law.
generally speaking,erisa preempts state common law claims of fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation when the false representations concern the existence or extent of benefits under an employee benefit plan.see,hall blue shield of alabama,cir erisa preempted claim that fraudulent misrepresentations regarding the scope of coverage induced plaintiff to enroll in her health benefits plan shea esensten,cir preemption applied to a state law claim for fraudulent nondisclosure and misrepresentation about the plan doctor incentive programs that limited the participant ability to make an informed choice about his health care smith,at erisa superseded claim that plaintiff was induced to relocate based on his employer false,oral representations regarding pension benefits.in fact,erisa preemption is commonly understood to apply to state common law claims that an erisa fiduciary misrepresented the nature or availability of retirement benefits,or failed to provide enough information to permit the retiring beneficiary to make an intelligent retirement decision.see,muse international bus.machs,cir concluding that erisa preempts claim that plaintiffs would have chosen to participate in the superior benefit plan had ibm not negligently or intentionally misrepresented to them that no further early retirement plans would be offered vartanian monsanto,cir same lee dupont de nemours,cir same see also carlo reed rolled thread die,cir concluding that erisa preempts a state law claim of negligent misrepresentation against an employer based upon the employer representations regarding the employee prospective benefits under an early retirement program.
originally,griggs sought relief from dupont in state court based on a theory of negligent misrepresentation.in considering whether erisa preemption applies to griggs claim,however,we look more closely at the factual nature of his claim than any state law label he applies to that claim.see boston children heart,cir explaining that a court can not make a preemption determination solely based on the form or label of the law t he inquiry into whether a state law relates to an erisa plan or is merely tenuous,remote,or peripheral requires a court to look at the facts of a particular case.the factual essence of griggs claim is that dupont did not provide any information about the general eligibility limitations on a lump sum rollover of the tps benefit and then compounded the problem by failing to inform griggs that federal tax law precluded him from rolling it over into dupont sip,despite dupont knowledge of this fact prior to making the tps distribution.according to griggs,had he been aware of this limitation,he would not have elected to participate in the tps program and would have continued working.
this claim has a sufficient connection with or reference to dupont pension plan to warrant preemption.shaw,at.griggs contends that the terms of dupont written description of tps benefits misled him about his eligibility to elect various options under the tps program,and,when dupont internal computations revealed that,in fact,griggs was not eligible for his preferred tps payment option and therefore would not be able to defer the taxes on his early retirement benefit,dupont failed to pass along this information.the assertion concerns a core function performed by an erisa provision of information about plan benefits to permit beneficiaries to make an informed choice about continued participation.varity,at.
the ninth circuit court of appeals addressed a remarkably similar set of facts in farr ii.there,a group of retired employees brought a claim against their former employer for failing to provide complete information about an early retirement incentive program administered under the company pension plan.like dupont tps offer,the program involved in farr ii permitted participants to elect a lump sum benefit and explained that a ll or part of lump sum distribution may be rolled over to another qualified plan or an ira without any current tax liability.farr ii,at second alteration in original.the retirees brought various claims,including fraud and misrepresentation claims,based on the employer failure to explain that only qualified portions of a lump sum payment would escape immediate taxation.the court explained that the claims were preempted because the tax consequences of the early retirement plan clearly relate to plan administration because they are part of the overall mix of information relied upon by plaintiffs in making their decisions to participate in the plan.id.at.
we conclude that griggs negligent misrepresentation claim,which arises under circumstances nearly identical to those in farr ii,likewise falls within the expansive scope of erisa preemption clause.
dupont does not dispute that,as the administrator of its pension plan,dupont is a fiduciary for purposes of erisa when it is engaged in the administration or management of its pension plan.see barnes lacy,cir fiduciary duty attaches where employer wear s two hats by acting as both employer and plan administrator great lakes steel deggendorf,cir explaining that erisa permits an employer to serve as a fiduciary for its employee benefit plan.neither does dupont suggest that in conveying information about tps benefits under its pension plan it was not acting in a fiduciary capacity.see varity,at.rather,dupont disputes that it violated any obligations imposed upon erisa fiduciaries.
congress intended erisa fiduciary responsibility provisions to codify the common law of trusts.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d see also bixler central.teamsters health welfare fund,cir although the statute articulates a number of fiduciary duties,congress relied upon the common law of trusts to define the general scope of trustees and other fiduciaries authority and responsibility.alteration in original quoting central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund central transport,d.under common law trust principles,a fiduciary has an unyielding duty of loyalty to the beneficiary.see massachusetts mut.life ins.russell,d brennan,concurring congress intended by a to incorporate the fiduciary standards of trust law into erisa,and it is trust law that fiduciaries owe strict duties running directly to beneficiaries in the administration and payment of trust benefits.naturally,such a duty of loyalty precludes a fiduciary from making material misrepresentations to the beneficiary.see varity,at.peoria union stock yards.ret.plan penn mut.life ins,cir lying is inconsistent with the duty of loyalty owed by all fiduciaries and codified in.however,a fiduciary responsibility when communicating with the beneficiary encompasses more than merely a duty to refrain from intentionally misleading a beneficiary.erisa administrators have a fiduciary obligation not to misinform employees through material misrepresentations and incomplete,inconsistent or contradictory disclosures.harte bethlehem steel,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.
moreover,a fiduciary is at times obligated to affirmatively provide information to the beneficiary.indeed,t he duty to disclose material information is the core of a fiduciary responsibility,animating the common law of trusts long before the enactment of erisa.eddy colonial life ins.of america.the common law of trusts identifies two instances where a trustee is under a duty to inform.first,a fiduciary has a duty to give beneficiaries upon request complete and accurate information as to the nature and amount of the trust property.faircloth lundy packing,cir quoting restatement second of trusts.second,in limited circumstances,a trustee is required to provide information to the beneficiary even when there has been no specific request 
ordinarily the trustee is not under a duty to the beneficiary to furnish information to him in the absence of a request for such information however,he is under a duty to communicate to the beneficiary material facts affecting the interest of the beneficiary which he knows the beneficiary does not know and which the beneficiary needs to know for his protection

griggs claim focuses primarily on a fiduciary duty to communicate complete and accurate information to a beneficiary and to refrain from misleading the beneficiary with respect to material facts.griggs contends that dupont provided him with information that it knew was material to his decision to accept a tps distribution,and that upon learning later that this important information was false with respect to griggs individually,dupont breached its fiduciary duty by failing to notify him of the inaccuracy.specifically,the assertion is that dupont provided employees with an explanation of tps distribution options that clearly implied to them,as it did to griggs,that a rollover of tps benefits could be accomplished tax free,that dupont later learned these rollovers could not be accomplished without the imposition of an immediate tax,and that dupont did nothing to warn affected employees like griggs.
we agree with griggs and the district court that these facts establish a breach of fiduciary duty by dupont.in so doing,we acknowledge our agreement with dupont that it did not have a duty to provide griggs with individualized notice of all the ways the tax laws would impact his lump sum distribution.brief of at.erisa does not impose a general duty requiring erisa fiduciaries to ascertain on an individual basis whether each beneficiary understands the collateral consequences of his or her particular election.see,ogan,cir explaining that a fiduciary is not obligated to seek out employees to ensure that they understand the plan provisions.however,an erisa fiduciary that knows or should know that a beneficiary labors under a material misunderstanding of plan benefits that will inure to his detriment can not remain when that misunderstanding was fostered by the fiduciary own material representations or omissions.in other words,a fiduciary is obligated to advise the beneficiary of circumstances that threaten interests relevant to the fiduciary relationship.eddy,at.thus,for example,when an ineligible person contributes to a fund,a fiduciary has a duty to inform him of his ineligibility within a reasonable time after the fiduciary acquired knowledge of that ineligibility.id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.in the erisa context,the recognition of a limited fiduciary duty to inform a beneficiary of material facts in the absence of a specific request for information from the beneficiary is not a proposition.see jordan,at explaining that fiduciary has an affirmative duty to inform a beneficiary of material facts known by the fiduciary but not the beneficiary and that the irrevocability of a retirement benefits election may be a material omission shea,at holding that fiduciary breached its duty under erisa by failing to disclose to the beneficiary financial incentives discouraging preferred doctors from making referrals to that was necessary for beneficiary to make an informed decision bixler,at reversing grant of summary judgment to employer on beneficiary claim that employer breached its fiduciary duty to affirmatively inform beneficiary of cobra benefits where there was evidence that employer knew beneficiary had unpaid medical expenses that would be reimbursed by an election under cobra.
once dupont learned that griggs lump sum rollover election would not be possible and,therefore,that griggs was no doubt under the mistaken belief that he was eligible to roll all or part of the lump sum into the dupont sip as provided in dupont written description,dupont had a duty to inform him of this development prior to making a fully taxable lump sum distribution.as early as july,before griggs even applied for tps benefits,dupont employees in the pensions and benefits section learned that at least some portion of griggs tps distribution would not qualify for a rollover.by september,it knew that griggs would not likely be able to exercise his election to receive a lump sum payment at all.and,dupont should have known that griggs was under the impression that he could roll the entire lump sum distribution into a vehicle.thus,before dupont distributed the tps benefit and tax consequences attached,it should have griggs expected to receive the benefits of having his tps benefit paid into a account but that,in fact,he was very much mistaken.dupont should have informed griggs about this before he retired and before a benefit check was issued to him.
as we earlier alluded,it is critical that griggs misunderstanding was fostered by dupont tps explanation.had dupont general,written description of the tps payment options included a more thorough explanation that federal tax law permits only qualified portions to be rolled over,or that not every employee was eligible for this option,we might view dupont duty to inform in a different light.in this case,however,dupont pamphlet on tps benefits included no such explanation and,instead,merely indicated that the beneficiaries could choose whether to roll all or part of their lump sum benefit into dupont sip.we are not impressed by the admonishment appearing on the reverse side of the tps application form warning applicants to seek tax advice since it does not explain that an applicant needs to consult a tax expert to determine if he or she is even eligible to make this election also,such a warning might have more force if dupont,during the course of processing griggs application,had not learned that griggs tps distribution would not qualify for the sip.but,once dupont actually learned that there was a problem that threatened to cut substantially into the benefits griggs thought he would receive,the particular language on the back of the application form did nothing to correct griggs obvious misunderstanding.eddy,at a beneficiary,about to plunge into a ruinous course of dealing,may be betrayed by silence as well as by the spoken word.quoting globe woolen utica gas electric,cardozo.
dupont complains that it would be impractical for it to notify beneficiaries like griggs,given the vast number of pension plan participants who would potentially elect to participate in tps or a similar program.we do not perceive any tremendous hardship.dupont need not have rendered any tax advice rather,it needed only to notify griggs that,during the processing of griggs tps application,dupont learned that the tax code may prevent him from taking the rollover option that he selected armed with that information,griggs could have made a more informed choice about the form of payment that he wished his tps benefit to take or about whether he would even participate in the tps program.one wonders how inconvenient carrying out such a duty to inform could be since dupont had already performed all of the necessary calculations.
in farr ii the ninth circuit rejected an employer claim that it satisfied its fiduciary duty to inform when it provided a substantially even more explanation of its early retirement benefit options.in farr ii,west sent a written overview of its early retirement incentives program to employees who were eligible to participate.the overview contained a section entitled tax considerations affecting choice of distribution that identified tax provisions relevant to the choice between taking the pension benefits in a lump sum or in a series of monthly installments.farr ii,at.the overview warned eligible employees that the tax implications of the distribution of benefits were complicated and admonished potential participants to consult with a tax advisor.finally,the overview explained that part or all of the lump sum payment may be rolled over to another qualified plan or an ira within days without any current tax liability but t he booklet did not say that only qualified portions of the lump sum distributions could be rolled over,and that everything else would be taxed.id the plaintiffs,employees of west,decided to participate in the early retirement program,and opted to receive their early retirement benefits in a lump sum.they attempted to roll the lump sum distribution into their individual accounts,only to discover that just qualified portions of their distributions could be rolled over.thus,the plaintiffs incurred a significant and immediate tax.
the plaintiffs contended that west breached its fiduciary duty pursuant to erisa by providing them with incomplete,false,and misleading information regarding the tax consequences of their lump sum distributions.id.at.the farr ii panel agreed that west had breached its fiduciary duty by failing to provide sufficiently detailed information to put the plaintiffs on notice of the potentially adverse tax consequences and,generally speaking,who might be affected.see id.at.the court concluded that west 
should have explained to employees the difference between excess lump sum benefits that can not be rolled over into iras and are therefore subject to
