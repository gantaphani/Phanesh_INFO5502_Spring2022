this case requires us to decide whether the district court properly reviewed paul revere life insurance company decision to terminate penny disability insurance benefits for an abuse of discretion,and if so,whether the court determination that paul revere abused that discretion in denying benefits withstands scrutiny.for the reasons explained below,we hold that the district court erred in applying the abuse of discretion rather than de novo standard of review.however,because this error inured exclusively to detriment and she nonetheless prevailed,we affirm.
in august,the law firm of reznik reznik reznik purchased a disability policy for its employees from paul revere life insurance company paul revere.immediately thereafter,reznik distributed to its employees a benefit summary that it had received from paul revere about a year later,in october,paul revere contacted reznik managing partner,alan kheel,and informed him that a retirement security benefit rsb had inadvertently been included in reznik policy.in order to correct that error,paul revere presented kheel with a policy amendment,which kheel signed.paul revere then supplied reznik with a revised benefit summary,which reznik again distributed.unlike its predecessor,the revised benefit summary contained a paragraph giving paul revere full,final,conclusive and binding power to construe and interpret the policy in order to make claims determinations.kheel did not execute an amendment authorizing this change.
between the original issuance of the policy and the execution of the october amendment to remove the rsb,one of reznik attorneys became disabled.penny,a senior trial attorney filed a claim on september,after pregnancy complications began interfering with her work.complications worsened as her pregnancy progressed,and after her daughter birth,doctors discovered had two herniated disks in her lower back.notified paul revere of her back condition,which she claimed caused severe pain and numbness and prevented her from walking,sitting,or standing for prolonged periods of time.reports from three doctors buttressed her claim.
following the requisite elimination period,paul revere accepted claim for disability benefits and began paying her per month.soon after,paul revere initiated an investigation of whether was disabled under the plan.as part of this investigation,it intermittently sent a field representative to interview and required her to submit to an independent medical examination ime and a functional capacity evaluation fce.the doctor who performed the ime concluded that was temporarily totally disabled,while the occupational therapists who performed the fce recommended that r eview options for returning to the legal profession as a corporate lawyer,insurance lawyer or a less demanding area of law that would not need as much handling of materials,prolonged,and working greater than hours as in trial work.
between and,paul revere surreptitiously videotaped on several occasions.upon viewing this videotape,paul revere associate medical director concluded that does not have an impairment that would preclude the duties of a lawyer.another of its medical consultants opined that could perform her occ upation at least part time now,and shortly work up to full time.neither of these two doctors,however,examined,and neither opined that she could function as a trial lawyer.
in december,paul revere concluded that was not disabled within the meaning of reznik policy and wrote to inform her of this decision.although paul revere now admits that this decision was based in part on its two doctors medical consultations,it did not advise of this fact at the time.indeed,paul revere did not produce the records of these consultations until sometime after august,when its final denial of claim prompted her to file suit.
the district court granted summary judgment for.the court did not resolve whether the amended benefit summary language controlled because the court concluded that even if it did not,the abuse of discretion standard of review applied.the court found that paul revere denial of claim constituted such an abuse of discretion.accordingly,it ordered paul revere to pay damages and reinstate benefits effective january.
in denying paul revere subsequent motion to stay execution of the judgment pending appeal,the district court acknowledged that under kearney standard insurance a ninth circuit case that postdated its judgment,it should not,in fact,have applied abuse of discretion review.rather,de novo review was appropriate.the court found that its error was harmless,however,because even under the stricter standard,showed that paul revere violated the plan terms in denying her benefits.paul revere appeals,and.
we review de novo both the district court application of the standard of review in an erisa case and its conclusion that the erisa plan administrator abused its discretion 
firestone tire rubber bruch instructs courts to review an erisa plan administrator benefits determination de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,in which case abuse of discretion review applies here the original plan lacks such discretionary language.it simply states that paul revere ha s the right to require written proof of financial loss and that p ayment of benefits may be contingent upon receipt of satisfactory proof of financial loss.although this court once considered such a statement sufficient to confer discretion it is clear that it no longer does so the revised benefit summary,however,indisputably does confer discretion.it states that paul revere has the full,final,conclusive and binding power to construe and interpret the policy under the plan to make claims determinations.thus,to decide which standard of review applies,we must first decide which version of the plan governs.
which plan applies 
no circuit has yet addressed which policy dictates the standard of review when an insured files her claim under a policy but is subsequently denied benefits under an amended regime.only the southern district of iowa has considered this precise question.the plaintiff in blessing deere was the wife of a deceased john deere employee.she applied for and was denied spousal benefits under her husband pension plan.it was undisputed that the plan in effect when blessing husband died did not give the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility or construe the plan terms,while the plan in effect when she applied for and was denied surviving spouse benefits did thus,there,as here,the court had to decide which plan governed to decide which standard of review to apply.
the court decided that the second plan applied.consistent with this circuit precedent,it noted that an erisa cause of action based on a denial of benefits accrues at the time the benefits are denied.it relied heavily on podolan aetna life insurance a district court case from the district of idaho.podolan facts are even closer to the instant case.podolan became disabled in,and aetna approved her application for disability benefits in.she received those benefits until,when aetna canceled them.the policy in place in did not confer discretion,while the policy in place in did.
the court concluded that the second plan,the plan,applied 
the instant action focuses on whether or not the plan administrator acted improperly in terminating benefits to plaintiff in.it was in that the claim for wrongful termination of benefits arose and it is the plan administrator acts in that are being reviewed by the court.therefore,the court concludes that it is the plan governing the administrator conduct in that must be considered in determining the scope of review over the administrator decisions 
blessing and podolan focus on when the plan administrator denied the claim rather than on when the claimant filed it,or when the event triggering coverage occurred.in chiles ceridian the tenth circuit justified this temporal focus by reference to the nature of the plan.it explained that erisa distinguishes between welfare benefits and pension benefits,and that the former,unlike the latter,need never vest.because of this,a n employer may unilaterally modify or terminate welfare benefits,unless it contractually agrees to grant vested benefits.contractual vesting of a welfare benefit,moreover,is an commitment that must be stated in clear and express language.
in mcgann h h music the fifth circuit made the malleability of welfare benefit plans brutally clear.when mcgann was diagnosed with aids,and when he made his first claims against his employer welfare benefit plan,the plan provided lifetime medical benefits of up to per employee.shortly thereafter,h h changed the plan to limit benefits payable for claims to a lifetime maximum of the court found no cause of action the continued availability of the limit was not a right to which mcgann may have become entitled for the purposes of erisa because erisa does not require vesting of the right to a continued level of the same medical benefits once those are ever included in a welfare plan.under similar circumstances,the eleventh circuit came to the same conclusion simply put,an employee rights under an erisa welfare benefit plan do not vest unless and until the employer says they do 
nothing in reznik policy with paul revere assured employees that their rights were vested.on the contrary,the policy provided that paul revere could change the group policy upon written request from the policyholder and that the insured consent was not needed to make a policy change.thus,is no more entitled to invoke the terms of the plan in place when her injury occurred than were blessing,podolan or mcgann.that she became permanently disabled and filed her disability claim while the first policy was in effect is irrelevant it does not entitle her to invoke that plan provisions in perpetuity 
because no employees rights were vested,reznik was at liberty to change its disability plan.it did so in october.because cause of action accrued several years later,in december,this court must look to the revised plan to determine the appropriate standard of review 
is the revised benefit summary provision valid 
the second benefit summary contains one paragraph the original benefit summary did not.that paragraph states 
the paul revere life insurance company,as the claims administrator,has the full,final,conclusive and binding power to construe and interpret the policy under the plan as may be necessary in order to make claims determinations.the decision of the claims administrator shall not be overturned unless arbitrary and capricious or unless there is no rational basis for a decision.
this provision clearly suffices to confer discretion the question,though,is whether it is valid.for two reasons,we hold that it is not.
first,the actual policy between paul revere and reznik purports to be fully integrated.the policy provides that t his policy and any application made by the policyholder or by an employee make up the entire contract between the parties.plainly this provision was intended to keep insureds like from binding paul revere to promises made in extraneous documents like the benefit summary but what is sauce for the gander must be sauce for the goose if can not invoke benefit summary provisions against paul revere,then paul revere can not invoke benefit summary provisions against.
it is true that an integration clause in the written agreement is not necessarily conclusive as to the parties intent to include their entire agreement in the writing.thus,some contracts that purport to be fully integrated may not in fact be so.if that were the case here,however,paul revere would still be unable to rely on the new benefit summary provision,for if the benefit summary forms part of the policy,it must be amended in conformance with policy provisions here it was not.
reznik policy with paul revere provides that 
we paul revere may change this policy if we receive a written request from the policyholder.all changes that are made are stated in riders or amendments to this policy.these documents must be signed by both our president or secretary and the policyholder 
it is undisputed that no one asked paul revere to insert the discretionary language in the revised benefit summary.this language,moreover,does not appear in any rider or amendment to the policy.the only amendment ever executed pertains exclusively to the retirement security benefit rsb.after reznik managing partner signed it,paul revere prepared a new benefit summary for the firm and inserted the discretionary language on its own initiative.nobody from the reznik firm ever signed off on this change.
paul revere asserts that by distributing the new benefit summary to its employees,and by telling its employees that it accepted responsibility for its accuracy and content,reznik expressly approved the language of the revised benefit summary.it provides no authority for this proposition,nor can we find any.there is case law holding that if an employer publishes an inaccurate summary plan description and an employee relies on that plan description to his or her detriment,the employer will be bound by the inaccuracy but to say that an employee may hold an employer to its own representations is a far cry from saying that an insurer may unilaterally amend a plan summary with an insured in a manner that does not comport with the underlying contract provision for changes and then,when the insured fails to detect the change,exploit the oversight to the detriment of the insured employees.we hold this contention to be devoid of merit.
because the actual policy purports to be fully integrated,and because even if it were not fully integrated,the benefit summary language paul revere added is null and void,the district court should have evaluated paul revere decision to deny benefits using de novo review 
normally,upon discovering that the district court used the wrong standard of review in evaluating a plan administrator decision to deny benefits,we would reverse and remand here,however,such a course of action would be a waste of judicial resources.not only did the district court proceed the first time around by thoroughly weighing the evidence which is precisely what we would ask it to do on remand,but in a order,it acknowledged its erroneous application of abuse of discretion review and confirmed that it would rule in favor under the more generous de novo standard as well.thus here,even more so than in newcomb standard insurance there is no practical purpose in remand.accordingly,we affirm.
upon finding that paul revere abused its discretion in terminating disability benefits,the district court ordered the insurer to retroactively reinstate benefits effective january,the date on which it discontinued them,through february,the approximate date of final judgment paul revere contends that this remedy usurped its prerogatives as plan administrator and necessarily relied on facts not in evidence.
when a district court remedy takes the form of an equitable order,we review that order for an abuse of discretion we find no such abuse here.contrary to paul revere assertion,retroactive reinstatement of benefits is appropriate in erisa cases where,as here,but for the insurer arbitrary and capricious conduct,the insured would have continued to receive the benefits or where there was no evidence in the record to support a termination or denial of benefits.in other words,a plan administrator will not get a second bite at the apple when its first decision was simply contrary to the facts.this court decision in saffle sierra pacific power company bargaining unit long term disability income plan does not counsel to the contrary.saffle stands for the proposition that remand for reevaluation of the merits of a claim is the correct course to follow when an erisa plan administrator,with discretion to apply a plan,has misconstrued the plan and applied a wrong standard to a benefits determination.this proposition is both unremarkable and inapposite.first,as discussed above,the operative plan documents do not confer discretion on paul revere.second,even if they did,paul revere did not misconstrue the definition of disabled,or apply the wrong standard to evaluate claim.
