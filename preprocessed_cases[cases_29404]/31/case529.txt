this erisa case presents an appeal of a denial of benefits claimed by gena baker under a life insurance policy covering her deceased husband,keith baker.gena baker and burlington resources,keith baker employer who paid the benefits to gena baker acquiring her right to the proceeds of this action,sued metropolitan life insurance company for these life insurance benefits.the complaint also alleged state law claims for breach of contract and violations of.ann.et and.bus.ann.et the district court granted summary judgment in favor of metropolitan life insurance and entered a final judgment against gena baker and burlington resources,disposing of their erisa and state law claims.
this appeal requires us to determine the degree of deference the plan insurer,metropolitan life insurance company,is required to give the named plan administrator,burlington resources,under the terms of the metropolitan life plan.however,this inquiry is substantially complicated by the fact that baker made his benefits election before the plan had become effective and died after the effective date of the plan but before the plan had actually been drafted.nevertheless,we hold that the district court was correct to uphold metropolitan life insurance company denial of benefits under the plan,but that it prematurely dismissed the state law claims.
keith baker was hired by burlington resources burlington on october.he initially enrolled in burlington group life insurance plan burlington plan and on november,elected to receive both basic and supplemental life insurance benefits equal to his annual salary in basic benefits and his annual salary in supplemental benefits.in burlington acquired the louisiana land and exploration company,which had its own employee benefit plan.burlington sought an insurer that would take over its parallel benefit programs as a new uniform program to cover all employees.to this end,in april,burlington directed its agent and broker,william mercer,to submit a request for proposal to numerous life insurance companies,including metropolitan life insurance company metlife,inviting them to bid on burlington life insurance program.
in the meantime,baker health was deteriorating.on october,he left work after developing skin cancer and on october,he was classified by burlington as disabled.after he went on disability,enrollment notices were sent by burlington to all active employees to allow them to enroll in the new metlife benefits plan baker name was carried on burlington list of active employees and burlington sent him an enrollment notice.burlington employees who received this notice were allowed to increase their life insurance coverage during the initial enrollment period.consequently,on november,baker called burlington human resources department and increased his life insurance coverage to his annual salary he was sent a letter by burlington confirming this election,but the letter noted that any change in benefits would not become effective until january,the date the plan would become effective.
baker never returned to work.he died on january.at the time of his death,the final metlife plan had not been completed.the plan was not finalized until october,and its effective date was made retroactive to january.the beneficiary of baker life insurance policy,his wife gena baker baker,submitted a claim for baker salary metlife paid her baker refused to pay the additional in march,burlington gave baker a nonrecourse loan for the amount alleged to be due under the plan and baker assigned the proceeds of her causes of action to burlington.
on april,burlington and baker filed this suit asserting erisa and state law claims.the district court ordered the parties to submit an agreed chronology and a binder of not more than twelve documents showing the evolution of their arrangement through january,and provided that t he parties have through september,to move for judgment as a matter of law on what the plan says.
both parties then filed for summary judgment.the district court held that t he beneficiary is bound by the plan as it ultimately existed or by the plan before the switch,and in neither case was the participant allowed unilaterally to increase his life coverage to six times his salary while on leave with a terminal illness.the district court reasoned that such an increase was not allowed because baker was not actively at work when he made this election and did not return to active service before his death.the court reasoned that baker could not have been actively at work in november because he was known to have been terminally ill.moreover,even if he were deemed actively at work at this time,he would have been eligible only to continue his benefits under the october plan,and not to increase them.second,the district court held that baker was ineligible to increase his life insurance benefits because he had not provided proof of insurability.the court concluded by noting that all employer,insurer and all bound by the plan,not preliminary negotiations,and the plan did not allow baker to increase his life insurance benefits.finally,the court made a observation that n o disinterested person would expect an insurance company to allow a terminally ill participant to increase his life insurance coverage.accordingly,the district court entered a judgment in favor of metlife disposing of burlington and baker erisa and state law claims.
this appeal challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of metlife upholding metlife decision denying baker claim for benefits under the plan and holding that burlington state law claims are preempted by erisa.
this court reviews summary judgments de novo,applying the same standards applied by the district court.performance autoplex ii casualty,cir.a grant of summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in evaluating the existence of a genuine issue of material fact,we review the evidence and inferences drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the party.daniels city of arlington,cir.
any review of an erisa benefit determination must begin with the relevant plan language.employee benefits committee,cir.first we will evaluate the terms of the plan as they relate to baker and then we will turn to evaluate the relationship between burlington and metlife under the plan 
the in october,approximately ten months after baker that baker failed to meet the eligibility requirements for the increased benefits because he was not actively at work when he increased his benefits.the metlife plan provides 
if you make a request to be covered for personal benefits during the first annual enrollment period in which you can elect coverage,your personal benefits will become effective on the first day of the calendar year following the annual enrollment period,subject to the active work requirement.
baker enrolled in in the first annual enrollment period in which he could elect coverage november his benefits should have become effective on the first day of the calendar year following the annual enrollment period january,that the active work requirement was met.
the active work requirement provides 
you must be actively at work in order for your personal benefits to become effective.if you are not actively at work on the date when your personal benefits would otherwise become effective,your personal benefits will become effective on the first day after you return to active work.
baker entitlement to benefits thus turns on whether he was actively at work on january,or sometime thereafter.the plan defines active work as performing all of the material duties of your job with the employer where these duties are normally carried out.baker was on disability and not attending work on january.under the terms of the plan,he was not actively at work on that date.accordingly,his increased benefits never became effective under the metlife plan unless the plan includes some exception to the active work requirement applicable to baker.
burlington argues that it was permitted to deem baker active and to allow him to increase his benefits under the plan.this contention is not supported by the language of the plan,which only provides if you are not actively at work as an employee because of a situation set forth below,the employer may deem you to be in active work as an employee in order that certain benefits under this plan may be continued.in this case the only dispute centers around whether baker benefits may be increased this provision does not allow burlington to deem baker to be active for the purpose of increasing his benefits under the plan.
in addition to the active work requirement,the plan requires participants in certain situations to provide proof of good health.pertinent to baker,the plan explicitly provides 
if you make a request,during an annual enrollment period,to increase your basic life and optional life benefits to an option of the plan providing more than the next higher level of benefits,you must give us evidence of your good health.
baker provided no certificate of health when he increased both his basic and supplemental life insurance benefits by more than one level,which also precludes his recovery under the plan.
although erisa authorizes a district court to review denials of claims a b,the statute does not specify the appropriate standard of review.vega life ins.services,cir en banc.our cases,however,make clear that when an administrator has discretionary authority with respect to the decision at issue,the standard of review should be one of abuse of discretion.id.at see also firestone tire and rubber bruch,d 
this deferential standard is recognized by the plan,which provides that 
in carrying out their respective responsibilities under the plan,the plan administrator and other plan fiduciaries shall have discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan and to determine eligibility for and entitlement to plan benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan.any interpretation or determination made pursuant to such discretionary authority shall be given full force and effect,unless it can be shown that the interpretation or determination was arbitrary and capricious.
emphasis added 
although we suggested in wildbur arco chem,cir,that evaluating an administrator or fiduciary denial of benefits under the abuse of discretion standard may be a process,and although this process has been followed in several cases for which such analysis was appropriate,see,abraham exxon,cir pickrom belger cartage,cir,we have also made clear that this analysis is not applicable in every case.duhon texaco,cir for example,if the administrator interpretation and application of the plan is legally correct,then our inquiry ends because obviously no abuse of discretion has occurred.see spacek maritime ass n,cir.furthermore,if an administrator interprets an erisa plan in a manner that directly contradicts the plain meaning of the plan language,the administrator has abused his discretion even if there is neither evidence of bad faith nor of a violation of any relevant administrative regulations.gosselink,cir see also wildbur,at.
the application here of these otherwise intelligible principles is somewhat confused by the fact that metlife,as an insurer,is a plan fiduciary and is also entitled to exercise discretionary authority under the plan 
thus,our next step in resolving this appeal is to determine what effect,if any,burlington decision approving baker claim for benefits must be given under the plan metlife is required by the plan to give burlington discretionary decision approving baker claim full force and effect as long as that decision is not arbitrary and capricious.see supra note see also a d requiring a fiduciary to discharge his duties in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.
burlington contends that its decision is not arbitrary and entitled to full force and effect under the,it argues,baker claim involves two distinct agreements one regarding the initial open enrollment period and one governing the parties obligations on a going forward basis,after the initial enrollment period,the plan.as already discussed,baker increased benefits never became effective under the plan thus,any entitlement to benefits must originate in the asserted collateral agreement governing the initial enrollment period.
burlington contends that this collateral agreement is embodied in an sent by metlife on august,which stated 
for employees currently covered for either basic or optional life,we will allow an increase of one level x salary without having to provide a statement of health.the only exception to this increase limit rule is for this enrollment where we will allow current employees who have less than x salary to increase coverage to x salary without providing a statement of health.
according to burlington,this waived all work and proof of allowed baker to increase his benefits to three times his salary.burlington contends that this collateral agreement supports its decision approving baker benefits and its decision is,therefore,not arbitrary and capricious and entitled to full force and effect.
assuming that burlington is correct about the ultimate legal effect of this correspondence,it is clear that burlington interpretation of this correspondence is not entitled to deference under the plan.under the plan,the only determinations entitled to deference are those made pursuant to burlington discretionary authority and the plan only gives burlington the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for and entitlement to plan benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan emphasis added.
as discussed above,baker benefits increase was never given effect under the plan.moreover,even if baker increased benefits are effective under the collateral we do not judge that claim consideration of that agreement in approving baker claim exceeded its discretionary authority under the plan.thus,burlington resort to an agreement extraneous to the plan and its determination that baker was entitled to the increased benefits are in direct conflict with the terms of the plan as such,burlington decision is arbitrary and capricious and not entitled to full force and effect under the plan.see gosselink,at see also wildbur,at stating that an interpretation in direct conflict with the explicit language of the plan indicates that the interpretation is arbitrary and capricious.
having decided that the plan did not require metlife to give burlington interpretation of the plan full force and effect,we are now required to determine if metlife denial of baker claim for benefits was an abuse of discretion.as noted above,because metlife is the insurer of the plan,we will review its denial of benefits with less than full deference.see supra note.
because we have already determined that baker election to increase his benefits during the initial enrollment period never became effective under the terms of the plan,metlife decision denying those benefits is legally correct and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.see spacek maritime ass n,cir.accordingly,the district court entry of a judgment against burlington and baker with respect to their erisa claims is affirmed 
we now turn to address the district court holding that burlington state law claims are preempted by erisa.as discussed above,the district court directed that t he parties have through september,to move for judgment as a matter of law on what the plan says emphasis added.in compliance with this command,burlington and metlife submitted summary judgment motions and limited their respective arguments to the meaning of the plan.
the district court,however,without the benefit of any briefing by the parties,held that b ecause this benefit arises in an employee plan,the claims beyond seeking the correct benefit are vacuous.particularly in the light of our opinion today,which leaves open any claim burlington may have on the correspondence and negotiations,this conclusion does not seem so certain.
moreover,a district court may not grant summary judgment sua sponte on grounds not requested by the moving party.john deere american bank,cir.in the instant case,in compliance with the district court command,neither party sought
