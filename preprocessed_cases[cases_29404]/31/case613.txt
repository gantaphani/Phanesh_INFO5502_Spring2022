this is a class action lawsuit brought by early retirees in the ak steel corporation retirement accumulation pension plan ak steel plan who elected to receive their pension benefits under the plan in the form of a payment.the ak steel plan is a cash balance plan specifying that participants can elect to receive a lump sum equal to their account balance at the termination of employment rather than having to wait until they reach the normal retirement age of.according to the plaintiffs,the ak steel plan failure to use what is known as the whipsaw calculation when determining the value of the distributions for these early retirees caused a forfeiture of benefits in violation of the employment retirement income security act erisa.
the district court,in april of,granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the issue of liability.a year and a half later,the district court awarded the plaintiffs over million in damages and more than million in prejudgment interest.ak steel timely appealed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a.the ak steel plan 
erisa specifies that employee benefit plans are subject to minimum standards assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.erisa a.under erisa,a pension plan is either a defined contribution plan or a defined benefit plan.erisa.a defined contribution plan provide s for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount contributed to the participant account erisa.in other words,an employee retirement benefit is the eventual value of his or her account to which contributions have been made by the employer the employee.
any other type of pension plan is a defined benefit plan.erisa.under a defined benefit plan,an employee benefit is an amount,either in the form of an annuity or a payment,equal to a specified percentage of the employee salary in the final years of his or her employment.the ak steel plan at issue in the present case is a hybrid of both a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan known as a cash balance plan,but is classified under erisa as a defined benefit plan.
a cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan that possesses many of the characteristics of a defined contribution plan.robert rachal,russell hirschhorn nicole eichberger,cases and issues in cash balance plan litigation,lab.law.cash balance plans mimic traditional defined benefit plans in that participants do not typically make any contributions.id.like defined contribution plans,however,a cash balance plan creates an account for each participant.but unlike traditional defined contribution plans,the account is hypothetical and created only for recordkeeping purposes.id.
the hypothetical account on paper looks much like a traditional k account.id.at.this account balance is made up of two components i a pay credit,of pay per year and ii an interest credit on the account balance,which may be fixed or variable and tied to some index.id.if these interest credits are tied to an average rate of return on investments in the stock market,for example,the employer bears any investment risk by agreeing to credit the participant account at that market rate.even if the employee ceases working for the plan sponsor,interest credits continue to accrue to the employee hypothetical account until he or she begins receiving pension benefits.when an employee reaches the normal retirement age of,the pension benefit is the value of this hypothetical account balance.the employee can usually choose whether the benefit is distributed in the form of a annuity or a disbursement.
in the present case,the ak steel plan provides for two different types of cash balance accounts opening accounts and future accounts.opening accounts represent the value of the retirement annuity that an employee had earned under ak steel prior benefit formula as of january.the opening accounts grow at a minimum interest rate of per year.future accounts keep track of benefits earned after january,the date on which ak steel converted its previous traditional pension benefit plan to a cash balance plan.the future accounts receive pay credits at a rate of between and per year,calculated according to a chart that factors in both the participant age and continuous years of service as of december,multiplied by an applicable percentage of pay that is periodically set by ak steel.for example,a plan participant who was years old on december,and had six continuous years of service as of that date would receive pay credits at the rate of of earnings.a plan participant who was years old on that date,in contrast,with the same years of service,would receive pay credits at a rate of of earnings.interest credits on future accounts are tied to the rate of return on treasury securities.
the ak steel plan provides that 
s ubject to the minimum protected benefits described in section,a participant may retire on or after his normal retirement date and receive a benefit payable in accordance with article vi in one of the following payment options a full payable on his benefit commencement date equal to his accounts b full annuity beginning on his benefit commencement date equal to the actuarial equivalent of his accounts or c partial and partial annuity payable or beginning on his benefit commencement date equal to the respective amounts determined under a and b above.
ak steel plan.a participant who takes early retirement,subject to certain conditions not relevant to this appeal,may also elect to receive his or her pension benefit in any of the payment options.ak steel plan.
section of the ak steel plan,titled minimum protected benefit,states that no participant shall have a benefit that is less than the actuarial equivalent of his accrued benefit determined under the terms of the prior plan accrued benefit is defined by the plan as 
the accounts payable in the form of a single life annuity commencing on a participant normal retirement date or,if later,such participant actual retirement date that is the actuarial equivalent of the participant current account.the account is projected to normal retirement date and converted to a single life annuity using the factors set forth in exhibit i.this single life annuity shall be determined by dividing the then current value of such participant account by the applicable factor as described in section a of exhibit 
another key provision of the ak steel plan is,which tracks the language of erisa.section defines a participant accrued benefit under a defined benefit plan as an individual accrued benefit determined under the plan expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.erisa a,a.
the internal revenue service irs issued a determination letter in november of that approved the ak steel plan.as part of its application,the ak steel plan expressly stated that an employee electing a distribution of benefits would receive a payment equal to his or her account balance.
whipsaw calculation 
the most litigated aspect of cash balance plans has proven to be the whipsaw calculation.this calculation arises when participants opt to cash out their hypothetical accounts before they reach normal retirement age.to comply with erisa,payments such as the ones received by the plaintiffs in the present case must be the actuarial equivalent of the normal accrued pension benefit.see berger xerox.ret.income guar.plan,cir citing c.the actuarial equivalent is calculated in two steps.first,a participant hypothetical account balance is projected forward to normal retirement the ak steel plan,age the rate at which future interest credits would have accrued if the participant had remained in the ak steel plan until that time.second,that projected amount is discounted back to its present value on the date of the actual distribution.
if the interest rate used in step is greater than the discount rate used in step,the amount of the participant disbursement will be larger than his or her hypothetical account balance.this process is commonly referred to as the whipsaw calculation.in the present case,opening accounts receive interest credits at a minimum annual rate of,while the statutory discount rate for calculating the present value of a distribution has been invariably lower in,for example.this causes the value of the pension benefit under the whipsaw calculation to be greater than the simple value of the account balance at the time of the distribution.the irs provides a useful example of the whipsaw effect 
a cash balance plan provides for interest credits at a fixed rate of per annum that are not conditioned on continued employment,and for annuity conversions using the internal revenue code e applicable interest rate and mortality table.a fully vested employee with a hypothetical account balance of terminates employment at age and elects an immediate single sum distribution.at the time of the employee termination,the section e applicable interest rate is.
the projected balance of the employee hypothetical account as of normal retirement age is.if is discounted to age at the section e applicable interest rate,the present value equals.
accordingly,if the plan paid the hypothetical account balance of,instead of,the employee would receive less than the amount to which the employee is entitled.
irs notice.
the plaintiffs argue that erisa mandates the whipsaw other words,a payout of in the example cited that ak steel failure to calculate distributions in this manner constitutes a statutory violation of erisa.ak steel responds by arguing that,under the plain language of the ak steel plan,the plaintiffs received exactly the distribution to which they were value of each participant hypothetical account at the date of termination in the example above.
pension protection act of 
cash balance plans are typically designed to pay accrued benefits to participants upon the termination of their employment.rachal,hirschhorn eichberger,lab.law.at.erisa,however,was not designed with cash balance plans in mind and,instead,is premised on the notion that in a defined benefit plan,the benefit due is an annuity beginning at the normal retirement age,typically age.id.until august of,erisa enforced this annuity obligation through several interrelated provisions.id.at.the net result of this enforcement scheme was that a cash balance plan such as the ak steel plan would be required to use the whipsaw calculation in order to comply with erisa.see id.at.
partly to address the treatment of cash balance plans under the erisa statutory scheme,congress passed the pension protection act ppa of,stat.the ppa created special rules for cash balance plans,among them the provision that defined benefit plans shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of erisa solely because the present value of an accrued benefit is deemed equal to the amount expressed as the balance in a participant hypothetical account.ppa a.these rules apply to distributions made after august.ppa e.in effect,the ppa establishes on a prospective basis that the whipsaw calculation is not required.
procedural history 
john west was employed by armco,from october until his retirement from the company in august of at the age of.he was a participant in the armco.retirement accumulation pension plan,a part of the armco.noncontributory pension plan.upon taking early retirement,west elected to receive his pension benefits in a distribution.he signed a form acknowledging that he understood his payment options,and that he was making a fully informed decision to receive his benefits in the form of a distribution equal to his account balance.in september of,armco,merged with ak steel.the original armco retirement plan,in which west was a participant,became part of the ak steel plan.
west submitted an administrative claim to the ak steel plan administrators in september of that challenged the amount of his benefit.he argued that the benefit he received was not the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that he would have been entitled to at age because it did not account for the interest credits that would have continued to accumulate under the terms of the ak steel plan if he had waited until the age of to collect his benefits.the ak steel plan committee rejected his administrative claim as untimely and,with regard to the merits,ruled that west had received all of the benefits due to him under the terms of the ak steel plan.
in january of,west filed suit on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,claiming that this alleged underpayment of benefits violated erisa.the district court certified the class in march of.a month later,the district court granted west motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.after denying a subsequent motion by ak steel to dismiss west claim as,the district court awarded damages of over million to the class together with prejudgment interest.ak steel timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment under the de novo standard.tatis bancorp,cir.that same standard applies to our review of the district court interpretation of a statute.united states tudeme,cir.the district court decision of whether to apply the plan requirement that erisa plaintiffs must exhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit in federal court is reviewed under the standard.costantino trw,cir.
jurisdiction under erisa to grant the relief requested 
section a b of erisa authorizes a participant or beneficiary of a benefit plan to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.erisa a,on the other hand,authorizes a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary of a benefit plan to bring a civil action a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations,or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
west complaint tracks the language of both a b and a 
this is a class action to enforce,and to redress violations of erisa.the action is brought on behalf of participants in an pension plan to recover benefits due them under the terms of the plan,to enforce their rights under the terms of the plan,to clarify their rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan,and to redress violations of erisa.
the prayer for relief requests damages to remedy the alleged underpayment of benefits due to how the distribution was calculated under the ak steel plan.ak steel argues that neither prong of the erisa enforcement scheme authorizes the relief that the plaintiffs seek.we will analyze the two statutory provisions in reverse order.
equitable relief under a 
ak steel argues,and we agree,that the plaintiffs can not recover the relief they request under erisa a.any doubt on this point was eliminated by this court decision in crosby bowater.ret.plan,cir.the plaintiff in crosby,a retirement plan participant,argued that the plan administrator use of a preretirement mortality discount factor in the whipsaw calculation of preretirement benefits constituted a statutory violation of erisa.id.at.as a result,crosby alleged that he and similarly situated plan participants were paid a benefit that fell short of the amount that they were legally entitled to receive.id.at the heart of the plaintiff prayer for relief was a request for recovery of additional lump sum benefits.id.the complaint requested equitable and injunctive relief.id.unlike in the present case,however,crosby specifically argued that he was precluded from bringing a claim under a b.id.at.the court intimate d no view as to whether that proposition is correct.id.
crosby argued that the relief he requested was an appropriate equitable remedy because he did not seek to impose liability for a contractual monetary obligation.id.at.this court,in rejecting his argument,began its analysis by noting that the supreme court has held that equitable relief refers to the categories of relief traditionally available in a court of,injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.id.at.lawsuits seeking to compel the defendant to pay a sum of money,on the other hand,almost invariably are suits for money damages,the classic form of legal relief.id.at.the court therefore held that erisa a does not,in most situations,authorize an action for money claimed to be due and owing.id.at.
unlike crosby,the plaintiffs in the present case expressly brought their claims under both a and a b.the prayer for relief,however,centers on money damages for the alleged underpayment of a benefit.although the plaintiffs also request unspecified other relief as may be deemed just and equitable,that phrase is found in the portion of the complaint requesting costs and attorney fees.this is insufficient to assert a proper equitable claim under a where the heart of the plaintiff prayer for relief was a request for recovery of additional lump sum benefits.crosby,at.
the plaintiffs in the present case have already cashed out of their participation in the plan,so traditional forms of equitable,mandamus,or not redress their claim.because the plaintiffs claim in the present case is essentially one for money damages,we conclude that crosby forecloses their claim to the extent that they rely on a.see id.at for the district court to order the defendants to refund to pay the difference between the amount calculated without a mortality discount and the amount actually received was to grant a form of relief not typically available in equity.see also life annuity ins.knudson,d s uits seeking whether by judgment,injunction,or declaration to compel the defendant to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff are suits for money damages,as that phrase has traditionally been applied,since they seek no more than compensation for loss resulting from the defendant breach of legal duty.citation and quotation marks omitted.
damages under a b 
west received his payment in august of.at that time,he executed a form acknowledging that he understood his options and that he was making a fully informed choice of a payment equal to his hypothetical account balance.he did not submit an administrative claim disputing the amount of the payment until september of.that claim was dismissed as untimely.section f of the ak steel plan states that any claim questioning the amount of the benefit will be rejected unless it is filed within days from the date of the first payment,subject to a showing of extenuating circumstances for the failure to timely file.moreover,that section specifies that a claimant who does not submit a written claim or request for review within the time limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived and abandoned any such claim or right of review except with the express written approval of and in the discretion of the committee.
ak steel moved for the entry of judgment on west claim,arguing that the claim had been untimely filed.the motion was not based on the theory that the statute of limitations on west right to bring suit had expired,but rather that he had failed to seek timely administrative review as specified by the plan.concluding that west had not waived his legal claim under erisa and that he was not required to first exhaust his administrative remedies,the district court denied the motion.the court concluded that resort to the administrative process would have been futile because the ak steel committee would have simply recalculated the benefits under the method outlined in the ak steel plan,resulting in the same benefit amount.it found that west futility argument is based on his position that the provisions of the ak steel plan violate erisa and the internal revenue code and that no amount of administrative review would alter the calculation of benefits under the current terms of the plan.
on appeal,ak steel argues that west can not proceed under a b because he has already received all of the benefits he was due under the terms of the plan.it contends that he is now barred from bringing his damage claim for a statutory violation of erisa because west had to concede that he received all of the benefits due him under the terms of the plan in order to successfully argue that he came within the futility exception to erisa exhaustion requirement.
we respectfully disagree.to rule in favor of ak steel on this ground would present future plaintiffs who would otherwise qualify for the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement with an untenable to concede their claim on the merits in order to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.ak steel,in our view,oversimplifies west argument in an attempt to strip him of any remedy for the alleged violation of erisa.as the district court aptly stated 
here,plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to additional lump sum benefits under the terms of the plan,because the plan treatment of lump sum payments violates erisa.to accept defendant argument that plaintiffs can not bring any claim,would in effect permit plan terms that blatantly violate erisa to stand unchallenged,because once the benefits were paid,participants could not bring a claim under a b for benefits under the terms of the plan.
exhaustion here would have been futile because,under the ak steel plan,a distribution is described as a payment equal to the participant account balance.had west submitted a timely claim for the recalculation of his benefit,the ak steel committee would simply have responded,as it has argued in this appeal,that west has already received an amount equal to his account balances,which is all that he is entitled to under ak steel interpretation of its plan.the district court thus did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the exhaustion requirement does not apply in this case.see fallick nationwide mut.ins,cir w hen resort to the administrative review process would be an exercise in futility,the exhaustion of remedies doctrine shall not apply.
although ak steel has a point that a b offers redress only for the recovery of benefits,enforcement of rights,or clarification of rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan,those terms must nevertheless comply with erisa.as will be discussed in greater detail below,the key issue is whether west was paid less than the full accrued benefit due him under the ak steel plan because of his election to receive that accrued benefit as a lump sum rather than as a traditional annuity.ak steel concedes that the accrued benefit can not be forfeited due to the form of distribution without violating erisa.
our conclusion that erisa a b provides an appropriate remedy is bolstered by other cases in which plaintiffs have been allowed to proceed on similar claims.see esden bank of boston,cir allowing a class action under erisa a b for unpaid benefits in a cash balance plan where the plan specified that payments were equal to the amount in the participant hypothetical account laurent pricewaterhousecoopers llp,d,denying the plan sponsor motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claim that the cash balance plan provision for calculating benefits violated erisa because the balance payable under the terms of the plan was an amount less than the actuarial value of the accrued benefits see also met.life ins.taylor,d describing erisa a b as the exclusive federal cause of action for recovering benefits from a covered plan.
whipsaw calculation and erisa compliance 
ak steel argues that neither erisa nor the internal revenue code irc require the whipsaw calculation adopted by the district court.the district court held that,in order to calculate a participant payment,the participant hypothetical account balance must be projected forward at ak steel plan specified interest rates into a life annuity beginning at age,and then discounted back at the lower statutory rates prescribed by erisa and the irc to a present value.ak steel argues that it is entitled to use the same statutory rate for both steps of the calculation.if so,the calculation would be a wash and the payout would always equal the participant hypothetical account balance at the time of distribution.
prior caselaw dealing with the whipsaw calculation and cash balance plans 
three other circuits have addressed the issue of whether the whipsaw calculation is required for a payout from a cash balance plan where a participant can retire prior to normal retirement age.these three cases are as follows 
lyons.salaried employees retirement plan 
in lyons.salaried employees ret.plan,cir,a plan participant could elect to receive his or her accrued pension benefits in an optional lump sum form,payable immediately,rather than as an annuity commencing at age.id.at.if the participant elects this option,the amount payable under the plan is a single sum equal to the amount in the participant personal account the hypothetical bookkeeping account.id.at.just like west in the present case,lyons sued for the underpayment of benefits,alleging that the amount distributed to him was substantially less than what he was entitled to receive under erisa e,as interpreted by reg.a which restricts the ability of defined benefit plans to distribute any portion of a participant accrued benefit in optional forms of benefit without complying with specific valuation rules for determining the amount of the distribution and reg.e which requires a minimum lump sum payable from a defined benefit plan to be at least equal to the present value of the participant normal retirement benefit.id.at.the annual amount of interest added to lyons hypothetical account as specified in the plan used in step of the whipsaw calculation was higher than the maximum discount rate used in step of the whipsaw calculation to determine the present value of the projected annuity prescribed by erisa e.id.at.
agreeing with lyons,the eleventh circuit held that he should benefit from the whipsaw calculation.the lyons court succinctly stated the issue if the plan had pegged the interest credit rate to the prescribed maximum discount rate,there would have been no difference regardless of the time factor,and no dispute.but it did not,so there is a dispute.id.at.
reg.a,which sets forth the same discount restrictions on calculating the present value of distributions as erisa e,specifies that the present value of any optional form of benefit a lump sum payout is an optional form of benefit,can not be less than the present value of the participant normal retirement benefit.id.at.the lyons court held that,u nlike a defined contribution plan,the accrued benefit under this plan is not the amount in the participant personal account,but rather an amount derived from that hypothetical account.id.at emphasis in original.in contrast to the ak steel plan,the plan itself required the whipsaw calculation 
to determine the normal retirement amount lyons would have received at age,the plan specifies that his hypothetical account balance must be projected forward using the interest credit rates set forth in the plan.it is the plan itself,rather than the treasury regulations,that requires the hypothetical account balance to be projected forward using the credit interest rate,and it is the plan itself that specifies the interest credit rate to be applied for that purpose.what the treasury regulation adds is that once the normal retirement benefit is ascertained in accordance with the plan,that amount is then to be discounted to present value using the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc rate prescribed by erisa in order to calculate the lump sum distribution to which the participant is entitled.
distribution of the hypothetical account balance alone is not enough where,as here,the interest credit rate exceeds the pbgc rate.
esden bank of boston 
the bank of boston amended its plan in to become a cash balance plan.esden bank of boston,cir.like the present case,the bank of boston plan provided that whenever a participant elected a distribution,the benefit received would be equal to the balance of the participant hypothetical account.id.at.esden elected to take a benefit at the time she terminated her employment in the amount of.id.at.this was the balance in her hypothetical account at that time.id.had esden waited until the age of to cash out her plan,she would have been entitled under the terms of the plan to a minimum accrued benefit of projected amount of her account at age,assuming a minimum guaranteed interest credit of.id.at.at the time of her termination,that projected annuity benefit had a present value of slightly more than what she received.id.at.esden argued that she received less than what the law requires under erisa.id.at.
the bank of boston contended,as does ak steel in the present case,that esden received all that she was promised under the explicit terms of the plan,and that any additional payout would constitute a windfall at the expense of the other plan participants.id.agreeing with esden,the second circuit concluded that the plan does not comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements,or with their authoritative interpretation issued by the irs.id.at.moreover,it concluded,the irs interpretation of how the existing regulations apply to cash balance plans is reasonable and consistent.id.the court summarized the relevant erisa and irc requirements for pension distribution in language 
what these provisions mean is that the accrued benefit under a defined benefit plan must be valued in terms of the annuity that it will yield at normal retirement age and if the benefit is paid at any other time,on termination rather than retirement or in any other form,a lump sum distribution,instead of annuity it must be worth at least as much as that annuity.
this rule that regardless of any option as to timing or form of distribution,a vested participant in a defined benefit plan must receive a benefit that is the actuarial equivalent of her normal retirement benefit that is,the accrued benefit expressed as an annuity beginning at normal retirement age has been repeatedly recognized by courts.
id.at emphasis added citations omitted.
the court in esden concluded that the bank of boston could not use the same rate in both step and step of the whipsaw calculation without working an impermissible forfeiture in violation of erisa.id.at either the plan must have employed a discount rate equal to the interest credit rate,and by hypothesis in excess of the prescribed applicable rate,in violation of code section e and erisa section g or the plan must have projected the cash account balance forward at a rate less than the interest credits provided under the plan,thereby working a forfeiture under code section a and erisa a.relying on irs.the fact that esden received exactly what she was promised under the terms of the plan was deemed irrelevant because the issue is whether the plan terms complied with the law.id.at.as the court observed,t he plan can not contract around the statute.id.at.
berger xerox.retirement income guarantee plan 
in,the seventh circuit affirmed a million class action judgment against xerox for underpayments made to participants in its cash balance pension plan who elected to take a payout upon termination of employment.berger xerox.ret.income guar.plan,cir.xerox plan entitled the departing employee not to the balance in his hypothetical account,but to the balance when he receives the distribution of his pension benefit.id.at.the xerox plan computed distributions paid out before normal retirement age under the whipsaw calculation,but because it used identical interest rates in both steps of the calculation,the result always equaled the participant cash balance on the date of his or her departure.id.at.
what xerox did is exactly what ak steel argues is the proper approach in the present case.but just as in lyons,esden,and the present case,the interest credit rate specified in the xerox plan was higher than the statutory discount rate.see id.the issue was thus squarely before the berger court.
erisa,said the court,mandates that any substitute for an accrued pension benefit must be the actuarial equivalent of that benefit.id.at citing c.the seventh circuit held that future interest credits are part of a participant accrued benefit.id.a participant in the xerox plan had an absolute,vested,indefeasible entitlement to a pension at age based on his cash balance as increased by future interest credits accruing between his departure a
