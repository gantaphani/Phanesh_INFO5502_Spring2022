nancy harrison brought suit against her employer wells fargo,arguing that the company improperly terminated her disability benefits while she was undergoing a series of treatments for thyroid disease.the district court upheld wells fargo decision,finding the plan administrator did not abuse its discretion in denying harrison claim.however,because wells fargo failed to consider readily available material evidence of which it was put on notice,the review process failed to conform to the directives of erisa and the plan own terms.we thus reverse and remand to the district court with directions to return the case to wells fargo for a full and fair review of harrison claims.
wells fargo hired nancy harrison as an online customer service representative in.in this role,she was responsible for assisting customers with a wide range of inquiries related to online financial products and services.her work was primarily sedentary in nature but required her to keep up in a fast paced environment and adequately maintain service levels for customers.she was also required to work ten hours a day for four consecutive days while sitting for of that time.
in may,harrison doctor discovered she had an enlarged thyroid and a large mass extending into her chest that was causing her to suffer chest pain and tracheal compression.harrison underwent a bronchoscopy on june,and a thyroidectomy on august.she was unable to work and received disability benefits under a plan offered by her employer.as part of her claim,she provided documentation and contact information for her primary care doctor,mark petrizzi,her ear,nose throat doctor,daniel van himbergen,and her thoracic surgeon,darius hollings.although she needed a second surgical procedure to remove the remaining mass in her chest,her benefits were terminated on september,just three weeks after her thyroidectomy.wells fargo adjudged this to be the normal period of recovery from this sort of operation.
while harrison was facing her surgeries,her husband died unexpectedly,triggering a recurrence of depression and stress disorder ptsd related to the death of her mother and her children in a house fire in.her primary care physician,petrizzi,doubled her dosage of antidepressants and referred her to a psychologist,glenn,for additional treatment.after her thyroidectomy,harrison also reported pain in her right shoulder for which petrizzi prescribed physical therapy.
although the doctor was able to remove harrison thyroid during the august,procedure,it was a difficult surgery and he was unable to remove the entire mass in her chest.one week after the operation,harrison notified wells fargo that she was scheduled for another more serious procedure,a median sternotomy,on october,where hollings would cut open her chest to remove the remaining tissue.however,on september,wells fargo found that she had fully recovered from the thyroidectomy,deemed her fit to return to work,and discontinued her disability benefits.
the parties do not dispute that harrison was properly granted benefits during the period from her bronchoscopy june,through her arguable recovery from the thyroidectomy september,nor do they dispute that she would have been eligible for benefits following the october sternotomy had she gone back to work in the interim.the only dispute is whether harrison was properly denied benefits from september,to october.
the short term disability std plan the plan,provided by wells fargo to its employees,entitles employees to salary replacement benefits where a medically certified health condition renders an employee unable to perform some or all of his or her job duties for more than seven consecutive days.id.at.the plan defines a medically certified health condition as a disabling injury or illness that is documented by clinical evidence as provided and certified by an approved care provider includ ing medical records,medical test results,physical therapy notes,mental health records,and prescription records.id.at.such condition must also prevent the employee from performing the essential functions of his or her own job as regularly scheduled.id.
the plan is by wells fargo and liberty life assurance company of boston serves as the claims administrator.after an employee submits a claim for disability benefits,liberty must notify the claimant of the decision either to approve or deny benefits.at the time of a denial,liberty must include the reasons why the claim was denied and,if applicable,any additional information that is needed.the plan provides for a appeals process.employees who believe their claims were improperly denied may file a appeal with liberty.if liberty denies this appeal,claimants may file a appeal directly with wells fargo.if wells fargo denies the appeal,that decision is considered final and claimants may file suit under section a of erisa.see see also.
following liberty initial denial of benefits,harrison,acting pro se,sought a appeal with liberty,the claims administrator.in her appeal,she noted that she continued to have chest pain from her recent thyroid surgery and had suffered emotional trauma from the death of her husband.her primary care physician,petrizzi,provided additional documentation to that effect.harrison also noted that she had an appointment to see glenn,a psychologist,with regard to her mental health condition and provided contact information for petrizzi,hollings her thoracic surgeon,and glenn her psychologist.a nurse case manager reviewed her file,and on november,liberty upheld the denial of her claim.
harrison,again acting pro se,filed a appeal with wells fargo under the terms of the plan.she provided documentation from petrizzi and hollings as well as a detailed letter from her sister who was her primary caretaker outlining her continuing pain,disability,and severe panic attacks.wells fargo,as part of the appeal,sought two independent peer of harrison physical disability claims by dan gerstenblitt and another of her psychological disability claim by daniel.
daniel contacted petrizzi regarding harrison mental health,but did not contact glenn despite being referred to him by petrizzi.in his review,daniel concluded that while there was evidence in the record to suggest that the loss of her husband could have triggered ptsd caused by the death of her mother and children,i n the absence of records or telephone conference with her psychologist,an opinion as to whether her psychiatric status limited her functional capacity can not be provided.id.at.on may,wells fargo rendered a final decision,upholding the denial decision.
harrison brought suit under of the employee retirement income security act erisa in the eastern district of virginia arguing that wells fargo abused its discretion in denying her disability benefits.wells fargo moved for summary judgment.the district court found there was insufficient evidence of disability under the plan to conclude that wells fargo had abused its discretion in denying harrison claim.this appeal followed.
harrison contends on appeal that wells fargo substantively abused its discretion in rejecting her claim between her surgical procedures,at a time when she continued to have pain and other complications from the mass in her chest.see appellant br.at.in addition,she argues that wells fargo denial was procedurally flawed because the plan administrator neither considered records from glenn nor specifically explained to her that such records were necessary to perfect her claim.because we find that wells fargo did not meet the full and fair review requirements imposed by erisa in,we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to return the case to wells fargo.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment to wells fargo de novo.see williams metro.life ins,cir.we apply the same standards employed by the district court when considering the plan administrator decision.id.because the plan language gives the plan administrator full discretionary authority,we consider whether wells fargo abused its discretion in denying harrison claim,see evans eaton.long term disability plan,cir.
