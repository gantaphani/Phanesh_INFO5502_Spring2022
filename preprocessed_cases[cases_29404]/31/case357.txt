opinion of the court 
reliance standard life insurance company argues that the district court incorrectly held arbitrary and capricious its determination that stephen lasser was not disabled within the terms of his disability insurance policy.we conclude that the court did not err and therefore affirm.
background 
stephen lasser is an orthopedic surgeon who was employed by townsquare orthopedic associates townsquare,a practice group.he sued to obtain disability benefits he alleges reliance standard life insurance company reliance owes him under the disability insurance policy townsquare purchased from reliance the policy.the policy pays disability benefits when,because of injury,illness or disease,a claimant is capable of performing the material duties of regular occupation on only a basis or only some of the material duties on a basis.
lasser suffers from coronary artery disease.in,at age,he underwent coronary bypass surgery.as later became apparent,the surgery was not correctly performed although lasser did not experience symptoms for the next decade following the surgery,in he suffered a myocardial infarction colloquially,a heart attack.robert aldrich,lasser treating physician,prescribed a treatment regimen of change of diet,exercise,and drug therapy.aldrich also advised lasser to reduce his stress level,including stress.accordingly,in september lasser returned to work on a reduced schedule.he decreased his patient load by,he was no longer at night or on weekends,and he did not perform emergency surgery.on december,reliance approved lasser application for disability benefits under the policy.
however,in december,after a periodic review of lasser condition and primarily in response to a medical evaluation issued by william burke,whom reliance hired to evaluate lasser reliance terminated lasser benefits on the ground that he was not disabled as defined by the policy.lasser invoked reliance administrative appeal procedures,which prompted reliance to obtain two additional medical opinions from karel raska and john field as well as to commission a labor market survey to determine the material duties of lasser general occupation.based on these medical opinions and the survey as well as the fact that lasser returned to work at a schedule including and emergency surgery duties in april reliance concluded that lasser was not disabled from performing the material duties of his occupation and affirmed its earlier denial of benefits.
lasser then filed a complaint in the district court.in a february,opinion,it denied both parties for summary judgment and stated that it would hold a hearing to determine the proper standard of review lasser reliance standard life ins,d.after holding that hearing and deciding that a moderately heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review was appropriate,the court reviewed the record before reliance.on the basis of its review,it held reliance determination of nondisability arbitrary and capricious and that lasser was entitled to benefits.reliance appeals.
ii.jurisdiction 
the insurance policy at issue is covered by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.lasser sued to recover benefits under the policy,and erisa preempts claims in this context.id.a.thus,the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise appellate jurisdiction under.
iii.standard of review 
the inquiry is more involved in this case than in most.the supreme court has mandated that courts review under the arbitrary and capricious standard claim denials in erisa cases if the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.under the arbitrary and capricious standard,an administrator decision will only be overturned if it is without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law and the court is not free to substitute its own judgment for that of the defendants in determining eligibility for plan benefits.pinto reliance standard life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here both parties agree that the policy grants reliance such authority.
however,if the same entity that determines whether a claimant is disabled must also pay for disability benefits,that entity has a financial incentive to find him or her not disabled.thus,we have noted that,when the insurer of an erisa plan also acts as a claims administrator,there is a structural or inherent conflict of interest that mandates a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review.id.at.in pinto we employed a sliding scale approach in which the level of scrutiny applied to the fiduciary decision is a range,not a point.id.at quoting wildbur arco chem,cir.it is more penetrating the greater is the suspicion of partiality,less penetrating the smaller that suspicion is.id.at.
the district court held a hearing on the extent of reliance conflict of interest to determine the standard of review.because the court found no evidence of conflict other than the inherent structural conflict,it held that the correct standard of review was at the mild end of the heightened arbitrary and capricious scale,and thus afforded a moderate degree of deference to reliance determinations.neither party disputes this conclusion on appeal.however,reliance argues that the district court misapplied the standard by not deferring to reliance allegedly reasonable conclusions 
iv.discussion 
lasser regular occupation 
under the explicit terms of lasser policy,he is disabled,inter alia,if as a result of injury,illness or disease he is capable only of performing the material duties of regular occupation on a basis or some of the material duties on a basis.to determine whether reliance correctly decided that lasser did not qualify for disability benefits,we first determine what is his regular occupation,as the policy leaves this term undefined.reliance argues that regular occupation is broad,indeed generic.in initially denying lasser benefits in december,reliance said that regular occupation is not your job with a specific employer,it is not your job in a particular work environment,nor is it your speciality in a particular occupational field.in evaluating your eligibility for benefits,we must evaluate your inability to perform your own or regular occupation as it is performed in a typical work setting for any employer in the general economy.
we recognize that,if the meaning of regular occupation is ambiguous,reliance definition is entitled to deference under the applicable arbitrary and capricious standard of review.skretvedt dupont de nemours,cir insurer interpretation of an ambiguous insurance provision is entitled to deference unless it is contrary to the plan plain language.however,we believe that regular occupation is not ambiguous.the policy states that it protects the insured from inability to perform the material duties of regular occupation.both the purpose of disability insurance and the modifier before regular occupation make clear that regular occupation is the usual work that the insured is actually performing immediately before the onset of disability.applying the text as written,lasser regular occupation was as an orthopedic surgeon responsible for emergency surgery and duties in a relatively small practice group and within a reasonable travel distance from his home in new jersey.
even assuming regular occupation is susceptible to multiple interpretations and therefore ambiguous,reliance definition of the term nonetheless must be reasonable before deference is conferred.see skretvedt,at noting that courts defer to a claims administrator interpretation if it is not arbitrary or capricious.yet reliance definition is different from that in the caselaw pertaining both to it and disability policies containing the regular occupation modifier.see reliance standard life ins,table,wl cir unpublished per curiam on arbitrary and capricious review,holding that claimant could not perform material duties of his regular occupation and defining regular occupation with reference to specific duties performed for his employer.
even were a court not to limit itself exclusively to the claimant extant duties,that person regular occupation nonetheless requires some consideration of the nature of the institution at which the claimant was employed.kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir.moreover,kinstler adopted the reasoning of an earlier district court case,dawes first unum life insurance,which defined regular occupation as a position of the same general character as the insured previous job,requiring similar skills and training,and involving comparable duties.id.at.notably,dawes was decided before lasser applied for disability benefits.
the plain meaning of regular occupation is one of which both parties were aware when the policy began on june.there is no reason to believe that lasser was aware of reliance different definition until it denied him benefits in december.because reliance has shown no intent to opt out of this plainly understood term indeed,it had the opportunity to do so each june when the policy came up for renewal,it is unreasonable for it to argue it has done so post hoc.even if we fall back to the interpretation of regular occupation imparted by dawes and kinstler,it too undermines reliance generic understanding.compare also gaines v.the amalgamated ins.fund.cir deferring to a plan administrator construction of an insurance policy when there was no caselaw interpreting the provision at issue epright envtl.res.health welfare plan,cir holding a plan construction unreasonable when,among other deficiencies,the administrator pointed to no statutory provision to interpret the term and when its definition seemed.
in this context,it is unreasonable for reliance to define regular occupation differently from its plain meaning or even the somewhat more relaxed understanding of dawes and kinstler without explicitly including that different definition in the policy 
material duties of lasser regular occupation 
having determined that lasser regular occupation under the policy was that of an orthopedic surgeon in a practice group in new jersey,and that it was unreasonable for reliance post hoc to argue that the policy plain language was otherwise,we turn to what lasser did in the course of his regular occupation.he saw patients during office hours,performed scheduled surgeries,took night call,and performed emergency surgeries.when he no longer handled night call and emergency surgeries,were they material the district court answered yes.d at.
the court conclusion is supported by comparing lasser earnings with his earnings from a reduced schedule.the townsquare shareholders agreement requires reduction by of a doctor salary when he or she no longer takes night call.moreover,lasser salary was,on average,approximately per month when he was performing all duties,but fell to between and per month immediately before reliance terminated benefits.during this latter period,however,lasser was working less than forty hours per week,as he reduced his patient load by and no longer was operating in the afternoon after seeing patients in the morning.even assuming he was working twenty hours per week instead of forty an assumption supported by record evidence,and assuming that he would have made to per month had he worked forty hours per week,double his earnings,it stands out that,by not performing or emergency surgery duties,lasser earnings have declined by over.this substantial earnings decline lays out as little else can the materiality of those activities to his regular occupation.
looking at the occupation of an orthopedic surgeon generically without reference to lasser particular duties,reliance commissioned a labor market survey to determine whether performing emergency surgery and being are material duties for an orthopedic surgeon the survey asked 
in general,in your experience is it reasonable that an orthopedic surgeon can practice in this field if one 
can not perform duties,do night calls,or carry a pager 
can not perform emergency surgery even if one can do,elective surgery 
if you have responded yes to either,can you estimate in your experience the appx.prevalence of such jobs for an orthopedic surgeon in the general economy where one would not need to perform or perform emergency surgery duties 
reliance vendor sent surveys,to which it received fourteen responses,only nine of which were returned in time to be considered.five of those nine respondents opined that an orthopedic surgeon could practice in this field without performing or emergency surgery duties.on the basis of the survey,and on the absence of any affirmative showing from lasser that performing emergency surgery and being are material duties of an orthopedic surgeon generally,reliance concluded that these duties are immaterial,thereby precluding lasser from disability benefits within his policy terms.
while reliance selected survey responses to argue that and emergency surgery duties were not material for lasser,we like the district court conclude that reliance survey actually favors lasser argument that these duties are material even on a generic basis when all fourteen responses are considered and when the respondents comments are viewed along with the answers to the questions,the survey indicates that performing emergency surgery and being are material duties of an orthopedic surgeon.eight out of fourteen responses suggest that practice without these duties would be impossible or would result in an occupation fundamentally different from orthopedic surgery.one respondent wrote that the practice reliance proposed would be very unusual and would essentially be a practice.another stated that t he only jobs that i know of that would fulfill your restrictions would be someone who restricted themselves sic to writing reports.or.a third respondent noted that i n your example,you are describing a physician who is not an orthopaedic surgeon,but might be considered an orthopaedist.an orthopaedic surgeon should be able to fulfill all duties.five other respondents said that what reliance proposed was impossible.
in this context,both lasser particular case and the survey for orthopedic surgeons in general lead to the conclusion that and emergency surgery duties were material to his regular occupation.
ability of lasser to perform the material duties of his regular occupation 
we next determine whether lasser medical condition precludes him from safely performing material duties of his regular occupation.he argues that he can not safely perform emergency surgery or perform duties.to fulfill our appellate review function under the arbitrary and capricious standard,we examine the entire record to determine whether reliance determination is supported by substantial evidence.pinto,at.
reliance primary motivation for discontinuing lasser benefits in december appears have been a report issued by burke.he examined lasser,subjected him to a treadmill test in november,and concluded that lasser does not demonstrate any cardiovascular disability.during an earlier treadmill test performed by steven roth in april,lasser achieved greater than of maximum heart rate and experienced only mild fatigue after minutes.a nuclear cardiologist,christos christou,noted that planar imaging of lasser heart conducted during the cardiovascular testing revealed only a very small and probably clinically insignificant heart defect.
furthermore,reliance notes that lasser physician,aldrich,considered lasser to be in new york heart association functional class ii patients with cardiac disease with slight limitation of physical activity.they are comfortable with mild exertion but experience symptoms with the more strenuous grades of ordinary activity.and therapeutic class c patients with cardiac disease whose ordinary physical activity should be moderately restricted and whose more strenuous efforts should be discontinued.classifications that do not suggest significant limitations on lasser ability to work as an orthopedic surgeon 
lasser,however,contends that reliance conclusion is unsupported by substantial evidence.he notes that,after appealing the discontinuation of his benefits,reliance engaged two other physicians to evaluate him,both of whom issued reports supporting his position.the first,raska,concluded that lasser should avoid stressful situations,those that require night call and medical emergencies,and that a reduced stress work environment and schedule is absolutely necessary to maintain this patient health.raska reasoned that s tress regardless of exercise tolerance is a recognized independent risk factor for recurrent coronary artery disease and that there are multiple studies which demonstrate that stress causes flux in the level of catecholamines in the circulation which have been shown to be a precipitant of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death.in raska opinion,lasser unsuccessful vein graft made stress reduction especially important,as increased stress could bring about even earlier failure of the graft.in this context,he opined that lasser disability benefits should not have been revoked because he can not safely perform the material duties of an orthopedic surgeon.
after receiving this report,however,reliance realized that raska had a conflict of interest he practiced in the same physician group as a doctor from whom lasser previously sought an evaluation,lubow whose evaluation is discussed below.in response,reliance engaged field as another evaluating physician.while field noted that t here is little definitive evidence that emotional or job stress is causally related to the development or acceleration of coronary artery disease,he did acknowledge that both physical and emotional stress are identified triggers of acute myocardial infarction heart attack.he concluded that lasser could work a week,but is not capable of resuming all of the customary duties and responsibilities of an orthopedic surgeon.in particular,field opined that lasser should restrict his or emergency surgery duties,given their stressful nature.
lasser also relies on the evaluation of his treating cardiologist,aldrich,as well those of barry lowell and lawrence lubow,who all opined that he is disabled.first,lasser argues that the evaluation issued by aldrich suggests that he is incapable of working in his regular occupation.when reliance asked aldrich to complete a form detailing lasser current restrictions and limitations,he responded that lasser should limit exposure to physical and emotional stress.he noted also that s tress is a risk factor not only for the development of coronary artery disease itself,but within that context,to the precipitation of a myocardial infarction.as a result,in a letter to reliance dated june,aldrich expressed to reliance that he believed lasser is disabled and incapable of resuming all of the customary duties and responsibilities of an orthopedic surgeon on a basis,or at least that he could not do so without exposing himself to a high degree of risk.aldrich reasoning underlying this conclusion was that,even though by all objective criteria lasser is doing very well at this point in time,stress might induce a deterioration in lasser condition.moreover,according to aldrich reasoning,a favorable classification under the new york heart association guidelines is of limited use in lasser situation,as that classification system addresses a cardiac patient ability to perform certain physical tasks without regard to stress.
lowell,who performed a cardiac catheterization on lasser,also opined that lasser was disabled.he agreed with burke that lasser functional stress test at the present time is excellent,but cautioned that the stress of his profession will contribute to poorer control of blood pressure and lipid therapies and that a less stressful environment would contribute to his graft longevity.lowell concluded that the severity of lasser heart condition,while not readily measured by traditional testing methods,renders him just as disabled as the patient whose disability would not be questioned because he presents with more overt symptoms.
finally,lubow,a physician who examined lasser at the request of lasser counsel,reached a conclusion similar to that of aldrich,raska,and lowell.he opined that,b ased on the recurrence of significant arteriosclerotic heart disease manifest ed by an acute infarction plus the need for urgent angioplasty and stenting after a ten year hiatus when he had no symptoms,the decision to grant this patient permanent partial disability was certainly correct,particularly in view of his anatomy.
thus,all evaluating physicians with the exception of burke,whose report the others discredited agreed that lasser heart condition precludes him from safely performing duties and emergency surgery.reliance conclusion to the contrary thus is arbitrary and capricious.to the extent that reliance determination of nondisability was that it was unreasonable to expect reliance to simply accept the opinion that stress would exacerbate lasser condition without any range of the probability or actual proof that lasser was at increased harm,we believe its determination was faulty.
clarification regarding burden of proof 
we conclude with a clarification regarding the burden of proof in disability cases.while the burden of proving disability ultimately lies with lasser,to require him to provide statistics detailing the harm that working in his regular occupation might precipitate as the dissent would require raises the bar too high most disability claimants will not have the means at their disposal financial or otherwise to obtain this kind of evidence.therefore,once a claimant makes a prima facie showing of disability through physicians reports as lasser has done here through physicians reports stating that stress will exacerbate his heart condition and if the insurer wishes to call into question the scientific basis of those reports as reliance has attempted to do here,then the burden will lie with the insurer to support the basis of its objection.it has not met that burden here.
relevance of alleged resumption of lasser and emergency surgery duties 
reliance argues that,even if emergency surgery and duties are material,lasser resumption of these duties settles whether he is disabled from performing them.we disagree.first,because lasser disputes that he has resumed performing these duties with the same frequency as before,this issue involves a factual question that we do not resolve on appeal.moreover,even assuming the facts as reliance has alleged them,lasser physicians as well as field,on whose opinion reliance has placed much weight have advised that he should not perform these duties.thus,there is substantial medical evidence that,if lasser is performing and emergency surgery duties,he is doing so to his detriment.indeed,lasser has argued that,to the extent that he has resumed these activities,he did so out of economic necessity because reliance discontinued his benefits.a claimant return to work is not dispositive of his or her disability when economic necessity compels him or her to return to work.hawkins first union.disability plan,cir a desperate person might force himself to work despite an illness that everyone agreed was totally disabling.levinson reliance standard life ins,cir a claimant status as a employee should not constitute reliable evidence that he is able to perform the material duties of his occupation on a basis stark weinberger,cir even if a claimant returns to work,her doing so does not mean she is not disabled.this principle is especially persuasive here,where lasser disability was not observable and did not make it physically impossible for him to perform his job for a limited period.
we hold that lasser regular occupation was that in which he was actually engaged immediately before becoming disabled an orthopedic surgeon in a practice group in new jersey.we also hold that and emergency surgery duties are material to lasser practice and that he is disabled from performing those duties.we agree with the district court that reliance conclusion to the contrary was unsupported by substantial evidence and therefore was arbitrary and capricious.we accordingly affirm the district court judgment in favor of lasser.
i am obliged to dissent from the majority judgment in favor of lasser.
the district court failed to adhere to our established standards of review and our precedents.see lasser reliance standard life ins,d,lasser i th is court anticipates adopting the procedure set forth in kearney standard ins,circuit en banc and making plenary findings of fact pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,even though no new evidence may be received on that branch of the case.by so doing,the district court erred by giving only lip service,but no required true deference,to the administrator walsh determinations even after it had held that the administrator was neither conflicted nor biased.see pinto reliance standard life ins,cir.
this is a summary judgment case.the district court,when called upon to decide summary judgment,can not hold a trial on the merits a la kearney.see infra note.in this case,the district court did just that.
the district court,at its truncated april,hearing,while purporting to resolve only the administrator status as to whether he was conflicted or biased it held that he was neither,can not proceed to ignore our prescribed standard of review which requires deference and then proceed to substitute its own judgment on the merits.
the policy written by reliance requires that for disability benefits,lasser had to be disabled from performing the material duties of his regular occupation.the burden of proving materiality rested on lasser.no evidence of materiality appears in the record.
no deference was shown by the district court to walsh,the administrator,determinations that a materiality was not demonstrated b lasser returned to,and was performing,his occupation c emergency and services were not established as material yet,these were the only services lasser was told not to perform and d neither stress nor future disabilities could establish lasser present disability.
the actions taken by reliance and the evidence relied upon by reliance,as well as the determinations made by walsh,the administrator,can not be determined to be arbitrary nor capricious under our standards and precedents.
this appeal comes to us after both parties had moved for summary judgment.it has remained a summary judgment case in which the district court could look only to the developed administrative record.
i begin by briefly outlining the pertinent procedural history.in its february,opinion,the district court denied the parties for summary judgment.it then stated that it would hold a hearing to determine if walsh,the administrator,was biased or suffered a conflict because he was an employee of reliance.lasser i,d at,referring to pinto s sliding scale of arbitrary and capricious review 
the district court then conducted a bench trial on april,where it heard only walsh testimony relevant to the issue of how heightened our standard of review should be on pinto sliding scale.lasser did not testify,nor did any other witness.i only purpose of the hearing was to address whether walsh was conflicted or biased because he was reliance employee.walsh had the duty of determining a claimant eligibility for benefits as well as of paying those benefits out of the funds from which reliance reaps its profits.if biased,then under pinto the deference to be accorded his determination would be less deferential,and the court must calibrat e the intensity of the review to the intensity of the conflict.pinto,at.if not biased,then under pinto,the standard of deference to be employed would be deferential,but not absolutely deferential.id.but,in either event,deference had to be accorded.
thereafter,the district court determined that it would give a moderate degree of deference to walsh determinations as it found no evidence of bias or conflict exhibited by walsh.lasser ii,d at.
at this stage,the district court was required to end its inquiries and hearing and review the existing administrative no more.but,the district court did not do that.it proceeded further,despite the summary judgment context of the instant case,and it made its own findings of fact on the merits.id.at.
under our precedents,district courts can not conduct when determining the appropriate review standard as i have stated,the district court should have limited its findings to a determination of what the appropriate standard of review would be,and then should have continued on to resolve the summary judgment question pursuant to that standard.
accordingly,i would have returned this case to the district court with the direction that it expunge all its merits findings and discussion and then proceed to perform its prescribed function of ruling,on the administrative record only,whether walsh denial of benefits was arbitrary or capricious.
although the district court purported to subscribe to the correct standard of review,a fair reading of the district court opinions indicates that it did not it merely gave lipservice to the deference to be accorded to the administrator determinations.
pursuant to the plain language of reliance policy,whether lasser is totally disabled hinges on whether he can perform the material duties of his occupation.the relevant part of the policy provides 
totally disabled and total disability mean that as a result of an injury or sickness,during the elimination period and thereafter an insured can not perform the material duties of regular occupation 
app.at emphasis added.critical to this analysis,is that the burden to prove materiality is on lasser because the burden of proving coverage is always on the claimant.see lasser ii,d at citing pinto,at.lasser,however,submitted no evidence,no proofs,no affidavits,no witnesses,and no depositions on the issue of materiality.indeed,the record as to this issue is barren 
despite the silence of the record regarding materiality,the district court nevertheless held that lasser had made out his burden of proof on materiality.to do so,the district court relied principally on the diminution of lasser income when he discontinued emergency and duties.id.at.the majority,too,finds this diminution in income to be controlling.yet,it must be remembered that during the period of time from september to december that lasser was totally disabled,he was attending to all his office functions and tasks and he was performing scheduled elective surgery.at the same time,he was collecting total disability benefits from reliance.
the district court also relied on the various medical reports from cardiologists,although they merely stated that lasser should not perform emergency and that those functions were material to his occupation of orthopedic surgeon.id.
reliance,on the other hand,presented evidence on the issue of materiality.reliance looked to the duties of a general surgeon as defined in the dictionary of occupational titles dot from the united states department of labor.emergency work are not included in material duties.lasser has presented no evidence to the contrary.
furthermore,the dot is a recognized authority in the vocational industry.see,gallagher reliance standard life ins,cir dot is an objectively reasonable tool for determining the material duties of an occupation a general job description of dot,to be applicable,must involve comparable duties but not necessarily every duty.emphasis added.
similarly,the district court gave no deference whatsoever to reliance in its use of a labor market survey.this study provided direct evidence that and emergency only restrictions which lasser physicians not material.lasser provided no vocational studies nor,as i stated earlier,any other evidence which contradicted reliance evidence on materiality.
moreover,the use of such vocational studies in eligibility for disability benefits is an accepted practice in this circuit.see,russell paul revere life ins,cir labor market study which identified jobs within the claimant occupation that did not require travel,contravened plaintiff contention that he remained disabled because he could not work extended hours and travel,which his current position required.
all of this evidence stands unrebutted by lasser.again,the appropriate standard of review is whether or not reliance was arbitrary and capricious in determining that lasser failed to meet his burden of materiality,that is that lasser could not perform the material duties of his regular occupation.nowhere in this record is there evidence that emergency and only work which lasser was told he could not material to lasser every day occupation.although i am sympathetic to lasser financial and medical i am sure the members of the majority are sympathy can not substitute as evidence that emergency and work are material to the occupation of an orthopedic surgeon.
furthermore,i find it troubling that lasser presented no vocational study,nor any evidence from experts in the field,or even evidence from the members of his own office or himself,to support his contention that these tasks were in fact material.in particular,there has been no evidence as to whether his three partners could handle and would respond to the practice and emergency duties,although such circumstances could lead to a diminution of income for lasser.there was also no evidence in the record that lasser could not perform scheduled elective surgery,as well as all other office procedures and tasks.
the majority,i sense,has fallen into the same pattern of analysis employed by the district court.instead of addressing and assessing the basis,the rationale and the evidence which led to the administrator determination denying benefits,and then giving appropriate deference to that determination,the majority discusses the evidence as if it was subjected to de novo review after trial.in doing so,it draws its own conclusions and substitutes its own judgment as to who and what is to be believed.
instead of looking to the evidence of materiality there is none or the evidence of whether emergency and procedures are material the evidence is uncontradicted that they are not the majority opinion reviews the district court record as if it arose from a trial.that,i suggest,was the error the district court fell into and it is compounded by the majority of this panel.
i also find that the majority preoccupation with the definition of regular occupation misses the mark.here,we are concerned only with the policy definition of total disability which concentrates on material aspects of lasser practice.the majority relies on the second circuit decision in kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir,even though that case is distinguishable inasmuch as the standard of review there,unlike here,was de novo.the majority further strains to justify the term regular occupation by relying on a fourth circuit unpublished opinion,reliance standard life ins,table,wl cir unpublished per curiam.see op.at.a fourth circuit unpublished opinion under no circumstances can be considered precedential by this court.in doing so,the majority opinion ignores the claim evaluation framework established by the very language of the reliance policy that it quotes first,the claimant condition is evaluated.next,the claimant regular occupation is evaluated and the material duties thereof are defined.finally,the claimant condition is compared against the material duties determined to be required in his regular occupation.it appears that lasser,the district court,and now this court would end the inquiry after just the first step.
another example of the district court failure to defer to walsh determinations revolves around lasser continuing to work while receiving disability payments of about a month,as well as lasser return to work after his benefits were discontinued.
reliance argues that lasser can not be totally disabled because in december he returned to unrestricted work,including emergency and duties,without consequence to his health.see app.at.reliance further contends that it was reasonable because none of the doctors stated that he would be incapable of performing a schedule and burke and field specifically evaluated lasser as being capable of work.
the district court concluded,and the majority here agrees,that because lasser risked future heart attacks due to the stress from and emergency duties which on this record can not be characterized as continuing to work after the termination of his insurance benefits nevertheless is evidence of his total disability.in particular,the district court focused on the fact that he risked his health,against the express recommendations of his doctors,by returning to those duties out of economic necessity.lasser ii,d at.but,without satisfying the policy condition of inability to perform tasks material to his occupation,i can not agree that lasser,who was working in his office and performing elective surgery,was totally disabled.
the eighth circuit has addressed this issue of relating economic necessity to total disability in a context similar to lasser.in galman prudential ins.of america,cir,the eighth circuit held that a claimant can not assert total disability when he has returned to work,regardless of whether he returned to work out of economic necessity after an initial denial of benefits while awaiting the results of his administrative appeal.galman,at.galman was a trial attorney who suffered from coronary artery heart disease,with a history of,inter alia,two prior heart attacks.he based his disability claim,in part,on the risk of aggravating his heart condition due to the stress of work.after the claim was denied,galman returned to work full time asserting that the denial forced him to return to work for financial reasons.id.at.the court rejected his claim for benefits.id.at.
the majority implies that lasser was unable to work a week,and thus was disabled.but the majority misapprehends our jurisprudence.an insurer is not arbitrary and capricious merely because it relies on other medical opinions that result in a denial of coverage it is only arbitrary if such decision was clearly not supported by the evidence in the record or the administrator has failed to comply with the procedures required by the plan.abnathya roche,cir see also,orvosh program of group ins.for salaried employees,cir hightshue aig life ins,cir a plan decision,if reasonable,must be affirmed even if the claimant presents an opposite position.here,reliance has fully complied with all established procedures and the administrator record is replete with evidence supporting the administrator decision.
moreover,the district court and the majority reliance on the issue of stress does not do credit to their analyses.
once again,i consider the evidence from the administrative record through the lens of deference.under this deferential standard,it is clear that the district court,and then the majority,erred.
first,it is undisputed that none of the doctors who supported the disability claim ever stated with any degree of medical certainty the increased risk to lasser of returning to employment.reliance policy does not insure against future present disability.a doctor or other expert who determines that a patient is disabled based on the possible future effects of stress should have to quantify that risk so that the erisa decision maker can determine if it constitutes a present disability.thus,an opinion that lasser venous graft may not survive another five years does not satisfy the condition of reliance disability policy which requires that lasser be unable to perform the material duties of his occupation at this time.to illustrate i,as a judge,may go blind in five if i am not blind now,that possibility can not be deemed to render me presently disabled.
i think we all recognize that stress,while it may affect cardiac patients,does not necessarily incapacitate them,or prevent them from successfully returning to,and performing,stressful jobs,vice president dick cheney.see,coker metropolitan life ins,cir plan not arbitrary and capricious in denying benefits,even where the claimant doctor declared him disabled based on the exacerbating factor of stress gooden provident life accident ins,cir dismissing claimant complaint that his insurance company failed to account for his doctor concern of the stress associated with his job.
based on the administrative record,it was not arbitrary and capricious for reliance to determine that lasser was not disabled based on any risk of relapse from stress.indeed,stress tests subsequent to his heart attack in july did not reveal any chest pain or ekg abnormalities duri
