suzanne bynum initiated this erisa civil action in the district of south carolina against cigna healthcare of north carolina,incorporated cigna,maintaining that cigna had improperly denied her infant daughter claim for health benefits for treatment of a skull deformity.the district court reversed cigna decision and awarded the benefits sought by bynum daughter.cigna has appealed the court ruling,maintaining that its denial of benefits was appropriate.as explained below,we agree that bynum infant daughter,katrina,was entitled to coverage from cigna for treatment of her misshapen head,and we affirm.
katrina bynum,along with her twin sister,was born to bynum in late by spontaneous vaginal delivery after a week gestation period.at her birth,katrina exhibited symptoms of congenital torticollis,a severely twisted neck which subsequently resulted in plagiocephaly,an abnormally asymmetrical head in may,concerned about her old daughter medical condition and desiring to obtain treatment for it,bynum sought medical care for katrina from a pediatrician in matthews,north carolina.this pediatrician,michelle parish,referred katrina to a specialist in neurosurgery,and,at the direction of scott mclanahan,a pediatric neurosurgeon practicing in charlotte,north carolina,katrina condition was treated with a medical procedure known as cranial banding or dynamic orthotic cranioplasty the doc procedure.
the doc procedure,which costs approximately,involved creating a orthotic device to be worn by katrina in order to progressively mold and correct the shape of her cranium the purpose of the doc procedure,as described by mclanahan,was to treat immediately the functional significance of katrina asymmetrical skull because head shape abnormalities or asymmetry of the skull base can lead to further deformities or physical impairments of the facial region,such as malocclusion of the mandible.
in may,mclanahan submitted to cigna a coverage request for the doc procedure utilized to treat katrina condition katrina claim.katrina was an insured of cigna through insurance coverage provided to her mother,an employee of an entity called pathways for learning in charlotte,north carolina.bynum possessed health insurance through her health plan,and her family coverage is governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.cigna serves the plan in two capacities first,as its insurer,and second,as its plan administrator.the member certificate the plan provided to each of the plan insureds describes the insurance coverage and benefits provided by cigna,and it also spells out the administrative procedures under which the plan operates.the plan has established a administrative appeal and grievance process for the resolution of claims and benefits questions,and it has granted cigna the final power and discretionary authority to interpret and administer th e member certificate,including the authority to make eligibility determinations.
katrina claim was filed with cigna on may,and the next day one of cigna medical directors wrote bynum a denial letter,advising,after careful review,that cigna had determined that coverage is not available because cosmetic services are not covered.cigna denial letter offered no explanation of what constituted a cosmetic service,and the plan contains no definition for either the terms cosmetic or cosmetic services.
thereafter,pursuant to the procedures established in the plan,mclanahan filed with cigna,on behalf of bynum and katrina,what the plan denominates as a appeal.in this appeal,cigna was requested to review and reconsider its earlier decision to deny katrina claim for the doc procedure by letter of may,mclanahan explained to cigna that children suffering from nonsynostoic cranial asymmetries such as that affecting katrina benefit from doc treatment.he also sought to directly address the cosmetic services issue raised in the denial letter,and he further advised cigna that c orrection of katrina defect may in fact lead to a more pleasant appearance,however,it is the functional significan ce of the defect that compels the treatment.emphasis added.in so concluding,he advised cigna,referring to the doc procedure,that i t is clearly not treatment of a cosmetic deformity.emphasis added.
cigna responded to katrina appeal by advising bynum that it was denying coverage for katrina claim.in explaining its decision,cigna again maintained that use of the doc procedure for nonsynostoic plagiocephaly is a cosmetic procedure,and it also asserted that t he documentation fails to substantiate the medical necessity for the doc service.as in its initial denial of katrina claim,cigna offered no definition of what constituted a cosmetic procedure under the plan.
thereafter,bynum retained counsel on katrina behalf,and,on july,she filed a appeal with cigna.cigna then requested production of additional materials or statements that bynum deemed relevant to katrina claim,and it advised bynum that her appeal would be heard and considered by cigna grievance committee the committee or cigna committee 
on august,bynum provided cigna committee with additional materials in support of katrina claim.first,she submitted an affidavit from mclanahan in which he reiterated that katrina suffers from a head shape abnormality related to intrauterine molding and postnatal position and that,in the opinion of a number of plastic surgeons,head shape abnormalities or asymmetry of the skull base can lead to further deformities or physical impairments of the facial region,such as malocclusion of the mandible.mclanahan explained that the true intent of katrina doc procedure was to eliminate physical defects that might be associated with head shape abnormalities such as malocclusion of the mandible,and he concluded that to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,the doc band,as used upon katrina bynum,was medically indicated and was not cosmetic under the terms of the p lan.
second,bynum provided cigna committee with a letter of may,from katrina treating pediatrician,parish.parish explained that katrina suffered from congenital torticollis that had been present at birth.parish also advised cigna that she had referred katrina to a neurosurgeon who noted that katrina had flattening of the right side of her head,right anterior ear shift,frontal bossing right greater than left,and plagiocephaly.in conclusion,parish related i believe katrina plagiocephaly is directly related to her congenital torticollis and therefore is a medical condition not a cosmetic condition.
third,bynum submitted to cigna committee a medical article discussing the treatment of craniofacial asymmetry with the doc procedure.fourth,she provided cigna committee with a copy of resolution of the american medical association house of delegates,which defines reconstructive surgery.pursuant to the ama resolution,reconstructive surgery is surgery that is performed on abnormal structures of the body,caused by congenital defects,developmental abnormalities,or disease.it is generally performed to improve function,but may also be done to approximate a normal appearance.finally,bynum provided the committee with an american orthotic and prosthetic association newsletter showing that the doc procedure had gained fda approval as an approved orthoses for katrina condition 
on august,the committee convened to consider katrina claim.cigna representatives were present at the committee meeting,but bynum and her attorney,though invited,did not attend cigna committee then reviewed katrina claim,the information submitted to it by bynum,and a tec assessment report concerning the doc procedure submitted to it by cigna by letter to bynum of the following day,cigna advised that its committee had decided to uphold the original decision to deny the cranial banding device.this denial letter explained that the committee decision was based on the section letter m exclusion,wherein all cosmetic procedures or surgery are considered.the documentation received fails to substantiate the medical necessity for the service.this letter,like the earlier ones,made no effort to explain what cigna believed to constitute cosmetic procedures or surgery.
after exhausting her appeal rights under the plan,bynum,on september,filed suit against cigna pursuant to a she alleged,inter alia,that the plan provided coverage for the doc procedure,and she sought to have the court direct cigna to provide coverage for katrina claim.
on april,with cross motions for summary judgment pending,the parties appeared before the district court.for whatever reasons,both parties then requested the court to dispense with the summary judgment proceedings and to try the case on its merits.with the consent of the parties,the court then proceeded to handle the case as a bench trial on may,the court ruled on the merits of the case,and it determined that the plan provided coverage for katrina claim.bynum cigna healthcare of north carolina,order,at may,the opinion.the court then ordered cigna to provide coverage to katrina for the benefits sought.id.at.
on may,cigna filed a timely notice of appeal.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
before turning to the merits of cigna appeal,we must first address and determine the applicable standards of our review of the issues raised here.generally,decisions made by administrators of erisa plans are subject to de novo review by the courts.firestone tire rubber bruch,d see also bedrick travelers ins,cir.when,however,an erisa plan provides the plan administrator with discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan and to make coverage determinations,the administrator decisions are reviewed by the courts only for abuse of discretion.firestone,at.bedrick,at.even if a plan administrator possesses such discretion,if it also operates under a conflict of interest,we have recognized the propriety of reviewing courts not act ing as deferentially as would otherwise be appropriate.bedrick,at.indeed,the greater the incentive for the plan administrator to benefit itself by a certain interpretation of benefit eligibility or other plan terms,the more objectively reasonable the administrator decision must be and the more substantial the evidence must be to support it.ellis metro.life ins,cir.
these standards of review apply to a district court review of a plan administrator coverage determinations in an erisa case,and they also are applicable on appellate review.in our review of the result of a bench trial,where the district court has made findings and reviewed coverage determinations under the proper standard of review,we do not sit in the same posture as that court.our review is affected by the principle that when we review a district court decision on the merits,see.a,we are,absent clear error,bound by its factual findings.see id.requiring that findings of fact made after a bench trial shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous sedlack braswell servs.group,cir hendricks cent.reserve life ins,cir.in this case,however,we are unable to ascertain whether the district court actually applied the abuse of discretion standard of review when reciting its findings.as a result,we conduct our appellate review of the objective reasonableness of cigna denial of katrina claim without relying on the district court findings.
the plan provides cigna,as the plan administrator,with final and discretionary authority to interpret and administer th e member certificate,including the authority to make eligibility determinations.accordingly,we may not disturb a coverage determination made by cigna in its capacity as the plan administrator,so long as its decision is reasonable.if,however,a coverage decision is unreasonable,then cigna has abused its discretion,and such an abuse warrants reversal of an affected coverage determination.see booth stores.assocs.health welfare plan,cir see also feder paul revere life ins,cir.
in this case,cigna performed its duties as plan administrator under a plain conflict of interest that is,cigna administered the plan and at the same time insured it.as such,while the abuse of discretion standard remains applicable to cigna coverage determination,we must,because of its conflict of interest,lessen the deference normally given under this standard of review to the extent necessary to counteract any influence unduly resulting from the conflict.ellis,at see also bailey blue cross blue shield of,cir reducing deference to the degree necessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from the conflict of interest.
cigna conflict of interest in its handling of katrina claim was a substantial one,cigna possessed a significant incentive,in the nature of its financial,to deny coverage for katrina claim.first of all,cigna was interpreting a disputed plan term cosmetic with wide applicability.because cosmetic procedures are excluded from the plan coverage under section letter l,cigna possessed a financial in defining cosmetic in a broad manner.moreover,as cigna counsel acknowledged at oral argument,cigna is presently facing an increasing number of benefit claims for doc procedures,because the number of infants with asymmetrical skulls is increasing due to current trends in positioning thus,a decision by cigna,as plan administrator,to provide coverage for katrina claim would have established a precedent adverse to the financial interests of cigna,as insurer.because cigna conflict of interest on this issue is a significant one,we are obliged to reduce the level of deference normally accorded its coverage determinations,and we must ascertain whether its decision to deny katrina claim was objectively reasonable.therefore,while we will accord cigna coverage determination some deference,its decision must be examined closely to ensure that it is supported by substantial evidence,and that it resulted from a deliberate,principled reasoning process.brogan holland,cir internal citations and quotations omitted explaining criteria for objectively reasonable.
on appeal,cigna maintains that the district court erred by substituting its judgment for cigna reasoned decision,as plan administrator,to deny katrina claim.cigna makes two contentions in this regard first,it asserts that the court improperly defined the applicable terms of the plan and second,it maintains that the court misapplied the terms of the plan.we examine each of these points in turn.
a significant question in this case concerns the proper meaning to be accorded the word cosmetic,as it is utilized in the plan.cigna contends that the court erred in its definition and application of the term.specifically,although the parties agree that the plan does not define cosmetic,cigna maintains that the court erred by not adopting cigna proposed definition of cosmetic,and by instead find ing that the treatment rendered to katrina could not be considered cosmetic under any reasonable definition of the word.opinion at.
cigna first maintains that the court erred by failing to give proper deference to its proposed definition of cosmetic.while cigna is correct that,as plan administrator,its definition must be accepted by a court absent an abuse of discretion,sheppard enoch pratt,travelers ins,cir,cigna nonetheless abused its discretion by failing to define this crucial term prior to its denial of katrina claim.
throughout its administrative handling of katrina claim,cigna failed to define the relevant terms cosmetic,cosmetic services,or cosmetic procedures.instead,it simply advised bynum that katrina claim had been denied because the doc procedure was of a cosmetic nature.in addition,the record before cigna committee lacked any reference to cigna definition of cosmetic,and cigna failed to document why the doc procedure,as applied to katrina skull deformity,constituted an excluded cosmetic procedure.because there is no evidence that cigna sought to define cosmetic before being sued by bynum,or that cigna applied a reasonable definition of the term to katrina claim,the court did not err in declining to defer to cigna definition of cosmetic.see id.at assessing reasonableness of plan administrator decision based only on facts known at time of decision.
next,cigna maintains that the court erred in concluding that cosmetic is an ambiguous term,and that it also erred by not affording the term its ordinary meaning.when interpreting an erisa health insurance plan,we u
