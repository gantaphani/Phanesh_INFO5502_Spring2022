these consolidated appeals arise from the bankruptcy court approval of,and subsequent enforcement of,a settlement agreement resolving adversary proceedings brought by the and a creditor against the.because we conclude that the settlement agreement was valid,and that enforcement of the agreement was proper,we affirm the district court decision upholding the approval of the settlement agreement.although the district court erred in ruling that the appeal of the judgment enforcing the settlement was untimely,we affirm the entry of judgment in favor of the trustee.
background 
a.the settlement agreement 
omer rains is an attorney and a debtor in bankruptcy.kenny flinn is the bankruptcy trustee.in september,the bankruptcy court appointed a mediator in connection with adversary proceedings involving rains,flinn,and a creditor.a settlement conference was held on september,and after a full day of negotiations,the parties reached a settlement agreement settlement or agreement.the agreement was reduced to writing and the parties including rains and their attorneys signed it.
pursuant to the terms of the settlement,rains and his wife,also a debtor,agreed to pay the trustee by march.upon timely payment,the trustee and the creditor agreed to dismiss the adversary proceedings and withdraw their objections to claimed exemptions from the bankruptcy estate.among the exemptions claimed by rains was his interest in a retirement plan sponsored by the american bar association retirement plan.the agreement alternatively provided that 
i n the event that payment is not timely made by the defendants,judgment shall be entered denying the debtors discharge and an order shall be entered denying the debtors exemption claim to the aba pension plan up to the amount of unless before the due date for payment the debtors have posted an irrevocable standby letter of credit or other instrument or collateral acceptable to the trustee and to the creditor to support the payment.
b.the first appeal court approval of the settlement 
immediately following the conclusion of the mediation,rains drove himself to a hospital emergency room where he was admitted and diagnosed with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm,hemorrhage,and stroke.rains underwent surgery the next day and was placed in the intensive care unit for approximately one month prior to his eventual discharge from the hospital.rains claims to have no recollection of the events preceding his hospitalization.
sometime after rains underwent medical treatment,counsel for rains informed the trustee attorney that rains did not intend to comply with the settlement agreement.this development prompted the trustee to file with the bankruptcy court a motion for court approval of settlement for enforcement of settlement and for entry of judgment thereon motion to approve.in support of the motion,the trustee submitted a declaration in which he stated that he had personally observed rains at the settlement conference.according to the trustee,rains evinced a clear understanding of what was transpiring,the issues inherent in the settlement process,and the terms of the agreement as it evolved.
rains opposed the motion to approve and sought rescission of the agreement on the ground that he was not mentally competent to enter into a contract at the time the agreement was negotiated and signed.in his opposition,rains expressly consent ed to the court resolution of any disputed material fact issues pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e as made applicable by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.rains submitted several declarations in support of his contention that he was mentally incompetent,including those of a neurologist who treated him for the aneurysm and a clinical psychologist who provided care.the neurologist opined that rains would have been without the mental capacity to engage in business affairs on september,the date of his hospital admission,and for a number of days on each side of that date.the psychologist concurred,stating that at the time rains negotiated the settlement,he would not have had his normal mental capacity and would have been incapable of conducting business affairs with competence.
the trustee filed a reply controverting rains contention that he was mentally incompetent during the settlement conference.accompanying the reply was a declaration from gregory hughes,counsel for the trustee.hughes stated that he had a chance to observe rains at the settlement conference.according to hughes,rains participated actively in the negotiations,arguing over the due date for a cash payment and over the use of funds in his retirement plan as security for the payment.after the settlement was reduced to writing,rains reviewed the document carefully and asked his attorney questions about it.hughes overall impression also was that rains evinced a clear understanding of what was transpiring,the issues inherent in the settlement process,and the terms of the settlement as it evolved.rains creditor and her attorney submitted similar declarations.
the bankruptcy court heard oral argument on the motion to approve the settlement agreement,but did not hold a separate evidentiary hearing.after taking the matter under advisement,the bankruptcy court issued oral findings of fact and conclusions of law and announced that it was not persuaded that rains lacked the capacity to enter into an agreement.the court ruled from the bench,granting the motion to approve.its decision was memorialized in a minute order entered on february,settlement order.
rains filed a notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement agreement,and elected to have the appeal heard by the district court.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision,and rains appealed.
c.the second appeal court enforcement of the settlement agreement 
while the first appeal was pending before the district court,flinn filed an ex parte application for entry of judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement.this request was prompted by rains failure to pay by the march,due date.the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of flinn,ruling that rains claim of exemption against the aba retirement plan is hereby denied up to the sum of,and of the funds in that retirement plan is hereby held to be property of the chapter estate.the judgment further required rains to forthwith withdraw the sum of from the aba retirement plan,and pay said amount to the trustee immediately upon receipt.
rains filed a motion to alter or amend judgment motion to amend judgment in the bankruptcy court,contending that the court exceeded its jurisdiction when it declared that of the aba retirement plan was part of the bankruptcy estate and ordered rains to pay that amount from the retirement plan to the bankruptcy trustee.the bankruptcy court heard oral argument and denied the motion.although the first appeal was pending in district court,neither party notified the district court of these later developments in bankruptcy court.rains subsequently appealed the bankruptcy court order denying the motion to amend judgment and its judgment enforcing the settlement agreement.once again,rains elected to have the appeal heard by the district court.
the district court rationale for the disposition of this second appeal rested on a complicated interplay of procedural rules involving both the first and second appeals.finding that the second appeal also challenged the order approving the settlement agreement,rather than merely challenging its enforcement,the district court altered the analysis of its prior ruling and determined that the original order approving the settlement agreement was not final after all the court reasoned that because the first appeal was taken from what proved to be an interlocutory order,it was premature,and should be treated as having been filed on the day the final judgment was entered,pursuant to fed.a as the premature but subsequently cured notice of appeal was deemed filed on the date judgment was entered may,but before the motion to amend judgment was filed june,the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the motion to amend judgment because of the appeal then pending in district court.see dressler v.the seeley in re silberkraus,cir observing that the filing of a notice of appeal generally divests the trial court of jurisdiction.citations omitted.the district court then reasoned that because the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the motion to amend judgment,the filing of the motion did not toll the time allowed for appealing the judgment to the district court.accordingly,the district court dismissed the second appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that rains notice of appeal filed july,seeking review of the judgment that enforced the settlement agreement and denied the motion to amend judgment was untimely the may,judgment.however,the district court rationale does not address the fact that the notice of appeal filed on february,if premature because it was interlocutory,would be deemed filed on may,the date of final judgment.see arrowhead estates development united states trustee in re arrowhead estates development,cir,as amended fed.a.the interlocutory and final orders would then merge into one judgment for the purpose of appeal.see american ironworks erectors amer.constr,cir.accordingly,the notice of appeal would be timely with respect to the february,order approving the settlement agreement,as well as the may,order enforcing the settlement agreement 
ii.general standards of review 
we review de novo a district court decision on appeal from a bankruptcy court,and afford no deference to the prior decision of the district court.we also review de novo the bankruptcy court conclusions of law,including its interpretation of the bankruptcy code.we review the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error.under this standard,we accept findings of fact made by the bankruptcy court unless these findings leave the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed by the bankruptcy judge.latman burdette,cir citations omitted.
iii.discussion 
a.the first appeal appeal from the order approving the settlement agreement.jurisdiction 
the trustee contends that we lack jurisdiction over rains appeal from the order approving the settlement agreement because the order was interlocutory.thus,as a threshold matter,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over the first appeal.see jeff kempthorne,cir.we conclude that we do.
jurisdiction over an appeal from an order of a bankruptcy court is governed by.that section vests jurisdiction in the district court to hear appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees and,with leave of the court,from interlocutory orders and decrees,of bankruptcy judges.id.a.the courts of appeals are granted jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered by the district courts in their bankruptcy appellate capacity.id.d emphasis added.whether a bankruptcy court decision is final is a question of law reviewed de novo.silver sage partners,city of desert hot springs in re city of desert hot springs,cir citation omitted.
although district courts have discretion to hear interlocutory appeals from bankruptcy courts,d does not grant courts of appeals similar discretion to review interlocutory decisions.the courts of appeals do not have jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals in bankruptcy cases.silver sage,at.under d,appellate jurisdiction exists when the bankruptcy court order and the decision of the district court acting in its bankruptcy appellate capacity are both final orders.in re bonham,at citations and footnote omitted.however,even if the order approving the settlement agreement were interlocutory,we are not necessarily deprived of jurisdiction,because subsequent events can validate a prematurely filed appeal.ethridge harbor house restaurant,cir citation omitted.t he rule in this circuit is that once a final judgment is entered,an appeal from an order that otherwise would have been interlocutory is then appealable.eastport assocs.city of los angeles in re eastport assocs,cir see also special investments aero air,cir a prematurely filed notice of appeal can be cured if the rest of the claims are disposed of in a subsequent final decision terminating the litigation citation omitted.whatever prematurity existed in rains appeal from the order approving the settlement agreement was cured by the subsequent entry of a final judgment.see in re eastport,at.we therefore have jurisdiction to consider rains first appeal.
rains mental competency to enter into the settlement agreement 
the parties agree that california state law applies to the issue of the validity of the settlement.see houston holder in re omni video,cir holding that the validity of settlements in bankruptcy cases is best resolved by reference to state contracts law see also raleigh illinois dep t of revenue,d observing the basic federal rule that state law governs the substance of claims in bankruptcy cases citation and internal quotation marks omitted.california law provides that a conveyance or other contract of a person of unsound mind,but not entirely without understanding,made before the incapacity of the person has been judicially determined,is subject to rescission cal.a.pursuant to this statute,a party is entitled to rescission of a contract if,when he entered into the contract,he was not mentally competent to deal with the subject before him with a full understanding of his rights smalley baker,d,overruled on other grounds by weiner fleischman,cal d.t he test in each instance is whether he understood the nature,purpose and effect of what he did.smalley,d at.citations omitted.
rains argues that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding him mentally competent to enter into the settlement agreement.however,the record contained sufficient evidence to support a finding that rains understood the nature,purpose and effect of his actions when he agreed to settle with the trustee and the creditor.witnesses who personally observed rains during the negotiations reported that rains participated actively and appeared to have a full understanding of what was transpiring and of the terms of the settlement.rains argued over certain terms and suggested alternatives to those he disliked.after the settlement was negotiated,rains reviewed the written agreement and asked his attorney questions about it.
rains does not seriously dispute the veracity of the witness statements offered by the trustee.rather,he relies heavily on the opinions of his treating physician and psychologist that a person with his diagnosis would not have had the mental capacity to conduct business affairs at the time of the negotiations.however,the weight to be given expert medical testimony is within the discretion of the trier of fact.wong ho dulles,cir.the bankruptcy court was not bound to follow these expert opinions.see united states honolulu plantation,cir.in the face of conflicting testimony,the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in discounting the theoretical speculation of rains experts,or in finding that rains was mentally competent to enter into the settlement agreement.see prescod amr,cir observing that the trier of fact is in the best position to resolve conflicts in the evidence.
denial of rains request to supplement the evidentiary record 
rains contends that the bankruptcy court committed reversible error by denying his verbal request at the preliminary hearing to supplement the evidentiary record to challenge flinn lay witness declaration testimony submitted in support of flinn reply.he further asserts that the bankruptcy court decision to deny rains request to file evidentiary objections to the reply declarations violated his procedural due process rights.
rains arguments are not persuasive for five reasons.first,rains waived his due process claim by failing to raise it properly before either the bankruptcy court or the district court.in general,this court does not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.cold mountain garber,cir rains did not raise the issue at all before the bankruptcy court.he did not raise it before the district court until he filed his reply brief.the district court did not address the due process claim in its subsequent order,undoubtedly relying on the principle that issues can not be raised for the first time in a reply brief.coleman quaker oats,cir citation omitted.
second,rains never articulated his requests with sufficient clarity to preserve the alleged error for review.for an argument to be considered on appeal,it generally must be raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it.broad sealaska,cir citation omitted.the closest rains counsel came to asking for expansion of the record was to complain that w e get no chance to take a whack at the reply declarations.i mean,are you going to do that sua sponte,or should i file something or.this vague statement did not adequately apprise the bankruptcy court of the nature of rains request such that the court had an opportunity to rule on it.
third,nothing prevented rains from orally objecting to the reply declarations at the hearing on the motion to approve.however,he failed to so.at one point,rains counsel stated that several of the declarations are replete with hearsay statements which are completely inadmissible,but he never articulated any clear objections to specific statements made in the declarations.absent a contemporaneous objection,we will review for plain error where the integrity or fundamental fairness of the proceedings is called into serious question.bird glacier,cir.that is not the case here.
fourth,as a substantive matter,the main authority rains cites in support of his allegation of a due process violation is mullane cent.hanover bank trust.that case simply stands for the proposition that t he fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.id.at.citation omitted.in that sense,rains was accorded his full due process rights with respect to the motion.the declarations of the trustee and his attorney flinn declarations were filed well in advance of the hearing.although the declarations of the creditor and her attorney were filed only one day before the hearing,rains counsel had received and read them by the time the hearing took place,and they were substantially similar in substance to the flinn declarations.rains had adequate opportunity to challenge the declarations at the hearing before the bankruptcy court.
fifth and finally,rains expressly waived his right to a separate evidentiary hearing when he filed his opposition to the motion to approve the settlement 
for these reasons,the bankruptcy court did not err in declining to allow rains to supplement the evidentiary record.
b.the second appeal appeal from the judgment enforcing the settlement agreement 
the bankruptcy court jurisdiction 
rains asserts that his filing of a notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement agreement transferred jurisdiction to the district court,thereby depriving the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to enter the judgment enforcing the settlement agreement.we are not persuaded.
we review de novo whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction.dunmore united states,cir.it is generally true that the timely filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction.see in re silberkraus,at cir.however,if the order at issue is interlocutory,any appeal would be premature and would not transfer jurisdiction to an appellate court.see riggs scrivner,cir see also united states abatement mobil exploration producing,in re united states abatement,cir holding that premature notice of appeal from interlocutory bankruptcy order was of no effect rather,the trial court retains jurisdiction to enter final judgment.see albiero city of kankakee,cir.
additionally,the rule that a notice of appeal will divest a court of jurisdiction is not absolute.neary padilla in re padilla,cir.for example,a trial court retains jurisdiction to take actions that preserve the status quo during the pendency of an appeal,although the court may not finally adjudicate substantial rights directly involved in the appeal.id.citations omitted.and a bsent a stay or supersedeas,the court also retains jurisdiction to implement or enforce the judgment or order but may not alter or expand upon the judgment.id.citations omitted.
in this case,the bankruptcy court judgment enforcing the settlement agreement,whether considered a final order or an interlocutory order,did not change the status quo or materially alter the issues on appeal.the judgment merely effectuated the express terms of the settlement agreement,and did not alter or expand upon the order approving the settlement agreement as a result,the bankruptcy court acted within its jurisdiction when it entered judgment,even though rains had already filed a notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement agreement.
the district court jurisdiction over the second appeal 
we review the timeliness of a notice of appeal de novo.feldman allstate ins,cir.under the district court analysis,whether rains appeal was timely depends on whether his motion to alter or amend the judgment was properly before the bankruptcy court.a bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction to consider a timely motion under fed.to alter or amend the judgment,even when the motion is filed subsequent to a notice of appeal.see fed.b see also resolution trust keating,cir interpreting analogous provision in fed.a as granting district court jurisdiction to entertain timely motion to alter or amend the judgment after notice of appeal is filed.the previously filed notice of appeal does not become effective until the entry of the order disposing of the motion fed.b 
rains notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement agreement,although filed prior to the motion to amend judgment,did not divest the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to consider that motion.see fed.b listing various motions see also keating,at.a motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed within days after entry of the judgment.fed.e.the bankruptcy court entered judgment on may.rains motion to alter or amend the judgment enforcing the settlement agreement,filed on june,was therefore timely.
rains notice of appeal from the entry of judgment enforcing the settlement agreement was also timely a party wishing to appeal a decision of the bankruptcy court must file the notice of appeal within days of the date of the entry of the judgment,order,or decree appealed from.fed.a.a timely motion to alter or amend the judgment under fed.tolls the time period for filing a notice of appeal.fed.b.in that case,the time for appeal for all parties runs from the entry of the order disposing of the motion.fed.b.the order denying the motion to amend judgment was entered on july.rains filed a notice of appeal ten days later,on july.as a result,the district court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal as do we the district court erred in dismissing rains appeal as untimely 
rains interest in the retirement plan 
section c of the bankruptcy code provides that a restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicable law is enforceable in a case under this title.c.the natural reading of this provision entitles a debtor to exclude from property of the estate any interest in a plan or trust that contains a transfer restriction enforceable under any relevant nonbankruptcy law.patterson shumate,d.the united states supreme court has held that an provision in an pension plan constitutes such a restriction for purposes of the c exclusion.id.at.the exclusion is permissive rather than mandatory a debtor interest in an pension plan may be excluded from the property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to c.id.at.emphasis added.a bankruptcy court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over excluded pension plan funds.in re mcclellan,cir.
in the settlement agreement,rains agreed that if he did not make a timely cash payment to the trustee or post alternative collateral,his exemption claim to the aba retirement plan would be denied up to the amount of.rains now contends that his interest in the aba retirement plan must be excluded from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa and that the bankruptcy court therefore lacked jurisdiction to order him to wit
