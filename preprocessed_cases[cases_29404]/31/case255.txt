this is an appeal by the plaintiff,helen dunnigan,the beneficiary of a disability insurance policy issued by defendant metropolitan life insurance company metlife,from the dismissal of her complaint by the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin.plaintiff complaint asserted a claim,personally and on the behalf of all other similarly situated disabled participants in metlife disability plans,pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,to recover interest on benefits paid subsequent to the date when the participant was entitled to receive such payments.metlife moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that independent actions for interest on delayed benefit payments can not be maintained under erisa where benefits are awarded after internal administrative review and not through litigation.the district court rejected metlife contentions,concluding that the language and policy of erisa,taken together with common law contract principles,can in some instances support an action to recover interest on delayed benefit payments.under the district court view,however,an essential element of such a claim is bad faith on the part of the insurer.because the complaint did not allege bad faith on metlife part,the court found that it failed to assert a claim upon which relief could be granted.the court denied the application for class certification and dismissed the complaint without prejudice to plaintiff reinstating a new suit.
in our view,the complaint adequately pleaded entitlement to relief.we vacate the judgment and remand.
background 
factual backgrounda.the complaint 
the allegations of dunnigan complaint include the following 
around october,dunnigan began employment as an auditor at the new york office of deloitte touche deloitte,the accounting firm.deloitte offered its employees the opportunity to participate in a disability policy issued by defendant metlife the deloitte plan or the plan.dunnigan enrolled in the plan.
in march,dunnigan was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and was rendered totally disabled by the disease.on july,she applied to metlife for disability benefits.metlife denied the application by letter dated november,approximately days after her request.the complaint notes that metlife denial of dunnigan application came after the expiration of the period specified by the secretary of labor regulations for such determinations,formerly e 
on february,dunnigan submitted an appeal to metlife.approximately days later,on august,metlife denied the appeal and stated that no further appeals were allowed.the complaint states that metlife denied the appeal after the expiration of the time periods specified by the secretary of labor regulations.see h i the complaint also alleges that metlife did not inform dunnigan of any special circumstances requiring an extension of these time periods.
dunnigan then hired a lawyer,and over the next three years,submitted additional appeals to metlife through counsel all were denied until the last appeal,which she filed in november.for reasons not explained in the complaint,on february,four years and eight months after the submission of dunnigan claim,metlife reversed its prior denials and granted her retroactive benefits for the period from june,through january.the benefits were tendered as a lump sum payment calculated by multiplying dunnigan monthly benefit provided by the plan by the number of months she had been eligible for benefits.the payment did not include interest on account of the delay in making payment.metlife informed dunnigan lawyers that regardless of the factual circumstances,metlife never pa ys interest on back benefits except when ordered to do so by a court of law.
construed in the light most favorable to dunnigan,as required in judging a motion under.b,the complaint alleges that metlife payment of benefits to dunnigan was made after she became entitled to receive the benefits.it goes on to assert a claim not only on dunnigan behalf but also on behalf of a class of similarly situated disabled participants in metlife disability plans whose payments of benefits were not made until after the participant date of entitlement to receive the benefits,but without interest to offset the lost value caused by the delay.
the complaint recites four claims for relief.
count i asserts a claim under erisa a b,which authorizes a plan beneficiary to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.a b.it claims that dunnigan and the plaintiff class were entitled under the terms of metlife plans to interest on benefits payments that were made after the individual entitlement to receive such payments.
count ii asserts a claim under erisa a b,which permits a plan beneficiary to seek an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief for violations of erisa or the terms of an erisa plan.a b.it alleges that metlife breached its fiduciary duties and was unjustly enriched by the delay in making payment.specifically,this count requests a declaration that,among other things,a constructive trust was established in the amount of the interest that metlife failed to pay on delayed benefits,and restitution equal to the interest on late benefits payments disgorgement of any profits metlife earned by withholding interest on benefits.
count iii alleges that metlife violated erisa and its fiduciary duties by rendering disability eligibility determinations beyond the periods specified in,which governs the time within which a plan must rule on claims for benefits.like count ii,count iii demands appropriate equitable relief under erisa a b.
count iv requests attorneys fees and costs pursuant to erisa g.g.
proceedings below 
after answering the complaint,metlife moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to.b appending a copy of the certificate of insurance setting forth the terms of the deloitte plan.metlife motion characterized the claims for interest as in fact claims for extracontractual,compensatory money damages,which are generally not recoverable under erisa.see lee burkhart,cir.
while accepting that payments of benefits have a component that is lost when those benefits are not paid until after they are due,the district court rejected dunnigan assertion that interest on delayed payments was an explicit or implied term of the plan,whether under ordinary principles of contractual interpretation or under federal common law.furthermore,because the deloitte plan,submitted in support of defendant motion,requires that the claimant written proof of claim be satisfactory to metlife,the court reasoned that there was no ascertainable date when the payments were due because metlife was entitled to time to assess the proofs to determine whether they were satisfactory.the court therefore determined that interest was not payable under the terms of the plan,as claimed in count i under a b.see dunnigan metropolitan life ins,d.
the district court concluded,however,that the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in every contract applies with equal force to erisa plans.id.at.the court reasoned that,if the complaint had asserted that the payment delays resulted from breach of metlife duty of good faith and fair dealing,it would have pleaded a cognizable claim to equitable relief under erisa a b.because the complaint did not assert that metlife had acted in breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing,the district court concluded count ii failed to state an actionable claim for equitable relief under a b.the court dismissed count iii for the same reasons.the court also concluded that dunnigan claim could not be brought as a class action,because the facts relating to breach of a duty of good faith would be likely to differ from case to case so that there would be little commonality of issues of fact.id.at.finally,the court denied plaintiff request for attorneys fees.id.at.
this appeal followed.
