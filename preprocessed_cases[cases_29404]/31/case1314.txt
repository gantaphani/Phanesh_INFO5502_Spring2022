we have held a number of times that a claimant failure to exhaust the administrative remedies that an erisa plan provides for challenging the denial of a benefits claim ordinarily bars her from pursuing that claim in court,counts am.life accident ins,cir.we have never decided the issue presented in this case,however,which is whether that bar should apply when the claimant failure to exhaust her administrative remedies is the result of language in the summary plan description that she reasonably interpreted as meaning that she could go straight to court with her claim.we conclude that the failure to exhaust bar should not apply in these circumstances,and for that reason we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment against the claimant.
background facts and procedural history 
a.the bellsouth short term disability plan 
bellsouth telecommunications,provides short term disability benefits to eligible employees through its bellsouth short term disability plan,and it has delegated to kemper national services,the exclusive discretionary authority to interpret and administer the terms of the plan.to simplify things we will refer to both corporations as bellsouth.the plan sets up a claim and appeal procedure for participants who wish to make a disability claim.first,the plan participant must file a claim for benefits documenting the claimed disability.if that claim for benefits is denied,the plan allows an appeal,providing 
any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied in whole or in part and who wants this denial to be reviewed must submit a written appeal of the claim denial within days after receipt of notice of denial.
in accordance with and b,bellsouth provided a summary plan description to plan participants and beneficiaries,including the plaintiff and appellant in this case,gloria watts,which contains an explanation of the terms of the plan.erisa requires employers to put certain information in the summary plan description,including the procedures to be followed in presenting claims for benefits under the plan and the remedies available under the plan for the redress of claims which are denied in whole or in part.b.bellsouth complied with this requirement and described the plan claim and appeal procedure in the summary plan description.
the introductory paragraph to the benefit claim and appeal procedures section of the summary plan description states the procedure that must be followed in order to pursue your claim and appeal rights is described below.under the heading appeal procedure,the summary plan description states that a claimant may use this procedure if written denial of the claim is received and the claimant wishes to appeal the denial.the appeal procedure is then described 
if the claim for benefits is denied,or deemed denied,in whole or in part,and the claimant or a person duly authorized by the claimant wishes to appeal this denial,such appeal must be submitted in writing within days after receipt of the denial written request for review of any denied claim should be sent to the secretary,ebc,ebcrc or other committee delegate 
to clarify,what we have been talking about thus far are the administrative remedies the plan provides for participants and how those remedies are described in the summary plan description given to participants.
in addition to those administrative remedies,participants have at their disposal federal and state court remedies under erisa,and those court remedies must also be described in the summary plan description.erisa authorizes the secretary of labor to require that the administrator of any employee benefit plan furnish to each participant and to each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan a statement of the rights of participants and beneficiaries under this subchapter.c.one of those rights is to bring a lawsuit challenging the denial of benefits.a b.the secretary,implementing this statutory authority,has issued a regulation mandating that summary plan descriptions include a statement of the plan participants legal rights under erisa,and the regulation includes a model statement of rights which is recommended for use.see t.the pertinent language of the model statement provides that i f you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored,in whole or in part,you may file suit in a state or federal court.id.t.the summary plan description bellsouth provided to watts and other participants contained a statement under the heading your rights under erisa,which repeated verbatim the language of the model statement recommended by the secretary in the regulation.
watts claim and administrative appeal 
gloria watts,as a participant in the plan,submitted a claim for disability benefits under it.on january,bellsouth notified watts by letter that her claim had been denied.watts timely filed what the parties call her first appeal,and bellsouth notified her by letter dated may,that it was denying her appeal and expressly informed her that she had days to file a second and final administrative appeal 
watts did not file the second and final administrative appeal.she consulted her union representative and was advised that it would not do any good,that she would not prevail in an administrative appeal.in an affidavit watts filed in opposition to bellsouth motion for summary judgment,she states that after consulting with the union representative,and while the days for filing the second administrative appeal had not yet run,she consulted the summary plan description.she read in that document both the statement that she may use the administrative appeal procedure if a claim for benefits is denied,and also the statement that i f you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored,in whole or in part,you may file suit in a state or federal court.according to watts affidavit,she understood from the summary plan description that she had the option of continuing to pursue her claim administratively by taking her second appeal,or filing a lawsuit,or both.as she described it,the summary plan description caused her to believe that she could do either,both,or neither.
because watts was convinced she would not prevail administratively,she decided her best avenue for relief would be a federal lawsuit.she did not consult an attorney to discuss the possibility of a lawsuit until july,sixteen days after the deadline for filing her second administrative appeal had passed.on the same day that she met with her attorney,and presumably in compliance with legal advice,she sent a letter to bellsouth seeking to pick up and complete the administrative process by taking the second appeal from the denial of her claim for benefits.on august,bellsouth denied her second appeal because it,in the form of watts letter,had been filed days after the denial of her first appeal,which was sixteen days too late.watts then filed this suit in the district court.
procedural history 
watts brought her complaint under the employee retirement income security act of,alleging that she was entitled to benefits under the plan.after bellsouth filed a motion to dismiss based on watts failure to allege that she had exhausted her administrative remedies,watts amended her complaint to specifically allege she had done so and that,even if she had not,the exhaustion requirement should be excused.after the parties consented to adjudication by a magistrate judge,he treated bellsouth motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment and granted it against watts because,by filing an untimely by sixteen days administrative appeal,she had failed to properly exhaust her administrative remedies.
ii.discussion 
ordinarily,if a plan participant failed to take advantage of an available administrative appeal by pursuing it in compliance with a reasonable filing deadline,she has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and that bars federal court review of her claim.see,counts am.life accident ins,cir gallegos sinai med,cir terry bayer,cir.watts does not contend otherwise,nor does she contend that she met the deadline for filing her second administrative appeal.instead,she argues that the district court should have estopped bellsouth from raising
