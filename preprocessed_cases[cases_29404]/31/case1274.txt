james capone struck his head on the bottom of the ocean 
while diving in the bahamas,paralyzing himself from the neck down.capone sought benefits under the accidental death and personal loss provision of his employee health insurance policy administered by aetna life insurance company aetna.aetna denied capone claim for benefits twice,prompting this civil action.the district court granted aetna motion for summary judgment,holding that aetna properly applied the plan accidental means and alcohol exclusion provisions barring recovery.we disagree,holding that aetna investigation was insufficient to support their conclusions.
factual and procedural background 
capone,an ohio resident,was an employee of dent wizard international,dent wizard a missouri company and subsidiary of cox enterprises,cox,a georgia corporation.as an employee of dent wizard,capone participated in cox welfare benefit plan.the welfare benefit plan is governed by the employee retirement income security act,et.although cox the majority of the benefits available under the plan,the accidental death and personal loss benefits were funded through an insurance policy with aetna.the policy had a choice of law provision,which designated georgia as the governing jurisdiction.
in april,capone attended a dent wizard employee training and incentive program in the bahamas.at approximately,capone joined a group of guests jumping and diving from a dock adjacent to the wyndham nassau resort.on his first dive,capone dove into the ocean without incident.on his second dive,capone struck his head on the bottom,fracturing his spine and suffering permanent quadriplegia at capone was admitted to the princess margaret hospital in nassau and stabilized.
as part of their admittance procedure,the hospital performed a blood serum test and entered the results at the alcohol in capone blood serum measured,which was later converted to a blood alcohol content bac of by aetna claims administrator the next day,capone was transferred from the bahamian hospital to jackson memorial hospital in miami,florida for further treatment.both hospitals characterized his injury as a result of diving into shallow water and the miami hospital labeled the incident as a etoh diving accident and recorded that capone noted a history of alcohol abuse.
capone sought benefits under the accidental death and personal loss provision of his employee welfare benefits plan.dent wizard submitted capone initial claim for benefits to aetna in june,stating that capone dove off pier and broke neck.aetna received a second claim form describing the injury more specifically as a diving accident that resulted in fracture with complete quadriplegia.
after several requests to capone,aetna received his medical records and toxicology report in november.on february,aetna denied capone claim for benefits on two independent grounds.first,aetna claimed that capone intentionally exposed himself to unnecessary and foreseeable risks by voluntarily diving from a fifteen to twenty foot high dock into the ocean.therefore,his injury was not the result of an accident as defined by the policy.aetna based its denial on an accident report from the wyndham nassau resort,and information provided by alfred rolle,a security officer for the wyndham,who indicated that no diving signs were posted on the dock and ignored by capone.
second,aetna claimed that even if his injuries were the result of an 
accident,no benefits were payable under the policy for accidents caused or contributed to by the use of alcohol.aetna cited capone medical records and the toxicology report in its denial.aetna stated that because capone was intoxicated,he could not recover under his policy.
appealing aetna denial,capone claimed that jumping from the dock was a common practice.capone stated that,contrary to aetna assertion,no diving signs were not posted and a nearby lifeguard did not stop the group from diving.capone supported his appeal with photographic evidence of the dock and resort area,taken two weeks after his injury.
the photographs showed the dock sitting four to five feet above the water instead of the fifteen to twenty feet claimed by aetna.the photographs also showed several people jumping off the dock,though no people were diving.no diving signs were not visible in the photographs.depositions of wyndham employees later revealed that the no diving signs had been blown away months earlier and never been replaced.no lifeguard was visible in the photographs.addressing the alcohol exclusion,capone argued that aetna failed to adequately specify how alcohol contributed to his injury.capone challenged the accuracy and reliability of the toxicology report due to the hospital failure to provide calibration testing of its equipment.capone also contended that an accurate conversion of his blood serum level put his bac at instead of the claimed by aetna 
capone further alleged that because the accident occurred at,and he had consumed alcohol in the hour immediately preceding the accident,his actual bac at the time of the accident would have been substantially less than due to the delay in alcohol absorption.capone cited the same medical treatise used by aetna to support his argument.finally,capone contended the accident was caused by a sudden change in water depth due to wave action and not his alcohol consumption.
capone supported his appeal with an eyewitness affidavit signed by capone coworker and friend,kevin zeh.zeh attested that both he and capone successfully dove from the dock prior to capone accident,and that other guests were jumping and diving as well.zeh stated that he did not see capone acting inappropriately or having red eyes,slurred speech,or difficulty walking,immediately preceding the accident.
in a letter dated may,aetna denied capone appeal.aetna concluded that a voluntary and intentional dive into the ocean was not an accidental means of injury under georgia law,despite the fact that the resulting injury may have been unexpected.additionally,aetna explained that the toxicology results,showing a bac of,barred his recovery.aetna relied on a learned medical treatise,which stated that someone with a bac of to would exhibit the following behavior staggering,grossly impaired,drunk may be lethargic and sleepy or hostile and aggressive.aetna noted that even if capone bac was as claimed by his appeal letter,the treatise stated that he would still show signs of increas ed impairment of sensory motor activities,reaction times,attention,visual activity,and judgment.aetna dismissed capone challenge to the reliability of the blood serum test because capone failed to provide any expert or medical documentation to support his assertions.
capone filed this action for benefits against aetna,cox,and cox welfare benefits plan.capone claimed a wrongful denial of benefits under a b.the district court dismissed all claims and defendants except for the benefits claim against aetna.in response to aetna motion,the district court issued a preliminary order stating that the standard of review for capone erisa benefits claim was this circuit heightened arbitrary and capricious standard because aetna was a conflicted administrator acting as both evaluator and payor of claims.
after conducting limited discovery,capone and aetna filed cross motions for summary judgment.on de novo review,the first step of erisa arbitrary and capricious standard,the district court concluded that aetna claim decision was correct and granted aetna motion for summary judgment.capone argues that the district court erred by applying the incorrect standard of review under erisa in reviewing his claims denying his claim under georgia accidental means standard and applying the insurance plan alcohol exclusion as an alternative,independent ground for denial.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standards governing the district court decision.sierra club,leavitt,cir.
erisa provides no standard for reviewing decisions of plan administrators or fiduciaries.firestone tire rubber bruch.however,the supreme court in firestone established three distinct standards for reviewing an erisa plan administrator decision de novo where the plan does not grant the administrator discretion arbitrary and capricious where the plan grants the administrator discretion and heightened arbitrary and capricious where the plan grants the administrator discretion and the administrator has a conflict of interest.see buckley metro.life,cir.recent cases from this circuit have expanded the firestone test into a analysis to guide district courts in reviewing an administrator benefits decision 
apply the de novo standard to determine whether the claim administrator decision is wrong,the court disagrees with the administrator decision if it is not,then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.
if the administrator decision in fact is de novo wrong,then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims if not,end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.
if the administrator decision is de novo wrong and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims,then determine whether reasonable grounds supported it hence,review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.
if no reasonable grounds exist,then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator decision if reasonable grounds do exist,then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.
if there is no conflict,then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.
if there is a conflict of interest,then apply heightened arbitrary and capricious review to the decision to affirm or deny it.
williams bellsouth,cir overruled on other grounds by doyle liberty life assurance of boston,cir.
until recently,the hallmark of the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard was its burden shifting requirement.when a plan administrator had a conflict of interest by both reviewing and paying claims,the burden shifts to the fiduciary to prove that its interpretation of plan provisions committed to its discretion was not tainted by.brown blue cross blue shield of,cir.however,in metropolitan life ins.glenn,the supreme court called into question the eleventh circuit heightened arbitrary and capricious standard.
glenn dealt with the denial of benefits under an employee benefit plan governed by erisa.glenn agreed that the appropriate standard for reviewing a conflicted administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious,but held that an individualized inquiry is required to determine the circumstances of each decision.id.as such,a generalized test is inappropriate.id.
in doyle,this circuit recognized that glenn implicitly overrules brown and other cases requiring courts to apply the heightened standard to a conflicted administrator benefits decision.at.instead,the existence of a conflict of interest should merely be a factor for the district court to take into account when determining whether an administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.id.at.furthermore,the burden remains on the plaintiff to show the decision was arbitrary it is not the defendant burden to prove its decision was not tainted by.id.
the parties dispute the impact of doyle on the methodology set forth in williams.however,the district court found and we agree that the williams methodology remains intact except for the sixth step.in doyle itself,this circuit approved the district court use of the williams methodology,as modified by glenn.see also white coca cola,cir although glenn affects the sixth step of williams,glenn does not alter our analysis unless operated under a conflict of interest.therefore,we will apply the williams methodology as modified by glenn.this requires the court to first determine whether aetna denial of benefits was de novo wrong.
iii.discussion 
a decision is wrong if,after a de novo review,the court disagrees with the administrator decision.williams,at.we find that aetna decision to deny benefits was de novo wrong.
standard of review 
the district court ruled that the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard 
was the appropriate standard to review the administrator decision.despite this ruling,the district court ordered that the scope of discovery was not limited to the administrative record compiled by aetna insofar as additional discovery could shed light on how the fiduciary reached its decision,or in examining whether an administrator fulfilled his or her fiduciary duties.this expansive discovery falls in line with a de novo review.also,the district court ultimately rendered its decision solely on de novo grounds.as our circuit erisa standard of review incorporates the de novo inquiry as the first step in the arbitrary and capricious standard,it is unnecessary for us to go beyond a de novo review at this time.see on the hearing of any appeal or writ of certiorari in any case,the court shall give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to errors or defects which do not affect substantial rights of the parties.
choice of law 
capone contends that allowing georgia law to apply would frustrate the twin goals of erisa protecting employee interests and providing uniformity of benefits administration.the pertinent question is whether the principles of liability agreed upon by the parties are inconsistent with the language of erisa or the policies that inform that statute and animate the common law of the statute.buce allianz life ins,cir.in buce,we recognized that erisa preemptive authority sweeps broadly but concluded that there was no evidence in the statutory language or common law of erisa suggesting that a valid choice of law provision would be subversive to erisa policy.see id.
capone further argues that it is fundamentally unfair to apply a georgia choice of law provision to a claim filed by an ohio citizen,who worked for a missouri company and was injured in the bahamas.where a choice of law is made by an erisa contract,it should be followed,if not unreasonable or fundamentally unfair.id.at.
while we recognize capone argument,the policy was contracted with a georgia corporation,contained a valid choice of law provision designating the state of delivery as the governing jurisdiction and was properly delivered in georgia.while confronting a similar argument in buce,we held that although the doctrine of accidental means may no longer be fashionable,its use under georgia law can hardly be characterized as unreasonable,let alone fundamentally unfair.id.as such,we conclude that georgia law applies to capone claim.
accidental results accidental means 
georgia law distinguishes between insurance coverage for accidental results and coverage for injuries caused by accidental means.see provident life accident ins.hallum.in hallum,the georgia supreme court explained that an accidental result is an injury that is unexpected but arises from a conscious voluntary act,without any intervening circumstances.see id.conversely,an injury from accidental means is one that is the result of an unforeseen act that was involuntarily or unintentionally done.see id.the insurance policy has two relevant provisions 
this plan pays a benefit,if,while insured,a person suffers a bodily injury caused by an accident and if,within days after the accident and as a direct result of the injury,he or she loses
