kodak retirement income plan krip or the plan,the trustee of the kodak retirement income plan,and kodak retirement income plan committee kripco appeal from the decision and order entered on august,by judge david larimer of the united states district court for the western district of new york.the decision and order granted a preliminary injunction in favor of kickham hanley kickham that prevents from making pension benefit payments to certain plan participants unless they place of the payments in escrow pending adjudication of kickham entitlement to an attorney fee award from these benefits.because we conclude that kickham claim to attorney fees drawn from undistributed vested pension benefits violates erisa provision,d,we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
krip is a defined benefit plan under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,that is administrated by kripco for the benefit of employees of eastman kodak kodak.michael scanlan,a client of kickham,was hired by kodak on october,to work for kodak health group.as a result of his employment,scanlan participated in krip,which required a participant to complete at least five years of employment to become a vested beneficiary.in may,kodak sold its health group to onex healthcare holdings,onex.scanlan and approximately other employees were divested to carestream health,a subsidiary or affiliate of onex,which necessitated their termination from kodak employment.approximately of these employees,including scanlan,had not vested their krip benefits yet because they had worked less than five years for kodak.for this reason,kripco determined that scanlan was not entitled to benefits.
by letter dated june,and pursuant to a claims procedure set forth in the plan,kickham challenged the denial of krip benefits to scanlan and,purportedly,to similarly situated participants,arguing that there had been a partial termination of the plan,entitling these participants to benefits.by letter dated december,kripco rejected kickham arguments and declared scanlan ineligible for benefits.the kripco letter also informed kickham that it must provide the names of any additional plan participants it claimed to represent for their cases to be considered.kickham appealed the decision by letter dated january,again claiming to represent a class of similarly situated persons.joint app.
on february,before kripco had resolved the administrative appeal,kickham filed a complaint in federal court initiating the present suit for attorney fees.kickham complaint alleged that,in discussions between the parties in february,kripco had indicated that it was considering the option of declaring a partial termination of the plan and vesting all unvested,involuntarily terminated participants,but that it did not believe that kickham would be entitled to fees based on any recovery by these plan participants.on march,kickham moved for a preliminary injunction to the effect that,in the event kripco granted scanlan claim to benefits or declared a partial termination of the plan,would be barred from distributing more than of the newly vested funds to plan participants prior to the district court ruling on kickham claim for attorney fees.a motion hearing was set for may and later rescheduled for june.
on march,kripco informed kickham by letter that kripco was granting scanlan access to his benefits.kripco again rejected kickham claim to be acting on behalf of individuals similarly situated to scanlan,noting that kickham had not named its additional clients as requested and that kripco read the plan to require each person seeking benefits to file a claim and to specifically authorize any firm representation.kripco also stated that it is unclear whether any other former employees are similarly situated to scanlan for any number of reasons.id.at.by a separate letter dated the same day,kripco rejected kickham claim to attorney fees.treating kickham filed complaint as a claim for fees under the terms of the plan and noting that krip requires fee claims to be made within days of the denial of benefits,kripco declared kickham claim for fees untimely because kickham complaint was filed more than days after its receipt of the december,letter denying benefits to scanlan.according to,kickham failed to appeal this determination as required by the plan prior to pursuing litigation.
on april,kripco mailed letters to the approximately former kodak employees previously denied pension benefits due to the may sale of the kodak health group,informing them that they would be given access to benefits through their krip accounts.by letter dated april,kickham accused kripco of attempting to cheat kickham out of its fees and demanded information concerning the number of former employees who had received the letter from kripco and how that group was defined.according to kickham,kripco did not respond.
on may,kickham filed an amended complaint seeking,inter alia,a declaration that its advocacy had created a common fund for the benefit of scanlan and a class of similarly situated plan participants and that kickham was entitled to a fee,presumably drawn from that fund,for conferring this benefit upon the class members.kickham requested that notice be provided to affected plan participants,that a hearing be held on the issue of the amount of attorney fees and costs to be awarded,and that the court thereafter order to pay these fees out of the undistributed plan funds allocated or otherwise payable to the affected p lan participants.id.at.kickham continued to seek an injunction barring kripco from distributing more than of the newly vested funds pending resolution of its claim to attorney fees.
on may,filed a motion to dismiss.a hearing on both the motion to dismiss and kickham preliminary injunction motion was held on june.on august,the district court granted kickham motion for a preliminary injunction in part and denied motion to dismiss.
regarding the preliminary injunction,the district court found that kickham would suffer irreparable harm if forced to seek its fee from hundreds of benefit recipients after a fund distribution.noting the complexity and inconsistency of the case law concerning attorney fees in common fund cases,the court also found that kickham had raised sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of its case.the court determined that whether a common fund had been created and,if so,whether its creation was due to kickham efforts were factual disputes that did not preclude a preliminary injunction.it also found that the balance of hardships tilted in kickham favor,deciding that any delay in sending payments to plan participants would be justifiable.the court determined,however,that kickham request for the reservation of of any payments to the plan participants was excessive in light of any attorney fee award kickham might realistically expect.the court therefore entered a preliminary injunction barring distribution of of such payments.it did not require kickham to execute a bond.
with respect to motion to dismiss,the district court concluded that kickham had stated a claim under the common fund doctrine.because kickham was not a party to the plan,the district court found inapposite argument that the plan terms precluded kickham action.as for claim that awarding relief to kickham would violate the provisions of erisa,d,and the internal revenue code,a,the district court ruled these provisions inapplicable because it found no clear statutory intent to proscribe fee awards from common funds,nor any cases dealing with such fee awards that showed any concern over the prohibitions on alienation of benefits.kickham hanley kodak ret.income plan,d.finally,the district court rejected argument that kickham lacked standing and failed to exhaust administrative remedies,observing that kickham based its claim on the common fund doctrine,not on erisa 
on august,filed an interlocutory appeal from the district court decision to grant a preliminary injunction to kickham.
discussion 
this court reviews a district court decision to grant a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,which occurs when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.vincenty bloomberg,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting mastrovincenzo city of new york,cir.to obtain a preliminary injunction,the moving party must demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction and either a likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation,with a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the movant favor.doninger niehoff,cir.with respect to kickham showing of irreparable injury,this court has recognized in a context that forcing counsel to attempt to collect its fee from hundreds of trust customers individually is so impractical as to be infeasible,and constitutes irreparable harm.savoie merchants bank,cir.do not appear to challenge the district court reliance on savoie to find that kickham demonstrated irreparable injury nor do they attack the district court determination that the balance of hardships tipped in kickham favor.the primary issue this court must decide,therefore,is whether kickham common fund claim to the vested pension benefits at issue presented sufficiently serious questions going to the merits such that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.we conclude that kickham can not successfully lay claim to vested but undistributed benefits and,therefore,that the preliminary injunction should not have issued.
kickham correctly acknowledges that the district court could not award attorney fees under erisa provision,g,because that provision permits recovery only for fees incurred in relation to a suit filed in a court of competent jurisdiction and not those incurred during the initial administrative process.peterson cont l cas,cir.nevertheless,kickham contends that this limitation on erisa provision is inapposite,because kickham is not attempting to collect attorney fees from pursuant to g.rather,kickham seeks fees from the affected plan participants under the equitable common fund doctrine.kickham argument is an artful attempt to avoid the scylla of g.in asserting a claim directly against the plan participants vested,but undistributed pension benefits,however,kickham passes too close to the charybdis posed by erisa provision that we conclude prohibits the very relief that kickham seeks.see erisa d,d see also a precluding a plan from qualifying for status in the absence of an provision.
erisa provision mandates that e ach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.d.in guidry sheet metal workers national pension fund,the supreme court indicated that this provision erects a general bar to the garnishment of pension benefits from plans covered by the act,d.this court has observed that a principal rationale behind erisa provision is the prohibition of involuntary levies by third party creditors on vested plan benefits.ellis bank of jacksonville irving trust,cir.such a prohibition supports congress primary objective of ensuring through erisa that,if a worker has been promised a defined pension benefit upon if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit he actually receives it.id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting alessi,d.
kickham attempts to avoid the application of d by asserting that the common fund doctrine grants kickham an interest in that portion of the plan benefit funds that it allegedly helped to create or preserve and that,accordingly,the plan participants have no claim to kickham part even assuming,arguendo,that kickham accurately describes the effects of the common fund doctrine,however,kickham purported interest in the funds is insufficient to negate the operation of the provision.as the supreme court said in guidry,d reflects a considered congressional policy choice,a decision to safeguard a stream of income for pensioners even if that decision prevents others from securing relief for the wrongs done them.at.and in united states all funds distributed to weiss,this court explicitly recognized albeit in dicta that even a strong claim of legal or equitable title to undistributed pension funds is not a sufficient basis to avoid the application of d.see,cir.in that case,the court concluded that erisa provision prevented the united states from proceeding in rem to forfeit undistributed pension funds even when these funds were allegedly the proceeds of fraudulent medicare claims.id.at.under the civil forfeiture statute,a ll right,title,and interest in the defendant property vests in the united states upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture,which in weiss occurred at a point prior to the funds deposit into an erisa plan.id.at,first and second alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting f.this court nevertheless concluded,citing guidry,that,until the pension plan funds were distributed to the plan beneficiaries,the government could not have made its forfeiture claim successfully.id.at.
we can discern no meaningful distinction between the claim to undistributed pension funds that kickham asserts and other claims indisputably barred by d.see,guidry,at.concluding that placing constructive trust on pension benefits was prohibited by d ellis bank of jacksonville,at ruling that constructive trust could not be imposed on pension funds,despite party claiming entitlement to the funds under common law principles of equity,state common law of trusts,and state criminal restitution statutes.regardless of how kickham describes the unique facts this case presents,br.for kickham hanley,it can not avoid the statutory protection erisa extends to pension benefits while they are held by the plan administrator.see robbins ex rel.robbins debuono,cir,overruled on other grounds by wojchowski daines,cir.only once the proceeds of the pension plan have been released to the beneficiary hands,can creditors and others pursue claims against the funds and the funds owner s.weiss,at.
nor does kickham point this court to any exceptions to the provision that might apply to its case.naturally,congress may create statutory exceptions to erisa provision,as it has done on occasion.see,united states irving,cir concluding that the mandatory victim restitution act of,a,constituted an exception to erisa provision.no statutory provision even arguably applies to permit kickham claim,however.kickham appeals only to equitable principles underlying the common fund doctrine.but as the supreme court cautioned in guidry,a s a general matter,courts should be loath to announce equitable exceptions to legislative requirements or prohibitions that are unqualified by the statutory text.guidry,at.
in guidry,the supreme court reversed a judgment imposing a constructive trust on the undistributed pension benefits of a union official who had embezzled money from the union,thereby likely injuring the other beneficiaries of the union pension plan.id.at.acknowledging the natural distaste in these circumstances with affording a malefactor access to his benefits,the court nevertheless did not think it appropriate to approve any generalized equitable for employee malfeasance or for criminal erisa prohibition on the assignment or alienation of pension benefits.id.at.such a policy determination was the prerogative of congress.id.
more recently,in martorana board of trustees of steamfitters local union health,welfare pension fund,the third circuit reversed an order providing for the equitable of attorney fees from the plaintiff undistributed pension benefits,imposed to give effect to the district court award of such fees to an erisa plan board of trustees,cir.the third circuit noted that congress amendments to the provision,which permit the of benefits in specific situations,provide no authorization for such a in order to recoup the expenses of defending against frivolous cl
