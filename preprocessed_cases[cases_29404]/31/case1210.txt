before the court are an appeal and from a final judgment in an erisa action in which three employee benefit trust funds collectively the trusts and their trustees sued investment managers for breach of fiduciary duties and related claims.following a bench trial,the district court found that the investment managers,loomis sayles company,llp and loomis sayles company,collectively loomis,had breached duties owed to the california field ironworkers health and welfare trust fund welfare trust but had not breached duties owed to the california field ironworkers annuity trust fund annuity trust or the california field ironworkers pension trust fund pension trust.the district court entered judgment in the amount of based upon its findings in favor of the welfare trust,but declined to award attorney fees or costs to either side.
we have jurisdiction and affirm the district court findings regarding liability and its decision not to award attorney fees or costs.however,we vacate the judgment and remand for recalculation of damages.
background 
the parties agree that the trusts are employee benefit plans within the meaning of erisa and that loomis management of trust funds was governed both by erisa and by the trusts investment guidelines.each trust investment guidelines required that investment managers inform the trustees of significant changes in investment strategy,adhere to the prudence rule,maintain sufficient liquidity to meet current cash needs,and obey the instructions of the trustees.each set of guidelines also contained lists of assets appropriate and inappropriate for investment,which differed slightly with respect to each trust.
in,and,loomis purchased inverse floaters on behalf of all three trusts.a floater is a type of collateralized mortgage obligation cmo,that is,a security backed directly or indirectly by real estate mortgages.unlike a common floater,an inverse floater rate of return moves inversely to market rates,rising when the rate index falls and falling when the rate index rises.when purchased at or below face value par from an appropriate entity,inverse floaters have little credit risk because the investor is likely to recover the entire principal if the securities are held until the date of maturity.however,like the rate of return,the maturation period of inverse floaters is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.when interest rates decline,the mortgages backing the investment are paid off more quickly by refinancing homeowners,thus shortening the maturation period.when interest rates rise,the mortgages are paid off more slowly,thus extending the maturation period.
none of the trusts guidelines explicitly prohibited investment in cmos or,more specifically,in inverse floaters.loomis reported its purchases of inverse floaters to john ebey,an outside consultant hired by the trusts to monitor fund investments.ebey never suggested to loomis or to the trustees that investment in inverse floaters was inappropriate.
in february the trustees hired a new outside consultant,alan biller.at that time interest rates,which had begun rising in,were fairly high,thereby depressing the price of inverse floaters.their price was further depressed by the failure of askin capital management,an investment company which had purchased large quantities of inverse floaters with borrowed funds.
after reviewing the trusts portfolios,biller concluded that inverse floaters were highly risky and recommended that the trustees order the immediate sale of all inverse floaters.biller also recommended that the trustees amend each trust guidelines to prohibit any future investment in inverse floaters.though biller was aware that the immediate sale of the inverse floaters would result in a significant loss of principal because of the depressed market price,he apparently did not consider the alternative of holding them until interest rates came down thus raising the market price of inverse floaters or until the date of maturity,even though the trusts had no immediate need for additional liquidity.
the trusts,acting on biller advice,directed loomis to sell all inverse floaters immediately.loomis did so,and the sale resulted in a loss of approximately million.it is undisputed that the value of inverse floaters began increasing shortly after the sale and that had they been retained the trusts would have experienced a gain on their investments in those securities.
the trusts and the trustees filed suit against loomis in june,asserting breach of fiduciary duties and related claims.following a bench trial,the district court found the following the trusts guidelines did not expressly prohibit investment in inverse floaters the decision to invest in inverse floaters was within loomis discretion loomis adequately researched inverse floaters before investing loomis did not violate fiduciary duties with respect to the annuity and pension trusts and loomis did not breach its duty of loyalty with respect to any of the trusts.
the district court concluded,however,that investment of thirty percent of the welfare trust assets in inverse floaters violated the prudence rule,and it therefore found a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the welfare trust,awarding damages in the amount of.the district court denied the trusts request that loomis be required to disgorge the fees paid by the trusts and also denied the welfare trust request for attorney fees and costs.

discussion 
the trusts contend that the district court erred in failing to find that loomis breached duties owed to all three trusts.loomis contends that the district court erred in finding that loomis breached fiduciary duties owed to the welfare trust.
investment guidelines 
fiduciaries who are responsible for plan investments governed by erisa must comply with the plan written statements of investment policy,insofar as those written statements are consistent with the provisions of erisa.see a.although we have not addressed the issue,at least one other circuit has held that failure to follow written statements of investment policy constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty.see dardaganis grace capital,cir.
the trusts contend that the district court erred in finding that loomis did not violate guidelines requiring loomis to notify the trusts of significant changes in investment strategy and to seek clarification if the guidelines were unclear.while the district court did not make explicit factual findings regarding these precise issues,it did state that the guidelines permitted investment in cmos and that loomis had no obligation to disclose to the trusts the particular risks inherent in inverse floaters before purchasing them.implicit in these statements is a factual finding that loomis did not violate the guidelines notification requirements.this factual finding is not clearly erroneous because it is supported by evidence in the record,including the text of the guidelines themselves and the opinion of loomis expert,who testified that investment in inverse floaters did not represent a significant change in loomis investment strategy.
the trusts also contend that the district court erred in failing to find a breach of fiduciary duties arising out of loomis asserted failure to comply with the conservative spirit of the guidelines.we are unaware of any authority indicating that a failure to comply with the spirit of written investment guidelines constitutes a breach of the duties imposed by a when the actual terms of the written guidelines have been followed.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not err in failing to find a breach of fiduciary duty arising from the asserted violation of the spirit of the guidelines.
prudence rule 
an investment manager of a trust governed by erisa must discharge his or her duties with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man sic acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.this requirement is referred to as the prudence rule.when applying the prudence rule,the primary question is whether the fiduciaries,at the time they engaged in the challenged transactions,employed the appropriate methods to investigate the merits of the investment and to structure the investment.donovan mazzola,cir.
the prudence rule also requires that a fiduciary give appropriate consideration to the role a proposed investment plays in a portfolio as a whole or,where appropriate,that portion of the portfolio as to which the fiduciary has investment duties.see b.appropriate consideration includes 
i a determination by the fiduciary that the particular investment or investment course of action is reasonably designed,as part of the portfolio or,where applicable,that portion of the plan portfolio with respect to which the fiduciary has investment duties,to further the purposes of the plan,taking into consideration the risk of loss and the opportunity for gain or other return associated with the investment or investment course of action,and 
ii consideration of the following factors as they relate to such portion of the portfolio 
a the composition of the portfolio with regard to diversification 
b the liquidity and current return of the portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow requirements of the plan and 
c the projected return of the portfolio relative to the funding objectives of the plan.
applying these standards,the district court determined that loomis adequately investigated the inverse floaters before purchase and gave appropriate consideration to the role the inverse floaters would play in the portfolios of the annuity and pension trusts.however,the district court concluded that because loomis did not give appropriate consideration to the role the inverse floaters would play in the portfolio of the welfare trust,it thus ran afoul of the prudence rule with respect to that trust.
the trusts contend that the district court erred in concluding that loomis adequately investigated the inverse floaters and gave appropriate consideration to the particular needs of the annuity and pension trusts.loomis contends that the district court erred in concluding that loomis failed to give appropriate consideration to the particular needs of the welfare trust.
rahim manji,the loomis portfolio manager assigned to the trusts investments,used the bloomberg financial analysis system to assess the potential investments in inverse floaters.the trusts argued at trial that the bloomberg system was inadequate and presented expert testimony that option adjusted spread oas analysis was the only appropriate method of investigation,but the district court found more persuasive loomis evidence that the bloomberg system was the tool prevalently used in the industry and that only a few portfolio managers were using oas analysis,and it made factual findings to that effect.on the basis of these findings,the district court concluded that loomis acted prudently with respect to its investigation of the potential investments.the district court factual findings regarding industry standards were not clearly erroneous and thus it did not err in concluding that loomis acted prudently with respect to its investigative obligations.
the trusts also argued at trial that manji did not consider the specific needs and characteristics of the individual trusts prior to investing in inverse floaters,presenting expert opinion and other evidence to this effect.however,manji testified that he read and considered each trust guidelines,targeted each trust investments to exceed its respective benchmark and considered each trust needs.loomis also introduced expert testimony that the percentage of assets allocated to inverse floaters was appropriate for each trust,taking into consideration the characteristics of each trust portfolio as a whole.
the district court was persuaded by loomis evidence with respect to the annuity and pension trusts but concluded that manji did not give appropriate consideration to the particular needs of the welfare trust.specifically,the district court found that the investment of thirty per cent of the welfare trust assets in the sensitive inverse floaters of lengthy duration violated the overall conservatism of the welfare trust guidelines,notwithstanding that these were the only guidelines that expressly authorized investment in cmos.the district court went on to find that 
b ased on,among other things,the more conservative nature of the welfare trust investment goals,the relatively higher percentage of that trust assets that were invested in inverse floater sic,and the fact that the welfare trust performed below its benchmark,the degree of investment of trust assets in inverse floaters was imprudent for that trust.
we see no need to disturb the district court findings or conclusions as to whether loomis violated the prudence rule.with respect to the annuity and pension trusts,there is ample evidence in the record to support the district court conclusion that loomis adequately considered the needs of those trusts before investing in inverse floaters.with respect to the welfare trust,the district court ruling was based not upon a determination that manji failed to consider the needs of the welfare trust at all,but rather upon its determination that manji imprudently invested too much of the welfare trust assets in inverse floaters.we find no fault with the district court analysis given evidence that inverse floaters could be highly risky investments,that the welfare trust had very conservative investment guidelines and that nearly one third of the welfare trust total assets were invested in inverse floaters as opposed to the much smaller percentages of annuity and pension trust assets approximately seven percent and five percent,respectively invested in inverse floaters.
duty to disclose 
erisa imposes upon fiduciaries a general duty to disclose facts material to investment issues.see barker american mobil power,cir holding that a fiduciary has an obligation to convey complete and accurate information material to the beneficiary circumstance,even when a beneficiary has not specifically asked for the information.loomis contends that erisa general duty of disclosure is limited to information relating to the provision of benefits or the defrayment of expenses,citing hughes salaried retirees action committee administrator of hughes retirement plan,cir en banc.although the language of hughes arguably limits the broader language of barker,it is not clear that this result was intended.hughes involved a request by participants for specific information the decision does not address barker or its statements regarding the existence of a general duty to disclose facts material to investment issues.
however,we need not resolve this potential conflict in order to decide the present case because,even applying the broader articulation set forth in barker,the district court did not err in concluding that loomis did not breach the duty to disclose.the trusts asserted at trial that loomis failed to disclose a number of material facts,including the decision to purchase inverse floaters and loomis practice of manually pricing inverse floaters.the district court did not make explicit findings regarding all of the asserted facts,but it clearly concluded that none of the asserted facts was sufficiently material to trigger the duty to disclose.we agree.moreover,loomis did disclose many of the facts at issue to ebey,the consultant hired by the trustees to monito
