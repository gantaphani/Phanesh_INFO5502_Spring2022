appellant,john anderson,appeals from the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of bancorp,bancorp middle management change in control severance pay program and the bancorp severance administration committee the committee,with respect to anderson claim for severance benefits under the bancorp middle management change in control severance pay program the plan pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa,a b.the district court found that the committee determination that anderson was discharged for cause from his position of employment with bancorp and thus was not eligible for severance benefits was not an abuse of discretion.we affirm.
the factual setting for the present action is succinctly summarized in this court opinion in a related case,johnson bancorp change in control severance pay program,cir 
around the time of anderson termination,bancorp was involved in a merger with firstar corporation.bancorp,in an effort to retain a number of valued employees in the face of the uncertainty caused by the pending merger,offered certain of them a severance plan the plan providing for severance pay in the event they were terminated as a result of the merger.the plan provided that employees terminated for cause would not receive severance pay under the plan.cause was defined in relevant part as follows 
g ross and willful misconduct during the course of employment including,but not limited to,theft,assault,battery,malicious destruction of property,arson,sabotage,embezzlement,harassment,acts or omissions which violate the employer rules or policies such as breaches of confidentiality,or other conduct which demonstrates a willful or reckless disregard of the interests of the employer or its affiliates circumstances constituting cause shall be determined in the sole discretion of bancorp.
employees who were terminated without cause within months of the merger were eligible for severance payments of up to the equivalent of weeks salary.
anderson was a long time employee of bank,a subsidiary of bancorp,and was a participant in the plan.anderson was employed as a lead financial analyst in the consumer banking and payment services division of bank.his supervisor was mark fields.a separate division of bank,the business line reporting planning division,was headed by kathy ashcraft.ashcraft subordinates included lynn sato,jason albeck,and burcin iz.
in,following the merger,anderson had conversations with iz and albeck hinting that anderson was privy to information as to personnel changes and modification of responsibilities in both the division in which anderson worked and ashcraft division.these comments were reported to ashcraft who became concerned because anderson comments implied that he indeed possessed knowledge of ashcraft confidential,planned personnel changes within her division.ashcraft suspected that such information had been improperly obtained from her individual computer files,specifically an organization chart contained in a folder in the corporate analysis and planning cap drive of the bank document management system.the cap drive of the bank document management system included personal folders for ashcraft and other employees that were labeled with the employee name.under the bank system,such folders were not password protected or otherwise secure and could be accessed by certain other bank employees,including anderson.
ashcraft notified jenny morgan,an employee in the human resources division,who instituted an investigation.the information security department examined ashcraft computer files and was able to determine the last individual to access each of ashcraft personal files.these included john anderson who last accessed the consolidated salary reconciliation file the salary file,nancy johnson who last accessed a performance goals file and other personal files,and,lynn sato,who last accessed ashcraft final merit and incentive file.
on april,morgan called anderson and left a voicemail message advising that she needed to talk to him about the files that had been inappropriately accessed in the ashcraft folder.anderson returned the call later that day.according to morgan handwritten notes of the conversation,when asked if the file had anything to do with anderson normal business and transactions,anderson responded no.when asked why he accessed the file,he responded just tried to see if i could then close sic right away.anderson told morgan that he did not talk to anyone about the information contained in the salary file.morgan notes were transcribed later producing a version of the conversation which included the following 
q does the information that you accessed have anything to do with your normal course of business or anything that you would have needed to access in a project you were working on 
a no,there are other files that are used for what i do,but none of these.the files in the ashcraft folder.
q why did you access this file 
a just tried to see if i could access it.i did and then closed it right away.
q did you this information or talk to anyone about what you accessed 
a no,i did talk to anyone about it.
anderson later told morgan that he would have answered differently if he had known that he was going to be terminated for accessing the document.
ashcraft and morgan concluded that anderson had violated company policies by accessing ashcraft file.bancorp computer and information security policy provides all of your computer access is on a basis and is limited to the information required to perform your job.bancorp confidentiality policy provides the use of any information stemming from your employment shall be restricted to that which is absolutely necessary for the legitimate and proper business purposes of on april,anderson was tendered a notice of termination by morgan,which stated as the basis of the termination you have engaged in unethical conduct by violating bancorp code of conduct.
on june,anderson submitted,through counsel,a letter making a claim for severance benefits alleging that he was wrongfully terminated based on an inadequate investigation by morgan.anderson denied accessing any file containing confidential and proprietary information or that his actions constituted cause as defined in the plan.he stated that he had conversations with employees regarding only well known integration issues.anderson admitted that he had accessed the salary file in the ashcraft folder,but stated that the file was indirectly related to one of his job responsibilities.
the severance administration committee consisted of deeann neri,a senior vice president in the human resources department,edward caillier,a human resources employee and,diane thoromsgaard,a senior manager in the trust division.thoromsgaard was not present at the meeting during which anderson initial claim was denied.
the committee considered anderson attorney letter of june,as a claim for benefits under the plan,and denied anderson claim on august,by letter.the committee concluded that the termination was for cause within the meaning of the plan because anderson access to the salary file in the ashcraft folder was without authorization or a business purpose and anderson had admitted the same anderson disclosed employee information obtained from the accessed file to others in violation of the bancorp confidentiality policy anderson was not truthful in his statements to morgan that he did not disclose accessed information to others and anderson conduct violated policies requiring integrity and proper use of company resources.
anderson appealed the committee decision by letter from his attorney to the committee dated october.in this appeal letter anderson admitted accessing the salary file but stated that he had a business purpose for doing so and denied that the salary file contained individual salary figures.he stated that he made a mistake in initially stating to morgan that he did not need access to the salary file to perform his job duties.anderson also denied disclosing the acquired information to anyone else.
in this letter,anderson requested that the committee provide him with documents including his entire personnel file,documents as to other similarly situated employees who had been terminated or denied severance benefits during the preceding five years,a copy of the salary file accessed by anderson,and documents showing the salary file to be classified.anderson also requested permission to speak to specified bank employees.
anderson supplemented his appeal by way of an additional letter on february,after bancorp provided anderson the opportunity to interview employees.in this letter,anderson submitted to the committee certain factual stipulations which he had elicited from bank.he further submitted argument with respect to the committee findings that anderson had improperly disclosed information,that he had accessed an ashcraft file containing individual salary data,and that anderson accessing the salary file was sufficient cause for termination.
the committee denied anderson appeal by letter dated march.the committee conceded that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that anderson accessed the organizational chart file or that he had shared confidential information,as the committee had previously concluded.however,the committee upheld its finding that anderson was terminated for cause based upon his unauthorized access of the salary file.the committee noted in support of its conclusion anderson statements to morgan that he had no business reason for accessing the file and that he did so simply to see if he could access the file his statement that he would have answered differently if he had known that termination would follow and his inability to describe with specificity the business purpose he claims he had to access the document.
bank employee nancy johnson was also terminated for accessing the ashcraft files without permission and without a business purpose.she brought an erisa action against the committee and prevailed before the district court.on appeal,this court found that the committee reasonably interpreted cause to include knowing and willful violations of bancorp computer security policy and that the committee reasonably exercised its discretion in applying uncertain terms of the plan.johnson,at.the court also held that substantial evidence supported the committee determination that johnson actions in accessing ashcraft files constituted a knowing and willful violation of the computer security policy.id.
anderson brought an action in the district court pursuant to a b,alleging that the committee action constituted an abuse of discretion and a breach of its fiduciary duty.the district court found that the committee had discretionary authority under the terms of the plan and that,accordingly,an abuse of discretion standard applies.applying this standard,the district court concluded that the committee did not abuse its discretion in finding that anderson accessed the computer file in question without permission and without a business purpose.in this regard,the court noted that anderson did not assert that he had a business purpose for accessing the file until his appearance before the committee,despite earlier questioning by morgan.
in light of johnson the district court found that the committee interpretation of the term cause in the plan as including anderson access of ashcraft file,was reasonable.the district court noted that the plan includes as gross or willful misconduct acts or omissions which violate the employer rules or policies such as breaches of confidentiality.accordingly,the district court found that because anderson had violated the computer and information security policy,his termination was for cause,was reasonable and therefore not an abuse of discretion.the district court granted summary judgment for the committee.

as pertinent to this appeal,anderson asserted in the district court a claim for breach of fiduciary duty pursuant to and a claim under a b seeking judicial review of the denial of benefits under the erisa plan.the district court correctly dismissed the breach of fiduciary duty claim as can not independently support a claim of fiduciary duty.section a provides the exclusive causes of action for claims by erisa plan participants and beneficiaries seeking to enforce rights under an erisa plan.sahulka lucent,cir internal citation omitted.

nevertheless,anderson contends that a less deferential standard should have been applied by the district court in this case.
a plan administrator decision will be afforded less deference if a claimant presents material probative evidence demonstrating that a palpable conflict of interest or a serious procedural irregularity existed,which caused a serious breach of the plan administrator fiduciary duty to the claimant.woo deluxe,cir.a plaintiff must also show that the conflict or procedural irregularity has some connection to the substantive decision reached.id.at quoting buttram cent.states,area health welfare fund,cir.
the need to show a serious breach of fiduciary duty presents a considerable hurdle for plaintiffs.barnhart unum life ins.of,cir citations and quotations omitted.in order to prevail the claimant must offer evidence which causes serious doubts as to whether the result reached was the product of an arbitrary decision or the plan administrator whim,at quoting layes mead,cir.
at.when these two tests are satisfied the court will apply a sliding scale approach,under which,the evidence supporting the plan administrator decision must increase in proportion to the seriousness of the conflict or procedural irregularity.id.quoting woo,at.
in this case,anderson argues that both a palpable conflict of interest was present as well as procedural irregularities.anderson asserts that the conflict of interest was.first,a conflict of interest was presented by virtue of the fact that bancorp would pay any severance benefits awarded,thus the fund is self funded,and,second,the committee included employees of the human resources department of bank,the department which had,at the least,approved anderson firing.
we have recognized that when an entity funds a plan and is also the plan administrator there is a rebuttable presumption of a palpable conflict of interest,tillery hoffman enclosures,cir,and,in this case,the committee has not articulated any ameliorating circumstances to rebut this presumption.see schatz mut.of omaha ins,cir.
anderson speculates that since committee members worked in the bank human resources department they would be reluctant to find that no cause existed for anderson termination,an action which was presumably approved by that department,thus creating a conflict of interest.however,we know of no authority which would support anderson contention that a palpable conflict of interest was created by this situation and anderson provides no proof that the relationship had a tangible or perceptible impact upon the impartiality of the members of the committee.we believe that the mere fact of the cited employment relationship is no
