though this combined appeal raises detailed questions of secured transactions and employee benefits law,the issue is easily stated.we must decide how to distribute million in settlement monies claimed by plaintiffs and a secured creditor and what effect,if any,the fund should have upon the defendants.in,star bank,as the secured creditor,claims the settlement fund as proceeds from its loan to the plan.in,appellants are the defendants who continue to object to the form and effect of the settlement we affirm the decision on the issue of proceeds but vacate the court approval of the settlement and remand for further consideration of a possible right to contribution and the overall fairness of the settlement and in light of new supreme court authority.
in,john endres decided to sell his interest in tool manufacturing,an aerospace machine shop that he founded and long managed.after fruitless negotiations with a canadian firm,he agreed to sell his stake in to the company own employees.as part of the transaction,the profit sharing plan was converted into an employee stock ownership plan the esop or the plan,as defined in the employment retirement income security act of.see d.to finance the million purchase,the plan contributed million of its own pension assets and obtained a loan of million from star bank,then known as the first national bank of cincinnati.the bank was secured,among other collateral,by a pledge of shares in,that portion of stock purchased with the loan amount.star bank perfected its interest by taking possession of the shares,which apparently it still retains.
litigation ensued when plaintiffs discovered that the shares they bought were,according to plaintiffs,were essentially worthless at the time of the transaction.plaintiffs,the trustee and beneficiaries of the plan,claim that the million purchase price for the stock was grossly overvalued.plaintiffs note that quality control problems led largest customer,general electric,to significantly reduce its orders.as a result,plaintiffs allege,sales for the last three calendar months of were one half that of the previous year.according to plaintiffs,no independent audit was conducted of financial statements for the fiscal year ending september,though by then the company was operating at a loss from which it never recovered.
plaintiffs assert that they knew none of this.they claim that endres and the officers of kept these operating losses secret while negotiating the buyout.they further claim that star bank,as former trustee of the plan,failed to investigate or bring any action on behalf of the plaintiffs once the losses were discovered.plaintiffs sued endres,star bank,and several former executives for breach of fiduciary duty under erisa.endres,in turn,named as defendants his lawyer,thomas simons,and simons former law firm.
plaintiffs also sued the professional advisors whom the plan retained to structure the transaction.this second set of,the settling defendants consists of william kirkham,who represented the plan during the buyout kirkham firm,lindhorst dreidame and gradison company,a consulting firm that furnished an appraisal of the stock.claiming malpractice and misrepresentation under state law,plaintiffs alleged that these legal and financial advisors failed to represent the plan properly by using incomplete appraisals and financial reports that did not reveal the extent of losses.
here,we need not consider the merits of either the erisa or the malpractice claims.while the former await further proceedings in district court,the latter eventually settled for million.instead,we narrow our focus to the malpractice settlement fund,whose distribution has been stayed until resolution of this appeal.our task is twofold we must decide whether a secured creditor is entitled to the settlement as proceeds of a stock pledge and what effect,if any,the settlement should have upon the litigation between plaintiffs and the remaining defendants.
ii.settlement funds as proceeds 
as secured creditor to the transaction between and the employee benefit plan,star bank took possession of company stock as collateral for its million loan.following plaintiffs settlement of the malpractice claims,star bank claimed an interest in the resulting fund as proceeds of the pledged stock.the district court denied the bank motion for partial summary judgment on this claim,and this appeal followed.star bank argues that the district court misinterpreted both the stock pledge agreement and ohio law,which the parties agreed would govern their transaction.we disagree with the bank and affirm the judgment of the district court.
under erisa,congress sought to protect plan assets by placing narrow restrictions on the types and terms of stock purchase transactions in which plans may engage.see prohibiting certain transactions with benefit plans and outlining stringent exemptions.one such limitation circumscribes the plan assets that may be placed at risk as collateral no person entitled to payment under the exempt loan shall have any right to assets of the esop other than collateral given for the loan,contributions other than contributions of employer securities that are made under an esop to meet its obligations under the loan,and earnings attributable to such collateral and the investment of such contributions.e.star bank and the employee plan expressly incorporated this restriction in their loan agreement,and star bank does not contest its applicability now.accordingly,the bank must fit the settlement fund under one of these three headings for its interest to attach.
star bank briefly argues that the settlement fund can be considered earnings attributable to the stock.this assertion,made without citation or legal support,is not.the term earnings generally describes income obtained from the performance of labor,the provision of services,the sale of goods,or gain from investment.see black law dictionary ed.in other words,earnings flow from deliberate and productive use of resources,not,as is alleged in this case,the malfeasance of others.plaintiffs settlement of their malpractice claims clearly does not constitute earnings on the stock.
in the alternative,star bank argues that the settlement fund constitutes collateral to the loan.although the pledged stock still remains in the bank possession,star bank contends that its interest in the collateral also reaches any traceable proceeds.under the uniform commercial code as adopted in ohio at the time this action was commenced,it is true that an interest secured by collateral continues in any identifiable proceeds of that collateral.ohio b.the question,then,is one of characterization whether the settlement fund constitutes proceeds of the stock subject to a continued security interest.under the version of the statute that governs this case,the term proceeds 
includes whatever is received upon the sale,exchange,collection,or other disposition of collateral or proceeds.insurance payable by reason of loss or damage to the collateral is proceeds,except to the extent that it is payable to a person other than a party to the security agreement.any payments or distributions made with respect to investment property collateral are proceeds.
ohio a emphasis added.in applying this definition to the facts,we observe that the settlement fund can not represent payments or distributions on investment property for the same reason it can not be considered earnings,as discussed.if star bank is to prevail,it must show a disposition of the stock from which plaintiffs received the settlement fund 
a disposition is marked by the parting with,alienation of,or giving up of property.black law dictionary ed.though star bank acknowledges that it still retains possession and ownership of the pledged shares,it maintains that the satisfaction of plaintiffs malpractice claims in settlement represents a disposition of the stock from which the million fund flows as proceeds.in support,it advances the functional concept of proceeds as any economic substitute for a secured asset.under this doctrine of substitution,for example,insurance payments constitute proceeds when collateral is damaged by tortfeasors voluntary sale or exchange by the debtor is not required.see,sicherman falkenberg,holding that payment received from the insuror settlement proceeds represented a continuation of its security interest under ohio law.
we agree with the general proposition that a security interest attaches to assets that replace collateral once damaged or destroyed.however,we disagree with the bank depiction of the settlement as a disposition of stock and the resulting fund as the replacement value of the collateral.simply put,nothing has been replaced.according to the loan agreement,the pledged stock refers only to those shares purchased with the loan,and star bank continues to hold these.the settlement has no bearing on the ownership of or rights to the pledged stock.at most,the fund represents a disposition of potential malpractice liability,not of shares.
in characterizing the settlement as a disposition of collateral,star bank overlooks the causal disconnect between the pledged stock and the malpractice claims.the district court found that the the actions of l d lindhorst dreidame and gradison did not diminish the value of the shares of stock.rather,that stock was effectively worthless when it was purchased and remains so today.mcdannold star bank,d.even if the settling defendants negligently inflated the price of the stock,as plaintiffs allege,they did not diminish its worth,which was already imperiled due to business setbacks.accordingly,the settlement fund compensates plaintiffs for unsound legal and financial advice,not for loss of collateral.on appeal,star bank has not convincingly contested this reasoning other than by claiming inconsistencies in plaintiffs theory of recovery.the bank does not address the essential distinction between an improper valuation of a stock price,as here,and the impairment of its actual market value.
this distinction is important in light of mcgonigle combs,a ninth circuit case star bank advances in support of its claim.cir.in mcgonigle,of a horse breeding operation called spendthrift farms sold million worth of stock in a private placement.when the share price plummeted,investors charged federal and state securities violations as well as common law claims of fraud and misrepresentation.plaintiffs settled their claims against one owner and the appraiser of the broodmares,resulting in a settlement fund of million.because plaintiff casares had borrowed money from central bank to invest in the enterprise,pledging the stock as collateral,the bank sought casares portion of the settlement fund as proceeds of the pledged stock.the court concluded that the bank was entitled to the fund as proceeds,explaining the locus of that loss was in the secured stock,and central bank as security holder is entitled to its lien on the settlement payments that were intended to compensate for that lost value.id.at.
plaintiffs malpractice case here,in contrast,is bottomed on bad advice rather than diminution of stock.here,the locus of the loss was not damage to the collateral but rather common law malpractice the plan was injured not as a purchaser of stock but as a purchaser of professional services.plaintiffs exchanged their malpractice claims for million,leaving unaffected all ownership interest in the pledged stock.we conclude that this fund,not derived from damage to or disposition of collateral,does not constitute proceeds 
iii.the effect of the settlement upon the remaining defendants 
because plaintiffs brought this case as a derivative action on behalf of themselves and all plan participants,they were required to obtain judicial approval of any settlement.see.appellants star bank,endres,and the trustee of the grantor trust in which endres held his shares collectively,the defendants objected to the settlement in two ways.first,they protested the bar order that prevents them from asserting claims against kirkham,lindhorst dreidame,and gradison,the defendants who settled the malpractice suit.the defendants requested a hearing to assess the fairness of the bar order,which they claimed cut off their right to contribution.the district court concluded that no hearing was necessary because the defendants had no right to contribution.second,the defendants argued that their liability should be reduced proportionately,rather than on the pro tanto or basis contained in the agreement.the district court likewise rejected this argument,explaining that a proportionate allocation of liability was contrary to the design of erisa.in sum,the district court concluded that the settlement agreement was fair,reasonable,and adequate as to all parties.mcdannold star bank,no,wl,at,dist.lexis,at ohio june,applying granada investments,dwg,cir explaining the factors to be considered when reviewing the adequacy of a proposed settlement.the court then certified its decision for immediate appeal pursuant to b.
appellants claimed right to contribution 
when,as here,a settlement agreement contains a bar order extinguishing possible legal claims of defendants,the court must conduct an evidentiary fairness hearing to determine whether the settling defendants are paying their fair share of the liability.see,cullen riley in re masters mates pilots pension plan and irap litig,cir t hird party participation in an evidentiary fairness hearing and court approval of the settlement bar are necessary to protect the due process rights of third parties.kovacs ernst young in re jiffy lube sec.litig,cir if the proposed settlement is intended to preclude further litigation by absent persons,due process requires that their interest be adequately represented.quoting manual for complex litigation,at.though agreeing with this rule,the district court found it inapplicable and refused to hold an evidentiary hearing.on this narrow point,we vacate this decision for the reasons that follow.
the district court found no right to contribution under either federal or ohio law.as the appellants have not briefed or otherwise challenged the court ruling under ohio law,we consider their claim to contribution under federal law alone.this is appropriate because the defendants helped structure a transaction that,according to plaintiffs,violated federal law.see donovan robbins,cir where contribution is sought by one who has had to pay damages for violating a federal statute,the scope and limitations of the right of contribution are invariably treated as questions of federal rather than state law.a departure from that principle would be unjustified in the case of erisa fiduciaries.citations omitted.if the appellants can claim a right to contribution question we remand to the district court but do not ourselves right exists because both settling and defendants share common liability under erisa 
at the outset,we note that we are not ruling on an action for contribution against the settling defendants.instead,we are asked to decide whether such a claim even exists.at present,there is a split in the circuit courts as to whether one erisa fiduciary may pursue an action for contribution against another fiduciary.compare chemung canal trust sovran bank maryland,cir recognizing a right to contribution,and free briody,cir same with kim fujikawa,cir disallowing a right to contribution.cogent opinions have been written supporting each view,reasoning from congressional intent,public policy,and traditional trust law.in fact,the instant case presents an even more challenging question as the appellants here would claim a right to contribution against erisa non fiduciaries.yet we do not decide now whether contribution can be claimed from either fiduciaries or nonfiduciaries.the division in authority has not been resolved in this circuit,and this case does not permit us an opportunity to do so.because the parties have yet to litigate their erisa claims,we will not attempt to allocate liability among the defendants due to the significant factual questions that remain.rather,we simply observe that the basis for the district court rejection of the right has been modified by a recent supreme court decision and we remand for reconsideration in light of that authority.
in short,the district court premised its ruling on the absenc
