bruce anderson appeals the district court determination,following a bench trial,that the suburban teamsters of northern illinois pension fund board of trustees the trustees did not abuse their discretion in partially denying his claim for disability benefits pursuant to a plan maintained under the employee retirement income security act erisa.in the past,the plan specified one way to calculate disability benefits.before anderson applied for benefits,the plan was amended to change the formula for calculating benefits depending on the date the employee became disabled.anderson claims the trustees improperly determined the date of his disability,resulting in a lower benefit.anderson claims also that if the trustees appropriately determined the date of his disability,then the amendment violates erisa rule.finally,anderson claims the trustees improperly applied a qualified domestic relations order qdro,allocating half of his disability benefits to his.we affirm.
background 
for much of his life,anderson worked as a mechanic.in july,anderson suffered an knee injury that required surgery.in december,anderson was diagnosed with osteoarthritis.in addition to his bad knee,anderson suffers from degenerative disk disease,carpal tunnel syndrome,tinnitus,depression,and bone spurs in his shoulders.
believing that he might be able to find a job that would allow him to work despite his injury,anderson went to school from to and did not work.he earned a degree in business administration and hoped to work in the computer field.
anderson and his wife divorced in.the qdro entered in the andersons state court divorce proceeding provided that anderson was to receive the actuarial equivalent of fifty percent of anderson accrued pension as of february.the payments to anderson were to begin at her election following the participant attaining his earliest retirement age as defined by the plan.
unable to find a job in the computer field,anderson went back to union employment in.from june to october,he worked days as a truck driver.finding himself unable to continue to perform this work because of his pain,anderson stopped working and has not worked since.in august,anderson applied to the suburban teamsters of northern illinois pension fund the fund for disability benefits under its pension plan the plan.the applicable version of the plan at that time was the plan as amended on january,plan.
the fund is a benefit trust fund.participating employers contribute to the plan pursuant to various collective bargaining agreements.the board of administers the made up of both employer and employee representatives.
the plan provides for several different types of pensions.for example,an employee might be eligible for a normal retirement pension under,an early retirement pension under,a pension under,or a and out pension under.
in addition to these types of pensions,article of the plan provides disability a disability retirement pension for employees who become totally and permanently disabled.the plan defines totally and permanently disabled as follows 
a participant shall be considered totally and permanently disabled only if he suffers from a physical or mental condition which will continue for a long and indeterminate period of time and which will prevent him from pursuing any and all gainful occupations and from performing any work for compensation or benefit during that period of time.
the plan calculates benefits based on benefit credits participants earn during their employment.normally,an employee receives benefit credits only for periods when the employee actually works.however,before the plan was amended in,employees were covered by the version of the plan plan.under the plan,if an employee became disabled,
t he amount of such disability retirement benefit shall be equal to of the amount of age retirement benefit to which the participant would be entitled at his normal retirement age,calculated as if he remained in covered employment continuously from the onset of his total and permanent disability until his normal retirement age,except that with respect to a participant whose disability retirement benefit becomes effective on or after april,each payment prior to his normal retirement age shall be equal to of such age retirement benefit,increasing to of such age retirement benefit at the participant normal retirement age.
plan,emphasis added.thus,the disabled employee was allocated benefit credits for future years even though the employee would not be working.
the plan,in contrast,contains two different ways to calculate a disability benefit.if an employee became disabled prior to may,the employee benefit would be determined using the same calculation described above the employee would receive extra benefit credits for years not actually worked.plan,b.
if,however,an employee became disabled after may,the disability benefit would be equal to of the amount of age retirement benefit to which the participant would be entitled at his normal retirement age,based on benefit credits actually earned.plan,a emphasis added.under this formula,the employee would not receive any extra benefit credits for future years of unemployment due to disability.
anderson claimed he was disabled as of june.the trustees,however,determined that anderson was totally and permanently disabled as of november and partially denied his application.the trustees informed anderson they could not reconcile a disability date prior to november with the fact that you worked for a significant period from june through october.because anderson became disabled after may,the trustees applied a of the plan instead of b.anderson disability benefit was based only on those benefit credits he actually earned while he was working.anderson earned benefit credits before and benefit credits in.based on this number of benefit credits,the trustees found that the amount of anderson disability benefit was per month.this amount consisted of attributable to his employment,and attributable to his employment.
the trustees then applied anderson qdro to divide anderson portion and his portion of his benefits.they split the,which accrued while anderson was married,by fifty percent.anderson was therefore entitled to half of the amount attributable to his employment plus the from his employment,for a total monthly benefit of.
anderson appealed the partial denial of his claim,as well as the qdro reduction,but the trustees came to the same conclusion on appeal.anderson then filed a complaint in the arizona district court.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of the trustees.the court also denied anderson motion for a new trial.anderson timely appealed to this court.
standard of review 
we face first a threshold question what standard of review applies to the trustees determination regarding the date of disability and thus their decision partially to deny anderson application the court will review de novo the district court decision to apply an abuse of discretion standard to the trustees decision.abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc.
when a court reviews an erisa plan administrator decision to grant or deny benefits,de novo is the default standard of review.id.at.however,if the plan grants discretion to the plan administrator to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,the court reviews the administrator decision for an abuse of discretion.id.quotation omitted.
even if a plan grants discretion to the administrator,the standard of review shifts to de novo if the administrator engages in wholesale and flagrant violations of the procedural requirements of erisa,and thus acts in utter disregard of the underlying purpose of the plan as well.id.at that is,de novo review is justified if the administrator decision was so plagued with errors and so far outside the strictures of erisa that we can not say the administrator actually exercised discretion.id.at.most procedural errors do not alter the abuse of discretion standard,but the court should consider such errors when deciding whether the administrator abused its discretion.id.
the parties agree that the plan grants discretion to th
