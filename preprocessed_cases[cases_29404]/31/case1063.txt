andre legras appeals the district court judgment in favor of defendants federal express corporation long term disability plan and aetna life insurance company collectively,aetna.in a letter denying legras application for continued disability benefits,aetna informed legras that he could file an internal appeal of the decision within days.the day period ended on a saturday.although legras mailed his appeal the following monday,aetna denied it as untimely.the district court dismissed legras action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.we reverse.we hold that because the last day of the appeal period fell on a saturday,neither that day nor sunday count in the computation of the days.as legras mailed his notice of appeal on monday,it was timely.this method of counting time is widely recognized and furthers the goals and purposes of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.we therefore adopt it as part of erisa federal common law.
in october,legras seriously injured himself while working as a ramp transport driver for federal express corporation fedex,a job he had held for years.legras suffered a serious back injury that caused severe and sustained pain.subsequent surgeries did not correct the problem.as an employee of fedex,legras was a participant and beneficiary of fedex long term disability plan ltd plan or plan.in may,he began receiving disability benefits under the plan.subsequently,aetna,the plan claims paying administrator,informed legras that his benefits would terminate on may,unless he could establish that his disability qualified as a total disability under the ltd plan.
after legras attempted to make the required showing,aetna sent legras a letter explaining that the evidence he submitted did not establish that he suffered from a total disability.of concern to aetna was legras alleged failure to prove that he could not sit or use his upper extremities for sedentary work.legras received the letter at on april.the letter stated,i f you disagree with the above determination,in whole or in part,you may file a request to appeal this decision within days of receipt of this notice.
the parties agree that the day appeal period expired on october,a saturday.legras mailed his appeal the following monday.on january,aetna denied legras appeal as untimely.legras filed an action in the district court pursuant to,the civil enforcement provision of erisa.after answering the complaint,aetna filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c.aetna argued that legras failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he mailed his appeal after the day period specified in the april,denial letter lapsed.the district court granted the motion and entered judgment in favor of aetna

the federal statute governing claims procedures under erisa requires that in accordance with regulations of the secretary of labor,every employee benefit plan shall afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.the regulation implementing states that a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review is at least days following receipt of a notification of an adverse benefit determination within which to appeal h,h i,h.neither the governing statute,nor the implementing regulation,specify a method of computing time.a.this leaves a number of unresolved ambiguities.for instance,did the days begin on april,the day legras received the notice,or on the following day does the final day end at,or midnight and,as is relevant here,if the final day lands on a weekend or holiday,is the participant permitted to file his appeal on the next business day the widespread understanding that a deadline falling on a saturday,sunday,or holiday extends to the next business day answers this question.
congress,in enacting erisa,has empowered the courts to develop,in light of reason and experience,a body of federal common law governing employee benefit plans.menhorn firestone tire rubber.cir.this federal common law supplement s the explicit provisions and general policies set out in erisa governed by the federal policies at issue.id.at.one of erisa declared policies is to protect the interest of plan participants and to provide adequate safeguards that are desirable in the interests of employees.indeed,we have repeatedly stated that erisa is remedial legislation that should be construed liberally to protect participants in employee benefits plans.mcelwaine west,cir batchelor oak hill med,cir smith cmta iam pension trust,cir.
we have developed erisa federal common law furthering these interests several times before.see,security life ins.of america meyling,cir recognizing under erisa federal common law that a recission remedy exists when an insured makes material false representations about his health schikore bankamerica supplemental ret.plan,cir invoking federal common law to incorporate the mailbox rule into erisa.for example,we adopted the doctrine of reasonable expectations as a principle to apply when interpreting insurance contracts.saltarelli bob baker grp.med.trust,cir.in so holding,we reasoned that protecting the reasonable expectations of insureds appropriately serves the federal policies underlying erisa.id.at.further,express incorporation of the principle elsewhere demonstrated its widespread acceptance and vitality.id.at 
there is nothing novel about the principle we adopt here that when a deadline falls on a weekend,it extends to the following business day.the supreme court recognized this general understanding in.street united states,a power that may be exercised up to and including a given day of the month may generally,when that day happens to be sunday,be exercised on the succeeding day.further,the fifth circuit has stated that this rubric has universal acceptance.armstrong tisch,cir.legras faces the possibility of losing his disability benefits because of a difference in the computation of the time period to pursue an administrative appeal.although the stricter method may be convenient for aetna purposes,it would be contrary to the purposes of erisa to adopt a method that is decidedly protective of plan administrators,not plan participants.
further,that a deadline extends to the next business day when it falls on a saturday,sunday,or holiday is widespread.for example,federal rule of civil procedure rule states that this principle applies to any local rule or court order,or in any statute that does not specify a method of computing time.a we have consistently applied rule when interpreting time periods in various statutory contexts.see,minasyan mukasey,cir addressing the beginning of the period of limitations for filing an asylum application payan aramark mgmt.servs,cir addressing the timeliness of a title vii action after receipt of a letter from the equal employment opportunity commission patterson stewart,cir addressing the appropriate ending of the grace period under the and effective death penalty act of cooper city of ashland,cir per curiam holding that because the last day of oregon statute of limitations in a personal injury suit under ended on the saturday preceding columbus day,the plaintiff could file on the following tuesday hart united states,cir holding that where the last day of the limitations period under the federal tort claims act ended on a saturday,the plaintiff could file on the following monday.additionally,many regulations explicitly incorporate this method for computing time 
incorporating this method into erisa federal common law protects the interests of insureds,thereby effectuating the policy goals of erisa.further,the concept is generally accepted and vital.see saltarelli,at.therefore,we hold that,where the deadline for an internal administrative appeal under an insurance contract falls on a saturday,sunday,or legal holiday,the period continues to run until the next day that is not a saturday,sunday,or legal holiday.
aetna attempts to skirt the issue by minimizing the role that erisa plays in our analysis of this case.it argues that legras appeal was pursuant to the plan not erisa or any erisa regulation.in other words,aetna contends that we should not apply the above method because the day period for appeal is set by contract,rather than by statute or regulation.what aetna overlooks is that the day appeal period is part of erisa mandatory claims processing standards.as noted above,under erisa implementing regulations,the minimum amount of time that must be afforded to a claimant to file an administrative appeal is days.h,h i,h.although the day appeal period is imposed by the plan,the plan is ultimately governed by erisa.any ambiguity in calculating the days should be resolved to further the purposes and goals of erisa.
as support for its position that the ltd plan is a private contractual arrangement and therefore should not be subject to the method we adopt,aetna relies heavily upon a fifth circuit case,jones georgia pacific,cir.in jones,a decedent heirs brought suit when the decedent former employer and life insurance company refused to pay life insurance benefits.id.at.the group plan expired on the decedent birthday,but included an option provision that allowed him to convert the policy to a individual policy within the day period immediately following the date of cessation of coverage,id.if the employee died within days,then he would be covered under the group policy as if he had purchased the new policy.id.at.the decedent died on the day after his birthday without having applied for the individual life insurance policy.id.at.when the insurance company declined to pay the death benefit,his heirs brought suit and argued that,because the day was a sunday,the option period should have continued to monday,the next business day.id.the district court applied rule a provision,and granted summary judgment to the heirs.id.at.reversing,the fifth circuit held that the provision did not apply because the option to convert the group plan to an individual plan was a private contractual agreement.id.at.
jones is distinguishable and does not support aetna argument.first,unlike this case,jones did not interpret a contractual provision that was required by erisa.in fact,the court emphasized that defendants,as offerors of a private option contract,had full control of the length of time during which the power of acceptance shall last.id.at.by contrast,aetna set the appeal period at days to achieve the minimum possible compliance with a statutory and regulatory mandate.in doing so,aetna did not full y control the length of time by which an appeal could be filed.see id.second,the jones court reasoning hinged on its determination that there was no ambiguity in the contractual provision.id.at.in particular,the court explained that t he qualifying phrase immediately following can have no other meaning than the days in their normal and natural sequence,without concern as to the days of the week id.in contrast,aetna april,denial letter contains no such qualifying clause or explanation of how legras should calculate the day appeal period.
finally,aetna warns that applying the method advocated by legras to the calculation of deadlines under erisa claims procedures would create confusion and great administrative burden.specifically,aetna contends that it would put claims processors for plans in the unenviable position of keeping up with all state holidays for all fifty states aetna argument is unpersuasive.the plan administrator is responsible for identifying,and clarifying,applicable due dates in compliance with erisa although we recognize the burden placed on administrators to keep up with state holidays,this burden must be with the clarity and consistency attained by applying the method that we hold applies to calculating the day period within which legras had to mail his notice of appeal.
although the day appeal period specified in the april,denial letter ended on saturday,october,erisa federal common law required that aetna accept legras appeal as timely as he mailed it on the first weekday following the weekend.it was error for aetna and the district court to conclude that legras administrative appeal was untimely.we reverse and remand to the district court with directions to remand to aetna,the plan claims paying administrator,for consideration of legras appeal.
reversed and remanded.
legras had days to appeal an adverse decision from aetna life insurance company aetna,denying him disability benefits under a long term disability plan plan provided by his employer,federal express fedex.he lost his opportunity to appeal as a result of his own conduct he sent his appeal to aetna two days after the appeal period expired.even legras agrees that he sent his appeal two days late.to excuse legras untimeliness,the majority turns a simple case of contract interpretation into an opportunity to without precedent expand federal common law surrounding the employee retirement income security act erisa to rewrite private contracts.i can not go along with them in bailing legras out.
an erisa plan is a contract that we interpret in an ordinary and popular sense as would a person of average intelligence and experience.we look first to the explicit language of the agreement to determine,if possible,the clear intent of the parties harlick blue shield of,cir internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.in general,c ontract terms are to be given their ordinary meaning,and when the terms of a contract are clear,the intent of the parties must be ascertained from the contract itself.klamath water users protective ass patterson,cir.that the parties dispute a contract meaning does not render the contract ambiguous a contract is ambiguous if reasonable people could find its terms susceptible to more than one interpretation.doe aol llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the terms of this contract are not ambiguous.by the plan terms,legras had days to file his appeal with aetna by mail.all parties agree that legras received notice from aetna that his disability claim had been denied on april.it is also undisputed that october,is days from the date of the notice.where is the ambiguity a person of average intelligence and experience would understand days to mean precisely what legras understood it to mean here legras knew that the day period ended on october,our only question whether he should be allowed to extend that time by two days solely because the deadline for the day appeal period happened to be on a saturday.
in other words,legras messed up he failed to abide by his contract and now seeks an excuse to set aside his failure.legras has never offered any reason to explain why he failed to timely appeal.he could have mailed that appeal on any one of days after april,including october.he offers no explanation why he did not.post offices around the nation even in pocatello,idaho are open on saturdays.legras offers no evidence to the contrary and no explanation why he did not send his appeal on that saturday.all legras had to do in order to preserve his rights was mail the appeal within a window.instead,he flatly argues that he does not need to comply with his contract.because the terms of the plan are clear,the district court did not err when it dismissed legras action with prejudice for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.our analysis should end here,with the contract.
to get around the plain terms of the contract,the majority is forced to create federal common law,in light of the erisa regulations applicable to the plan these regulations provide that an employee benefit plan shall establish and maintain a procedure by which a claimant shall have a reasonable opportunity to appeal an adverse benefit determination.h.in order to have a reasonable opportunity,an employee benefit plan must p rovide claimants at least days following receipt of a notification of an adverse benefit determination within which to appeal the determination.h i.
