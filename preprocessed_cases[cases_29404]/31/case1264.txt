unum life insurance company of america unum appeals the district court judgment for plaintiff russann hall.hall filed suit against unum under the employee retirement income security act erisa,because it terminated her disability benefits.unum principal argument is that the district court improperly considered evidence outside of the administrative record relied upon by unum when it terminated hall benefits.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
in,hall injured her left shoulder in a bicycle accident.at the time,she was a regional vice president of sales for nova information systems,incorporated nova,and she was a participant in nova group disability insurance plan.under that plan,she was entitled to benefits from unum if she was disabled and unable to perform the material duties of her regular occupation.appellant app.at.hall injury required multiple surgeries in and,and she was unable to permanently return to her job at nova.in january,unum concluded that hall was disabled and approved the payment of disability benefits to her.in the summer of,a unum employee reviewed hall claim file and began to investigate whether hall remained disabled within the terms of the unum policy.unum offered hall a payment to resolve all claims under the policy,an offer that hall refused.the company then proceeded to reevaluate hall medical condition and whether that condition prevented her from pursuing her occupation the reevaluation included surreptitious video surveillance of hall.based on this reevaluation,unum concluded that hall was no longer disabled because the restrictions on her physical activities did not prevent her from undertaking work as a of sales.on april,unum terminated disability payments to hall,and her subsequent internal appeal was denied in november.
after the termination of disability payments,hall worked for a short time for another corporation as a sales manager but was terminated from that job in.throughout,hall received additional medical treatment due to continuing pain in her left shoulder.a physician diagnosed her condition as thoracic outlet syndrome,a condition in which the nerves to the arm are constricted.in,hall underwent two additional surgeries in an attempt to treat the thoracic outlet syndrome.hall informed unum of the additional medical treatment in june when she sought to have the termination of disability payments reconsidered,but unum was never subsequently informed of the additional surgeries.
hall filed suit against unum in august,alleging that unum had violated erisa by improperly terminating her disability payments.unum moved for judgment on the administrative record in september,arguing in part that the court was limited to considering the materials compiled by unum in the course of its management and termination of hall disability claims.the district court characterized this as a motion for summary judgment and denied it on august,ruling that it would consider evidence beyond the administrative record.a bench trial was held august.the district court entered findings,conclusions,and an order in december,determining that unum had breached its duty to hall under erisa.the court held that unum owed hall benefit payments and that hall was entitled to mandatory injunctive relief for future benefits so long as her disability continues.appellant app.at.in supplemental findings,conclusions,and an order for judgment,the district court ordered that unum pay interest and attorney fees to hall.
unum timely appeals,arguing that the district court erred in allowing admission of evidence outside the administrative record and awarding hall attorney fees.our review is limited to those issues,and thus,we are not asked to address the district court disability decision on the merits.
erisa provides a detailed and comprehensive set of federal regulations governing the provision of benefits to employees by employers,including disability benefits.erisa specifically gives a plan beneficiary the right to federal court review of benefit denials and terminations.see a.however,the statute does not establish the standard of review for such decisions.chambers family health plan,cir.
in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the supreme court established the basic framework for determining the standard of review in erisa cases that challenge the denial or termination of benefits the court held that a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone,at.if discretionary authority exists,then the proper standard of review is abuse of discretion.id.unum does not challenge the district court determination that the de novo standard applies to judicial review of its decision.
however,firestone left open the issue of what evidence may be considered by a federal court in an action under a b when de novo review is required.this circuit,along with the majority of other federal courts of appeals,has held that in reviewing a plan administrator decision for abuse of discretion,the federal courts are limited to the administrative record the materials compiled by the administrator in the course of making his decision.sandoval aetna life cas.ins,cir woolsey marion,cir see also miller united welfare fund,cir compiling cases and stating that m ost circuits have declared that,in reviewing decisions of plan fiduciaries under the arbitrary and capricious standard,district courts may consider only the evidence that the fiduciaries themselves considered.
however,this circuit has never considered the proper evidentiary scope of review in de novo erisa cases,and the courts of appeals are split on this issue.one circuit prohibits the introduction of evidence outside the administrative record in de novo cases.perry simplicity eng g,cir.the sixth circuit reasoning in perry was that 
n othing in the legislative history of erisa suggests that congress intended that federal district courts would function as substitute plan administrators,a role they would inevitably assume if they received and considered evidence not presented to administrators concerning an employee entitlement to benefits.such a procedure would frustrate the goal of prompt resolution of claims by the fiduciary under the erisa scheme.
id.at.the court added that de novo review,in and of itself,did not imply that the reviewing court necessarily had to take additional evidence.id.but see vanderklok provident life accident ins,cir allowing the admission of additional evidence in a de novo case because the plan administrator failed to follow proper procedures in terminating benefits.
the opposite position has been taken by the eleventh circuit,which has held that when conducting a de novo review,any party may be free to submit additional evidence outside the administrative record.moon am.home assurance,cir.the moon court reasoned that,prior to erisa,parties would have been able to submit additional evidence.id.as a result,restricting parties to the administrative record would afford less protection to employees and their beneficiaries than they enjoyed before erisa was enacted,a conclusion that,according to the moon court,would run counter to the supreme court holding in firestone,which was based in part on preserving levels of protection for employees.id.quoting firestone,at.
most circuits have adopted rules somewhere in between these extremes,allowing the admission of additional evidence in de novo cases in limited circumstances.see,defelice am.int l life assurance of,cir allowing the use of extra evidence if the plan administrator has a conflict of interest mongeluzo baxter travenol long term disability benefit plan,cir allowing the use of extra evidence where the plan administrator incorrectly interpreted the plan casey uddeholm,cir allowing a district court to consider additional evidence where the plan administrator has made no factfinding himself farm bureau life ins.moore,cir allowing the admission of extra evidence with regards to plan interpretation by the administrator,but not with regards to the finding of historical facts by the administrator donatelli home ins,cir leaving the question of whether to admit extra evidence to the discretion of the district court where there is good cause to admit additional information in order to provide adequate review quesinberry life ins.of,cir en banc leaving the question of whether to admit extra evidence to the discretion of the district court when it finds that exceptional circumstances have been met and listing some of those circumstances luby teamsters health,welfare pension trust funds,cir stating that the decision to admit additional evidence is within the district court discretion and was permissible in this case because there was no evidentiary record.
the most thorough explication of the intermediate position has been provided by the fourth circuit in quesinberry.that case first notes the multiple purposes of erisa to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries,to provide employees and beneficiaries with at least as much protection as they had enjoyed prior to the enactment of erisa,to provide prompt resolution of claims,and to ensure that district courts are not made into substitute plan administrators.at citations omitted.in the fourth circuit view,the most desirable approach to the proper scope of de novo review under erisa is one which balances these multiple purposes of erisa.id.allowing a district court to exercise its discretion to admit additional evidence in certain circumstances best reconciles these competing purposes.id.
we agree with the fourth circuit that the best way to implement erisa purposes in this context is ordinarily to restrict de novo review to the administrative record,but to allow the district court to supplement that record when circumstances clearly establish that additional evidence is necessary to conduct an adequate de novo review of the benefit decision.id.unless we allow employees the possibility of supplementing the record in such circumstances,we run the risk of providing employees fewer procedural rights than they had prior to the enactment of erisa.see also moon,at.supplementation will also help protect employees substantive rights in those limited circumstances where evidence is relevant and necessary while allowing supplementation in limited circumstances will slightly increase the cost of judicial review and therefore of managing and administering benefit plans,firestone discounted these concerns in establishing the de novo review standard.at.by strictly limiting the circumstances in which supplementary evidence may be presented,the risk of increasing decision of deterring employers from providing pension and benefit plans to their controlled.
finally,allowing the possibility of supplementing the record is appropriate given the variety of erisa cases which are brought to the federal courts.quesinberry,at.some of these cases reach the courts with substantial administrative records because of the plan administrator detailed procedures and for benefit determination decisions.other cases arrive with very limited records.id.erisa cases also may involve plans in which the payor and administrator are one and the same,or different entities,and they may involve complex issues of medicine,law,and plan interpretation.id.given this diversity,providing the district courts with flexibility to admit additional evidence in limited circumstances is appropriate and even necessary in order to address the varied situations in which the administrative record alone may be insufficient to provide proper de novo review.
we emphasize that it is the unusual case in which the district court should allow supplementation of the record.see id.in most cases,where additional evidence is not necessary for adequate review of the benefits decision,the district court should only look at the evidence that was before the plan administrator or trustee at the time of the determination.the party seeking to supplement the record bears the burden of establishing why the district court should exercise its discretion to admit particular evidence by showing how that evidence is necessary to the district court de novo review.
to provide guidance to district courts on this issue we note that the following exceptional circumstances could warrant the admission of additional evidence 
claims that require consideration of complex medical questions or issues regarding the credibility of medical experts the availability of very limited administrative review procedures with little or no evidentiary record the necessity of evidence regarding interpretation of the terms of the plan rather than specific historical facts instances where the payor and the administrator are the same entity and the court is concerned about impartiality claims which would have been insurance contract claims prior to erisa and circumstances in which there is additional evidence that the claimant could not have presented in the administrative process.
id.at.however,district courts are not required to admit additional evidence when these circumstances exist because a court may well conclude that the case can be properly resolved on the administrative record without the need to put the parties to additional delay and expense.id.this list is not exhaustive it is merely a guide for district courts faced with motions to introduce evidence not presented to the plan administrator.id.in considering any such motion,the district court will also need to address why the evidence proffered was not submitted to the plan administrator,and should only admit the additional evidence if the party seeking to introduce it can demonstrate that it could not have been submitted to the plan administrator at the time the challenged decision was made.see,davidson prudential ins.of,cir holding that the district court did not err in refusing to admit evidence because the additional evidence was known or should have been known to plaintiff during the administrative proceedings.conversely,i f the administrative proceedings do not allow for or permit the introduction of the evidence,then its admission may be warranted.quesinberry,at.cumulative or repetitive evidence,or evidence that is simply better evidence than the claimant mustered for the claim review should not be admitted.id.
with these principles in mind,we turn to consider whether the district court appropriately admitted the additional evidence.
during trial,the district court allowed the admission of enormous amounts of testimony and evidentiary materials outside of the administrative record,including depositions,hall medical records,and the testimony of several witnesses.during the hearing on whether to admit additional evidence,the district court made the following observations 
then,there an additional issue.if it de novo,what the scope of the evidentiary record to be relied on by the court and,i tell you my preliminary view of it to assist you in focusing whatever additional argument you wish to make here.it seems to me that the real dispute in the case is what is the plaintiff condition or what it was at the time of the termination of disability benefits.and that,it seems to me,is a factual question and it one where medical opinions can differ.
in fact,this is not in the papers,but certainly i had litigation here before about thoracic outlet syndrome.it,in itself,is a controversial diagnosis.as i say,i going a bit beyond what you submitted here,but i know it to be true that doctors disagree,orthopedic surgeons disagree,and particularly with respect to whether there a surgical approach that can assist such a condition.
but,in my study of the cases,and i realize there some difference among the circuits,but particularly looking at the language of the supreme court in firestone,i think that this is two things.first,this is just because it erisa does make this all that much different from the recovery on an insurance policy and that is whether the defendant insuring company is in accord with the promises of its coverage and that really depends on a factual determination of the plaintiff condition as of the time of termination and now because plaintiff is also seeking here equitabl
