in,empire blue cross and blue shield empire significantly lowered the amount of life insurance provided to retirees are former employees of empire who retired between and.plaintiffs seek to enforce the terms of the life insurance plan provided by empire to its retirees,as those terms existed during their employment with empire.in addition to their claim for injunctive and declaratory relief under a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a,plaintiffs assert claims for monetary relief under erisa for wrongful reduction of benefits,for breach of fiduciary duty,and for failure to provide information summaries in a timely fashion.plaintiffs also assert a claim based on promissory estoppel.
the district court barbara jones,judge rejected plaintiffs claims for relief,principally concluding that the relevant erisa plan documents did not provide plaintiffs with a vested life insurance benefit at the previous level of coverage.byrnes empire blue cross and blue shield,civ.bsj,wl,at.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the relevant plan documents provide them with a vested life insurance benefit in an amount equivalent to their final annual salary.additionally,plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to recover benefits under a theory of promissory estoppel.finally,plaintiffs assert a breach of fiduciary duty claim under erisa a,a.
for the reasons set forth below,we agree with plaintiffs that the relevant plan documents can reasonably be interpreted to provide a vested life insurance benefit.we also agree that summary judgment was inappropriately granted to defendant on the promissory estoppel,breach of fiduciary duty,and penalty claims.we therefore vacate the district court decision granting summary judgment to empire and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
plaintiffs were all employed by empire for various lengths of time,with some plaintiffs having worked at empire for over years.all retired from empire between and.some of these plaintiffs retired pursuant to an early retirement incentive program announced in,known as the voluntary separation opportunity program vsop.others retired pursuant to a similar program offered in,known as the voluntary incentive program vip.the remaining plaintiffs retired pursuant to empire normal retirement program.
throughout plaintiffs employment,empire provided life insurance benefits at no cost to its employees and retirees.these benefits were described by empire in a summary plan description spd distributed to employees prior to 
all graded employees,hired on a basis,after a probationary period become a member of our group life insurance plan,while all executive compensation program are covered upon employment.
in addition,retired employees,after completion of twenty years of permanent service and at least age will be insured.
your life insurance is twice your annual salary,excluding overtime pay.
for eligible retirees,the group life insurance will be reduced on the retirement date and in equal amounts on the next four anniversaries of the retirement date.that is,on the fourth anniversary of the employee retirement,benefits will have been reduce sic of the level for the remainder of their lives sic.
at emphasis added this spd contained no qualification or condition on these benefits,nor did it contain any indication that empire would or could later reduce or eliminate them.
in,empire created and distributed an employee handbook,entitled your handbook,which also included a summary plan description of empire group life insurance benefits.like the earlier plans,this plan provided life insurance benefits to employees at an amount equal to two times the employee annual salary.for retirees,the plan provided that 
if you retire at age or older with or more years of service or at age or older with or more years of service or at any age,with or more years of service,your basic life insurance will be reduced by as of your retirement date,and by an equal amount on each of the next four anniversaries of your retirement date so that of your life insurance coverage remains in force for the rest of your life,at no cost to you.
at.the last sentence on the last page of this document informs employees that o ther important information about their group life insurance plan and its administration can be found in the section entitled benefit administration.at.contained in the benefit administration section is the following statement 
empire blue cross and blue shield maintains the plans for the exclusive benefits sic of its employees.the company expects and intends to continue the plans in your benefits program indefinitely,but reserves its right to end each of the plans,if necessary.the company also reserves its right to amend each of the plans at any time.
at.this reservation of rights appears for the first time in in your handbook.as noted,the earlier plan descriptions contain no similar language.
in,empire implemented the vsop,a voluntary workforce reduction program.in connection with this program,empire distributed materials outlining eligibility and program benefits.participation in this program required eligible employees to voluntarily resign from empire in exchange for certain benefits.at.these certain benefits included life insurance coverage,on substantially the same terms as provided in the earlier plans.while the vsop description of health insurance benefits included an explicit reservation of empire right to adjust coverage,the description of life insurance benefits did not.in the administration section of these materials,however,empire reserve d the right to amend terminate the vso program at any time for any purpose.at.this section also warned that empire may or may not adopt new or modified programs or benefits or take other actions in the future that,depending on your individual circumstances,may be more or less advantageous to you than the current program.id.
in,empire offered the vip,another early retirement incentive program similar to the vsop.a document distributed in connection with this program informed employees that y our insurance benefits may be extended to you for your lifetime,depending on your age and years of service.you will be eligible for retiree insurance benefits if you normally qualify or if you would qualify by adding five years to your age and five years to your service under the vip.at.the vip provided for life insurance benefits virtually identical to those described in earlier plans that is,benefits were reduced by on retirement and for four subsequent years,until reaching one annual salary.like the vsop materials,the vip healthcare insurance description contained a reservation of rights,but the description of life insurance benefits did not.the vip administration section included the following language 
empire reserves the right to amend withdraw the vip at any time for any purpose with respect to any employee,up to the date on which that employee resignation and general release and covenant not to sue becomes effective.empire also reserves the right to announce new and different plans and programs as business needs require.
in late,because of financial difficulties and in an effort to remake itself as a corporation in the managed care environment and remain economically competitive,empire reviewed its benefits plans.on june,empire announced that the board of directors voted to adopt a number of new benefit provisions for current employees and retirees effective january.at.these new benefits provisions affected individuals who retired from empire after january,and before june.among the changes instituted by empire was a reduction in life insurance coverage to a flat.
many retirees wrote to empire,demanding an explanation for this reduction in benefits and to obtain more information about empire process.in response,empire informed these retirees that the reduction was necessary for empire financial health and that empire had clearly reserve d the right to modify or reduce benefits in its sole discretion.at.
in late and early,two groups of retirees filed suit in the southern district of new york,asserting several erisa claims as well as a claim of promissory estoppel.in june,these cases were consolidated for all purposes.essentially,these retirees claimed that the employee handbooks distributed prior to contain promises of lifetime life insurance benefits in an amount equal to their annual salary.
upon for summary judgment,the district court rejected plaintiffs claim for benefits.first,the district court concluded that the relevant plan documents were either the your handbook,the vsop documents,or the vip documents,depending on each plaintiffs retirement program.byrnes,wl,at.according to the district court,because each of these documents contained unambiguous reservation of rights clause s,plaintiffs rights had not vested and empire was free as a matter of law to reduce plaintiffs retiree life insurance benefit to.id.at.the district court similarly rejected plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty and penalty claims under erisa,concluding that empire had acted in accordance with and had properly provided its employees with the relevant plan documents.id.at.the district court also granted summary judgment to empire on plaintiffs promissory estoppel claim,holding that plaintiffs had failed to allege the extraordinary circumstances necessary to state a claim of promissory estoppel under erisa.id.at.judgment was entered for the defendant,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs contend on appeal that the spds contained a promise of lifetime life insurance benefits at the annual salary level and that these benefits vested in the plaintiffs when they qualified for retirement by attaining age and completing at least twenty years of service.additionally,plaintiffs contend that the doctrine of promissory estoppel bars empire from unilaterally reducing the life insurance benefits.finally,plaintiffs assert that empire breached its fiduciary duty by providing them with false and misleading plan information.
we review the grant of a summary judgment motion de novo,and reversal is required if there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.schonholz long island jewish med,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
contractual vesting 
plaintiffs claim under erisa a b,a b,which permits a civil action by a plan participant to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.essentially,plaintiffs assert under this section a contractual right under a benefit plan.strom goldman,sachs,cir.
erisa does not create any substantive entitlement to health benefits or any other kind of welfare benefits.employers or other plan sponsors are generally free under erisa,for any reason at any time,to adopt,modify,or terminate welfare plans.schoonejongen,d see also joyce,cir stating the general rule that under erisa an employer welfare plan is not vested and that an employer has the right to terminate or unilaterally amend the plan at any time i f a plan document unambiguously indicates whether retiree benefits are vested,the unambiguous language should be enforced.am.fed of grain millers,int l multifoods,cir multifoods.thus,even though empire is generally free to modify its life insurance plan,if empire promised vested benefits,those benefits will be enforced.
to ascertain if empire made such a promise,we must examine the relevant erisa plan documents.plaintiffs urge us to review the spds distributed by empire,which empire concedes contained no reservation of rights to modify the benefits and which,plaintiffs argue,evince empire intent to vest lifetime life insurance benefits upon their eligibility for retirement.both spds include language indicating that life insurance coverage after retirement would remain at a level equivalent to plaintiffs annual salaries for the remainder of their lives.
the district court concluded that this language did not express an intent to vest in the plaintiffs a retiree life insurance benefit before they retired.byrnes,wl,at.without such clear and express language,the district court reasoned,the only reasonable interpretation of the spds was that life insurance benefits would be vested only if plaintiffs retired prior to,when empire issued your handbook which included an express reservation of rights clause.id.
in reaching its conclusion,the district court relied on wise el paso natural gas,cir.we understand the district court temptation to rely on the fifth circuit decision in wise as it presents facts similar to those presented here.in wise,the issued spds that described healthcare benefits for retirees but failed to include any express reservation of the right to amend or terminate the plan benefit provisions.id.at.when the defendant realized this failure,it issued new spds which la id the groundwork for future changes by including a reservation clause.id.at.shortly after issuing these new spds,the defendant announced the termination of healthcare benefits for those retiring after a certain date.id.the fifth circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the employer,reasoning that it had not contractually vested its employees with free lifetime healthcare coverage because s uch commitments must be found in the plan documents and must be stated in clear and express language.id.at emphasis added.wise explained further 
aside from the fact that the underlying documents and the later spds did place employees on firm notice of the coming change,we find no reason or authority to conclude that silence in the spds is somehow tantamount to an affirmative contractual commitment and that el paso earlier spds impliedly cede the right to later amend or discontinue coverage.while clear and unambiguous statements in the summary plan description are binding,the same is not true of silence.there is nothing in the way of context,inference,or presumption to persuade us otherwise.contractual vesting is a narrow doctrine.to prevail,plaintiffs must assert strong prohibitory or granting language mere silence is not of itself abrogation.
notwithstanding these similarities,the district court erred in relying on the standard for contractual vesting set forth in wise.wise requires a plaintiff opposing summary judgment to show a promise that is clear and express and to show precise language denying the right to withdraw benefits.id.at.we take a different view 
in this circuit,to reach a trier of fact,an employee does not have to point to unambiguous language to support a claim.it is enough to point to written language capable of reasonably being interpreted as creating a promise on the part of the employer to vest the recipient benefits.
multifoods,at quoting schonholz,at.our standard permits a plaintiff to get to a trier of fact based on ambiguous plan language,while the wise standard requires clear and unambiguous language.
we have rejected wise twice before.in schonholz,we concluded that the plaintiff was not required to point to unambiguous language to support her claim and criticized the district court for holding that an employer commitment to vest benefits must be in precise language denying the right to withdraw benefits.schonholz,at quoting schonholz long island jewish med,which in turn quoted wise,at.in multifoods,we described a circuit split as to the summary judgment rules for contractual vesting,noting that wise was among those requiring clear and express language.multifoods,at.after noting the circuit split,we emphasized that,in this circuit,a plaintiff need only point to written language capable of reasonably being interpreted as creating a promise to survive an employer summary judgment motion.id.quoting schonholz,at.
under our standard,then,the plaintiffs here must first identify specific written language that is reasonably susceptible to interpretation as a promise.joyce,at.plaintiffs direct our attention to two sentences within the spds.the first provides that retired employees,after completion of twenty years of permanent service and at least age will be insured.at emphasis added.we believe that this statement can be reasonably read as promising such insurance so long as employees retire after age and have provided permanent service to empire for at least twenty years.this provision can be construed as an offer that specifies performance as the means of referred to as an offer for a unilateral promises lifetime life insurance benefits upon performance therefore,by performing that is,working for at least twenty years until attaining the age of,the plaintiffs accepted this offer.restatement second of contracts.where the offeror did not explicitly reserve the power to revoke,such an offer can not be revoked once the offeree has begun to perform.see id.cmt.d the beginning of performance completes the manifestation of mutual assent and furnishes consideration.therefore,empire reliance on its spd,your handbook,for its reservation of the right to modify the life insurance benefits is unavailing.we reject empire argument because after the plaintiffs began performance,pursuant to the spds,empire was not free to revoke 
the second statement contained in the spds which plaintiffs invoke provides that life insurance benefits will remain at the annual salary level for the remainder of their lives.at emphasis added.such lifetime language,we believe,is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether empire promised to vest retiree life insurance benefits at the stated level.see bidlack wheelabrator,cir en banc posner,allowing case to go to jury based on written language stating that both you and your spouse will be covered for the remainder of your lives joyce,at rejecting contractual vesting argument where document did not include language that affirmatively operates to create the promise of vesting but noting that a promise of benefits for one lifetime gives rise to a triable fact issue,citing bidlack,at multifoods,at finding that no vesting where statements simply indicate who would pay the costs of the plan but in no way indicate that multifoods would continue to pay the cost of the plan for the retirees lifetime.
applying the proper standard to these two statements contained in the spds,we conclude that they are indeed capable of reasonably being interpreted as creating a promise to vest lifetime life insurance benefits in those employees eligible for retirement.because of the ambiguity of the language,the ultimate determination of whether empire promised lifetime benefits should be left to a trier of fact,likely assisted by extrinsic evidence to clarify the meaning of this ambiguous language.see bidlack,at allowing parties to present extrinsic evidence to disambiguate a collective bargaining agreement health benefits provisions 
promissory estoppel 
p rinciples of estoppel can apply in erisa cases under extraordinary circumstances.schonholz,at.a plaintiff must satisfy four elements to succeed on a claim of promissory estoppel a promise,reliance on the promise,injury caused by the reliance,and an injustice if the promise is not enforced.aramony united way replacement benefit plan,cir quoting schonholz,at.additionally,an erisa plaintiff must adduce not only facts sufficient to support the four basic elements of promissory estoppel,but facts sufficient to satisfy an extraordinary circumstances requirement as well.aramony,at quoting devlin transp.comms.int l union,cir.schonholz provides an example of such extraordinary circumstances,where the employer used promised severance benefits to induce the plaintiff to retire.schonholz,at.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by holding that t o satisfy the extraordinary circumstances requirement,a plaintiff must demonstrate a promise that the defendant reasonably should have expected to induce action or forbearance on the plaintiff part.byrnes,wl,at.in schonholz,we stated that we require,for purposes of erisa,that plaintiff demonstrate a promise that defendant reasonably should have expected to induce action or forbearance on her part.schonholz,at.we did not,however,explicitly define extraordinary circumstances or limit it to circumstances of inducement.in devlin,we noted that the remarkable consideration in schonholz was the defendants use of promised severance benefits as an inducement to persuade shonholz to retire and concluded that such circumstances were absent in that case,because the plaintiffs in devlin could not demonstrate such inducement.devlin,at.because we conclude that plaintiffs here have demonstrated sufficient facts supporting intentional inducement to avoid summary judgment,we need not decide whether extraordinary circumstances other than intentional inducement would suffice.
to succeed on this claim,then,plaintiffs must,in addition to the four basic elements of promissory estoppel,point to circumstances beyond the ordinary.aramony,at.in this vein,plaintiffs contend that the injustice suffered by them due to empire reduction in life insurance benefits is such an extraordinary circumstance.but injustice is one of the four basic elements of the claim,and therefore does not rise to the level of extraordinary.devlin,at r eliance is one of the four basic elements of promissory estoppel,and would not by itself render this case extraordinary.
plaintiffs also contend that they were induced by empire to work for over twenty and up to forty years in order to receive inter alia a particular level of life insurance coverage,and that empire acted with the intent to induce by distributing literature guaranteeing lifetime benefits at no cost.appellants br.at.the district court rejected this contention and noted if courts were to consider it extraordinary every time an employee chose a job based in part on the quality of an employer benefits package,the requirement of extraordinary circumstances would lose all meaning.byrnes,wl,at.
contrary to the district court conclusion,we believe that plaintiffs have demonstrated more than mere acceptance of employment at empire in exchange for these benefits instead,they have dedicated much of their working lives to empire.edwin werner,empire former chief executive officer,stated in his deposition that empire probably would never be able to compete with some of the companies out in the world who were competing for the same employees i n order to compensate for the fact that empire might not be able to compete with some organizations that would like the same employees that we would like,we needed to treat our employees well.our fringe benefit program needed to be respectable at.from these and similar statements describing empire promise of lifetime life insurance benefits for retirees,a trier of fact could reasonably conclude that empire intentionally promised lifetime life insurance benefits to lure and retain employees away from other firms paying higher salaries and then denied those benefits after the employees were of an age where they could neither make up the salary difference or obtain alternative benefits at a reasonable cost.if so found,we believe that such a practice constitutes extraordinary circumstances sufficient to support plaintiffs promissory estoppel claim.because we find that there are genuine issues of material facts with respect to plaintiffs promissory estoppel claim,we vacate the grant of summary judgment to the defendants on that claim.
breach of fiduciary duty under erisa 
plaintiffs contend that empire breached its fiduciary duties,as outlined in erisa a a,b,and d,providing that 
a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and b with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims and d in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter iii of this chapter.
a.plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claims under erisa a a b are based on empire communications concerning their life insurance benefits.specifically,plaintiffs focus on the ret
