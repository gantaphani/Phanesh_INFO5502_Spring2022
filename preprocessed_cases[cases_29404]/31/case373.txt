opinion of the court 
the appellants hereafter employees,members of the teamsters union,filed suit against teamsters local pension fund,under the employee retirement income security act erisa of,stat,et,claiming the pension fund violated its fiduciary duty to them by failing to disclose a proposed change in benefits prior to their retirement.after determining that the pension fund was not seriously considering the change in plan benefits when the employees inquired about that possibility,the district court entered summary judgment for the pension fund.mushalla teamsters local pension fund,d.
in this appeal,the employees argue that the district court erred as a matter of law in its application and interpretation of the serious consideration test we enunciated in fischer philadelphia electric,cir fischer ii,and that genuine issues of material fact are still in dispute.in addition,the employees assert that because the pension fund was a multiemployer fund,it had a greater duty to disclose proposed changes than a fund administered by a single employer.
background 
appellants russell mushalla,edward szwast paul fritzinger,luis garcia,charles fritz,francisco corral and walter boris,collectively,the employees retired voluntarily from wakefern food corporation,the merchandising and distribution arm of shoprite,between december,and january.each had been employed at wakefern for over thirty years.all of the employees participated in the teamsters local pension fund the fund,a multiemployer fund administered jointly by the teamsters local union the union and management representatives from wakefern and other participating employers.the fund is managed by five trustees appointed by the union and five trustees selected by participating employers.individual employers contribute to the fund at rates governed by collective bargaining agreements with the union.
the fund does not apportion benefits based on the individual amount contributed by any individual employee.instead,the fund distributes monthly retirement benefits by a formula based on the number of years the employee worked for a participating employer years of service multiplied by the rate of contribution.at the time the employees retired,the fund capped the years of service used in calculating pension benefits at thirty years.in other words,employees received no credit for any year of service above thirty years in the calculation of their pension benefits.following the employees retirement,the fund announced that effective april,retirement benefits would be calculated based on years of service up to years.all of the employees are currently receiving benefits with their years of service capped at thirty.
the fund began revising its benefit scheme in april,when it retained thomas hart,a legal consultant,to redraft the terms of the fund plan the plan to take into account changes made to the internal revenue code and other laws.after reviewing the plan and interviewing fund representatives,hart began drafting a restated plan,which he worked on through october and november.he did not discuss changing or revising the cap on years of service with anyone related to the fund during that time.
the union business agent,joseph tramontana,who also served as a trustee of the fund,first raised the idea of increasing the cap on years of service.tramontana,who was concerned that the union was losing too many of its senior members,concluded that one way to retain senior members would be to increase their pension benefits to reflect years of service beyond thirty years.in early november,tramontana asked the fund actuary,stanley weisleder,to perform a preliminary check into whether the fund could afford to increase the maximum cap on years of service.tramontana did not propose a specific number of years,and he did not discuss his idea with anyone else at that time.on november,weisleder performed an analysis of the potential impact on the fund if the cap on years of service were increased to years.
at the end of november,weisleder advised tramontana and the plan consultant,anthony miranda,that the fund could not afford to increase the maximum cap to years.weisleder suggested that the fund could probably afford a smaller increase in the cap to approximately years,although he noted that he would need to perform an actuarial analysis for such an increase.
on december,hart completed a draft of the restated plan,which he distributed to the plan advisors.that draft contained no increase to the cap on years of service.after tramontana reviewed the december draft,he spoke to miranda,hart,and the fund attorney,andrew zazzali,about increasing the cap on years of service to years.they told him that any increase in the cap would have to be approved by the fund actuary and the trustees.tramontana responded that he would like to see the cap increase added to the proposed revised plan so that we could at least get the ball rolling on having it reviewed.app.at.
the union held a general membership meeting on december.mushalla was the only appellant to attend.at the meeting,tramontana reported that the fund was considering an increase in the cap on years of service.tramontana also advised the membership that a possible buyout of about pathmark employees was under consideration.mushalla left the meeting with the misunderstanding that the change in the cap on years of service was applicable only to pathmark employees.
on december,miranda and weisleder asked hart to increase the cap in the restated plan to years.hart did so,and reviewed the various changes in the restated plan with the trustees at their scheduled meeting the next day,december.hart informed the trustees that no cost study or actuarial analysis had been performed of the proposed increase to the cap.the trustees responded by directing weisleder and zazzali to review the proposed increase in the cap to determine whether the change was feasible.weisleder was instructed to report his findings to the trustees before their next scheduled meeting on january.the minutes reflect that the trustees approved the restated plan contingent upon the reviews of the fund professionals and trustees.app.at.
meanwhile,mushalla asked daniel mariano,a union business agent and fund trustee,on a few occasions whether any increases in fund benefits were being considered.on each occasion,the last one being december,mariano told mushalla that no increases were under consideration.szwast,fritzinger,garcia and boris all questioned either mushalla or mariano sometime in about a possible pension increase.all were told that no pension increases were under consideration.fritz relied on fritzinger,his,for the same information.corral never questioned anyone with the fund or the union about pension benefits before he retired 
in january,weisleder performed the actuarial analysis and informed miranda and tramontana that it was financially feasible for the fund to increase the cap to years.at their scheduled january meeting,weisleder informed the trustees of his finding.after accepting weisleder actuarial analysis,the trustees began to discuss how to obtain irs approval for the change,what type of notice would be necessary,and when notice had to be given to participants about the proposed change.hart advised them that the fund was required to provide at least sixty days notice of any proposed change in pension benefits.app.at.the trustees voted unanimously to approve the increase in the maximum cap on years of service to years effective april.on february,the plan administrator sent a letter to all plan participants informing them of the increase in the cap on years of service and the effective date of april.
on july,the employees filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey claiming that the fund had violated its fiduciary duty under erisa.on may,the fund moved for summary judgment.following oral argument,the district court concluded that the fund did not violate its fiduciary duty to the employees by failing to inform them of the proposed change to the pension benefits.the district court also determined the fund had no duty to communicate the proposed cap increase in response to the employees inquiries prior to january,when the fund first seriously considered the increase in the cap.on that basis,the district court granted the fund motion for summary judgment and dismissed the employees complaint.this appeal timely followed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to e f,and this court enjoys jurisdiction under.the parties agree that this court exercises plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment and that we should affirm summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.walling brady,cir quoting smith hartford ins.group,cir see also.c we review the facts in the light most favorable to the employees,the party against whom judgment was entered.whetzel,cir.
in enacting erisa,congress sought to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries by establishing standards of conduct,responsibility,and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans,and by providing for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.b.in this appeal,the employees contend that the fund violated its fiduciary duty to them by failing to advise them of the proposed increase in the cap on years of service in response to their inquiries.a plan administrator breaches its fiduciary duty under erisa if it materially misleads employees who inquire regarding possible changes in a plan.fischer phila,cir fischer ii.a plan administrator makes a material misrepresentation when it responds to employee inquiries by representing it is not considering a change to its pension plan,if it is in fact giving serious consideration to a change.id.
the employees argue that even if the fund was not seriously considering a change to the plan at the time they made their inquiries,the fund was obligated to inform them of the proposed change.the employees assert that because the fund is a,multiemployer plan,the serious consideration test this court enunciated in fischer ii does not apply to it.essentially,the employees invite this court to create a new line of authority,paralleling fischer ii but setting a lower standard than the serious consideration test to take into account the differences between multiemployer and single employer plan administration.
the employees maintain that this court created the serious consideration test in fischer ii to strike a balance between an employee right to information and an employer need to operate a business.br.of appellants at.although the employees accept that fischer ii is good law,they assert that the underlying tension noted in fischer ii is simply inapposite to a multiemployer plan,because t he corporate profit motive simply does not exist herein.id.thus,the employees contend the fischer ii serious consideration test should not apply to multiemployer pension plans because for multiemployer pension plans there is no need to strike a balance between an employee right to information and an employer need to operate a business,given that companies must develop strategies and evaluate options as they prepare for decisions.id.
the district court rejected the employees argument that fischer ii should apply differently to multiemployer plans than to single employer plans.the district court concluded that this court decision in walling brady,cir,controlled.mushalla,d at.the district court stated that the trial court in walling had based its decision largely on the same distinction between multi and plans that plaintiffs ask this court to make here.the court of appeals reversed,finding no material difference in the administration of single and plans.id.alteration in original quoting walling,at.
unlike this case,where the duties of plan administrators in communicating changes in benefits to plan participants are at issue,walling considered the fiduciary duty of plan administrators toward plan participants when the administrator amends the plan.in other words,walling concerned the duties of administrators in making changes to a plan,while this case concerns the duties of the administrator to communicate that change to employees.
nonetheless,the conclusion in walling that absent some material difference in administration there is no distinction between single employer and multiemployer plans is directly pertinent.congress clearly contemplated that an employer could choose between administering its own pension plan and conjoining its efforts with other employers.see,b using the term plan sponsor rather than employer,and thereby encompassing a plan established or maintained by two or more employers or jointly by one or more employers and one or more employee organizations a directing that other erisa sections be applied as if all employees of each of the employers were employed by a single employer.as we held in walling,where there is no material difference between the way a multiemployer plan and a single employer plan are administered,the simple fact that the plan at issue is a multiemployer plan is insufficient to alter the fiduciary duties of the administrator.walling,at.
even if walling did not persuade us to reject the proffered distinction between the fiduciary duties of administrators of multiemployer and single employer plans for this purpose,our decision in fischer ii compels the application of the serious consideration test to multiemployer funds.the district court determined that the trustees of a multiemployer pension fund have the same need to be able to freely consider changes to the pension plan as individual employers.mushalla,d at.the court noted that t he serious consideration test protects beneficiaries by ensuring that they are not deluged with information,while a contrary rule requiring earlier disclosure,could discourag e employers from considering proposals to amend plans.id.the district court concluded,the policy reasons undergirding fis c her ii are equally applicable in this case.id.
we agree with the district court.although fischer ii came to us in the posture of an early retirement plan offered by a single employer,the policies we noted in that case apply with equal force to a,multiemployer fund.most importantly,we noted in fischer ii that erisa does not impose a duty of clairvoyance on fiduciaries.an erisa fiduciary is under no obligation to offer precise predictions about future changes to its plan.rather,its obligation is to answer participants questions forthrightly,a duty that does not require the fiduciary to disclose its internal deliberations.at citations and quotations omitted in original quoting fischer phila,cir fischer i.this is in keeping with o ther courts of appeals,which have likewise emphasized the absence of any duty of clairvoyance,as well as the fact that disclosure does not extend to internal deliberations.id.citing swinney motors,cir mullins pfizer,cir drennan motors,cir barnes lacy,cir berlin.bell,cir.
we also observed in fischer ii that although employees benefit from having pertinent information in making their employment decisions,requiring disclosure of every potential plan change 
could result in an avalanche of notices and disclosures.for employees at a company which regularly reviews its benefits plans,truly material information could easily be missed if the flow of information was too great.the warning that a change in benefits was under serious consideration would become meaningless if cried too often.
id.the employees have failed to so much as speculate how employees who participate in plans would be more adept at negotiating an avalanche of notices and disclosures than employees who work for companies that manage their own pension plans individually.
further,we recognized in fischer ii that e very business must develop strategies,gather information,evaluate options,and make decisions.full disclosure of each step in this process is a practical impossibility.at.the administrators of a,multiemployer plan are in no better position than an individual employer in overcoming the practical difficulties referred to in fischer ii.we know of no authority that suggests that pla
