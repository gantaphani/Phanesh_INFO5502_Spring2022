this case concerns an action by the secretary of labor the secretary against james doyle,cynthia holloway,and others,arising from their alleged breach of fiduciary duties to the professional industrial trade workers union pitwu health welfare fund fund,a health benefit plan governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for doyle and holloway.the secretary appeals the district court judgment,contending that the district court failed to adequately address its breach of fiduciary duty arguments and to consider whether the defendants were responsible for diversion of plan assets held by the fund for the reasons that follow,we will vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for additional factual findings.
background 
procedural history 
in april,the secretary brought this action for breach of fiduciary duty against holloway,doyle,the pitwu fund,and two other defendants,michael garnett and mark maccariella.the secretary complaint alleged that pitwu had established a health benefit plan that was a welfare arrangement mewa governed by erisa.two companies,privileged care,pci and northpoint peo northpoint or np,enabled small businesses to obtain health benefits for their employees by enrolling the employees in the fund,even though the employees never joined the union.privileged care marketing group pcmg marketed this scheme to small businesses.businesses that chose to enroll their employees in the fund were required to make benefit payments to pcmg.pcmg retained a portion of the payments as compensation and remitted the balance to pci and np.pci and np also retained a substantial portion of the payments as compensation and remitted the remainder to claims administrators established by the fund.the complaint alleged that these payments were assets of the fund improperly diverted by pci,np,and pcmg and that pci,np and pcmg were required by erisa to use the assets only for the purpose of defraying reasonable plan expenses for the benefit of plan participants.
the complaint alleged that garnett and maccariella at various times owned and operated pci and northpoint and were fiduciaries under erisa because the payments they received from their business clients were assets of the fund under their control.garnett and maccariella allegedly breached their fiduciary duties to the fund by using assets of the fund for purposes other than defraying reasonable plan expenses for the benefit of plan participants.the complaint similarly alleged that doyle had owned and operated pcmg and that he was a fiduciary because he exercised discretionary control over payments that were assets of the fund.it further alleged that doyle had breached his fiduciary duties to the fund by improperly using plan assets for his own benefit.finally,the complaint alleged that holloway was a named trustee of the fund,had breached her fiduciary duties to the fund,and was liable both directly and as a for failing to detect and prevent the diversion of fund assets by garnett,maccariella,and doyle.the complaint sought restitution of losses to the plan,a permanent injunction against any of the defendants serving as a fiduciary or service provider to an erisa plan,appointment of an independent fiduciary to manage the fund,an accounting,costs,and other appropriate equitable relief.
after extensive discovery,the case proceeded to a bench trial in october.solis doyle,wl june.at the beginning of the trial,maccariella accepted a consent judgment enjoining him from serving as fiduciary or service provider to an erisa plan and requiring him to pay.a default judgment was entered against garnett at the close of trial because he failed to appear at trial d espite numerous continuances granted at his request.
b.the district court findings 
the district court made the following factual findings based on the bench trial.in,david weinstein established pitwu.holloway owned and operated employers depot,edi,a professional employer organization peo that she had established in at some point in,she learned of pitwu from a health insurance broker.an attorney,neil goldstein,who later became counsel to the fund,provided holloway with verification of pitwu union status.on may,holloway and three other trustees established the pitwu fund by an agreement and declaration of trust.the fund initially had two employer members,edi and employers consortium,eci.the edi and eci employees were enrolled as participants in the fund.the trust agreement obligated edi and eci to make regular contributions to the fund for each of their employees covered by the fund.the fund made annual filings with the federal government,had trustees,counsel,an actuary,and claims administrators.the district court found that counsel for the fund never expressed a concern that pitwu was not a valid union or that the fund was not a valid fund.
in january,eci terminated its relationship with pitwu.pci and np then became employer members of the pitwu fund.pci and np entered into identical collective bargaining agreements cba with pitwu in which they agreed to make contributions to the fund so that their employees could receive health benefits under the fund the cbas provided that pitwu had been designated by a majority of employees in certain client companies of as their exclusive bargaining representative for those terms and conditions of employment controlled by as per its client service agreement.the client service agreement referred to a peo services contract,which was executed by clients of who wished to obtain health benefits for their employees once an employer executed the contract and began making contribution payments,its employees would become members of the pitwu union and obtain access to health benefits from the fund.although the contract allowed clients to choose not to join the pitwu union,clients were required to select the union option to obtain health benefits for their employees through cbas with the fund.similarly,the contract listed a number of additional peo services,but the only service consistently offered by was health benefits through the pitwu fund 
after became an employer member of the fund,holloway and another trustee appointed weinstein as a trustee of the fund.later in may,weinstein sold to garnett,resigned as trustee,and was replaced by garnett 
doyle company,pcmg,marketed the services of a variety of entities,including in january of,ariety of entities,including in january of,doyle signed a marketing service agreement with pci,in which pcmg agreed to market pci services for a fee.pcmg also collected payments from clients.clients made payments by two checks,one to for participation in the fund check,and one to pcmg for administrative service fees check.pcmg received both checks and would forward the first on to.it retained the second check to cover its expenses,which included sales commissions paid to pcmg sales consultants and fees for additional services selected by the client,such as gap insurance pcmg also provided monthly reports to regarding funds received and paid certain union dues.
at some point,pcmg stopped marketing for,but continued to provide billing and administrative services until may.pcmg received million in check funds,and million in check funds pcmg forwarded million of the check funds to,and paid directly to claim administrators and medical providers in addition to the million received from pcmg,also directly received from employers enrolled in the fund through weinstein wife.of this roughly million,sent million to claims administrators to pay employee health benefit claims.thus,in total,pcmg and collected million in payments relating to the fund,but only million was sent to claim administrators for the payment of health benefit claims.the remaining million was retained by pcmg or.
management of the fund 
the fund retained a claims administrator to pay health benefit claims by employees covered by the fund.the fund first claims administrator was union privileged care upc,which was owned by weinstein.oak tree administrators oak tree replaced upc as claims administrator and served in that capacity from march to june of in a meeting with oak tree in april,holloway learned of many pending claims and of oak tree concern that claims may not have been paid since november.in may,oak tree reported that it had still not obtained necessary documents and financial information from upc and therefore could not provide the trustees with a financial report moreover,the fund actuary could not perform a study on the financial condition of the fund.holloway also decided in may to appoint weinstein as trustee of the fund despite general concerns she had about him.on september,the fund new claims administrator,brokerage concepts,informed holloway of problems relating to lack of funding because of failure to make contributions to the fund and other problems arising from inadequate paperwork 
these problems were illustrated by the testimony of five business owners who had obtained access to the fund through.they testified that they had difficulty presenting claims and did not have claims paid to their satisfaction.additionally,several of these witnesses testified that they did not consider their employees unionized or part of the pitwu union.one employer was assured by pitwu union officials that pitwu brought small businesses under its umbrella for purposes of medical benefits and payroll,but that there was no interest in unionizing the employees.
in response to these problems,holloway asked goldstein,the fund attorney,to bring some accountability to the fund,but he asked holloway to talk to the trustees about that.she also asked goldstein to obtain membership information from pci.however,holloway did not seek mediation of disputes with other trustees regarding the management of the fund or seek to remove any trustee nor did she demand an audit of or pcmg or contact the department of labor to complain about the lack of funding,lack of financial accountability,or chaotic state of affairs.instead,on september,holloway resigned as trustee.she identified several reasons leading to her resignation,including the lack of financial accountability for contributions to the fund and resulting lack of funding to pay claims.she described the vulnerability of the fund due to actions taken by membership that has created insolvency of the fund.holloway also noted that several states had issued cease and desist orders based on the representation by other that pitwu was an insurance program.
holloway continued to participate in the administration of the fund after her resignation.in october,for example,holloway met with brokerage concepts to discuss the fund lack of funding.she agreed that contribution rates should be increased.edi,holloway company,used its own funds to satisfy claims by its clients employees that were not paid by the fund.holloway also sought to resolve outstanding claims with health care providers and sought payment of claims from southern plan administrators.
the district court conclusions 
the district court concluded that the secretary had failed to show that holloway or doyle breached their fiduciary duties to the fund.although the secretary argued at length that funds collected by were plan assets governed by erisa,the court did not make any findings of facts or conclusions of law as to which of the monies received by and pcmg if any were plan assets.instead,the court focused on whether the secretary had established that necessary contributions had not been made to the fund or that the fund had unpaid claims when it closed on may.the court noted the secretary concession that she did not allege that defendant holloway failed to collect contributions from employers and the testimony of the secretary summary witness that none of the financial analyses presented by the secretary would have indicated to an observer that the fund was underfunded.the court also noted doyle unrefuted testimony that the fees charged by and pcmg were customary and reasonable,and observed that the secretary introduced no evidence that the fees charged by or pcmg were excessive,unreasonable,or contrary to plan documents.
additional evidence 
in addition to the district court factual findings,we summarize additional evidence in the record that we find relevant to our legal analysis.
evasion of state insurance regulation 
we find significant the cease and desist orders issued by insurance commissioners of seven states against,pcmg,doyle,and in some cases,the pitwu fund and holloway.some regulatory background is necessary to understand the significance of these orders.providing and selling insurance,including health insurance,is generally regulated by the states.see rush prudential hmo,moran.certain employer and union plans that are subject to erisa funding,vesting,and fiduciary standards are exempted from state insurance regulation see a,b b.however,health insurance plans involving multiple employers are deemed welfare arrangements mewas under erisa,see a,and are subject both to erisa standards and to state insurance regulation,see id.b.nevertheless,certain health insurance plans covering union members working for multiple different employers are excepted from the definition of mewa and thus remain exempt from state insurance regulation see a i.it is not disputed that the fund was a mewa,and therefore subject both to erisa standards and to state insurance regulation.see b.
the record illustrates that,even though the fund was properly considered a mewa and therefore subject to state insurance regulation,pci np and pcmg marketed the fund as a union sponsored plan,exempted from state regulation.this connection to the union was reinforced by a form that required its clients to sign entitled professional industrial trade workers union health welfare fund plan b disclosure form,which stated 
this health welfare plan is sponsored by the professional industrial trade workers union.the plan is and exempt from state regulation,as outlined in the employment retirement income security act erisa of.the plan is under the jurisdiction of the united states secretary of labor.this plan is not regulated by any state department of insurance.the plan being is not covered by any state or federal guarantee fund in the event of fund insolvency.
and pcmg thus relied on the fund relationship with pitwu to claim that erisa exempted the fund,and their marketing of the fund,from state regulation.
from the outset,this scheme attracted the scrutiny of state insurance regulators.in january,less than a month after and pcmg were created,the oklahoma insurance commissioner entered a cease and desist order against pci,pcmg,and two of its marketing affiliates,finding that they were engaging in the unauthorized sale of insurance and ordering them to cease and desist from any further sales or marketing of insurance in the state 
in june,the louisiana insurance commissioner issued a cease and desist order based on its finding that pci and pcmg were selling health insurance without authorization.the louisiana commissioner found that pci purported to offer peo services,including health benefits,to its clients.pci allegedly assumes the role of to the employees of its client employers and thereby provided these employees access to the fund,pursuant to a cba between pci and the fund.however,the commissioner found,inter alia,that 
t here is no collective bargaining for wages or improved working conditions as in a bona fide union agreement employees of the employers contracting with pci do not directly join the union,and receive no representation or benefit from pitwu other than access to the union sponsored health plan.one employer from louisiana who contracted with pci and enrolled in the health and welfare fund did not include employees or activate any peo services other than the health benefits.
the commissioner concluded that pitwu was a plan covering employees of multiple employers and had not acquired the necessary authorization to sell insurance in louisiana the commissioner summarized several of pci,pcmg,and their affiliates marketing practices as follows 
the individuals and entities named above have been involved directly or indirectly in making,issuing,circulating,or causing to be made,issued,or circulated written and oral statements in the form of sales presentations and marketing materials used to solicit potential marketing agents and prospective client employers for pci by,misrepresenting to the public,and on an official document filed with the louisiana department of insurance,that the pitwu or privilege care employee health and welfare fund is not insurance and therefore exempt from regulation under state laws governing insurance and insurance agents deceptively claiming that pci health benefit services have been approved by the louisiana department of insurance falsely claiming that a sic official representative of the louisiana department of insurance had been invited and wanted to attend a compliance and training meeting held by pcmg and pci in louisiana on may,and falsely claiming that pci had been licensed by the louisiana department of labor as a peo doing business in this state falsely representing that pcmg had not been issued a cease and desist order prior to april,and violating several prohibitory laws of this state.
the commissioner accordingly ordered pci,pcmg,the pitwu fund,weinstein,doyle,garnett,oak tree administrators,and several affiliates to cease and desist from marketing or providing health care services in the state.
by the time the fund ceased operations in may,five other states north carolina,texas,massachusetts,colorado,and illinois had entered similar orders against,the pitwu fund,pcmg,doyle,and others.several of these orders were based on hearings before state insurance commissioners at which it emerged that,as in louisiana,purported to offer peo services but actually offered almost exclusively health benefits through the fund by enabling its clients employees to obtain health benefits from the fund without union membership.several of the later cease and desist orders also noted that the fund had numerous unpaid claims for example,colorado insurance commissioner noted that as of december,the fund had over million in unpaid claims.
the findings of these insurance commissioners are corroborated by the record before the district court.evidence showed that required its clients to sign a disclosure form in which it falsely represented that the pitwu fund was exempt from state regulation,as outlined in the employment retirement income security act erisa of.at the bench trial,five managers whose businesses contracted with testified that their employees were not unionized.one witness stated that he had been assured by pitwu officials that the union had no interest in unionizing employees it was merely a means of providing health insurance and other benefits.the business owners also testified to serious problems resulting from unpaid claims for health benefits from the fund.financial data presented by the secretary supports this testimony,showing that the fund had million in unpaid claims on october.
both doyle and holloway were aware of at least some of the cease and desist orders.doyle had contact with insurance commissioners in some states and participated in some of the related proceedings he is named in each of the orders,and in several cases the record contains certified mail slips confirming that he or pcmg received copies of the orders holloway also learned of some of the cease and desist orders while serving as trustee,mentioning them in her resignation letter as one of her reasons for resigning.but the extent of her knowledge about the orders is unclear,and the orders with the most troubling findings were issued after her resignation.as the district court found,the fund attorney assured holloway that he would respond to these orders,arguing that this is a plan,it is not insurance,you state commissioners do have jurisdiction over this.
we find it significant that promotion of the fund bears striking similarities to the type of scheme that erisa mewa provisions were specifically designed to prevent an aggressively marketed,but inadequately funded health benefit plan masquerading as an plan in order to evade the solvency controls imposed by state insurance regulation although the record is not entirely clear on this point,it appears that the ultimate result of this arrangement was that which congress feared the fund was ultimately unable to pay all employee claims,and thus employees participating in the fund were not provided promised health benefits doyle and holloway were not the principal architects of this scheme,and the question presented by this case is the extent of their awareness of the scheme and liability for its consequences.but we think it is important to keep the nature of the scheme firmly in mind.
holloway management of the fund and subsequent resignation 
we also find relevant some additional details concerning holloway management of the fund.it appears from the record that holloway first learned of problems with the management of the fund in a meeting in april with the fund claims administrator at that time,oak tree administrators,and the fund trustees.the meeting minutes,prepared by holloway,report that 
it was discussed that several boxes of unpaid claims had been shipped from union privilege and that oak tree was inputting all the claims to determine the magnitude of requirements.it was noted that many claims were very old and dated back to mid with no claims reflecting payment since november.cindy holloway requested a date for the all sic claims to be entered into the data base.oak tree advised that this would be completed by the following tuesday,april.
the fund actuary reported that he had not been paid by upc and was owed the trustees authorized payment of the bill.the trustees also learned in the meeting that two new health benefit plans,new types of coverage with different pricing schemes had been added to the fund by without their approval.one of the trustees,dante georeno,observed that he did see a problem with the plans,although the premium rates were very low,because the plans have limited coverage.the plans were already in use and the summary plan descriptions already in the hands of the membership.it was therefore determined the plans would be continued.additionally,oak tree noted that enrollment applications submitted by were not complete.a week after this meeting,holloway and the other trustees agreed to appoint weinstein,the owner and operator of upc and,as a trustee of the fund 
the trustees held another meeting on may.a draft of the minutes from the meeting prepared by the fund attorney indicates that weinstein resigned at that meeting and was replaced by garnett,who succeeded him as owner and operator of.the fund accountant informed the trustees that he could not prepare a financial statement for the fund because certain financial information he had requested from upc had not yet been provided.the fund actuary reported to the trustees that he had received some information from weinstein but was still missing necessary information about the number of claims for prescription benefits submitted by plan participants and the number of participants enrolled per plan per month.without this data,he was unable to offer an opinion as to whether the fund reserves were adequate to meet its ongoing needs.oak tree also reported that it was awaiting additional information from weinstein and upc.weinstein then joined the trustees meeting and they developed a list of information that weinstein would provide the trustees directed upc and oak tree to provide all necessary data to the fund accountant and actuary within two weeks.according to holloway,the fund attorney sent weinstein a letter after the meeting to confirm the request for information.
on september,holloway learned from the fund latest claims administrator,brokerage concepts,that it was having problems paying claims because had stopped making contributions to the plan and that necessary information and paperwork from was lacking.the district court found that holloway instructed the fund attorney to bring some accountability to the fund,but he asked holloway to talk to the trustees about that,and holloway took steps to try to get membership information from pci.it is not clear from the record whether holloway followed up on these requests before submitting her resignation letter on september,
holloway resignation letter enumerated specific reasons for resigning,which she explained were examples and are not representative of all the issues related to my resignation.many of these reasons related to disagreements with other trustees about their approach to fund management.for example,she strongly disagreed with the other trustees dismissal of oak tree administrators without consulting her.her reasons for resigning also included 
lack of continuity or communication by the union representatives.
no financial accountability for contributions to the health and welfare fund by other membership.employers depot holloway company provided monthly audits and accountability since the inception of the program.
lack of proper follow through to ensure that union privilege provided required financial records to the accountants and actuary that determined the financial solvency of the fund.
establishment of two additional plans without the consent of the trustees.
contribution rates established for two additional plans without the expressed consent of the trustees or approval by actuary.
vulnerability of the fund due to actions taken by membership that has created insolvency of the fund.
k.the consensual approach by the pitwu to allow staff of certain membership to make decisions,develop programs and direct the outcome of contracts and tpa activity.
cease and desist orders in multiple states based on the representation by other that pitwu is an insurance program.
legal issues with the department of insurance in multiple states due to the representation by other membership that pitwu is an insurance program.
lack of follow through by responsible parties to ensure the structure,insurance programs and related requirements are managed timely and effectively.
holloway expressed concern about the chaotic state of affairs of the fund,which had brought undue damage in multiple states,created credit damage to the membership due to claims that are in excess of months old and generally has ruined the credibility of the union and its associated fiduciaries.holloway did not find another person to replace her as trustee before resigning,nor was she immediately replaced 
iii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction over this action pursuant to and we have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to.in considering an appeal from a bench trial,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.travelers cas.and sur.ins.of north,cir brackets omitted.
determination of plan assets 
the secretary urges in this appeal that the district court erred in failing to determine whether payments collected by and pcmg were plan assets subject to erisa.we agree.the identification of plan assets in this case determines erisa reach.if,as the secretary claims,all of the money collected from employers by and pcmg were plan assets from the moment of collection,then doyle may be a fiduciary by virtue of exercising control over those assets,see a i,and,if he is a fiduciary,he and holloway may be liable for breaching their fiduciary duties with respect to those assets.see.a,a,a.but if,as doyle and holloway claim,the payments collected by and pcmg were not plan assets,and the only assets of the fund were those payments received by the fund claims administrators,then doyle did not handle any plan assets,and could not be a fiduciary under erisa,and holloway duties as a fiduciary were not implicated by and pcmg disposition of the payments they collected from employers.
doyle fiduciary status 
identification of plan assets is essential to determining doyle fiduciary status.under erisa,even if a person is not named as a fiduciary in plan documents,he may still be a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent he exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets a i see also board of trustees of teamsters local pension fund foodtown,cir.the secretary argues that doyle was a fiduciary because all or part of the payments that pcmg collected from clients were plan assets and doyle,as head of pcmg,exercised discretionary control over those assets.doyle contends that the payments pcmg collected from employers who enrolled their employees in the fund were not plan assets and that the only plan assets were funds remitted to the fund claim administrators pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements between pitwu and.
the district court,however,made no findings as to which,if any,of the monies under doyle control were plan assets,or whether doyle was a fiduciary.instead,the district court appears to have concluded that doyle could not have breached any fiduciary duties he might have owed to the fund based on his testimony that he forwarded all required check monies,and his testimony that the check monies he collected as marketing fees were customary and the absence of evidence that the fees were excessive,unreasonable,or contrary to plan documents.doyle,wl.both of these conclusions are problematic.
first,the district court findings cast doubt on doyle testimony that he forwarded all required check monies.the court found that doyle had collected million in check monies,of which million was forwarded to and was sent directly to the fund claim administrator pursuant to instructions from the fund trustees after stopped making contributions in november.doyle,wl.but this leaves of the million collected by doyle unaccounted for.doyle claim that he properly forwarded all required check monies can not be credited without addressing this discrepancy between the amounts doyle collected and the amounts he transmitted to or the fund claims administrator.in any case,the district court would still need to determine whether check monies were plan assets and whether doyle exercised sufficient control over those monies to be considered a fiduciary.see in re mushroom transp,cir.
second,doyle unrefuted testimony that the check funds he collected for marketing fees were customary or reasonable does not mean that he did not violate any fiduciary duties under erisa.if check monies were plan assets and doyle was a fiduciary,he was required to use these monies for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.a a.the check monies retained by pcmg were used to pay expenses it incurred in marketing the fund.it is far from obvious how plan participants benefitted from pcmg marketing of the fund to other businesses with whom they had no connection or why the fund would reasonably incur such expenses.moreover,as we have explained above,the peo services of that pcmg was promoting were actually part of a scheme to abuse erisa preemption and avoid state insurance regulations through a sham collective bargaining relationship with pitwu.at a minimum,expenditures for marketing this illegal scheme were not reasonable expenses for the benefit of plan participants 
accordingly,on remand,the district court should make detailed factual findings concerning the nature of the funds received and controlled by doyle to determine which,if any of these funds,were plan assets.the court should specifically address whether check and check monies were plan assets,considering in particular those monies sent at the direction of the trustees directly to claims administrators.if the district court determines on remand that some or all of these monies are plan assets,it should then consider whether doyle had sufficient control over these assets to support a finding of fiduciary status.see in re mushroom transp,at.if the district court finds that doyle is a fiduciary with respect to certain plan assets,it should then consider whether doyle breached his fiduciary duties to the fund.see,fr bd.of trs.of teamsters local pension fund foodtown,cir.
holloway liability 
the identification of plan assets is also important to the secretary breach of fiduciary duty claims against holloway.it is undisputed that,as a trustee,holloway was a named fiduciary,and thus was obligated to discharge her duties to the fund with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.the secretary primarily argues that holloway failed to act prudently to prevent the improper diversion of check and check monies by and pcmg.the district court did not address this argument,however,apparently because it concluded that holloway did not breach any fiduciary duties owed to the fund.
holloway contends that there was no evidence that holloway acted in a way that caused the fund to i fail to provide benefits to eligible participants or be underfunded,ii fail to defray costs,or iii fail to adhere to plan documents.that argument,however,only addresses some of the fiduciary duties enumerated in erisa a,which is not an exhaustive list see glaziers glassworkers union local annuity fund newbridge,cir.
rather,erisa a incorporates the fiduciary standards of trust law,of which several are relevant here.see id.at.in particular,a trustee has a duty to maintain financial records and to preserve and protect the assets of the plan,including from diversion or embezzlement.see restatement third of trusts b,ream frey,cir.because the district court did not resolve the question of plan assets,it did not address the secretary arguments regarding the question of holloway knowledge of asset diversion or her corresponding duties,if any.those arguments turn on close questions of fact regarding what holloway knew and could reasonably be expected to know.
in addition,a trustee must also take prudent precautions,such as by providing for a suitable and trustworthy replacement,to ensure that his resignation does not harm the fund or its beneficiaries.see ream,at.because the record does not indicate who replaced holloway as trustee,it is unclear whether that person is suitable and trustworthy.
finally,when confronted with suspicious circumstances,a trustee may be required to investigate potential risks to a plan.see chao merino,cir.the record indicates that holloway took several steps to rectify recordkeeping problems.the district court failed,however,to address whether holloway had a duty to investigate,how extensive an investigation would have been required,or whether an adequate investigation would have revealed the fund potential insolvency the diversion of assets.
if holloway has breached any of these duties,as the secretary contends,then she may be liable for any resulting loss of plan assets the secretary claims can not be evaluated,however,without first determining whether any of the check or check monies were plan assets that holloway was obligated preserve.accordingly,as explained above,the district court should make appropriate findings as to which,if any,of these monies were plan assets.if on remand the district court finds that any of the monies retained by pcmg or were plan assets,it should then consider whether holloway breached her fiduciary duties relating to those assets and is liable for any resulting losses to the plan.in considering holloway fiduciary duties,the district court should resolve the relevant questions of fact,including those raised above.
identification of plan assets 
to facilitate the district court analysis on remand,we provide the following guidance on identification of plan assets under erisa.the term plan assets is not comprehensively defined in erisa or in the secretary regulations.erisa provides that the term plan assets means plan assets as defined by such regulations as the secretary may prescribe.the secretary regulations define the scope of plan assets in two specific contexts where an employee benefit plan invests assets by purchasing shares in a company,and where contributions to a plan are withheld by an employer from employees wages.the first regulation is not relevant here,and the second regulation does not apply because the secretary has not presented any evidence that employer contributions to the fund were withheld from the wages of employees participating in the fund.see in re luna,n cir.
as the tenth circuit court of appeals has persuasively explained,in the absence of specific statutory or regulatory guidance,the term plan assets should be given its ordinary meaning,and therefore should be construed to refer to property owned by an erisa plan see in re luna,at considering dictionary definition of asset and noting that c entral to the definition of asset,then,is that the person or entity holding the asset has an ownership interest in a given thing,whether tangible or intangible.this approach is also consistent with guidance provided by the secretary on the meaning of plan assets,which states that the assets of a plan generally are to be identified on the basis of ordinary notions of property rights under law.in general,the assets of a welfare plan would include any property,tangible or intangible,in which the plan has a beneficial ownership interest.department of labor,advisory op,wl may,see also kalda sioux valley physician partners,cir finding the secretary reasoning in its rulings regarding plan assets thorough,valid,and particularly consistent and adopting the secretary definition 
as a general rule,the first step in identifying the property of an erisa plan is to consult the documents establishing and governing the plan.in re lucent death benefits erisa,cir.a court should then,in light of these documents,consult contracts to which the plan is a party or other documents establishing the rights of the plan.see,metzler solidarity of labor organizations health welfare fund,wl,aff cir per curiam,cert.denied galgay gangloff,aff cir.the secretary further argues that representations made by and pcmg to businesses which purchased health benefits from the fund should also be considered in determining what monies were assets of the fund.given the district court limited factual findings,we are reluctant to rule on this argument.we merely note that such representations are relevant only to the extent that they affect the property rights of the fund under ordinary property law principles.we leave it to the district court to determine on remand what representations were made and their relevance,if any,to the fund property rights.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will vacate the judgment of the district court in favor of holloway and doyle and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
another defendant in this action,michael garnett,did not appear at trial and the district court entered a default judgment against him.garnett did not file a notice of appeal,but five months after the entry of judgment,he filed in this court a pro se brief challenging the judgment.because garnett appeal is untimely,we lack jurisdiction to consider it.see fed.a b bowles russell.
