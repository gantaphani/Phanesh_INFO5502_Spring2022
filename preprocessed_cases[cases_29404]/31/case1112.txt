we consider in this case whether a b of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a b,completely preempts a action for breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,quantum meruit and estoppel.because the claims could not be pursued under a b,and because they rely on legal duties that are independent from duties under any benefit plan established under erisa,we hold that they are not completely preempted.because the claims are not completely preempted under a b,there is no federal question subject matter jurisdiction in federal court.removal from state court was therefore improper.
background 
according to its complaint,marin general hospital the hospital telephoned the medical benefits administrators of md,mbamd on april,to confirm that a prospective patient had health insurance through an erisa plan provided by his employer,modesto empire traction modesto.mbamd was the administrator of modesto plan.according to the complaint,mbamd orally verified the patient coverage,authorized treatment,and agreed to cover of the patient medical expenses at the hospital.
between april and april,the hospital performed a lumbar fusion procedure on the patient.the hospital then submitted a bill to mbamd for.mbamd paid the hospital and stated in a letter that the hospital was not entitled to further payment.the hospital sent mbamd a letter stating that p er your contract this claim should be paid at of total charges.mbamd denied that it had such a contract with the hospital and refused to make additional payment.
on december,the hospital filed suit in california state court against modesto,mbamd,and mbamd ceo and chairman ronald wilson collectively defendants for breach of an implied contract,breach of an oral contract,negligent misrepresentation,quantum meruit,and estoppel.defendants removed the suit to federal district court on the ground that erisa completely preempted the hospital claims.the hospital moved to remand to state court,arguing that it alleged only claims in its complaint,and that these claims were not completely preempted under erisa.defendants moved to dismiss,arguing that erisa preempted the hospital claims and that the hospital failed to allege any cognizable claims under erisa.
the court denied the hospital motion to remand and dismissed its complaint.the court concluded that the hospital only remedy was under a b,a subsection of erisa civil remedy provision for plan participants and beneficiaries,and that the hospital complaint failed to sufficiently allege a cause of action under that subsection.the court granted the hospital leave to amend.the hospital amended complaint,like its first complaint,alleged only claims.the hospital again moved for remand to state court,and defendants moved to dismiss.the court dismissed without leave to amend and entered judgment in favor of defendants.the hospital timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
the question in this case is whether the hospital claims are completely preempted under a b of erisa,a b,and thus whether the case was properly removed from state to federal court.removal was proper only if the hospital claims are completely.the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.nike,comercial iberica de exclusivas deportivas,cir.the burden of establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction falls on the party invoking removal.toumajian frailey,cir.
iii.discussion 
defendants removed the hospital state court action to federal court based on federal question jurisdiction.a,a.generally speaking,a cause of action arises under federal law only when the plaintiff complaint raises issues of federal law.hansen blue cross of,cir.the complaint rule is the basic principle marking the boundaries of the federal question jurisdiction of the federal district courts.metro.life ins.taylor,d internal quotation marks omitted.the hospital complaint asserts only causes of action,and defendants preemption defense would appear in its answer if it ever filed one.but defendants argue that the hospital suit comes within the exception to the complaint rule for causes of action that are completely preempted by a of erisa.we agree with defendants that there is an exception to the complaint rule for causes of action that are completely preempted by a.however,for the reasons that follow,we disagree with defendants contention that the hospital causes of action are completely preempted.
complete preemption under erisa 
the parties in this case have not clearly understood the difference between complete preemption under erisa a,a,and conflict preemption under erisa a,a.we take this opportunity to make clear the difference between the two kinds of preemption,and to make clear the different jurisdictional consequences that result from these two kinds of preemption.
complete preemption under a is really a jurisdictional rather than a preemption doctrine,as it confers exclusive federal jurisdiction in certain instances where congress intended the scope of a federal law to be so broad as to entirely replace any claim.franciscan skemp healthcare,cent.states joint bd.health welfare trust fund,cir.the supreme court first articulated,indeed created,the doctrine of complete preemption under a of erisa as a basis for federal question removal jurisdiction under a in metropolitan life insurance taylor,d.the court held that a reflected congress intent to so completely a particular area that any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character.id.at.the court explained that while f ederal is ordinarily a federal defense to the plaintiff suit,id.at,congress had clearly manifested an intent to make causes of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of a removable to federal court.id.at.
complete preemption removal is an exception to the otherwise applicable rule that a plaintiff is ordinarily entitled to remain in state court so long as its complaint does not,on its face,affirmatively allege a federal claim.pascack valley hosp.local ufcw welfare reimbursement plan,cir.the general rule is that a defense of federal preemption of a claim,even conflict preemption under a of erisa,is an insufficient basis for original federal question jurisdiction under a and removal jurisdiction under a.a provision of state law may relate to an erisa benefit plan,and may therefore be preempted under a.see a the relevant provisions of erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may relate to any employee benefit plan described in section a of this title and not exempt under section b emphasis added.but a defense of conflict preemption under a does not confer federal question jurisdiction on a federal district court.
a party seeking removal based on federal question jurisdiction must show either that the causes of action are completely preempted by a of erisa,or that some other basis exists for federal question jurisdiction.if a complaint alleges only claims,and if these claims are entirely encompassed by a,that complaint is converted from an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the complaint rule.metro.life,at.but if the doctrine of complete preemption does not apply,even if the defendant has a defense of conflict preemption within the meaning of a because the plaintiff claims relate to an erisa plan,the district court is without subject matter jurisdiction.toumajian,at.
we may have been partially responsible for the parties confusion between complete preemption under a,which provides a basis for federal question removal jurisdiction,and conflict preemption under a,which does not.some of our prior opinions dealing with complete preemption under a have used the terminology relate to even though that terminology is relevant to conflict preemption under a rather than complete preemption under a.see,the meadows employers health,cir we hold that the district court correctly concluded that the independent state law claims lie outside the bounds of the erisa relates to standard.however,some of our more recent decisions have made clear the distinction between complete preemption and conflict preemption.see,cleghorn blue shield of,cir observing that a court need not consider whether a state statute relates to erisa under a when considering a complete preemption toumajian,at contrasting a and a.
the supreme court recent opinion in aetna health davila,d,is instructive.in davila,a participant in and a beneficiary of employee benefit plans collectively,plaintiffs brought separate suits in state court arising out of injuries sustained as a consequence of their plans denials of coverage.id.at.plaintiffs alleged that their plans refusal to cover the requested services violated their duty to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions,and that these refusals proximately caused their injuries.id.at.quotations omitted.the plans removed plaintiffs suits to federal district courts,contending that their claims fit within the scope of,and were therefore completely by,erisa a.id.
the court began its analysis in davila by quoting a b.that section provides 
a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary b to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.
the court wrote,if a participant or beneficiary believes that benefits promised to him under the terms of the plan are not provided,he can bring suit seeking provision of those benefits.at.under a b,a participant or beneficiary can also bring suit generically to enforce his rights under the plan,or to clarify any of his rights to future benefits.id.
if causes of action come within the scope of a b,those causes of action are completely preempted,and the only possible cause of action is under a b.in that event,a federal district court has federal question jurisdiction,either original jurisdiction under a or removal jurisdiction under a,to decide whether the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under a b.in order to determine whether an asserted cause of action comes within the scope of a b,the court formulated a test.under davila,a cause of action is completely preempted if an individual,at some point in time,could have brought the claim under erisa a b,and where there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant actions.id.
the court in davila concluded that the plaintiffs causes of action were completely preempted and that removal to federal court under a was therefore proper.the court noted,under the first prong of its test,that the plaintiffs only legal claims were about denials of coverage promised under the terms of employee benefit plans.id.at.upon the denial of benefits,plaintiffs could have paid for the treatment themselves and then sought reimbursement through a a b action,or sought a preliminary injunction.id.citation omitted.therefore,according to the court,plaintiffs could have brought suit under a b.
under the second prong,plaintiffs argued that an independent state statute constituted an independent legal duty,and that their claims under the statute were therefore not preempted.id.at.the supreme court disagreed,concluding that the duties imposed by the state statute do not arise independently of erisa or the plan terms.id.this was so because the standards set forth in the state statute at issue create no obligation on the part of the health insurance carrier to provide to an insured or enrollee treatment which is not covered by the health care plan of the entity.id.at.quoting.civ.prac.ann.d.there was thus no independent liability under the state statute because the plan denied coverage for treatment not covered by the plan.the plaintiffs action was therefore only to rectify a wrongful denial of benefits promised under an plan,and did not attempt to remedy any violation of a legal duty independent of erisa.id.at.
application of davila 
the test of davila is in the conjunctive.a cause of action is preempted by a b only if both prongs of the test are satisfied.in the case before us,neither is satisfied.first,the hospital could not have brought its claim under a b of erisa.second,the hospital seeks to remedy violations of legal duties that are independent of erisa.the hospital state court suit is therefore not completely preempted by a b.
davila first prong 
the question under the first prong of davila is whether a plaintiff seeking to assert a claim at some point in time,could have brought the claim under erisa a b.at.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the hospital could not have brought its claims under a b.
the hospital complaint relies on california state law to allege breach of an implied contract,breach of an oral contract,negligent misrepresentation,quantum meruit,and estoppel.all of these claims arise out of the telephone conversation in which mbamd allegedly agreed to pay of the patient hospital charges.mbamd has already paid the hospital part of the patient charges.that payment was made to the hospital in its capacity as an assignee of the patient rights under his erisa plan.the hospital is now seeking additional payment,in an amount necessary to bring the total payment up to of its charges.
the hospital does not contend that it is owed this additional amount because it is owed under the patient erisa plan.quite the opposite.the hospital is claiming this amount precisely because it is not owed under the patient erisa plan.the hospital is contending that this additional amount is owed based on its alleged oral contract with mbamd.
the hospital claims in this case thus are unlike those in davila,where plaintiffs complain ed only about denials of coverage promised under the terms of employee benefit plans.at.plaintiffs claims for payment under the erisa plans duplicated those that were available under a b.plaintiffs in davila therefore could have,and should have,brought suit under a b.
blue cross of california anesthesia care associates medical group,cir,is analytically similar to the case now before us.though decided earlier,blue cross is consistent with the supreme court decision in davila.in blue cross,we decided whether the claims of medical providers against a health care plan for breach of their provider agreements are preempted by erisa.id.at.providers of medical services providers sued blue cross for breach of contract,alleging that blue cross had improperly changed the fee schedule according to which providers were to be compensated.id.at.blue cross argued that the providers right to receive reimbursement from blue cross depends upon the assignment of the right to benefits for payment for medical services from their patients,some of whom are beneficiaries of health plans.id.at.therefore,blue cross argued,the providers claims were unavoidably claims for benefits under the terms of erisa benefit plans and fall within a b.id.
we disagreed.we wrote that the providers did not contend that blue cross had violated the terms of an erisa plan,but rather that it had breached a separate contract.id.at.we explained that the providers are asserting contractual breaches that their could not assert the patients simply are not parties to the provider agreements between the providers and blue cross.id.the patients in blue cross had assigned their erisa rights to providers,so providers would have had standing to pursue those rights under a b had they wished to do so.id.discussing ninth circuit cases and explaining that a stands in the shoes of the beneficiary,and hence has standing to sue under a b to recover benefits due under the plan.but the court in blue cross explained that providers were suing based upon different asserted legal obligations,namely the terms of the executed provider agreements.id.the mere fact that providers could have brought suit against blue cross under a b did not automatically mean that providers could not bring some other suit against blue cross based on some other legal obligation.
as in blue cross,in the case before us the patient assigned to the hospital any claim he had under his erisa plan.pursuant to that assignment,the hospital was paid the money owed to the patient under the erisa plan.the hospital now seeks more money based upon a different obligation.the
