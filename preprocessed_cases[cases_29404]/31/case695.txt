background 
factual background 
majewski began working at adp cleveland,ohio office in.he joined the computer operations department in,where he worked until his discharge in september of.at the time of his discharge,majewski was years old.
adp processes and produces payroll information for employers.majewski was a senior computer operator,responsible for entering data and monitoring the printers.from until his discharge,majewski was supervised by gary kudej and,before kudej,by gene egglebrecht.both egglebrecht and kudej noted deficiencies in majewski job performance.kudej observed a steady decline in the quality of majewski work beginning in.in the performance evaluations for the years and,kudej concluded that majewski performance needs improvement.
approximately two weeks after majewski signed his performance evaluation without comment,he sent a letter to the adp corporate office in new jersey criticizing kudej supervision and saying that kudej was singling him out for making mistakes that other computer operators had made without receiving discipline.the letter was written on a single page,with nine pages of attachments.in the letter,majewski both defended his job performance and criticized kudej.the only indication that majewski thought that his treatment was related to his age is found on page six of the attachments,where he stated that i was not doing anything different than my and i felt like they were trying to fire me before i was forty.majewski also asserted that the entire department under kudej supervision,which included people both over and under the age of forty,felt discriminated against.
the letter was forwarded to caro nickel,the human resources director at adp cleveland office,who discussed majewski concerns with william balzer,the vice president of operations,and john sciano,the general manager of the cleveland office.according to nickel,kudej was never informed of majewski criticisms and never read the letter.
sciano and balzer assigned nickel to investigate majewski allegations.nickel interviewed and discussed the allegations with other employees in the computer operations department.the employees who spoke to nickel said that majewski was committing errors and causing problems in the department as a result of his attitude and work habits.through her investigation,nickel also discovered that majewski had asked others in the department,including employees who were under years of age,to sign his letter addressed to adp corporate office.although the employees who spoke to nickel expressed dissatisfaction with kudej,none of them thought that kudej was unfairly singling out majewski,and none of them signed the letter.one of the computer operators whom nickel interviewed,ron jackson,was himself years old at the time.
after nickel finished her investigation,she delivered her findings to balzer and sciano.nickel reported that her interviews with the other computer operations employees did not confirm majewski allegations of unfair treatment by kudej.additionally,through her review of majewski personnel file and kudej written comments,nickel concluded that majewski was making repeated errors and that kudej was correct in encouraging majewski to improve his performance.
sciano and balzer met with majewski in january of to discuss majewski complaint and the results of nickel investigation.because kudej was unaware of majewski letter,sciano instructed majewski to meet with kudej about his concerns and to report to sciano concerning their discussion.majewski,however,never met with kudej.approximately three weeks later,sciano and balzer again met with majewski,this time with nickel and kudej present.kudej had still not been told of majewski letter.when sciano asked majewski why he had not met with kudej,majewski did not respond.sciano then expressed his displeasure with majewski failure to meet with kudej and told majewski that he would have to improve his performance and reduce the number of repeated errors in order to avoid further disciplinary action.
majewski,however,continued to make numerous errors during the next six weeks.according to adp,these errors were of the same type as those documented in his and performance evaluations.they included deleting payroll information for a number of employers and incorrectly running payroll information,leading to delays in printing.kudej investigated and documented these errors.
majewski next met with balzer and kudej in march of to discuss the implementation of a performance improvement plan.the plan summarized majewski unsatisfactory job performance,noted the areas in which majewski was instructed to avoid making further errors,and placed him on probation for at least days.if his performance did not improve significantly,according to the plan,he faced disciplinary action up to and including discharge.majewski refused to sign the performance improvement plan,contending that the evaluation of his poor performance was baseless.
according to kudej,majewski poor attitude and deficient work performance continued after the march meeting.kudej said that majewski continued to make errors,such as delaying jobs,printing jobs on the wrong paper,and incorrectly filling out various log sheets.in august of,according to kudej,majewski deleted an entire payroll wrap.a payroll wrap is the output report for a batch of payrolls that have been processed.these reports are on a disk until the operator is ready to print them.once deleted,the output report can not be recovered.kudej stated that this error by majewski caused hours of additional work for other employees and resulted in the need to recreate payroll data for numerous customers.no other computer operator during kudej tenure had ever made this error,and kudej was of the opinion that the deletion could not be accidental because of the way information had to be inputted on the computer console.majewski was discharged soon afterward.
during majewski employment at adp,he participated in the company k plan and its stock purchase plan.these plans both contain payout provisions upon the termination of employment.under the k plan,majewski was permitted to remain a plan participant after his discharge,but he could no longer make contributions.the stock purchase plan allowed majewski to receive reimbursement after his discharge for the money he had already contributed,but because he was discharged before he had participated in the plan for two years,he was not eligible to purchase discounted stock that would otherwise have been available to him.upon majewski discharge,adp paid him all of his accrued benefits that were due under these two plans.majewski admitted that he is unaware of any termination benefit that adp has denied him.
after majewski discharge,his job duties were reallocated among the remaining computer operators.approximately six weeks later,another adp employee,jerry katcher,transferred into the computer operations department because of the elimination of katcher department.katcher,unlike majewski,was a employee.at the time katcher transferred into computer operations,he was years old.katcher performed a number of majewski tasks,including loading and unloading the printers,but he never operated a computer console as majewski had done.
procedural background 
majewski filed this action in the cuyahoga county court of common pleas on march.in his complaint,majewski alleged that adp discharged him in order to interfere with his attainment of retirement benefits,in violation of of the employee retirement income security act erisa,discriminated against him because of his age,in violation of ohio revised code and,and retaliated against him for opposing adp allegedly discriminatory practices,in violation of ohio revised code.adp,a new jersey corporation,removed the action to federal court based upon both diversity of citizenship and the presence of a federal question.
five months after the discovery deadline,majewski requested additional discovery relating to adp budget.the district court granted majewski request.majewski,however,did not find any useful information in the documents produced by adp.after adp had filed its motion for summary judgment,majewski requested that discovery be extended for a second time.because majewski provided no reason to believe that such discovery would produce any relevant evidence,the district court denied this second request.the district court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of adp.majewski now appeals the dismissal of his erisa,age discrimination,and retaliatory discharge claims,as well as the denial of his second request to extend the discovery deadline.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is proper where there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the judge is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.a genuine issue for trial exists only where there is sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.id.at.
b.the district court erred in its application of erisa 
majewski retirement benefits claim is based upon of erisa,which provides that i t shall be unlawful for any person to discharge,fine,suspend,expel,discipline,or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under an employee benefit plan.section was designed to prevent unscrupulous employers from discharging or harassing their employees in order to keep them from obtaining vested pension rights.west butler,cir.
because protects an employee right to attain future entitlements to retirement benefits free from intentional interference by his employer,the district court improperly based its dismissal on the fact that majewski received every accrued benefit to which he was entitled.the right to accrued benefits,however,is not the issue in majewski claim under.instead,the issue is whether adp discharged majewski with the intent to prevent him from obtaining vested pension rights,west,at,beyond those that he had already attained.walsh united parcel service,cir holding that in order to establish a prima facie case under,the plaintiff must show that the employer interfered with the attainment of any right to which the employee may become entitled citation omitted.majewski admission that he can not identify any accrued benefit that he has not been paid,therefore,does not affect his claim under.
although the district court reasoning was in error,it reached the correct result in concluding that majewski failed to establish a prima facie case under erisa 
majewski discharge caused him to lose the opportunity to accrue additional benefits by precluding him from contributing further to his k plan and receiving discounted stock.in order for majewski to establish a prima facie case under erisa,however,he must demonstrate not only that he lost the opportunity to accrue new benefits,but also that adp had the specific intent of avoiding erisa liability when it discharged him.smith ameritech,cir.otherwise,every employee discharged by a company with an erisa plan would have a claim under.
this court in smith set forth the framework for analyzing a claim under,which requires a showing that the employer had a specific intent to violate erisa.id.because majewski has produced no direct evidence of specific intent,he must instead establish an indirect prima facie case of discrimination by showing the existence of prohibited employer conduct taken for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which the employee may become entitled.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.majewski must also come forward with evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the defendant desire to avoid retirement benefit liability was a determining factor in plaintiff discharge.id.citation omitted.
a plaintiff burden in establishing a prima facie case is not intended to be an onerous one.christian stores,cir stating,in the context of a racial discrimination case,that the plaintiff burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination is not intended to be onerous,citing texas dep t of community affairs burdine,d.majewski,however,has produced no evidence that would permit a reasonable inference that adp was motivated to discharge him in order to prevent him from attaining further entitlements to retirement benefits.because of this lack of evidence,we conclude that majewski failed to establish a prima facie case under.
d.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying majewski motion to extend discovery for a second time 
in an apparent acknowledgment that his erisa claim is weak,majewski devotes the erisa portion of his appellate brief to the argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying his second request to extend discovery.we will find an abuse of discretion only upon a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.cincinnati ins.byers,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.
the district court granted majewski request to review adp budgeting and staffing records,even though the request was made five months after the discovery deadline had passed.although adp produced the documents,majewski found them undecipherable.after adp filed its motion for summary judgment,majewski once again asked the district court to extend discovery for the same purpose,but the court declined to do so.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying majewski motion to extend discovery because majewski provided no support for his assertion that additional discovery was likely to produce relevant evidence in support of his erisa claim.where the full period for pretrial discovery has run its course,a party should generally be precluded from reopening discovery months after it has closed in a attempt to salvage a deficient claim or defense.see good ohio edison,cir this court requires a party requesting additional discovery pursuant to rule f do so in good faith by affirmatively demonstrating how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable him,by discovery or other means,to rebut the movant showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact.see also willmar poultry,cir rule f is not a shield that can be raised to block a motion for summary judgment without even the slightest showing by the opposing party that his opposition is meritorious.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying majewski motion to extend discovery for a second time.
e.the district court did not err in dismissing majewski age discrimination claim 
majewski brought his age discrimination claim pursuant to ohio revised code n,which provides that a n aggrieved individual may enforce the individual rights relative to discrimination on the basis of age as provided for in this section by instituting a civil action ohio courts examine state employment discrimination claims in accordance with federal caselaw interpreting title vii.bucher sibcy cline,ohio app d,ohio.if the employee lacks direct evidence of discrimination,then title vii caselaw provides a regime that begins with the
