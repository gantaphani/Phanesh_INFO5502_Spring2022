for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
james mcdonald began working for on october.his last position with the company was as a district sales manager in charge of the columbus,ohio,office.as an employee of,mcdonald was a participant in the western and southern life insurance company flexible benefits plan.the plan provided ltd benefits for covered employees who were determined to suffer from a disability or who were determined to be disabled.disability or disabled is defined by the terms of the plan as 
disability or disabled shall mean until the covered employee has completed uninterrupted years of employment a disablement resulting from sickness or accidental bodily injury of such a nature that the disabled covered employee is receiving disability benefits under the social security act.once a covered employee is receiving such benefits his period of disability shall be deemed to include the waiting period for such benefits.after the covered employee has completed uninterrupted years of employment,disabled shall mean the complete and continuous incapacity of the covered employee to engage in any and every occupation,business or employment for wages,compensation or profit.
pursuant to the terms of the plan,a covered employee has a continuing obligation to furnish proof of his disability,to be examined in order to verify his disability,and to provide any release required by the plan.
in the fall of,mcdonald began to experience severe depression.on october,awarded mcdonald disability benefits due to his depression.on august,the social security administration determined that mcdonald was totally and permanently disabled.on january,notified mcdonald that it had approved his application for ltd benefits,to be effective january,based upon his severe depression and his aggressive personality disorder.
on october,pursuant to a periodic evaluation of his continued eligibility for ltd benefits,asked mcdonald to provide information to it relating to his disability and to sign an authorization for the release of his medical records upon receipt of this material,medical consultants believed that some of mcdonald activities,which were noted in his medical records,were inconsistent with a diagnosis of major depression accordingly,asked mcdonald to submit to an independent medical examination in order to determine whether he remained eligible to receive ltd benefits.
on may,richard clary,a psychiatrist,examined mcdonald clary examination consisted of a standard psychiatric evaluation,the psychological test,and a clinical interview of mcdonald.thereafter,clary submitted a report to which contained his evaluation of mcdonald condition and the results of mcdonald.
specifically,clary report indicated that the results of mcdonald were consistent with symptoms of depression and showed an to criticism displayed an underlying hostility as well as evidence of anger and resentment and indicated paranoid tendencies but did not show any paranoid delusions or psychotic thinking.clary diagnosed mcdonald as having dysthymic disorder,a dependent personality,possible paranoid personality,macular degeneration of the left eye,decreased vision in his right eye,and high frequency hearing loss.based upon his examination and interview of mcdonald,clary rendered the following conclusion 
mcdonald would be able to relate satisfactorily with supervisors and.he would be able to understand and follow instructions in a competitive setting.he would be able to maintain attention and attendance for a reasonable period of time and would perform routine repetitive tasks without undue supervision.he would be able to exercise acceptable judgment concerning work functions and would have some difficulty understanding the stress and pressure associated with day to day work activities.he might be able to return to work in a very low stress environment on a limited trial basis.
on may,sent mcdonald a letter informing him that his ltd benefits would be terminated effective june.in this letter,advised mcdonald that,based upon goodman medical records and clary conclusions,it was terminating his ltd benefits because it now appeared that he could engage in an occupation for wages,and thus,he no longer met the definition of disability or disabled as defined by the terms of the plan thereafter,offered mcdonald a position,but he refused it 
on june,mcdonald,through counsel,filed an administrative appeal of decision to terminate his ltd benefits.as part of his appeal,mcdonald presented new evidence which included affidavits from goodman,hamdorf,and eichenbaum,mcdonald bridge coach.therein,both goodman and hamdorf opined that mcdonald is totally disabled from engaging in any work for profit.in his affidavit,eichenbaum testified that mcdonald is a poor bridge player and that,based upon his observations of mcdonald bridge playing skills,he believes that mcdonald is totally disabled from working 
upon receipt and review of the evidence which mcdonald submitted as part of his administrative appeal,telephonically contacted clary in order to discuss the issues raised by mcdonald new evidence and in order to have clary clarify his previous findings and conclusions.participating in this telephone call with clary were don wuebbling who was chief legal counsel and a member of the appeals committee,dean vonderheide who was director of benefits,and megan ratchford who was nurse coordinator.this telephone conversation was audio taped at the end of this telephone conversation,wuebbling asked clary to submit a second letter discussing the issues raised during their telephone conversation.
on december,clary submitted an addendum to his initial report.in this addendum,clary found that,contrary to goodman and hamdorf opinions and despite mcdonald poor bridge playing skills,mcdonald was capable of returning to work.specifically,clary found 
in my opinion,mcdonald is not suffering from any psychiatric or psychological impairment that is severe enough to prevent him from returning to work but he,in fact,does not want to return to work.
on january,informed mcdonald that his administrative appeal was denied.
on april,mcdonald filed a complaint which he later amended in federal district court against,alleging that it had wrongfully terminated his ltd benefits in violation of his rights under erisa.specifically,mcdonald alleged three causes of action against a claim to recover benefits under erisa,a b a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under erisa,and a and a claim for intentional denial of benefits under erisa,and a.at the conclusion of the discovery period established by the district court,mcdonald and filed for summary judgment.
on december,the district court entered an order granting in part and denying in part both parties motions for summary judgment.specifically,the district court held that decision to terminate mcdonald ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious because could not offer a reasoned explanation,based upon the evidence in the administrative record,for finding that mcdonald was able to engage in gainful employment and,thereby,rendering him ineligible for ltd benefits under the plan.in reaching this conclusion,the district court noted the unanimity of the opinions of goodman and hamdorf regarding mcdonald disability,found that clary initial report was an insufficient basis upon which to terminate mcdonald ltd benefits because clary merely stated that mcdonald might be able to return to work in a very low stress environment on a limited trial basis,and held that clary supplemental report should be given very little weight because it was radically different from his initial report and because it was rendered only after an ex parte telephone conference with representatives.accordingly,the district court entered judgment in mcdonald favor and against on his claim to recover benefits and ordered the reinstatement of mcdonald ltd benefits.
as for mcdonald two other claims,the district court found against mcdonald and in favor.specifically,the district court held that mcdonald breach of fiduciary duty claim was barred because it was redundant to his claim for denial of benefits,and the district court found that mcdonald claim for intentional denial of benefits failed because mcdonald presented no evidence that clary was biased or predisposed to concluding that he was able to work and,therefore,not disabled.on january,filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court order 
ii.discussion 
the sole issue which the court must decide in this appeal is whether or not the district court erred in holding that decision to terminate mcdonald ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious.we find that the district court did not err in so holding.
claims that there are two issues which this court must address in order to resolve this appeal.the first issue is whether substantially complied with erisa procedural requirements,and if not,whether the substantive remedy imposed by the district court was proper.argues that the district court order should be reversed because the district court erroneously concluded that it had failed to comply with erisa procedural requirements in terminating mcdonald ltd benefits,and thus,the district court improperly granted a substantive remedy to mcdonald as a result of this alleged procedural defect.specifically,asserts that the district court erred in holding that the telephone call between members of its appeals committee and clary was improper and constituted a procedural defect because neither mcdonald nor his counsel were included in the telephone call.based upon this finding of an alleged procedural defect,contends that the district court improperly disregarded a highly relevant portion of the administrative record,clary supplemental report.
argues that it provided mcdonald with a full and fair review of the record on his administrative appeal and that the procedures which occurred in this case substantially complied with the requirements of.asserts that,contrary to the district court characterization,there was nothing improper about its employees contacting clary for a clarification of his initial report.contends that erisa claims procedures are not adversarial or as described by the district court on the contrary,erisa claims procedures are designed to be an inexpensive,expeditious,and method of claims settlement.thus,asserts that the district court erred in failing to fully consider clary supplemental report because this court has adopted a rule of substantial compliance under.see kent united of omaha life ins,cir holding that when claim communications as a whole are sufficient to fulfill the purposes of section the claim decision will be upheld even if a particular communication does not meet those requirements.
furthermore,argues that its erisa fiduciary obligations and the terms of the plan itself required it to investigate mcdonald claims on appeal.contrary to the district court conclusions,contends that clary initial report is not in conflict with his supplemental report.in both reports,clary concludes that mcdonald is not disabled,as that term is defined by the plan,and his supplemental report merely explains whatever ambiguity exists in his initial report.thus,claims that the district court had no basis to disregard clary supplemental report.
finally,argues that,even assuming arguendo that a procedural defect exists,the remedy of wholly discounting clary supplemental report is contrary to sixth circuit precedent.see id.at holding that g enerally,the courts have recognized in erisa cases that procedural violations entail substantive remedies only when some useful purpose would be served.
the second issue that claims must be resolved in this appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that its decision to terminate mcdonald ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious.given the plan definition of disability or disabled as the incapacity to engage in any and every occupation for wages,given clary opinion that mcdonald is not suffering from a condition which prevents his return to work,and given goodman medical reports which indicate that mcdonald is playing bridge for points,golfing,boating,and going on vacations,contends that it would defy logic to affirm the district court decision because it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based upon the administrative record,for the termination of mcdonald ltd benefits.accordingly,asks the court to reverse the district court order and to remand this case with directions to the district court to enter judgment in its favor.
mcdonald concedes that the district court correctly found arbitrary and capricious to be the appropriate standard of review because the terms of the plan give the plan administrator the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the plan.however,mcdonald argues that the district court order should be affirmed because the district court also correctly found that decision to terminate his ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious given the administrative record.mcdonald claims that the evidence overwhelmingly establishes that he is totally disabled as defined by the terms of the plan and that had no reasonable basis for determining otherwise.
mcdonald asserts that the medical evidence indicates that he has had a mental illness since,that his condition has not improved over time,that his condition is not likely to improve,and that his treating physicians believe him to be disabled.in fact,mcdonald notes that even clary believed that more treatment with his psychologist would be unlikely to result in any improvement or change in his condition.
moreover,mcdonald asserts that,other than clary supplemental report,there is no evidence in the administrative record to indicate that there has been a change in his condition,nor has any new medical evidence been presented since initially determined him to be disabled which would support a conclusion that he is now no longer disabled.the social security administration has concluded that he is disabled,his treating physicians and the independent medical examiners save clary have found him to be disabled,and his mmpi and tests support a finding of disability.
finally,mcdonald argues that the district court correctly discounted clary supplemental report.contrary to characterization of the facts,mcdonald claims that the district court did not refuse to consider clary supplemental report due to any procedural irregularity in the manner in which it was obtained,nor did it impose any substantive remedy as a result of this irregularity.rather,the district court simply found that the report should be given very little weight because the supplement contradicted clary initial opinion and because the only event which triggered the change in clary opinion was a telephone call from members of appeals committee.under these circumstances,mcdonald argues that the district court correctly found decision to terminate his ltd benefits to be arbitrary and capricious,and thus,this court should affirm the district court decision.
we have explained 
as a general principle of erisa law,federal courts review a plan administrator denial of benefits de novo,unless the benefit plan gives the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.wilkins baptist healthcare,cir citing firestone tire rubber bruch,d.when a plan administrator has discretionary authority to determine benefits,we will review a decision to deny benefits under the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review.yeager reliance standard life ins,cir.
sanford harvard,cir.t he arbitrary and capricious standard is the least demanding form of judicial review of administrative action.when applying the arbitrary and capricious standard,the court must decide whether the plan administrator decision was rational in light of the plan provisions.stated differently,when it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome,that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious.williams international paper,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.
generally,when a plan administrator chooses to rely upon the medical opinion of one doctor over that of another in determining whether a claimant is entitled to erisa benefits,the plan administrator decision can not be said to have been arbitrary and capricious because it would be possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based upon the evidence,for the plan administrator decision see abnathya,cir holding that a plan administrator may rely upon a single medical opinion finding that an employee is not disabled see also donato metropolitan life ins,cir upholding a plan administrator denial of benefits where a psychiatrist found the employee to be severely depressed,there being insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff depression,regardless of treatment,would constitute a total disability and upholding plan administrator denial of claim where independent medical consultant opinion was contrary to plaintiff doctor opinion see also birdsell united parcel serv.of,cir holding that a plan administrator decision to deny benefits was not arbitrary or capricious simply because the plan administrator adopted one of two competing views.
under these circumstances,however,the district court did not err in refusing to defer to reliance upon clary opinion in terminating mcdonald ltd benefits or in finding decision to be arbitrary and capricious.
the medical evidence establishes that mcdonald diagnosis and condition have remain unchanged since he was first diagnosed with severe depression and aggressive personality disorder in the late and was awarded ltd benefits by.as noted supra,the results of his in are substantially similar to the results of his mmpi,and even clary admitted that more treatment with his psychologist would be unlikely to result in any improvement or change in mcdonald condition.both goodman and hamdorf have unequivocally and repeatedly opined that,based upon the medical evidence and their treatment of him,mcdonald is totally incapable of returning to work due to his mental condition.see hoover provident life and accident ins,cir applying a de novo standard of review in finding that provident relied on the ime performed by roseman and the review of hoover medical records by provident physicians as pointed out by the district court,although roseman assessment did not totally endorse the assessment of hoover treating physician,vinson,he did not refute it.the evidence presented in the administrative record did not support the denial of benefits when only provident physicians,who had not examined hoover,disagreed with the treating physicians.under these circumstances,the district court decision to reverse provident denial of residual benefits to hoover was correct.
in addition,two independent medical examiners questioned mcdonald ability to return to work.in,murphy opined that mcdonald may be able to return to work but only under careful supervision of his therapist.in,altman opined that mcdonald could not return to his usual occupation.altman also noted that mcdonald severe personality disorder prevented him from progressing and that,because he has long since made any progress which he is going to make,therapy would only be supportive for him 
what remains are the initial and supplemental reports of clary.as noted supra,in his initial report,clary opined 
mcdonald would be able to relate satisfactorily with supervisors and.he would be able to understand and follow instructions in a competitive setting.he would be able to maintain attention and attendance for a reasonable period of time and perform routine repetitive tasks without undue supervision.he would be able to exercise acceptable judgment concerning work functions and would have some difficulty withstanding stress and pressures associated with day to day work.he might be able to return to work in a very low stress environment on a limited trial basis.
we believe that clary initial report was an insufficient basis upon which to determine that mcdonald could engage in an occupation for wages.first,clary opinion which was contained within his initial report regarding whether mcdonald was disabled was ambiguous at best.the best evidence of this ambiguity lies in the fact that had to contact clary in order to have him clarify his report 
second,in his initial report,clary merely opined that mcdonald might be able to return to work under certain limited circumstances.the mere possibility that a participant in an erisa plan might be able to return to some type of gainful employment,in light of overwhelming evidence to the contrary,is an insufficient basis upon which to support a plan administrator decision to deny that participant claim for ltd benefits.see mein pool.disabled int l employee long term disability benefit plan,holding that a plan administrator decision to deny erisa benefits was arbitrary and capricious where it was based upon a physician opinion that the claimant may be capable of some sedentary work see also norris citibank,disability plan,cir quoting noram energy,cir holding that s ubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.both the quantity and quality of evidence may be considered.but see miller metropolitan life ins,cir holding that plaintiff makes much of the fact that in the narrative portion of his report,murthi stated that he recommended a return to work on a trial basis.even though murthi recommended work only on a trial basis,we do not believe metropolitan action in terminating benefits was inconsistent with the scheme as set forth in the plan.emphasis in original.
likewise,we believe that clary supplemental report was an insufficient basis upon which to determine that mcdonald could engage in an occupation for wages.in his supplemental report,clary was much more forceful in his conclusion that mcdonald was able to engage in gainful employment.in fact,clary went so far as to accuse mcdonald of malingering in his ability to return to work 
in my medical opinion,mcdonald is not suffering from any psychiatric or psychological impairment that is severe enough to prevent him from returning to work but he,in fact,does not want to return to work.
although the district court found that there was no evidence of bias by clary and although there was nothing untoward about contacting clary in order to have him clarify his initial report,it is noteworthy that clary became more definite in his opinion only after he was contacted by.in his supplemental report,clary did not change his diagnosis of mcdonald,did not modify the results of mcdonald,or alter his belief that therapy would be of little use to mcdonald.moreover,he did not mcdonald,nor did he receive any new medical evidence or reports upon which to base his clarified conclusion.in fact,the only new medical evidence submitted after clary initial report was reports from goodman and hamdorf in which they reiterated their opinions that mcdonald was disabled and which attempted to rebut clary conclusions contained within clary initial report.
therefore,we agree with the district court that clary supplemental report should be discounted.clary su
