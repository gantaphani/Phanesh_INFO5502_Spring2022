andrew ruttenberg filed a claim for total disability benefits with his insurer,united states life insurance company in the city of new york life or the company.after protracted consultations with a number of physicians and consultants produced no ruling on the claim,ruttenberg filed suit.originally,he alleged claims under illinois law.the parties agreed to a stay in the proceedings while life considered ruttenberg claim.when life denied the claim,the parties returned to the district court.the district court then determined that ruttenberg claim was preempted by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.it therefore dismissed the action with leave to file a claim under that statute.
after ruttenberg filed an erisa claim,the parties conducted discovery,and,eventually,each filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted life motion it concluded that ruttenberg did not qualify for coverage under the plan because he could not be considered a employee under its terms.
ruttenberg now appeals both the grant of summary judgment and the district court previous erisa preemption determination life certain rulings made by the district court in the course of this litigation.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
ruttenberg worked as an independent commodity trader at the chicago board of trade and mercantile exchange the exchange,a position requiring a certain amount of screaming in order to gain the attention of other traders on the floor.the exchange floor was open for hours per week.he did not keep regular hours on trading days.sometimes,he would work several hours at the exchange.other times,he would leave early after making significant gains or taking losses.he spent time away from the floor preparing for trades or reconciling accounts.trading constituted his primary occupation,and the evidence shows that,at times,he made over in profits per month.
ruttenberg cleared his trades through smw trading smw.the firm contracted through life to provide disability insurance to independent traders.ruttenberg paid premiums on a policy which entitled him to per month in coverage.on march,ruttenberg filed a claim for disability benefits.he submitted evidence from his physician,goldberg,that asthma prevented him from performing his job.two other physicians,taitz and fisher,performed tests at goldberg request and found no nasal or other obstructions.life forwarded the claim to its administrator,disability reinsurance management services rms.the rms consultant,hogan,reviewed the claim and offered medical opinions rms determined that goldberg opinion was based on subjective complaints.rms then arranged an appointment for ruttenberg with another specialist,diamond.
diamond examined ruttenberg and diagnosed asthma and vocal cord dysfunction and expressed concern that ruttenberg hoarseness,still apparent after ruttenberg had been away from work for seven months,might be permanent.to the diagnosis,he attached a pulmonary function report and a plethysmograph report in the latter,the technician noted that ruttenberg had been unable to achieve reproducible results in his exhalation flow rate.diamond appended an additional letter to the report,in which he sought to clarify his opinion that ruttenberg is permanently disabled because he could not continue to work as a trader.
hogan reviewed diamond report and concluded that a definitive diagnosis could not be made without viewing ruttenberg vocal cords.a claims analyst for life told ruttenberg that the company might accept liability if the test supported diamond conclusion.a month later,rms contacted ruttenberg and said it was waiting for fisher to review hogan interpretation.ruttenberg filed suit the next week.
district court proceedings 
ruttenberg action initially was based in diversity,but the district court dismissed the suit without prejudice on august,because ruttenberg had not pleaded diverse defendants.he later refiled the complaint,and the parties agreed to a stay of proceedings while rms the claim.ruttenberg submitted additional medical evidence,including the results of a nasopharyngoscopy performed by diamond the test led diamond to confirm his previous diagnosis and disability opinion because he saw the classic posterior chinking associated with vocal cord dysfunction.he further stated that the inconsistent results noted by the plethysmograph technician a year earlier were not the result of insufficient effort on ruttenberg part,as had been implied by life,but were associated with the dysfunction.
rms forwarded the medical records to another expert,karetzky,for review.this physician determined that ruttenberg results stemmed from his poor effort and found nothing that would impair significantly his work on november,rms reported the results to ruttenberg.it also raised questions about whether he qualified as a employee under the policy and requested documentation to establish that he had worked more than thirty hours per week as required by the policy.ruttenberg responded that it was impossible to actually work on the floor of the exchange for thirty hours per week and asserted that he worked on trades and performed other functions which,taken together with his time on the floor,amounted to more than thirty hours.on december,life denied ruttenberg claim.it concluded,among other things,that his injury did not meet the definition of disability under the policy and that life could not substantiate his eligibility.the letter stated that ruttenberg had the right to appeal the decision the parties then returned to the district court.
life filed a motion alleging that erisa preempted ruttenberg state law claims and seeking dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.in response,ruttenberg argued that his insurance plan was not an erisa plan because smw did not establish or maintain it and as an independent contractor,he was not a participant or beneficiary as erisa employs those terms.
the district court rejected the first argument because smw created the insurance plan,designated eligible employees and contributed funds.with respect to ruttenberg second argument,the district court stated that ruttenberg qualified as a beneficiary under erisa,and his state law claims thus were preempted by that statute,id.the court based its beneficiary determination on the plain language of,which defines a beneficiary as a person designated by the terms of an employee benefit plan,who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder,and precedent in other courts.having determined that the policy qualified as an erisa plan,the district court found ruttenberg state law claims to be preempted the district court dismissed ruttenberg complaint with leave to refile an erisa cause of action it thus found no need to address life argument that ruttenberg had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.ruttenberg refiled an erisa action.
after discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment life based its motion on two grounds,both relating to ruttenberg eligibility under the policy that he was not an employee of smw and therefore was not covered by the policy terms and that even if he was an employee,he did not qualify as as required by the policy because there was no evidence that he worked more than thirty hours per week the district court rejected the first argument,concluding that the policy was ambiguous because it limited benefits to employees but listed as employees traders reporting income on irs forms,even though such individuals generally are considered independent contractors.given the ambiguity,the district court applied the maxim contra proferentem and construed that ambiguity against life,foreclosing the company from arguing that ruttenberg was not an employee under the policy.
the court,however,accepted life second argument.the district court read the policy terms to require plainly that ruttenberg be a employee and,just as plainly,that he work at least thirty hours per week.the evidence submitted by ruttenberg indicated that he spent at most fifteen to twenty hours working the exchange floor,and the court noted that 
p resumably by those hours he meant to suggest that he was trading in the pit during those times,and it is reasonable to suggest that ruttenberg may have spent another hours a week preparing for his trades.however,with no evidence in the record to support this or otherwise create a question of fact on this issue,there is little basis to say that ruttenberg could be considered based on the policy express terms.
at.finding no evidence that ruttenberg was eligible for benefits under the policy,the court granted life motion for summary judgment.
ruttenberg appeals the grant of summary judgment based on his ineligibility under the provision,and life the district court initial determinations that the company did not have interpretive authority under the policy and that ruttenberg qualified as an employee.
discussiona.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant or denial of summary judgment de novo,making all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see vallone cna fin,cir.in interpreting erisa plans,we apply general principles of contract law under the federal common law guiding interpretation of erisa claims.bock computer assocs.int l,cir.
in erisa cases,an important principle governs the scope of a district court,and therefore our,review a district court reviews de novo a denial of benefits unless the plan grants to the plan administrator the discretionary authority to construe policy terms.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d see also phillips lincoln life ins,cir.if the plan grants an administrator such authority,that administrator interpretation of contract terms is reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.firestone,at.life submits that the district court erred in determining that the policy did not give life interpretive discretion in its view,the appropriate review should be deferential rather than de novo.
to avoid an overly broad grant of discretionary authority based on boilerplate policy language,we have articulated a notice requirement that must be met before an insurer may be said to have retained interpretive discretion an employee must be told in clear terms that the administrator reserves the authority to construe terms in the plan.see herzberger standard ins,cir.absent notice sufficient to satisfy the herzberger standard,an insurer is not entitled to arbitrary and capricious review of its interpretations.
life submits that it met the herzberger notice standard.according to the company,the relevant notice is contained in a document titled the master application for employee benefits master application.at.specifically,life invites our attention to the applicant declaration section of the master application,which states that 
i f the insurance contract that smw applied for compromises a part of an employee benefit plan,life is granted sole discretionary authority to determine eligibility,make all factual determinations and to construe all terms of the policy.
id.at.the district court erred,according to life,in ignoring the master application and basing its determination on the summary plan description spd given to the insured further,life argues that its relationship is actually with the policyholder,smw,and that the terms of the plan in its view,the master application control over the spd.in life view,responsibility for notifying independent traders of the master application provisions rested with smw while ruttenberg might have an independent cause of action against smw,that fact does not change the discretionary authority vested in life by the master application.
both the spd and the plan terms are silent as to life interpretive authority.life points only to language contained in the master application,but the master application is,by its terms,an application for group insurance coverage submitted by smw,not the policy itself.neither the spd,the certificate of insurance,nor any subsequent insurance document reproduces the discretion provision and no document notifies an insured that life retains interpretive discretion given the lack of discretionary language in any document except for the master application,we can not say that boilerplate language in a contract the negotiations leading to contract formation rather than the substance of the as the type of notice required by herzberger.we,like the district court,therefore review ruttenberg claims de novo and afford no deference to life interpretation of contract terms.
erisa preemption 
ruttenberg first challenges the district court determination that erisa preempted his state law claims.the statute supersede s any and all state laws insofar as they relate to any employee benefit plan described in a.a.under,erisa applies to any employee benefit plan that is,among other things,maintained by an employer engaged in commerce.id.a.as relevant to this appeal,the statute defines an employee benefit plan,as any plan,fund,or program which was established or maintained by an employer for the purpose of providing for one of two classes of covered persons participants or their beneficiaries.id.a participant in an plan 
means any employee or former employee of an employer,or any member or former member of an employee organization,who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization,or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.
id.the other qualifying erisa class members are beneficiaries,that is,a person designated by a participant,or by the terms of an employee benefit plan,who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.id.thus,ruttenberg state law claims would be preempted by the erisa scheme if he qualifies as either a participant or a beneficiary of the life plan.given the procedural posture in which it determined the question,the district court assumed that ruttenberg was not an employee of smw and therefore could not be considered a plan participant.for purposes of the present discussion,we also shall assume that ruttenberg does not qualify as an employee and therefore is not an erisa participant.under this assumption,erisa preemption is only possible if ruttenberg qualifies as a beneficiary.
we look first to the language of the statute.when the language of a statutory provision is clear,our sole function is to enforce its terms.see united states jones,cir.read alone,the erisa definition of beneficiary seems clear.a beneficiary is defined as one who is designated by a participant,or by the terms of an employee benefit plan,who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.emphasis added.by employing commas to set the emphasized language apart,the statute appears to establish two distinct classes of individuals who might be beneficiaries those designated by a participant and those who are,like ruttenberg,directly designated to receive benefits by the plan itself.
but other erisa provisions might be said to raise questions about the clarity of.for example,one might reach an apparent contradiction between the definition of a qualified benefit plan as one maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries,id.emphasis added,and the language.the congressional findings that introduce erisa in the united states code,see id.b declaring erisa purpose to be the protection of commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries emphasis added,might also be said to be in tension with.ruttenberg therefore suggests a limited reading of the term beneficiary.in his view,the term encompasses only those individuals designated as such by plan participants,smw employees.by contrast,the district court,and life here,take the view that includes within the definition of beneficiary those who,like ruttenberg,are designated to receive benefits by the plan itself and not just those who are designated beneficiaries by a participant.
we do not think these provisions,when read in the context of the entire statute,create a severe textual ambiguity.our sister circuits that have considered the question agree with life view that,under,a beneficiary may be a person designated to receive benefits under a plan beneficiary is not limited to those who are designated as beneficiaries by a participant.see hollis provident life accident ins,cir wolk unum life ins.of america,cir engelhardt paul revere life ins,cir prudential ins.of america doe,cir peterson american life health ins,cir.indeed,the same interpretation has been applied by district courts in this circuit.see,turnoy liberty life assurance of boston,wl.
ruttenberg largely grounds his construction of the term beneficiary on a single case,ritter massachusetts casualty insurance,certainly,ritter criticized what it considered to be an reading of the erisa term beneficiary.see id.at.although ruttenberg is correct that the supreme judicial court of massachusetts interpretation appears to support his position,we agree with the district court that,at most,ritter simply is inconsistent with the approach in our sister circuits.we join the weight of authority in concluding that an erisa beneficiary may be a person designated to receive benefits under the terms of the plan itself the definition is not limited to individuals designated by a participant to receive benefits.the district court did not err in determining that ruttenberg qualified as a beneficiary of the life policy for erisa purposes and correctly found his state law claims preempted by the federal statute 
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
an erisa plaintiff must exhaust all available administrative remedies before filing suit to challenge a denial of benefits.zhou guardian life ins.of america,cir.because the erisa plaintiff need only exhaust available remedies,we have recognized two circumstances in which a failure to exhaust may be excused.one is if there is a lack of meaningful access to review procedures,and the other applies if pursuing internal remedies would be futile.stark ppm america,cir see also lindemann mobil oil,cir.futility is demonstrated by showing that it is certain a plaintiff claim will be denied by the plan administrator.robyns reliance standard life ins,cir.the decision to require exhaustion is committed to the sound discretion of the district court and,consequently,is reviewed only for abuse of that discretion.stark,at.
our review of the record reveals that ruttenberg did not follow life administrative requirements.ruttenberg filed suit prematurely life had not officially granted or denied his claim when he brought suit.he agreed to stay the proceedings to conclude the administrative process,but,once life denied his claim,he undoubtedly failed to file an administrative appeal within the allowable time period.despite these failures,there certainly is nothing in the record indicating that,had ruttenberg complied with the administrative appeals requirement,life would have altered its decision to deny benefits.indeed,the record indicates that life has opposed ruttenberg claim at every step.life spent more than eighteen months adjudicating ruttenberg claim.in the course of this process,it contested every medical opinion favorable to ruttenberg,including that of its own expert diamond.after ruttenberg agreed to a stay in the proceedings,life spent over a year reviewing his submission before it denied the claim,knowing that he would resume the suit in the event of an unfavorable result.
the history of this matter,both before the district court and in administrative proceedings,provides ample support for the district court view that life would have denied ruttenberg claim even if he had filed an administrative appeal.indeed,there is no evidence in the record demonstrating that life denial would be anything but certain if the company had reviewed ruttenberg claim once again.accordingly,we can not say that the district court futility determination was unreasonable.zhou,at quoting cincinnati ins.flanders motor,cir.therefore,the district court futility determination was a proper exercise of discretion.
eligibility under the policy 
ruttenberg submits that the district court erred in finding the,work requirement to be unambiguous.in the alternative,he challenges the court determination that he did not provide sufficient evidence demonstrating that he worked more than thirty hours per week.life argues in its that the district court erred in finding ruttenberg to be an employee under the policy.the company asserts that he was ineligible for coverage because he was neither an employee nor did he work.
before considering ruttenberg eligibility under the policy,we must resolve two threshold disputes between the parties.first,ruttenberg,relying on life assurance levy,cir,contends that the burden of proving his ineligibility rests with life.we can not accept this view.ruttenberg seeks to enforce benefits under the policy he therefore bears the burden of proving his entitlement to contract benefits.see santaella metro.life ins,cir fuja benefit trust life ins,cir.
second,ruttenberg submits that life waived a challenge to his eligibility under the policy because it did not raise this contention before the administrative record closed.life responds that ruttenberg had adequate notice that the company challenged his eligibility during the administrative process.although life did not consistently challenge ruttenberg eligibility in the course of this claim we agree with the company assessment.before the administrative record closed,the company twice notified ruttenberg that it questioned whether he met the eligibility requirement through a letter sent to his counsel on november,and in the letter denying ruttenberg claim.ruttenberg acknowledged life challenge by stating,in response to the november letter,that he obviously spent more than thirty hours per week preparing for trades.see at see also at.given that he had notice that his status was at issue and had the burden of proving eligibility,ruttenberg waiver argument fails.we thus must consider his eligibility as an employee who works.
in its,life asserts error in the district court finding that the term employee is ambiguous,and in its use of the contra proferentem maxim to construe the term against life.the district court considered the term employee as used in the contract ambiguous because its terms include filers of form who are typically independent contractors rather than common law employees.for his part,ruttenberg argued at various points that he is not an employee,but an independent contractor.regardless of the label,however,ruttenberg presumably agrees that he must be considered an employee as the policy uses that term otherwise,he would be ineligible for any benefits.
life submits that looking to the form provision is only one factor in determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor.the company also asserts that contra proferentem is an interpretive tool that ought to be employed only to tiebreaker situations and,consequently,was improperly applied here.see nationwide mut.ins.darden,d.in its view,the court first must analyze extrinsic evidence to resolve the ambiguity and resort to contra proferentem only if consideration of such extrinsic evidence does not yield a resolution.
the situation here differs significantly from that confronted in darden.there,the court was called upon to interpret the erisa term employee in determining what constituted an erisa participant.but the issue in this case does not present a question of statutory interpretation rather it presents a question of contract construction.the district court here had to interpret the term employee contained in this contract to determine whether the parties intended it to cover traders like ruttenberg.the relevant contract provision describes eligible classes of employees as 
a ll employees of the participating employer who are 
managers and officers earning over annually 
traders who report earnings on their form 
firm traders who report prior years on their dde form,
but not those who are temporary,or seasonal.
at the eligibility clause.
within this provision,the term employee is not otherwise defined in the policy,unlike terms such as.an employee in the traditional sense is a person who works in the service of another person under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance.black law dictionary ed.however,employers account for income paid to these employees on irs form generally speaking,a worker whose income is reported on form is an independent contractor,not a common law employee.see eeoc knox sch,cir.the inclusion of form in defining the contractual term employee thus indicates that the term includes more than just common law employees,and that other workers may be eligible under the policy.those other workers may include independent contractors like ruttenberg,but the scope of the contractual term is ambiguous.
we have endorsed the use of contra proferentem to resolve such ambiguities,at least in circumstances plan administrator was not empowered to interpret contract terms.see phillips lincoln life ins,cir.life argues that this court more recent precedent,see hall life ins.of america,cir limits contra proferentem to tiebreaker situations the proper approach,according to the company,was for the court to look first to extrinsic evidence in interpreting the ambiguous term.even if life is correct that the district court should have looked to extrinsic evidence in construing the eligibility clause,it offered no such evidence to the district court,nor does it suggest the existence of such evidence to this court given the lack of extrinsic evidence,the use of contra proferentem would be justified as a tiebreaker even under hall.indeed,we have noted that the contra proferentem doctrine serves its function when it prevents traps for the unwary.id.allowing ruttenberg to purchase insurance for which life now claims that he is ineligible constitutes the type of trap for the unwary that contra proferentem is meant to prevent.the district court correctly found the term employee to be ambiguous,and properly construed the term against the policy drafter,life.
the term is defined to 
mean active work on the participating employer regular work schedule for the class of employees to which you belong.the work schedule must be at least hours a week.
at.basic to the definition of is the requirement that a covered employee work for more than thirty hours per week.the district court found the term to be unambiguous and determined that ruttenberg failed to offer sufficient evidence that he worked the requisite thirty hours per week.
life urges us to affirm the district court determinations,both its finding that the term is unambiguous and its conclusion that ruttenberg failed to offer sufficient evidence.the company contends that ruttenberg failed to provide evidence that he met the requirement,even off of the trading floor in response to questions about his eligibility ruttenberg argued only that he spent more than thirty hours per week working on trades and that it was impossible to spend more than thirty hours per week on the floor.assuming that the requirement unambiguously includes working more than thirty hours per week,life asserts that the district court correctly determined that ruttenberg failed to demonstrate his eligibility.
in reply,ruttenberg submits that the plain language of the definition,requiring active work on the participating employer regular work schedule for the class of employees to which you belong,id.emphasis added,indicates that the requirement applies only to smw common law employees,not to independent traders covered by the policy he asserts that,at the very least,the requirement application is ambiguous.as for the evidence presented,he contends that,at certain stages in the litigation,life adopted his view that a trader could not work thirty hours on the floor and that he did work more than thirty hours per week in preparing for trades.he points out that other courts have relaxed contractual requirements to find that an insured is covered.see burke blue cross blue shield of nebraska,jetson cna ins,so d.ruttenberg also submits that it would defeat the reasonable expectations of the insured to deny coverage to more than eighty traders,based on a requirement they can not meet,after they have paid for the insurance.
contrary to ruttenberg assertion,life did not adopt in its statement of facts the position that he could not work more than thirty hours on the floor and that he worked the required hours in preparing for trades.life statement of facts listed the text of a letter received from ruttenberg attorney only to support the fact that the letter was received,not the letter contents.indeed,aside from assertions that he obviously worked more than thirty hours per week preparing for trades,he submitted no evidence that such was the case,for example,through affidavits from himself or associates.he was aware before the administrative record closed that life questioned his eligibility under the requirement,but failed to supplement the record.thus,ruttenberg presented insufficient evidence that he actually worked more than thirty hours per week.on this record,therefore,any relief ruttenberg may be granted must be found through contractual ambiguity.
turning to the ambiguity question,other courts interpretations of the term in other contracts do not control the present inquiry.rather,we must determine what the term means in this insurance contract.
in interpreting a contractual term,we can not give meaning to a word standing alone.rather,we must take into account its placement in the text and discern its proper relationship to the text in which it is placed.here,given the ambiguity in the term employee,it is not clear from the contract that the requirement applies to noncommon law classes of employees like independent traders.indeed,in defining,the policy simply refers back to the ambiguous term employee means active work on the participating employer smw regular work schedule for the class of employees to which you belong.at.if,as we have determined,the term employee is itself ambiguous as applied to ruttenberg,then the policy is equally ambiguous about the application of the requirement to his class of worker.
moreover,the provision is ambiguous even apart from the lack of clarity in the term employee.independent traders like ruttenberg do not work according to a work schedule established by smw independent traders clear their trades through smw but the company does not control the details of their work schedules.similarly,to qualify as a worker,the employee must render active work,defined as performing each duty of your job for full pay.id.it is not clear how full pay is measured for independent traders who do not draw a salary from smw and simply clear their trades through the company.the inclusion of independent traders as employees under the eligibility clause can not be reconciled with a definition of that such workers can not meet one of the provisions must take precedence,and arguably this means that the requirement does not apply to the class of eligible employees that includes ruttenberg.
ruttenberg proposed interpretation,that the requirement does not apply to his category of eligible employee,is at least as plausible as life.the term can not be said to be unambiguous,and the district court erred in dismissing his claim on that ground.given the error,we remand to the district court for further proceedings 
apart from the ambiguity questions,ruttenberg and life each argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the merits of their respective claims.life asserts that ruttenberg is not disabled for his part ruttenberg contends that life own expert in fact found him to be disabled.the merits of ruttenberg claim,whether he is disabled and therefore entitled to the policy benefits,is a matter properly reserved to the district court on remand.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.ruttenberg may recover his costs in this court.
