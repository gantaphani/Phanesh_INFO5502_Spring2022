these consolidated appeals arise out of a complex background of financial transactions and litigation stemming from the leveraged buyout of company stock by an employee stock ownership plan.plaintiffs in the earlier of the two actions and plaintiffs originally brought suit in california state court,alleging only state law causes of action in their complaint.defendants successfully removed the case to federal district court on the basis of complete preemption,pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.the parties raise numerous issues on appeal from the ensuing litigation.because we conclude that the district court lacked original subject matter jurisdiction,necessary for removal pursuant to,we must vacate the judgments below.we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal from the district court final judgment,and to decide the jurisdictional issue,toumajian frailey,cir 
background 
norcal solid waste systems,norcal,a california corporation,was an garbage company.plaintiffs are former or their heirs and assigns of norcal.norcal created the norcal solid waste systems,employee stock ownership plan and trust the norcal esop or esop to purchase shares from plaintiffs in a leveraged buyout of company stock.there is no dispute that the esop is an employee benefit plan within the meaning of erisa.in december,plaintiffs sold their stock to the esop as part of the leveraged buyout transaction for million in cash and million in notes.of the plaintiffs also were norcal employees and participants in the benefit plan esop participants.
the leveraged buyout was accomplished through a complex financing arrangement in which the esop acquisition of norcal shares was financed by bank loans to norcal,which in turn then lent those funds to the esop.bank of america the bank served as a senior lender among several banks and a financial advisor to norcal for the leveraged buyout.the notes that were issued to the former shareholders pursuant to the buyout were governed by the terms of a trust indenture agreement the indenture between the norcal esop,as obligor,and security pacific national bank,as the trustee security pacific or the trustee.security pacific also acted as a lender to norcal in the transaction.
the notes were as against norcal,were not secured by norcal stock,were subordinated to the norcal esop senior indebtedness the bank loans to norcal that were subsequently lent to the esop,and were to be paid in accordance with erisa regulations for exempt transactions.among the other provisions of the indenture relevant to the litigation were the following 
section b in case an event or default has occurred and is continuing,the trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this indenture,and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise,as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
section the plan agrees to indemnify the trustee for,and to hold it harmless against,any loss,liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part,arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust,including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.
section the plan shall not consolidate with or merge into any entity or convey,lease or transfer its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any person unless the plan shall first redeem the entire outstanding principal of all of the notes.
the indenture also provided that it shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of california.
in december,norcal consummated a transaction with envirocal,envirocal,whereby the norcal esop and the envirocal esop simultaneously with their respective sponsors combined to form a single entity the former owners of envirocal exchanged stock for a combination of cash and notes.security pacific also acted as a lender to norcal in the envirocal transaction.on may,in its capacity as the trustee,security pacific sent an annual reporting letter to plaintiff note holders stating,among other things,that n o other action has been taken by the trustee,in the performance of its duties under the indenture,which,in its opinion,materially affect the noteholders.only in september did the esop advise its participants of whom are among plaintiff note holders of the envirocal transaction.
between and april,the norcal esop paid each quarterly interest payment due on the notes,and the trustee also transferred all of these payments to plaintiff note holders,as required by the indenture.in april of,however,norcal defaulted on its indebtedness to the bank lenders and to the envirocal note holders,and the esop defaulted on its indebtedness to plaintiff note holders.on march,security pacific sent letters to norcal and the esop resigning as trustee under the indenture as well as under the subsequent indenture formed for the envirocal note holders,for which it also served as trustee,and on may,a successor trustee was formally substituted.
proceedings 
plaintiffs commenced an action in california state court in against the trustee,norcal,the esop,norcal bank lenders,and several individual officers and directors of the defendant corporations including some members of the esop administrative committee.the bank was sued not only in its capacity as a lender in the leveraged buyout,but also as successor in interest to security pacific,which was both a lender and the trustee plaintiffs alleged state law causes of action including fraud,breach of contract,tortious interference with contract,negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and unjust enrichment.
the alleged conduct underlying plaintiffs claims was a series of breaches,misrepresentations,omissions,concealment,and conflicts of interest by defendants,as well as an alleged conspiracy among them,in conjunction with the initial leveraged buyout,the envirocal transaction,and subsequent esop activities.these acts allegedly resulted in plaintiffs unwitting reliance in tendering their shares in norcal for restricted notes,the failure to redeem or enforce redemption of those notes at the time of the envirocal transaction,and the eventual default on those notes.of the plaintiffs,who were also esop participants,simultaneously initiated a separate action in federal district court against norcal,the norcal esop,and some individual defendants for the breach of their duties imposed by erisa in conjunction with the envirocal transaction and subsequent esop activities.
defendants removed the action from state court to federal court on the basis of complete erisa preemption.the district court denied plaintiffs motion to remand,concluding that,at least with respect to the subset of plaintiffs who were esop participants,the state law causes of action based on constructive fraud,fiduciary duty,and negligence were preempted by erisa.the district court then asserted supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims and parties.see a.on motion for partial summary judgment by plaintiffs,the district court ruled on june,that the envirocal transaction constituted a triggering event for purposes of redemption under section of the indenture and that the esop had defaulted under the terms of that provision.in august,norcal and the esop completed a settlement with plaintiffs for the principal due on the notes,but not the interest the settlement.under the settlement,plaintiffs agreed to a broad release of all claims against all parties,excepting only their preservation of the claims against the trustee falling outside the scope of the esop contractual indemnity obligations to the trustee pursuant to section of the indenture.the district court subsequently entered orders determining the settlement to be in good faith and dismissing the released claims and parties.
in february,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint against the bank of america alone.prior to trial,norcal and the esop intervened to obtain a declaration that they had no further indemnity obligations to the bank under the indenture after the settlement.on december,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of norcal and the esop on their complaint in intervention for declaratory relief.after trial on the remaining claims,judgment on the jury verdict was entered in favor of the bank the district court denied plaintiffs motion for a new trial and entered final judgment on october.plaintiffs timely appeal,and the bank timely and.
after the verdict,the bank commenced a separate action in federal court against the esop seeking a declaration of its entitlement to indemnity under the indenture for its defense costs in light of the specific findings of the special verdict.on for summary judgment,the district court again ruled in favor of the esop on the indemnity issue.final judgment in that action was entered on august.the bank timely appeals.
ii.jurisdiction 
plaintiffs contend that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction at the time the case was removed and at the time of judgment therefore,the denial of the motion to remand was error and the proceedings and judgment must be vacated the bank,norcal,and the esop contend that plaintiffs claims for constructive fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and negligence in the state court complaint at least with respect to the plaintiffs who are also esop participants are subject to complete preemption under erisa,providing the court with subject matter jurisdiction and a federal question to anchor removal of the entire action questions of subject matter jurisdiction and removal are reviewed de novo.toumajian,at.the denial of a motion to remand a removed case by the district court is also reviewed de novo.arco envtl.remediation,dep t of health and envtl.quality,cir.
removal under requires that the complaint contain a claim within the original subject matter jurisdiction of the federal district court.toumajian,at.thus,only if we can discern a federal question was removal proper.
plaintiffs complaint did not facially assert any federal claim therefore,the original subject matter jurisdiction required to support removal exists only if erisa completely preempted any of the state law claims.see rutledge seyfarth,shaw,fairweather,geraldson,cir,amended by cir,cert.denied,d.the doctrine of complete preemption has been described as an independent corollary to the complaint rule.id.quoting harris provident life and accident ins,cir.complete preemption can be invoked only when two conditions are satisfied erisa expressly preempts the state law cause of action under a conflict preemption and that cause of action is encompassed by the scope of the civil enforcement provision of erisa,a displacement.metropolitan life ins.taylor,d rutledge,at.neither of these conditions was satisfied in this case.
conflict preemption under a 
section a states,in relevant part,that provisions of this subchapter and subchapter iii of this chapter shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan the critical phrase relate to has been the source of much confusion as well as multiple and slightly differing analyses by this court.see,rutledge,at surveying our approach to the relates to requirement but ultimately declining to develop a test describing the outer bounds of erisa conflict preemption.we recognize that while this relate to language has been construed quite broadly in the past,the supreme court has narrowed the applicability of a in recent years ever since its decision in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.see also toumajian,at acknowledging that r ecently,the scope of this broad relate to preemption was markedly narrowed quoting travelers,at.
state law relates to an erisa benefit plan if there is a connection with or reference to such a plan.blue cross anesthesia care assocs.med.group,cir quoting cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d.as we discussed in rutledge,the reference to prong of the test is fairly precise and did not apply is it applicable the state law in question did not act immediately and exclusively upon an erisa plan nor is such a plan essential to the operation of the law.at quoting dillingham,at.plaintiffs allegedly preempted claims here were solely based on state law theories of constructive fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and negligence,so the relevant state law certainly does not act immediately and exclusively on an erisa plan,nor is such a plan essential to the operation of the law.in order to determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection,we look both to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood to survive,as well as to the nature and effect of the state law on erisa plans.egelhoff egelhoff,d internal quotation marks omitted.the only argument advanced for removal,and upon which the district court relied,is that the state law claims have the necessary connection with an erisa plan because they encroach upon relationships 
we have previously recognized that a core factor leading to the conclusion that a state law claim is preempted is that the claim bears on an relationship.rutledge,at.under the rationale of a relationship test,we look to whether the state law encroaches on relationships regulated by erisa,such as between plan and plan member,plan and employer,and plan and trustee.blue cross,at.those regulated relationships that are purported to be encroached upon in this case are between i plan and parties in interest,as defined in ii plan and participants and iii plan and fiduciaries.we find none of these arguments persuasive.
with respect to the first relationship,the bank,norcal,and the esop each suggests that erisa comprehensively governed the sale of stock and extension of credit between a plan and parties in interest,such as the employees of the plan sponsor and that absent the express statutory exemptions provided by erisa,any transaction constituting a lending of money or other extension of credit between the plan and a party in interest would have been a prohibited transaction.see a b see also id.b exempting loan when primarily for the benefit of participants and beneficiaries of the plan and at an interest rate which is not in excess of a reasonable rate and e exempting acquisition by a plan of qualifying employer securities if for adequate consideration and no commission is charged.certainly that subset of plaintiffs who were current norcal employees would be parties in interest for the purposes of the prohibited transaction provision.see id.a.but the state law claims alleged in the initial complaint did not implicate the prohibited transaction provision,which serves erisa purposes by protecting a plan participants and beneficiaries from a depletion of plan assets through shady,inside deals.rutledge,at.indeed,the claims do not remotely concern the objectives of erisa.
like all plaintiffs,the employees were suing as note holders for state law fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and negligence arising from a transaction that was expressly exempted from the prohibited transaction provision their status as parties in interest is irrelevant.unlike in rutledge,where the preempted claims were premised on a relationship between a plan and a legal service provider in the very respects governed by erisa regulation of prohibited transactions,the state law claims here do not bear upon any relationship between a plan and parties in interest.see id.because the allegation at issue in the state law claims is precisely the sort of prohibited transaction governed by erisa,we hold that the claims are preempted.by carefully crafting exceptions to the transactions prohibited under erisa and the conditions for those exceptions,congress presumably understood the scope of the state law that would otherwise survive to govern such transactions in all aspects unrelated to the objectives and administration of erisa.in this way,the esop relationship with plaintiffs who were also norcal employees was no different from its relationship with the rest of the plaintiff note holders.arizona state carpenters,at as a service provider offering nonf
