these consolidated appeals require us to decide whether a b of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a b,completely preempts one or more of plaintiffs state law claims,thus providing a basis for federal question jurisdiction.plaintiffs,martin rutt rutt,michael egan egan,and connect state dental association csda,filed separate complaints in connecticut state court,and defendant,anthem health plans,anthem,removed the cases on the basis of erisa preemption.the district court denied plaintiffs motions to remand.for the following reasons,we conclude that erisa completely preempts at least some portions of rutt and egan state law claims but does not preempt csda state law claim.we also conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying rutt and egan motion to vacate or amend the judgment.therefore,we affirm in part and reverse in part the order denying plaintiffs motions to remand,reverse the order denying rutt and egan motion to vacate or amend,and remand.
background 
rutt and egan are dentists who practice in connecticut.csda is a membership organization comprised of connecticut dentists,including rutt and egan.anthem offers and administers managed health and dental plans to employers and employer groups which provide coverage to employees and their eligible dependents.many of these plans are employee welfare benefit plans governed by erisa.see.
rutt and egan participate in anthem network of dentists who provide services to individuals enrolled in anthem plans.they became participating dentists by entering into contracts with anthem provider agreement,pursuant to which they agreed to provide professional services in exchange for compensation in the amount specified in the comprehensive schedule of professional services,or the usual,customary and reasonable allowable determination.
on april,rutt and egan filed a class action complaint against anthem in connecticut state court,alleging claims for breach of contract,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,violation of the connecticut unfair trade practices act cutpa,negligent misrepresentation,and unjust enrichment.the crux of the allegations was that anthem employed a number of practices,such as improper downcoding and improper bundling,as a means of underpaying participating dentists for services they performed.csda also sued anthem in state court,alleging in a single count that anthem violated the cutpa.the factual allegations mirrored those in rutt and egan complaint.
anthem removed the cases to the united states district court for the district of connecticut on the basis that plaintiffs state law claims are completely preempted by erisa.plaintiffs filed motions to remand,but before the motions were decided,the cases were transferred by the joint judicial panel on litigation as tag along cases in the litigation titled in re managed care,pending in the southern district of florida.the florida federal district court eventually denied plaintiffs motions to remand in brief orders,citing only its previous decision on a motion to remand in another case as the basis for denying plaintiffs motions 
the district court stayed plaintiffs cases from august to april,while it addressed the cases and matters on the main track.prior to the stay,anthem filed motions to dismiss,and plaintiffs filed responses.the district court never ruled on these motions.instead,twice it denied the motions without prejudice but directed anthem to refile them.anthem refiled its motions as instructed in november and again in april.plaintiffs responded to the november motions but,due to an error of counsel,failed to respond to the april motions.the district court thus granted anthem motions based on plaintiffs failure to respond.plaintiffs then moved to vacate or amend the orders granting anthem motions,but the district court denied the motions,concluding that plaintiffs had not shown excusable neglect.plaintiffs timely appealed.

iii.motion to remand 
on a motion to remand,the removing party bears the burden of showing the existence of federal subject matter jurisdiction.pacheco de perez,cir.the test ordinarily applied for determining whether a claim arises under federal law is whether a federal question appears on the face of the plaintiff complaint.louisville nashville mottley.as a general rule,a case arises under federal law only if it is federal law that creates the cause of action.diaz sheppard,cir citing franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d.because plaintiffs complaints allege only state law claims,there is no jurisdiction under the complaint rule.
complete preemption is a narrow exception to the complaint rule and exists where the preemptive force of a federal statute is so extraordinary that it converts an ordinary state law claim into a statutory federal claim.caterpillar,williams,d.see also butero royal maccabees life ins,cir when congress comprehensively occupies a field of law,any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character and thus furnishes jurisdiction under.quoting metro.life ins.taylor,d.because federal jurisdiction turns on erisa preemption,we briefly review the two types of erisa preemption.
erisa preemption 
erisa is one of only a few federal statutes under which two types of preemption may arise conflict preemption and complete preemption 
conflict preemption,also known as defensive preemption,is a substantive defense to preempted state law claims.jones lmr int l,cir.this type of preemption arises from erisa express preemption provision,a,which preempts any state law claim that relates to an erisa plan a.because conflict preemption is merely a defense,it is not a basis for removal.gully first bank.see also ervast flexible prods,cir stating that defensive preemption provides only an affirmative defense to state law claims and is not a basis for removal.
complete preemption,also known as super preemption,is a exception to the complaint rule.it differs from defensive preemption because it is jurisdictional in nature rather than an affirmative defense.jones,at citing ervast,at.complete preemption under erisa derives from erisa civil enforcement provision,a,which has such extraordinary preemptive power that it converts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the complaint rule.taylor,at.at.consequently,any cause of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of a is removable to federal court.id.at.at.
although related,complete and defensive preemption are not coextensive 
complete preemption is narrower than defensive erisa preemption,which broadly supersede s any and all state laws insofar as they relate to any erisa plan.erisa a,a emphasis added.therefore,a claim may be defensively preempted under a but not completely preempted under a.in such a case,the defendant may assert preemption as a defense,but preemption will not provide a basis for removal to federal court.
cotton.mut.life ins,cir accord ervast,at super preemption is distinguished from defensive preemption,which provides only an affirmative defense to state law claims and is not a basis for removal.
because the propriety of removal is at issue,our analysis concerns complete preemption.
for a number of years,this court has applied the test for erisa complete preemption set forth in butero royal maccabees life insurance,cir there must be a relevant erisa plan,the plaintiff must have standing to sue under that plan,the defendant must be an erisa entity,and the complaint must seek compensatory relief akin to that available under a often this will be a claim for benefits due under a plan.id.at.a few years after butero was decided,the supreme court set forth the following inquiry for complete preemption 
i f an individual brings suit complaining of a denial of coverage for medical care,where the individual is entitled to such coverage only because of the terms of an employee benefit plan,and where no legal duty state or federal independent of erisa or the plan terms is violated,then the suit falls within the scope of erisa a b.in other words,if an individual,at some point in time,could have brought his claim under erisa a b,and where there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant actions,then the individual cause of action is completely by erisa a b.
aetna health davila,d.the davila test thus requires two inquiries whether the plaintiff could have brought its claim under a and whether no other legal duty supports the plaintiff claim.
while similar to the butero test,davila refines butero by inquiring about the existence of a separate legal duty,which is not a consideration under butero.moreover,a number of other circuits have recognized davila test as the proper test for complete preemption under erisa.see marin hosp.modesto empire traction,cir lone star assocs.aetna health,cir franciscan skemp healthcare,cent.states joint bd.health welfare trust fund,cir ups supply chain solutions,cir thurman pfizer,cir pascack valley,local ufcw welfare reimbursement plan,cir.in accordance with the supreme court directive,we too apply davila 
in davila,the plaintiffs,a participant and a beneficiary,sued their respective erisa plan administrators in state court alleging that they violated the texas health care liability act thcla by failing to exercise ordinary care in denying their claims for health care benefits under the plans.the defendants removed the cases to federal district court,arguing that the plaintiffs claims fell within the scope of erisa a and were thus completely preempted.davila,at.at.the court first considered whether the plaintiffs claims were among the types of actions that fall within the scope of erisa a b by examin ing the plaintiffs complaints,the statute on which their claims are based the thcla,and the various plan documents.id.at.at.in both instances,the plaintiff claim was based solely on the plan denial of benefits under the plan,and the defendant only relationship with the plaintiff was the administrator of the plaintiff employer erisa plan.the court concluded that the plaintiffs could have brought their claims under erisa a b because they complain ed only about denials of coverage promised under the terms of employee benefit plans and could have resorted to their remedies under erisa by filing a claim for benefits seeking a preliminary injunction.id.at.at.
the court then turned to the second part of the existence of an independent concluded that the duty upon which the plaintiffs claims were based did not arise independently of the plans.the plaintiffs argued that the duty of ordinary care imposed under the thcla was a duty independent of any duty imposed by erisa or the plan terms and,thus,was not a duty implicated by erisa civil enforcement provision.not so,the court reasoned.it noted that while the thcla does impose a duty on managed care entities to use ordinary care in making health care decisions,if a plan correctly concluded that a particular treatment was not covered,the failure of the plan itself to cover the requested treatment would be the proximate cause of any injuries arising from the denial.id.at.at footnote omitted.moreover,the court observed,because the thcla does not obligate a managed health care entity to provide any particular coverage,interpretation of the terms of the plaintiffs benefit plans forms an essential part of their thcla claim and liability would exist only because of the defendants administration of benefit plans.id.at.at.in other words,the court explained,the defendants potential liability under the thcla in these cases derives entirely from the particular rights and obligations established by the benefit plans.id.
rutt and egan complaint 
before turning to the preemption analysis of rutt and egan complaint,we make some general observations regarding complete preemption of healthcare provider claims under erisa.
first,healthcare provider claims are usually not subject to complete preemption because h ealthcare providers generally are not considered beneficiaries or participants under erisa.hobbs blue cross blue shield of,cir citing cagle bruner,cir see also pascack valley,at we conclude that the hospital could not have brought its claims under a because the hospital does not have standing to sue under that statute.in re managed care,d noting that only two categories of and authorized to sue for benefits under a b.moreover,such claims often are not the type of claims that could be brought under a because they do not duplicate,supplement,or supplant the erisa civil enforcement remedy.davila,at.at.for example,a healthcare provider claims of negligent misrepresentation and estoppel based on a plan oral misrepresentations are not erisa claims because they do not arise from the plan or its terms franciscan skemp,at.
second,it is in this and most other circuits that a healthcare provider may acquire derivative standing to sue under erisa by obtaining a written assignment from a participant or beneficiary of his right to payment of medical benefits.hobbs,at citing cagle,at.claims for benefits by healthcare providers pursuant to an assignment are thus within the scope of a.
finally,a provider that has received an assignment of benefits and has a state law claim independent of the claim arising under the assignment holds two separate claims.in such a case,the provider may assert a claim for benefits under erisa,the state law claim,or both.see franciscan skemp,at franciscan skemp could bring erisa claims in romine shoes as a beneficiary for the denial of benefits under the plan but it has not franciscan skemp is basing its claims on a conversation to which romine was not even a party.emphasis in original marin hosp.modesto empire traction,cir noting that the instant claim was based on a telephone conversation in which the plan had agreed to pay of the patient charges and that the hospital had already been paid part of the charges pursuant to an assignment from the patient.thus,so long as the provider state law claim does not fall within a,the existence of the assignment is irrelevant to complete preemption if the provider asserts no claim under the assignment.sheridan,neighborhood health,d.
the third,fifth,and ninth circuits have applied these principals to determine the line of demarcation between erisa and state law claims in actions brought by healthcare providers.
in blue cross of california anesthesia care associates medical group,cir,the ninth circuit held that healthcare providers claims for breach of their provider agreements with blue cross were not completely preempted,even though they had received assignments from patients who were beneficiaries of erisa plans.the providers agreements with blue cross required blue cross to identify providers in the information it distributed to members of the plan and to direct members to those providers.id.at.in return,the providers agreed to accept payment from blue cross for the services they rendered pursuant to specified fee schedules.id.after blue cross changed the fee schedules,the providers filed a class action in state court alleging that blue cross breached the provider agreements by improperly amending the fee schedules and by violating its implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under california law.blue cross thereafter removed the case to federal court.the federal district court remanded the case to state court.
on appeal,the ninth circuit held that the providers breach of contract claims were not within the scope of a b because the providers breach of contract claims arose solely out of their provider agreements.in other words,the claims were not claims for benefits that could be asserted by the.id.at.the ninth circuit differentiated the breach of provider contract claims from erisa claims as follows 
t he providers are asserting contractual breaches,and related violations of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,that their could not assert the patients simply are not parties to the provider agreements between the providers and blue cross.the dispute here is not over the right to payment,which might be said to depend on the patients assignments to the providers,but the amount,or level,of payment,which depends on the terms of the provider agreements.
id.at emphasis in original.because the providers state law claims arose out of separate agreements with blue cross that governed their provision of goods and services to plan members,the assignments were irrelevant to preemption.id.at.
the third circuit,in pascack valley hospital,local ufcw welfare reimbursement plan,cir,a case,found no preemption under facts similar to those in anesthesia care.in pascack valley,the plaintiff hospital entered into a network hospital agreement with magnet,an independent consultant that had organized a provider network to provide services at discounted rates to beneficiaries of group health plans in exchange for the plans promises to encourage beneficiaries to use network providers.id.at.there were two contracts,the agreement between the hospital and magnet and the agreement between magnet and the plan,or subscriber subscriber agreement.the subscriber agreement required the plan to pay the hospital within a certain time,otherwise the plan would forfeit the discounted rate.the hospital submitted claims for services provided to two erisa beneficiaries.the defendant plan paid the claims,but the hospital asserted that the payment was untimely and the plan had forfeited the discounted rate.id.the hospital sued the plan in state court alleging that it was a third party beneficiary of the subscriber agreement,and the plan removed to federal court.
applying davila,the third circuit concluded the hospital claims were not completely preempted because the hospital lacked standing to sue under a.id.at.more specifically,the court found that the plan,as the removing party,failed to meet its burden of showing that the hospital had obtained an requisite of derivative standing id.at.although this conclusion was dispositive,the court went on to observe that even if the hospital had an assignment,its claims would not be preempted under davila because they were based on a separate duty independent of erisa.while it acknowledged that the hospital claims existed only because of an erisa plan,the court observed that claims at issue did not implicate the plan 
coverage and eligibility are not in dispute.instead the resolution of this lawsuit requires interpretation of the subscriber agreement,not the plan.the hospital right to recover,if it exists,depends entirely on the operation of contracts executed by the plan that are independent of the plan itself.
id.at citing caterpillar,williams,d.the court also identified a number of compelling similarities between that case and anesthesia care the hospital claims arose from an agreement independent of the plan participants and beneficiaries of the plan were apparently not parties to the subscriber agreement and the dispute was unrelated to assignments or the plan terms because it involved the amount of payment under the subscriber agreement,not the right to payment,which might require interpretation of the plan.id.at quoting anesthesia care,at.
in a recent decision,lone star associates aetna health,cir,the fifth circuit adopted the ninth circuit rate of payment versus right of payment test for distinguishing a provider state law claims from a claim for benefits under erisa.the plaintiff,lone star,entered into a provider agreement with aetna,an insurer that administered erisa plans.lone star sued aetna in state court under the texas prompt pay act tppa,alleging that aetna had not paid lone star claims for services at the rates set forth in the provider agreement.lone star attached a list of the disputed claims to its complaint.aetna removed the case,citing certain payment claims it argued were preempted because coverage had been denied.the district court granted lone star leave to amend its pleadings to remove the claims that were denied for lack of coverage and then granted lone star motion to remand on the basis that all of the remaining claims had been partially paid.id.at.
because lone star standing was not at issue,the fifth circuit preemption analysis under davila turned on whether lone star allegation that aetna failed to pay claims at the rate established in the provider agreement was based on a duty independent of the erisa plan at issue.while acknowledging that the provider agreement and the plan each other and it might be necessary to refer to the plan in order to determine the correct payment rate,the court held that lone star claims arose independently of the plan 
though the plan and the provider agreement each other,the terms of the particular,those related to not at issue in a dispute over whether aetna paid the correct rate for covered services as set out in the provider agreement.while aetna is correct that any determination of benefits under the terms of a,what is medically necessary or a covered service does fall within erisa,lone star claims are entirely separate from coverage and arise out of the independent legal duty contained in the contract and the tppa.
id.at.notwithstanding this conclusion,the court recognized that lone star claims may still be at least partially preempted because aetna asserted that some of the partially paid claims actually reflected partial denials of services that were not covered.lone star disputed this characterization,but the record was insufficient to allow the court to resolve the factual issue.in order to guide the district court on remand,the fifth circuit held that while claims involving only underpayment are not preempted,claims that were partially denied because coverage was not afforded for all the submitted procedures may be preempted.id.at.
we agree with these courts that the rate of payment and right of payment distinction is a useful means for assessing preemption of healthcare provider claims based upon a breach of an agreement separate from an erisa plan and thus apply it in considering rutt and egan claims.
first davila inquiry 
the first inquiry is whether rutt and egan,at some point in time,could have brought their claim under erisa b b.davila,at.at.this part of the test is satisfied if two requirements are met the plaintiff claim must fall within the scope of erisa and the plaintiff must have standing to sue under erisa.id.at.at marin,at.we first consider whether the claims are within the scope of a b,because if they are not,standing to assert them is irrelevant.
rutt and egan argue that their claims are not cognizable under a because the relief they seek is unavailable under erisa.they stress that they are not seeking benefits under an erisa plan,but instead seek to collect unpaid amounts they are owed under their provider agreements as a result of anthem use of improper payment methods,such as downcoding and bundling,under the guise of utilization review.moreover,they assert,their state law claims are the types of claims federal courts have consistently held are not even defensively preempted under erisa.the court emphasized in davila,however,that merely referring to labels affixed to claims to distinguish between preempted and claims is not helpful because doing so would elevate form over substance and allow parties to evade the scope of erisa.davila,at.at quoting lueck,d.
the factual allegations of the complaint do support rutt and egan argument that their claims involve the rate of payment under their provider agreements yet,a closer look discloses more.plaintiffs allegations implicate not only the rate of payment under their provider agreements,but also the right of payment.for example,in paragraph a under class allegations,rutt and egan allege that anthem breached its contractual obligations by engaging in various acts,including systematically denying reducing dentists reimbursement for medically necessary services through i improper denials.and,in paragraph b,rutt and egan allege that anthem denied medically necessary claims through the use of guidelines which do not comply with accepted treatment standards.as the fifth circuit observed in lone star,such allegations concern coverage issues that fall within erisa.lone star,at.finally,paragraphs g and h complain that anthem committed erisa procedural violations by failing to provide an adequate explanation for the denial of claims for reimbursement and failing to ensure that procedures exist to properly consider plaintiffs and members of the class claims for reimbursement,both initially and in the appeals process.significantly,the provider agreements say nothing about anthem obligations to provide an explanation when it denies a claim for reimbursement or to provide procedures for reviewing claims for reimbursement.rather,erisa imposes those obligations.and requiring every erisa plan to provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits has been denied and to afford a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of denied claims.rutt and egan repeated these same allegations in paragraphs a,g and h as part of their general factual allegations and again in paragraphs a,g and h as part of their breach of contract claim 
what we have,then,is really a hybrid claim,part of which is within a and part of which is beyond the scope of erisa.because rutt and egan complain,at least in part,about denials of benefits and other erisa violations,their breach of contract claim implicates erisa.
rutt and egan must have had standing to assert erisa claims,and because they are providers,they could only have derivative standing through assignments.thus,unlike anesthesia care,supra,the existence of assignments does matter in this case.in the district court,anthem presented claim forms that rutt and egan submitted to anthem for reimbursement for dental services.lynn appicelli,a project manager in anthem government programs division,confirmed in an affidavit that the attached forms were typical of claim forms that anthem receives from connecticut dentists.the claim forms contain the following language i hereby authorize payment of the dental benefits otherwise payable to me directly to the below named dental entity.anthem contends that these claim forms suffice to show an assignment of benefits by rutt and egan patients.we agree.
rutt and egan contend that the claim forms can not be valid assignments for two reasons,both of which we reject first,they point out that each of the three sample plan documents anthem submitted preclude assignments.for example,they note that the first plan states the member or covered person may not assign benefits to a provider,except when parents are divorced.citing physicians multispecialty group health care plan of horton homes,cir,in which this court held that an unambiguous provision renders an assignment ineffective,rutt and egan contend that any purported assignment by their patients was invalid.as anthem notes,however,each of the sample plans also contains an exception specifically permitting the assignment of dental benefits notwithstanding the terms of any provision regarding the payment of benefits a member may assign the benefits to a dentist or oral surgeon in accordance with the connecticut laws concerning assignment of benefits to a dentist or oral surgeon.thus,the plans specifically authorized the assignments to rutt and egan.
rutt and egan also contend that the claim forms are ineffective to create standing because they convey only the right to receive payment of benefits and not the patient right to file an action under a.they cite a number of unreported district court cases holding that an assignment of the right to payment of benefits that does not include the right to pursue litigation is not an unequivocal assignment that creates derivative erisa standing.see north jersey ctr.for surgery,horizon blue cross blue shield of,haa,wl,at,the scope of the assignment is essential to establishing derivative standing as courts have made distinctions between assignments that only give the provider the right to reimbursement for medical are not erisa assignments that give the provider a full assignment of benefits,which are erisa claims.citing cooper hosp.med.ctr.seafarers health benefits plan,wl,at,and touro infirmary am.officer,wl,at,somerset orthopedic,aetna life ins,mlc,wl,at,holding that the defendant failed to show an assignment sufficient for erisa preemption purposes,as the assignment authorizes nothing more than direct payment to the plaintiff.we find these cases unpersuasive and decline to follow them.our own cases confirm that assignment of the right to payment is enough to create standing.healthcare providers may acquire derivative standing by obtaining a written assignment from a beneficiary or participant of his right to payment of benefits under an plan.physicians multispecialty group,at citing hobbs,at see also hca health servs.of,employers health ins,cir recognizing standing based on an assignment authorizing payment of insurance benefits directly to the provider.moreover,as noted in cagle bruner,cir,in which this court first recognized derivative standing,an assignment furthers erisa purposes only if the provider can enforce the right to payment.
of course,an assignment will not facilitate a plan participant or beneficiary receipt of benefits if the plan does not pay the benefits it owes,and are not permitted to sue on the participant or beneficiary behalf.if can not sue the erisa plan for payment,they will bill the participant or beneficiary directly for the insured medical bills,and the participant or beneficiary will be required to bring suit against the benefit plan when claims go unpaid.on the other hand,if can sue for payment of benefits,an assignment will transfer the burden of bringing suit from plan participants and beneficiaries to providers,who are better situated and financed to pursue an action for benefits owed for their services.
id.at citations omitted alteration in original.see also servs.of,inn dev,d,an assignment to receive payment of benefits necessarily incorporates the right to seek payment.as plaintiff argues,the right to receive benefits would be hollow without such enforcement capabilities.finally,as the seventh circuit observed in kennedy connecticut general life insurance,cir,cited with approval in cagle,all one needs for standing under erisa is a colorable claim for benefits,and t he possibility of direct payment is enough to establish subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.rutt and egan rights to direct payment of benefits are thus sufficient to confer standing.
we conclude that anthem has carried its burden of showing that rutt and egan received valid assignments from their erisa patients.furthermore,although anthem did not link any particular assignment to a particular erisa plan,the appicelli affidavit sufficiently demonstrates that the submitted assignments in the claim forms are representative of assignments rutt and egan received for services they rendered,which would necessarily include patients covered by erisa plans administered by anthem.
second davila inquiry 
the second inquiry is whether rutt and egan claims are predicated on a legal duty that is independent of erisa.our analysis above answers this question.rutt and egan argue that their claims are based on a separate legal duty arising from their provider agreements.this is true to the extent their claims implicate only the amount they were owed under their provider agreements.but,as noted,their claims stray from the boundaries of their provider agreements into erisa territory by asserting improper denials of medically necessary claims and violations of erisa procedural requirements.consequently,portions of their claims arise solely under erisa or erisa plans and not from any independent legal duty.
as for the remaining claims,where removal jurisdiction exists over a completely preempted claim,the district court has jurisdiction over any claims joined with the preempted claim.butero,at citing c.therefore,the district court may exercise jurisdiction over rutt and egan state law c
