kelly neumann brought an action in state court alleging that at t retaliated against her for filing a workers compensation claim and failed to accommodate her disability under,subd.and.her case was removed to the district court on the ground that her claims were completely preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,insofar as her claims required the court to construe her employer disability plan.after removal of her original action,neumann filed a related lawsuit in the district court alleging state and federal causes of action against at t and gates mcdonald company.
neumann two actions were consolidated by the district court.the district court denied neumann motion to remand the case to state court,and then dismissed neumann claim that at t violated the minnesota human rights act mhra by failing to accommodate her disability.the court later granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all of neumann federal claims,and then remanded to state court her one remaining claim premised on,subd.on appeal,neumann argues that the district court erred by declining to remand her state court action,by dismissing her claim under the mhra,and by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on her federal claims.we affirm.
neumann worked for at t as a customer sales and service specialist.she had serious back problems dating back to at least.on october,neumann returned to work after having been out for several days for back treatment.that very day,neumann slipped and fell in the office while reaching for reference books.as a result,she experienced pain in her lower back and was taken to a hospital emergency room.
neumann did not work during the ensuing months.she was evaluated and treated by a buttermann,as well as other physicians.these physicians arrived at conclusions about neumann physical limitations,as well as the extent to which her lower back condition was a result of the accident on october,as opposed to earlier injuries.
neumann was a participant in at t sickness and accident disability benefit plan sadbp,an plan which provides participants with disability benefits.at t funds the sadbp and acts as plan administrator.at t contracted with appellee gates mcdonald company to administer certain aspects of the sadbp claims procedure.the sadbp contemplates two mutually exclusive categories of benefits sickness benefits,which are governed by section of the plan,and accident benefits which are covered by section.for purposes of the sadbp,sickness includes injury other than accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment by the company the sadbp further specifies in section that accidental injuries are those that result solely from an accident during and in direct connection with the performance of neumann job duties.
pursuant to sadbp section,plan payments are coordinated with workers compensation benefits.an employee who is eligible for both workers compensation and sadbp benefits may receive payments from the plan only up to the amount,if any,by which the plan benefit exceeds the amount mandated by the workers compensation law.
at t ultimately classified neumann injury as a sickness under the sadbp.the amount of sickness benefits payable varies depending on an employee tenure.based on neumann net credited service at the time of the accident,she was entitled to a maximum of weeks of full pay,followed by weeks at her salary,for a total of no more than weeks pursuant to sadbp section c.after weeks,however,neumann received of her salary because that amount of payment was required by workers compensation law,even though it exceeded sadbp sickness disability benefit.thus,neumann received sadbp sickness benefits and workers compensation benefits for a period of weeks.had neumann condition been characterized as an accident under the sadbp,her eligibility for benefits would not have been limited to a total of weeks,and she asserts that her employment would have been assured during the period of her disability.
while she was not working,neumann received a number of written notices pertaining to her benefits.on december,gates mcdonald informed neumann that her claim for benefits under the accident sadbp plan was denied.by separate letter of the same date,gates mcdonald advised that neumann was eligible for benefits under the workers compensation plan.on march,at t sent neumann a notice indicating that if neumann continued to be absent beyond expiration of her sickness disability benefits under the sadbp,she could consider applying for social security disability insurance benefits.the letter further stated that if neumann continue d to receive sickness disability benefits under the sadbp for approximately nine months,then she would receive information regarding long term disability benefits.on july,at t sent neumann a notice advising that i f you expire your sickness disability benefit entitlement,your employment will be terminated and all benefits may terminate at the end of october.this letter also explained how to apply for long term disability benefits.
neumann claims to have asked a employee at at t,mark peterson,and a representative of cigna,the administrator of at t long term disability plan,about the july,letter.neumann asserts that these persons told her that the letter did not apply to neumann because she was receiving workers compensation benefits.
neumann contends that she planned to return to work,albeit with certain restrictions,on september.according to neumann,at t instructed her not to report for work and cancelled ergonomic modifications to her work station.in a letter dated september,at t told neumann,y our weeks of sickness disability benefits will end on october.the health affairs organization has advised us that you will not be returning to work.therefore,you will be taken off the active payroll effective october.ultimately,neumann was terminated by at 
on january,neumann sued at t in minnesota state court.neumann claimed that she was discharged in retaliation for seeking workers compensation benefits,in violation of,subd,and that at t had refused to offer continued employment to her when employment was available within her physical limitations,in violation of,subd.after the state court litigation reached the stage of a motion for summary judgment,at t removed the action to the district court on the ground that neumann claims were preempted by erisa.
on august,neumann appealed the classification of her injury as a sickness under the sadbp to the at t benefit claim and appeal committee bcac.under the sadbp,the bcac is granted complete discretionary authority to interpret plan terms and make eligibility determinations.the bcac is the final review committee with respect to all appeals by sadbp participants.the bcac reviewed neumann medical records and other reports.on october,the bcac issued a written decision concluding that neumann back condition did not arise solely from her october,accident at the workplace,and the exception of the day of the was entitled to sickness,not accident,benefits.
during this period,neumann moved the district court to remand her lawsuit to state court.in an order dated november,the district court denied her motion to remand and ruled that neumann claims were completely preempted by erisa.neumann v.at t communications,wl,at.the district court examined neumann claim,as well as her state court summary judgment brief,and concluded that neumann claims under.rest ed on allegations that at t violated its erisa plan,and that the court had to interpret the sadbp in order to determine the merit of her claims.neumann,wl,at.therefore,the court concluded,neumann was seeking to recover benefits allegedly due to her under the terms of her plan,and that her claim arose under federal law.
neumann responded in december by filing another lawsuit in federal district court against at t and gates mcdonald.neumann amended complaint alleged estoppel and ratification and erisa violations against at t and gates mcdonald in counts i and ii,respectively.count iii alleged a violation of the minnesota human rights act mhra,subd,against at count iv alleged retaliatory discharge in violation of,subd,against gates mcdonald.the district court consolidated this second action with neumann original action that had been removed from state court.
on august,the district court granted at t motion to dismiss neumann mhra claim on the ground that it was preempted by the minnesota workers compensation act.neumann v.at t communications,wl,at.additionally,the district court reaffirmed its november,decision that neumann retaliatory discharge claim under was completely preempted by erisa,but amended its previous order to reflect that neumann claim alleging refusal to offer continued employment under was not completely preempted by erisa.the district court nevertheless exercised pendant jurisdiction over that claim.
on may,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of at t and gates mcdonald on neumann erisa and estoppel claims.neumann v.at t communications,wl at.may.since no federal causes of action remained,the district court remanded neumann remaining claim to state court pursuant to c.id.at.
neumann challenges the district court conclusion that her state court action was removable to federal court under the doctrine of complete preemption.that doctrine provides that congress may so completely a particular area that any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character.metropolitan life ins.taylor,d.claims arising under the civil enforcement provision of section a of erisa,a,including a claim to recover benefits or enforce rights under the terms of an erisa plan,implicate one such area of complete preemption.congress intended that an action brought to recover benefits or enforce rights that were allegedly denied contrary to the terms of an erisa benefit plan will be regarded as arising under the laws of the united states,even if the complaint filed by the plan beneficiary purports to raise only a cause of action.metropolitan life,at.thus,where a claim relate s to any employee benefit plan,a,such that the claim is preempted by federal law,pilot life ins.dedeaux,d,and the claim seeks to recover benefits due or enforce rights under the terms of a plan,a,such that the exclusive cause of action is under federal law,then the action is subject to removal.metropolitan life,at.
as noted,neumann claims in her state court complaint were that at t unlawfully discharged her in retaliation for receiving workers compensation benefits,and that at t unlawfully refused to offer continued employment to neumann despite the availability of employment within her physical limitations.neumann brief opposing at t state court motion for summary judgment,however,made clear that her claims related to the at t benefit plan governed by erisa.neumann argued that at t own policy manuals and sickness and accident disability plans conclusively demonstrate that at t violated its own plans and policies when it terminated plaintiff,after she received weeks of workers compensation benefits.she asserted that at t application of it sic own written policies and procedures demonstrated the merit of her claims.she argued that a review of the three disability plans sickness,accident,and workers compensation offered by at t was necessary to understand the fallacy of at t argument on the motion for summary judgment.and,as the district court observed,she spent several pages citing various portions of the sadbp and arguing in favor of a certain interpretation of the plan.
we conclude that neumann retaliatory discharge claim is completely preempted by erisa.the erisa preemption clause is conspicuous for its breadth,fmc holliday,d,and state law relate s to a benefit plan if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.shaw delta air lines,d.neumann implicitly concedes that a claim relates to an erisa plan where resolution of the claim is substantially dependent on an analysis of the terms of the benefit plan.see rice panchal,cir carter ford motor,cir section of labor management relations act preempts state tort claims where resolution of the claim is substantially dependent upon an analysis of the terms or provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.
like the district court,we believe the heart of the lawsuit filed in state court is neumann claim that at t violated its erisa plan by classifying neumann condition as a sickness rather than an accident.neumann arguments require interpretation of the plan,and those arguments do not affect the plan in merely a tenuous,remote or peripheral manner.shaw delta air lines,d.rather,the success or failure of neumann claims would impact the relationship between the sadbp and its participants,the structure of the sadbp,and sadbp administration and finances.see bannister sorenson,cir listing factors bearing on whether claims relate to erisa.
neumann claim also involves an attempt to recover benefits that she alleges are due to her under the benefit plan,so her exclusive cause of action is under section a of erisa.this case is unlike those in which a plan participant merely seeks to recover lost plan benefits as damages for a wrongful discharge from employment that is unrelated to the benefit plan,campbell aerospace,cir.here,as described above,the merits of neumann retaliatory discharge claim are substantially dependent on her assertion that at t incorrectly classified her injury under the sadbp.accordingly,we hold that the doctrine of complete preemption applies to neumann state court complaint,and that removal to federal court was proper 
neumann next argues that even if the removal was proper,the district court erred in granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on neumann federal claims.we disagree.
neumann argues that at t and gates mcdonald improperly denied her claim for accident benefits under the sadbp.because the plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits we ordinarily would review the administrator determination for an abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.under that standard,we uphold an administrator interpretation of the plan if it is reasonable,even if the reviewing court disagrees with the interpretation.hebert sbc pension benefit plan,cir.neumann argues that we should apply a less deferential standard of review,because at t and gates mcdonald committed serious procedural irregularities that had some connection to the substantive decision reached on neumann claim.see woo deluxe,cir.
we are not persuaded that the ordinary standard of review should be altered.for heightened review to apply,a beneficiary claiming procedural irregularities must show that the plan administrator,in the exercise of its power,acted dishonestly,acted from an improper motive,or failed to use judgment in reaching its decision.buttram central states,areas health welfare fund,cir citing restatement second of trusts.the beneficiary must demonstrate not only procedural irregularities,but also that any such irregularities caused a serious breach of the trustee fiduciary duty to the plan beneficiary.id.the irregularities must have some connection to the substantive decision reached,such that they leave a reviewing court with serious doubts as to whether the result reached was the product of an arbitrary decision or the plan administrator whim,or demonstrate that the actual decision was reached without reflection and judgment.id.at.otherwise,a deferential standard of review is appropriate.id.
in support of her claim that the benefit determination suffered from procedural irregularities,neumann asserts that gates mcdonald failed to consider certain medical evidence when it initially denied accident benefits,that at t and gates did not provide adequate notice that neumann was receiving sickness benefits,and that gates did not provide a written explanation of its denial of accident benefits and of neumann right to appeal.when it considered neumann appeal from the initial denial by gates,however,the bcac considered neumann medical records and rehabilitation reports that were contained in the administrative record the bcac also waived the normal timeliness requirements for the appeal,thus avoiding any prejudice to neumann arising from the absence
