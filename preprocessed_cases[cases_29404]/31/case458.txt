in this erisa appeal,we consider whether metropolitan life insurance company metlife abused its discretion in denying the claim for disability ltd benefits filed by robert evans.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of metlife,finding that metlife did not abuse its discretion.for the following reasons,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
evans,a nuclear fuels engineer employed at bwx technologies,b w,began experiencing abdominal pain and fatigue in february.evans first received treatment from his family physician,kim wright,but his abdominal pain persisted.wright referred evans to a gastroenterologist.both wright and the gastroenterologist diagnosed evans as suffering from chronic abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome ibs.
despite his condition,evans continued to work from february through december.commencing december,evans was given a week off from work.wright thereafter continued evans off work for more than six months.evans childhood stuttering returned,so wright referred him to a psychologist,daniel owens,for assessment in january.owens continued treating evans through at least september.while evans was away from work,wright also referred him to another gastroenterologist at the university of virginia for a second opinion.that doctor changed evans medications,which provided some relief.
because evans was feeling somewhat better,wright thought it would be appropriate to return evans to work at b w on june.wright hoped that once evans returned to the routine of his job that his condition might continue to improve.over the next six weeks,evans worked sporadically he worked some days and some days,but he also took off several sick days.his last day at work was july.evans took several more leave days thereafter until august,when it appears b w placed him on approved medical leave of absence.
b w offers its employees ltd benefits through a group disability insurance policy the plan issued by metlife.metlife is also the administrator of the plan.b w filed the initial ltd application form with metlife on behalf of evans on august.on the form,b w indicated that evans date last worked was december,but that his date returned to work was june.
metlife then contacted evans,requesting that he submit several other forms and documentation.in response,evans stated on his disability claim employee statement that his date last worked was august,and that the date disability began was december.he also explained that he was at that time suffering from almost constant abdominal pain,had frequent urges to use the restroom often with less than seconds warning,spent from two to six hours every day in the restroom,and was generally mentally exhausted.
evans also submitted attending physician statements from some of his treating doctors.the first gastroenterologist indicated that he had treated evans for ibs but had last seen him on june,few days before evans returned to work wright stated that evans was suffering from ibs.she also indicated that she had discussed with evans before august the possibility that he might be disabled from performing his job but that she definitely advised evans to cease his job as of august.owens indicated that he advised evans to cease his job as of july.
metlife denied evans claim for disability,concluding that there was no evidence supporting his claimed inability to perform his job.metlife also concluded there was no medical documentation establishing that evans was suffering from ibs.
evans hired a lawyer to appeal metlife denial.the lawyer wrote a lengthy letter outlining the purported errors made by metlife in its review.the lawyer also submitted letters from wright and owens further explaining their opinions that evans became disabled on about his last day at.the lawyer also submitted a copy of the social security administration award of disability benefits to evans effective december.the lawyer insisted that the evidence showed that evans was disabled as of december.
metlife reviewed this new documentation,but affirmed its original denial of evans ltd claim.metlife stated that evans last day of work was december,july,as the record clearly that there was no evidence to support a disabling impairment as of december.in support of this finding,metlife relied in part on the opinions of wright and owens that evans did not become disabled until on or about august.
evans then filed this erisa lawsuit against metlife,seeking to recover benefits under the plan.metlife moved for summary judgment,arguing that it properly exercised its discretion in deciding that evans had failed to establish that he was totally disabled when he quit work on december.in his written response,evans argued,in effect,that metlife failed to give adequate weight to the evidence evans submitted.evans did not expressly argue in his brief that metlife should have determined whether he was disabled as of august rather than as of december.
the district court held a hearing on metlife motion for summary judgment.during the hearing,metlife contended that it was evans burden,pursuant to the plan requirements,to show that he was totally disabled from the time he quit,thereafter through a elimination period.although metlife has never stated a specific date,this elimination period would have expired,based on metlife interpretation of the plan,on june,before evans returned to work on june.
evans countered,for the first time before the district court,that the disability determination should have been made as of august,after evans returned to work.in reply,metlife conceded that there was some medical evidence in the record that evans was disabled as of august,but metlife insisted that the proper date to determine disability was as of december,and during the subsequent elimination period.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of metlife,ruling that metlife decision to deny benefits resulted from a reasoned,disciplined,deliberative process.the district court did not,however,indicate whether the proper date to determine disability was as of december,or august 
evans now appeals,arguing that metlife use of december as the date to determine disability contravenes the terms of the plan.he contends that metlife abused its discretion by ignoring evidence that he was totally disabled as of august 
when an erisa plaintiff appeals a grant of summary judgment,we conduct a de novo review,applying the same standards that the district court employed.ellis metropolitan life ins,cir.in cases in which the erisa benefit plan gives the administrator of the plan discretion to determine eligibility for benefits,we review a denial of benefits by the administrator for abuse of discretion.id.at.under this deferential standard,we will not disturb the administrator decision if it is reasonable,even if we would have come to a different conclusion independently.booth stores,cir.such a decision is reasonable if it is the result of a deliberate and principled reasoning process and is supported by substantial evidence.brogan holland,cir.
in this case,it is undisputed that the plan gives metlife discretionary authority to determine entitlement to plan benefits.thus,we review metlife denial of evans claim for benefits for an abuse of discretion.however,because metlife is both administrator of the plan and its insurer,a conflict of interest exists,and that conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether an abuse of discretion occurred.see ellis,at 
metlife insists that evans could not recover benefits unless he proved that he was totally disabled when he quit work in december and continuously through the elimination period.metlife brief.metlife claims that evans failed to produce any evidence that he was disabled during this particular,through june.metlife relies in part on the opinions of wright and evans should have ceased work no earlier than july,suggest that evans was not disabled from december,through june.
we do not agree that evans was necessarily required to prove that he was disabled from december,through june.first,evans did not quit work on december.although evans did not work from december,through june
