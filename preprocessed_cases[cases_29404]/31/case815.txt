allen tegtmeier sued the midwest operating engineers pension trust fund the pension fund for improper administration and breach of fiduciary duties under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,alleging the defendant improperly calculated his disability award.both parties moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the pension fund motion.tegtmeier appeals.we affirm.
a.the plan at issue 
allen tegtmeier was an operating engineer who participated in the midwest operating engineers pension plan the pension plan,which the pension fund administers.the pension plan addresses when a disability pension begins,providing that the payment of a total and permanent disability pension shall be effective as of the first day of the month next following the date the participant files an application for total and permanent disability pension emphasis added.thus,the date a person becomes disabled does not trigger payment of disability benefits rather,benefits begin the month following the date the participant applies for the pension.
in and,special significance attached to this effective date under the pension plan because of a major change to another plan covering tegtmeier,the midwest operating engineers health and welfare plan the health and welfare plan.this plan also provided benefits to a disabled member,though the benefits only lasted for one year.beginning in april,the health and welfare plan began a transition in welfare payment rates by members.through,all members paid the same monthly rate to the health and welfare fund for welfare benefits received during a participant retirement or when the participant was receiving disability benefits in an effort to reward seniority,however,the health and welfare fund trustees decided to implement a new schedule beginning in january this new schedule provided that participants with less seniority would pay greater monthly welfare rates in the case of retirement or disability than under the previous flat rate,while those with greater seniority and who had paid greater amounts to the health and welfare fund over the course of their careers would pay less than under the flat rate.this meant,in many cases,that if a participant filed for a disability pension before january,he would pay much less in monthly rates than if he filed after january,when the new scheduled kicked in.for a participant of ten to fourteen years seniority who became disabled,such as tegtmeier,it was the difference between paying a monthly rate of to the health and welfare fund effective date of disability and paying a monthly rate of to the health and welfare fund effective date of disability.
in addition to the effective date,the second provision of particular importance in this case concerns the claims administration procedure after an application is filed.for applications filed before january,section of the pension plan applies.this section states,in relevant part 
a unless special circumstances exist,a participant shall be informed of the trustees decision on his claim within days of the date the claim is received,whether or not all the information and evidence necessary to process the claim is received.within such period,the participant shall receive the administrative manager decision or a notice that 
i explains the special circumstances requiring a delay in the decision,and 
ii sets a date,no later than days after his claim has been received,by which he can expect to receive a decision.
the participant may assume that his claim has been denied and may proceed to appeal the denial if the participant does not receive any notice from the administrative manager within the period.
the remainder of section details what should be contained in a notice from the administrative manager and the review procedure when an application for benefits has been disapproved.
tegtmeier disability 
tegtmeier injured his back at work on july.following this injury,he began to receive weekly disability benefits from the health and welfare fund that had a period of eligibility,ending on july.tegtmeier did not immediately seek disability benefits from the pension fund which would have displaced payments from the health and welfare fund.in fact,he did not inquire into obtaining these pension benefits until october.the next day,the pension fund sent him an application,which he did not return until november,the last date to qualify as a filing.
after filing his application,however,tegtmeier showed reluctance to proceed with the actual determination of his disability status under the pension plan.on january,the pension fund sent tegtmeier a letter stating that it did not have sufficient information to process his claim.the pension fund noted that he had failed to provide a medical examiner report and gave him until march,an additional days,to comply.the letter ended with the warning i f you do not provide this information,your claim will be denied.
instead of providing this information promptly,tegtmeier waited nearly a month before taking action.at that time,tegtmeier talked to an unidentified person at the pension fund,who told him that he could put his application on hold.tegtmeier then wrote a letter on february,received by judith kot of the pension fund,requesting that the pension fund put his application on hold.
please put my application for my disability pension on hold.as of this date,i have not had my surgery.i been advised even with a successful sic procedure,i should not return to operation of rough riding heavy equip.ie.sic dozers,earthmovers,loaders,sic my situation is still uncertin sic and at this time i feel this is in my best interest.
there is no record of any response by the pension fund to tegtmeier note.
on may,the pension fund sent tegtmeier another letter requesting medical records.this may letter referenced the earlier letter and day extension,stating t his is to notify you that we have not received all medical records to date.the pension fund asked for updates on all notes from january of onward and gave another day extension,which ended on june.on may,tegtmeier responded to this letter,stating that he had surgery scheduled for may,and request ed another extension of at least days or more.there is no record of any response by the pension fund to tegtmeier letter.tegtmeier underwent back surgery on may.
on july,tegtmeier called the pension fund to discuss the status of his application.the pension fund stated that he would need to file a new application with medical documentation.kot sent him a new application,which tegtmeier completed and filed on july.the next day,he sent the pension fund a letter stating in pertinent part 
i hereby request that my initial application for disability dated be still in affect sic i had no idea the importance of maintaining this date due to program changes,ie.sic effects,afterwards sic.i believe i was not completely informed and actually was vaguelly sic mislead sic.
despite tegtmeier pleas,the pension fund review board approved the july application for disability benefits with an effective date of august,and denied his request to use the date of his first application for determining the monthly payments he owed to the health and welfare fund.the review board explained that y ou put your pension application on hold in february of and then notified the fund in may that you were not ready to apply for pension.the fund closed the application process and requested that you submit a new application when you were ready to pursue it.
tegtmeier appealed the review board decision to the pension fund appeal review panel,which initially denied the appeal.tegtmeier then asked for reconsideration,which led to a hearing as well as a november,decision from the review panel that was final,conclusive and binding.before the review panel,tegtmeier acknowledged that he was attempting to obtain the highest level of benefits during his rehabilitation to support his family,but indicated that he had misunderstood the consequences of waiting to proceed with his disability pension application.according to tegtmeier,had he known that his delay would result in the higher rate,he would not have made the finan
