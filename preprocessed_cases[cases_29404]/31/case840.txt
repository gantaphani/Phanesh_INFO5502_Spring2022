we are asked to decide whether a pension plan amendment which expands the types of employment that trigger mandatory suspension of early retirement benefits violates erisa rule,g,when applied to suspend the benefits of the plaintiffs,who retired before the amendment.the district court,relying on spacek maritime ass n,cir,granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant pension fund.we reject the fifth circuit interpretation of g and hold that the amendment,which had the effect of reducing the plaintiffs early retirement benefits,violates the rule 
background 
the facts are not in dispute.plaintiffs thomas heinz and richard schmitt,are participants in a multiemployer pension plan administered by defendant central laborers pension fund.both plaintiffs,who were years old when they retired in,qualified for and began receiving monthly benefits payments under a pension,which was available to participants who retired at any age,so long as they had earned or more pension credits.the monthly payments available under the pension were the same as those available at normal retirement is,the benefits were not actuarially reduced to take into account that payments began at an earlier age and would continue over a longer period.the monthly amount was determined based on the contribution rates at which the required pension credits were earned.
under the plan,monthly benefit payments for those retiring before age,like the plaintiffs,were subject to suspension for periods during which the participants worked in certain disqualifying employment.at the time of plaintiffs retirement,disqualifying employment was defined in the plan for employees retiring before age as employment 
in a job classification of any type specified and covered in a collective bargaining agreement or in any occupation or job classification where contributions are to be made to the fund pursuant to a written agreement either as a union or construction worker.
after their retirement,plaintiffs obtained jobs as supervisors in the construction industry,which was not disqualifying under the existing definition.for two years the plaintiffs worked as construction supervisors while collecting monthly pension benefits.then,in,the plan was amended and the definition of disqualifying employment was expanded to include for participants who retired before age work in any capacity in the construction industry either as a union or construction worker.the fund construed this amended definition as covering plaintiffs supervisory work and suspended their monthly benefit payments.
the plaintiffs sued the fund and,on cross motions for judgment on the pleadings,the district court entered judgment for the fund.the district court,after careful analysis,held first,that the rule does not apply to suspensions of early retirement benefits payments triggered by disqualifying employment,and second,that the fund interpretation of the amended definition of disqualifying employment to include supervisory work was not arbitrary and capricious.the plaintiffs appeal on both grounds.
ii.analysis 
erisa does not require employers to provide pension or early retirement benefits,or mandate a particular level of benefits.hickey chicago truck drivers,helpers and warehouse workers union,cir.instead,erisa protects the benefits described in the plan by ensuring that,if a pensioner is promised a benefit and fulfills the conditions required to receive it,the pensioner will actually receive the described and promised benefit.id.at.erisa protects benefits from forfeiture through detailed rules regulating vesting and accrual rates,which ensure the participant right to receive promised benefits notwithstanding his or her consent to plan provisions that would otherwise require forfeiture.see john langbein bruce wolk,pension and employee benefit law ed.
one limited exception to the rules is that pension plans may contain provisions requiring the suspension of monthly benefit payments if a participant works in certain jobs after retirement.see a b ii erisa a b.under this exception,multiemployer plans may provide for suspension of benefit payments if the retiree works in the same trade or craft,and the same geographic area covered by the plan.id.for early retirement benefits,plans may contain even broader limitations on,according to a department of labor regulation promulgated under erisa a b.see a.the plaintiffs do not contend that the restrictions on employment contained in the plan,either before or after the amendment,violate these restrictions.instead,they assert that the amendment,which expanded the scope of disqualifying employment,violated the rule of g.we review de novo the district court decision to grant judgment on the pleadings in favor of the fund.see velasco.of human,cir.
plan amendments under g 
plan amendments are permitted under erisa,see b,but an amendment may not decrease benefits that have already accrued.see langbein wolk,supra at.according to paragraph of the rule 
the accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan,other than an amendment described in section c or of this title.
g erisa g accrued benefit is defined under erisa as the individual accrued benefit determined under the plan expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.this definition has been interpreted to include retirement benefits and to exclude ancillary benefits not directly related to retirement benefits like insurance or disability benefits,see a hickey,at,and some courts,relying on this definition,have held that early retirement benefits were likewise excluded.see meredith allsteel,cir,overruled by ahng allsteel,cir bencivenga western.teamsters and employers pension fund,cir.
paragraph of g,added by the retirement equity act of,makes clear,however,that early retirement benefits are within the protection of the rule.under that new provision,the test is not whether the amendment decreases accrued benefits,but rather whether the amendment has the effect or reducing early retirement benefits attributable to service before the amendment 
for purposes of paragraph,a plan amendment which has the effect of 
a eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a subsidy as defined in regulations,or 
b eliminating an optional form of benefit,
with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits 
g erisa g see ahng,at arndt security bank employees pension plan,cir there is no question that the benefits at issue here are attributable to service before the amendment because the plaintiffs had already retired when the plan was amended.the only question,then,is whether the plan amendment has the effect or reducing the plaintiffs early retirement benefit.
before the amendment,plaintiffs had the right under the plan to work as construction supervisors and continue to receive their monthly benefit payments.when disqualifying employment was redefined to include work in any capacity in the construction industry either as a union or construction worker,and when the fund applied that definition to supervisory work,the plaintiffs lost their right to work as construction supervisors while collecting benefits.
we conclude that plaintiffs loss of the option of working as construction supervisors was a reduction of their early retirement benefits within the meaning of g.a participant benefits can not be understood without reference to the conditions imposed on receiving those benefits,and an amendment placing materially greater restrictions on the receipt of the benefit reduces the benefit just as surely as a decrease in the size of the monthly benefit payment.we have not before interpreted the prohibition in the rule as limited to amendments that reduce the amount of the periodic payment,and we find nothing in the language of the rule that suggests such an interpretation.in ahng,for example,we held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim for violation of g when they alleged that a plan amendment changed the deadline by which the employee must retire in order to receive supplemental early retirement benefits.at see also bellas cbs,cir plan amendment that changed eligibility requirements for early retirement benefits violated g.similarly,in michael riverside cement.pension plan,cir,the ninth circuit held that an amendment that eliminated the plan rule,which had allowed a participant to receive full early retirement benefits without regard to the amount he already received upon previous retirement,violated g even though the amendment increased the plaintiff monthly benefit payment.hickey,at cir plan amendment that eliminated the participant right to adjustments violated the rule.
the fund argues that these cases are distinguishable because a change in the eligibility requirements,as in ahng for example,differs from a change in the conditions triggering suspension of benefit payments in that the former permanently reduces benefits or eliminates certain participants rights to benefits,whereas a suspension is temporary.we find the distinction unconvincing.although with a suspension the interruption in benefit payments is temporary,the retiree never recovers the payments lost during the employment period.the amendment thus eliminates monthly benefit payments for participants who take certain jobs after retirement and reduces the participant total early retirement benefits by an amount determined by how long the disqualifying work continues.plaintiffs lost a valuable right they had earned before the right to continue to work in the industry while receiving monthly benefit that loss was permanent in our judgment,this was a reduction of early retirement benefits within the plain meaning of g 
spacek maritime association 
the fund points out,however,that suspensions are not identified along with the prohibitions against decreases,reductions,and elimination of benefits in the rule.the fund relies on spacek maritime ass n,cir,in which the fifth circuit concluded that an amendment like the one in this case did not violate the rule because it concerned a suspension and not a reduction in benefits the fifth circuit supported its conclusion with an examination of the use of the two terms under the statute and related regulations the legislative history of the retirement equity act and a treasury regulation concerning the effect of suspensions on accrued benefits.we respectfully conclude,however,that the fifth circuit arguments do not support its conclusion.
suspensions and reductions under erisa.
in spacek,the court noted that t hroughout the statute and corresponding regulations,the concepts of reduction of benefits and suspension of benefit payments are used in distinct ways,often within a single provision.at citing a,d d a v a iii.from this the court reasoned that to interpret the prohibition in the rule against amendments that reduce benefits as applying to suspensions would make the word suspension redundant in all of these statutory provisions and interpretive regulations.spacek,at.this redundancy,according to spacek,would violate the canon of statutory construction that every word in a statute must be given meaning.id.
we disagree with the inference that spacek draws from the various provisions that refer to both reductions and suspensions.our interpretation of the rule does not suggest that all suspensions are reductions or vice versa,only that if the suspension is pursuant to an amendment that reduces benefits attributable to service before the amendment,then it is a reduction within the rule.this interpretation does not render the word suspension in the other provisions redundant.
for example,spacek relies on various provisions in title iv of erisa relating to financially troubled and terminated plans that refer to both reduction of benefits and suspension of benefit payments according to spacek,to avoid redundancy,the former phrase must be construed as excluding the latter.id.but spacek identification of the two relevant phrases is too narrow to the extent the title iv provisions identify two separate categories,they are amendments that reduce benefits on the one hand,and suspension of benefit payments,on the other.section,governing plan terminations,is typical 
a amendment of plan by plan sponsor to reduce benefits,and suspension of benefit payments 
notwithstanding sections and of this title,the plan sponsor of a terminated multiemployer plan to which section d of this title applies shall amend the plan to reduce benefits,and shall suspend benefit payments,as required by this section.
a emphasis added see also a a plans in reorganization may amend the plan to reduce benefits a a insolvent plans may suspend benefit payments a e ii a f exception to forfeiture rule for amendments that reduce benefits under or,and suspension of benefit payments under and.because the latter category suspension of benefit payments includes suspensions not according to any amendment,as in the case of insolvent plans,for example,it is not rendered superfluous by interpreting the amendment in this case as falling into the former category amendments that reduce benefits 
in other words,even crediting the reliability of any inference about the rule that can be drawn from the use of these phrases in various provisions relating to terminated or troubled plans,the most we can infer is that a suspension of benefit payments not falling into the first that reduce be excluded from the rule.but other than in the case of insolvent or terminated plans,an administrator authority to suspend benefits must come from the plan.and as we noted before,no one is disputing that the suspension in this case would be proper if it were contained in the original plan.it is the propriety of the amendment to the plan that is at issue in this case,and not the suspension itself,and therefore we can not infer from the distinction made in title iv between suspensions of benefit payments and amendments that reduce benefits that the amendment in this case is beyond the rule 
we do not view the omission of a specific reference to suspensions in the rule as an oversight,but as unnecessary.adding a reference to suspensions in g,the accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased or suspended by an amendment of the plan or g,a plan amendment which has the effect of eliminating,reducing,or suspending an early retirement benefit,would be awkward and perhaps overbroad it is not the suspension of benefit payments that offends the rule,but the change to the detriment of the participant in the conditions triggering the suspension,and this concept is adequately captured by the prohibition against amendments that reduce benefits.
legislative history of the retirement equity act.
the fund,again relying on spacek,also points to the legislative history of the retirement equity act of,which added paragraph the provision concerning amendments that reduce or eliminate early retirement g.see spacek,at.spacek found instructive the following comment made by representative william clay during the final house debates on the retirement equity act 
nor do those provisions in any way apply to or affect the provisions of erisa section a b and code section a b relating to the suspension of benefits for postretirement employment,including the authorization for multiemployer plans to adopt stricter rules for the suspension of subsidized early retirement benefits.
spacek,at quoting cong.rec.the fifth circuit concluded that representative clay remark means that the rule in g does not limit the power of the plan to amend the plan to expand the restrictions on employment.see spacek,at.
we find representative clay remark ambiguous at best on the question of whether amendments concerning suspensions for disqualifying employment are outside the coverage of g but even if representative clay understanding of the rule were consistent with the fifth circuit that suspensions upon disqualifying represent an additional exception to g we find nothing in the legislative history to indicate that anyone else in congress shared the understanding attributed to representative clay by the fifth circuit.the parties have not identified,and we have been unable to find,any further reference in the legislative history of the retirement equity act to the exception for suspensions that the fifth circuit infers from representative clay remarks the absence of any additional support in the legislative history suggests to us that the fifth circuit gave undue weight to the statement of representative clay,which as interpreted by the fifth circuit is at odds with the straightforward language of the statute.see barnhart sigmon coal,d rejecting interpretation contained in the floor statements of the statute sponsors monterey coal federal mine safety and health review comm n,cir same alex city of chicago,cir i solated remarks of individual legislators,can not be used to find ambiguity,or contrary intent,in statutory language that,with respect to a case in hand,is clear on its own terms without rendering nugatory the plain meaning canon of construction.accordingly,we conclude that representative clay remarks can not be used to support an exception to the rule for amendments that expand disqualifying employment.
treasury regulation c f.
the court in spacek also found support in c f,a treasury department regulation concerning the allocation of accrued benefits between employer and employee contributions.by way of background,the court first noted that the term accrued benefit means the employees benefit as accrued under the plan,expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age,or,for early retirement benefits,the actuarial equivalent of the benefit commencing at normal retirement age.see spacek,at citing c c e the treasury regulation relied upon by spacek,c f,states that in calculating the actuarial equivalent of an accrued benefit,n o adjustment is required on account of any suspension of benefits if the suspension is permitted under erisa a b the section dealing with restrictions on employment according to the fifth circuit,because the reduction in total benefits paid over the lifetime of the plan participant as a result of the suspension need not be accounted for actuarially in computing the participant accrued benefit,an amendment authorizing such a suspension does not serve to decrease the participant accrued benefits,and thus can not violate g.at.
this reasoning,however,is inconsistent with the language of paragraph of g,which provides that an amendment that has the effect of eliminating or reducing early retirement benefits shall,for purposes of g,be treated as reducing accrued benefits.g,erisa g emphasis added see ahng,at bellas,at.whether a benefit is accrued for other purposes under erisa is irrelevant for purposes of g.see costantino trw,cir there is no inconsistency between defendant claim that the definition of accrued benefits excludes subsidies,and the retirement equity act strategy of protecting subsidies by treating them as accrued benefits in several provisions.bellas,at while the definition of an accrued benefit has not been modified,congress did modify section g in to the end that early retirement benefits and subsidies were defined as being accrued for purposes of erisa provisions.in fact,it was on this basis that we overruled our earlier decision in meredith allsteel,cir,which held that an amendment reducing early retirement benefits did not violate g because the benefits were not accrued benefits as defined under.see ahng,at.the portion of the regulation relied upon by the court in spacek,like the general definition of accrued benefits relied on in meredith,is simply irrelevant to our determination of the scope of g,which treats amendments that reduce early retirement benefits as reducing accrued benefits.
the fifth circuit reasoned,however,that because the amendment would not decrease accrued benefits,then the amendment could not violate the rule as applied to full retirement benefits,because for those benefits,the prohibition is limited to amendments that decrease accrued benefits.see at.according to spacek,applying the rule to amendments governing suspension of early retirement benefits would therefore give early retirement benefits greater protection than full retirement benefits,which is contrary to congress intent that early retirement benefits receive the same protection as full retirement benefits.id.but spacek observation about congress intent cuts both ways.the question is,same as what other than perhaps the remarks of representative clay reliance on which,as we just discussed,is problematic,there is nothing in the legislative history of the retirement equity act to suggest that congress had any specific understanding about whether amendments affecting suspensions of full or early retirement benefits would be covered.and we disagree with spacek key for full retirement benefits,c f means that an amendment expanding the conditions triggering a suspension would not be covered by the rule.
as spacek points out,the regulation instructs that in calculating the accrued benefit,no actuarial adjustment need be made to account for the decrease in total benefits paid as a result of the suspension.see at.this is consistent with erisa a b,a b,which states that a suspension for certain employment is not a forfeiture.but it does not necessarily follow that,because no actuarial adjustment is required,an amendment concerning suspensions can not decrease accrued benefits.to say that a suspension is not a forfeiture or does not decrease accrued benefits is not the same as saying that a change in the rules governing suspensions can not decrease accrued benefits.in other words,we can conclude from the regulation that a plan provision suspending benefit payments would not decrease accrued benefits the regulation says nothing,however,about a change in the rules regarding suspensions.and if we view accrued benefits as including the conditions on receiving those benefits,then the amendment,by increasing those conditions,decreases accrued benefits.spacek logic therefore depends on interpreting the term accrued benefits as including only the periodic payment,but excluding the conditions affecting the participant ability to receive that amount.there is nothing in the statutory definition that compels this interpretation,and we are persuaded that our interpretation is closer to erisa purpose of protecting anticipated benefits.see generally hickey,at erisa protects the benefits described in the plan by ensuring that,if a pensioner is promised a benefit and fulfills the conditions required to receive it,the pensioner will actually receive the described and promised benefit.langbein wolk,supra,at.
another regulation,moreover,supports our conclusion that spacek construction is too narrow.that regulation,d,which contains the treasury department interpretation of d the counterpart of the rule in the internal revenue code,interprets the rule as applying to amendments that impose further restrictions or increase the conditions affecting benefits that have already accrued.the regulation begins by defining section d protected benefits as including any benefit that is described in d a b the counterpart in the internal revenue code of the rule in g.d q.it then provides that 
the addition of employer discretion or objective conditions with respect to a section d protected benefit that has already accrued violates section d.also,the addition of conditions whether or not objective or any change to existing conditions with respect to section d protected benefits that results in any further restriction violates section d.
the section of the rule dealing with early retirement benefits does not limit the prohibition to a decrease in accrued benefits,but rather says that an amendment that has the effect or reducing benefits will be treated as reducing accrued benefits.g.reading this language to include an amendment increasing conditions is straightforward,and we decline to abandon this plain reading in favor of the fifth circuit interpretation of the term accrued benefits,which is neither compelled by the statutory definition nor supported by legislative history or other persuasive authority 
iii.conclusion 
nothing in erisa,the legislative history of the retirement equity act,or the treasury regulation relied upon by the court in spacek persuades us to depart from our conclusion that g unambiguously applies to the amendment in this case,which reduced plaintiffs early retirement benefits by expanding the conditions triggering a suspension of benefit payments.because our interpretation of g resolves this appeal,we need not reach the plaintiffs alternative argument that the fund trustees interpretation of the amendment definition of disqualifying employment to include supervisory work was arbitrary and capricious.the judgment of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
judge williams for the majority has labored with great skill and ingenuity to overcome the efforts of chief judge caroline dineen king for a fifth circuit panel that came out the other way.see spacek maritime ass n,cir.though judge williams has put as persuasive a face as may be possible on the majority position,i still find spacek quite compelling.spacek,it seems to me,presents straightforward and plausible arguments,not susceptible to rebuttal by the sometimes tortured contentions of the majority.
the first pillar supporting the outcome in spacek is the absence of the word suspend or its variants from g,the rule yet suspend or its variants appear with reduce or its variants in numerous other sections of erisa.if,as the majority argues,the concept of reduction includes suspension,then the use of suspend or its variants,in addition to reduce or its variants,in many other erisa sections is redundant.there is no doubt that the drafters knew how to include the concept of suspension,in contrast to that of reduction,when they wanted to do so.i find this plain meaning argument to be quite convincing.
the majority attempts to rebut this argument with two points.first,it seems to say that a suspension is really a reduction because over time a suspension of the receipt of a benefit reduces the economic value of the total benefits received.op.at.of course,there is an economic loss from a suspension if there were none,there would be no lawsuit.but,that does not mean that,as used in erisa,a suspension is exactly equivalent to a reduction or is included within it.from the point of view of the recipient on the facts before us,the suspension of pension payments does not reduce the recipient current income because the temporarily lost pension income is replaced by earned income derived,as was the pension,from the very same construction industry.this elimination of from the construction industry pockets seems substantially more equitable,and is certainly less burdensome to the pension recipient,than would be a reduction in the amount of the benefit unsupplemented by earned income.hence,the broadening of the ban on seems not inequitable.
second,the majority attempts to dismiss the argument from redundancy based on the numerous erisa provisions that contain both the words reduction and suspension by distinguishing those provisions as involving matters other than an amendment purporting to diminish benefits.op.at.thus,the majority apparently concludes that if a suspension is pursuant to an amendment that diminishes benefits,then the suspension is a reduction of benefits.op.at.on the other hand,if a suspension is not pursuant to such an amendment,then,the majority concludes,it is not a reduction of benefits.id.i do not follow this logic.while there may be more than one means of invoking a suspension,what constitutes a meaning or definition of a not change because the suspension was achieved by one method instead of by another method.
the majority subsequent argument that g concerns only amendments and thus it only bars suspensions pursuant to an amendment,op.at,only makes sense if a suspension is a reduction of benefits.but,beside the majority ipse dixit,there is nothing to indicate that a suspension of benefits is a reduction of benefits as those terms are used in erisa.rather,as the analysis of treasury regulation c f,discussed infra,concludes,a suspension is not a reduction of benefits based on erisa mode of calculating accrued benefits.
the legislative history involving the clear comments of representative clay firmly supports the interpretation based on plain meaning.the effort of the majority to explain away this comment is unconvincing.the comment appears to reflect an understanding at the time of the adoption of the rule that it not apply to adjustments made by the plan perhaps in the interest of the plan financial integrity to the rules involving suspension of benefits in the event of in the construction industry.with respect to the arguments of the majority depreciating the use of legislative history in general,these arguments become less weighty in the case of legislative history that fits so closely with the interpretation founded on plain meaning.
the plain meaning is also supported by the internal revenue manual described by the majority in its footnote.again,this bit of authority fits neatly into the interpretation derived from plain meaning.it is,therefore,hard to explain away.
that spacek interpretation reflects the plain meaning of the statute is supported by the outcome in whisman robbins,cir.in whisman,the appellant had qualified for a pension benefit,which was available to participants with thirty years of service,regardless of age.id.at.he received per month under the provision until he began working for the united states postal service in,at which time,his pension benefit was suspended under the plan provision.id.the sixth circuit held that the provision,which suspends early retirement benefits if the participant is engaged in prohibited employment,was not contrary to the law.id.at citing gardner central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund,wl cir,per curiam.the court then dealt with whisman argument invoking the rule of erisa.
whisman counters that gardner is inapplicable because at the time whisman applied and qualified for pension benefits,the reemployment provision,adopted in,was not in effect.according to whisman,the application of the amended reemployment provision violates the principle of costantino trw,cir.we disagree.in costantino,this court held that a plan attempt to eliminate early retirement subsidies for retirees that had already qualified for the subsidy prior to plan amendment violates the anticutback rules of erisa and the tax code.costantino is based upon an application and enforcement of section g of erisa,g,which prohibits employers from amending their pension plan to decrease or eliminate early retirement benefits or retirement type subsidies.even assuming that the benefit contains an early retirement subsidy,whisman argument is unpersuasive,because g and costantino involve a reduction or elimination of accrued benefits and subsidies,not a suspension,as is the case here.
whisman,at emphasis added and footnote omitted.the court went on to conclude that whisman would have lost even under the unamended plan.id.while the majority dismisses whisman as reaching its conclusion without analysis,perhaps the whisman court thought that its conclusion was obvious from the plain meaning of g.
the majority also seeks to rebut spacek reliance on treasury regulation c f to establish that normal retirement benefits are not protected against suspension by amendment.the point spacek makes is that,if normal retirement benefits are not protected,it is most unlikely that early retirement benefits would be protected.
initially,to gain some perspective on the status of early retirement benefits in relation to normal retirement benefits,one should recognize that early only years be much more likely to go back to work in construction than people normally retiring in their sixties.hence,it would not be at all surprising that by early retirees would,perhaps for reasons of the financial integrity of the plan,be dealt with more severely and certainly not less severely than would in the industry by workers retiring at a normal and relatively advanced age it would appear more likely that normal retirees would be allowed to retain their pension payments than would early retirees so one might logically expect employment restrictions on early retirees to be more onerous than those on normal retirees.
the retirement equity act rea,however,added the language of g,and,as spacek states,the legislative history of the rea indicates that the fundamental purpose behind the addition of paragraph was to afford early retirement benefits and subsidies the same form of protection from reduction by amendment afforded to accrued benefits.i am therefore in accord with spacek conclusion that,if an amendment,such as the one at issue here,would not violate g if it were applied to suspend fully accrued benefits,it plainly can not violate g if applied to early retirement benefits.spacek,in reaching that conclusion,starts with the proposition from the applicable treasury regulation that,for the purposes of computing the actuarial equivalent of a retirement benefit available at normal retirement age,n o adjustment of any accrued benefit is required on account of any suspension of benefits if such suspension is permitted under section a b of the employment retirement income security act of a b.spacek,at quoting c f.therefore,in figuring a plan participant accrued benefit,where early retirement benefits are involved,the calculation of the accrued benefit need not account for the decrease in total benefits paid as a result of a suspension authorized by a.
spacek then notes the authorization under a b of suspension of accrued benefits based on certain is the case here.at this point,spacek goes on to conclude that an authorized suspension does not decrease accrued benefits.and,as earlier noted,to the extent that an amendment would not violate the provision rule if applied to fully accrued benefits,such an amendment can not,based on the demonstrated intent of congress,violate the rule if applied to early retirement benefits.the logic here seems inescapable.
as far as i can divine,the majority effort at refutation involves a simple attempt at bootstrapping.the majority says that the spacek reasoning is inconsistent with the language of paragraph of the rule,apparently because this provision requires that amendments that have the effect of eliminating or reducing early retirement benefits should be treated as reducing accrued benefits.slip op.at.but,as has been demonstrated earlier,a suspension is not a reduction although the majority would have it otherwise,and the alleged inconsistency therefore disappears.as far as i can determine,the remainder of the majority argument involving accrued benefits continues to rely on the false equation of suspension with reduction.
the majority also adds the point that,even though a suspension of benefit payments may not decrease accrued benefits or become a forfeiture,a change in the rules governing suspensions may indeed decrease benefits.slip op.at.this argument misses the mark because the provisions we are discussing are directed to what is permissible for changes in the plan.to change the rules governing suspensions is merely to create a suspension with a little different design than an earlier one.the rules addressing the consequences of invoking a suspension necessarily encompass changes leading to a new form of suspension.
the majority reliance on d interpreting d,an analogous rule in the internal revenue code,is also unconvincing.nothing in this regulation refers to a suspension or anything resembling a suspension.the majority seems to be arguing that the amendment under consideration here had something to do with increasing conditions.but there is no indication that anything in the cited regulation is relevant to the conditions of a suspension.rather,the bar against increasing conditions appears to be a bar against increasing eligibility requirements for pension participation.see d q asking and answering whether a plan may condition the availability of a section d protected benefit on the satisfaction of objective conditions that are specifically set forth in the plan.we have already held that a change in eligibility requirements could violate the rule.see ahng allsteel,cir so holding.but the internal revenue manual discussed in footnote of the majority opinion states unequivocally that an amendment pursuant to erisa a b,a b,suspending benefits payments for periods of employment,as here,does not violate the rule of d.the majority has nothing better to point out in refutation than a clumsy use of words in drafting some of the provisions of the manual.the intent of the manual provision,on the other hand,seems clear.
spacek analysis relies on straightforward interpretations of statutory and regulatory language.the majority seeks to refute it with implausible and unconvincing arguments that do violence to the clear intent of the drafters.
as to considerations of policy and equity,it is true that my analysis may result in defeating in some instances the expectations of the plan participants.but this seems acceptable if they withdraw from retirement and return to the workforce,later to place additional demands upon the plan.they suffer no loss of regular income and are merely deprived of a bonus in the form of a dual recovery at the expense of the construction industry.meanwhile,the financial integrity of the plan may be affected by continuing to make retirement provisions for participants who have not really retired.
i therefore respectfully dissent.
because this opinion conflicts with the fifth circuit decision in spacek,it has been circulated pursuant to circuit rule e to all members of the court in regular active service.a majority did not wish to hear the case en banc.judge evans voted to grant rehearing en banc.
the amended plan distinguished between early retirement benefits that accrued before and after the amendment.for participants who retire before age,the amended definition of disqualifying employment quoted above applied to early retirement benefits that accrued before the amendment benefits accruing after the amendment were subject to suspension for any kind of work.amendment,section b c.
the two stated exceptions relate to cases of substantial business hardship c and terminated multiemployer plans.the fund does not assert that either exception applies.
for simplicity,we will refer to the plaintiffs benefit as an early retirement benefit,without intending any substantive distinction between that term and subsidies.on the difference between the terms,see arndt,at dan mcgill donald grubbs,fundamentals of private pensions,at pension research council ed,reprinted in langbein wolk,supra,at.
we respectfully believe that our dissenting colleague,by describing income as a bonus,mischaracterizes and underestimates the value of this right to plan participants,who were entitled to count on that pay to supplement their pension.there are other sources of such income,but compensating for lost income is more difficult the closer one is to retirement or as here,early retirement.amendments that restrict employment most harshly affect those nearing retirement and especially those who have already retired,who have foregone other options which require planning such as taking classes or fortifying savings and investment accounts.in this way,the amendment effect in this case is like any reduction of benefits attributable to service already disproportionately affects those with greater service.
the fund also asserts that the amendment was necessary to curb the practice of,which it claims was depleting fund assets.we note that the plan already provided for suspension of benefits if the retiree resumed work in jobs for which contributions were made to the fund,so it does not appear that the amendment was aimed at in the sense of preventing a participant from accruing additional benefits while drawing a pension.in any event,the rule does not prohibit the fund from curbing certain reemployment prospectively,that is,by using the new definition of disqualifying employment to suspend the portion of the benefit payment attributable to service after the amendment,pt.at,at,reprinted in.but there is no question that at the time of plaintiffs retirement,the plan permitted the very practice that the fund now as construction supervisors while receiving benefits.we can see no basis for inferring that congress intended to exclude from the rule amendments b
