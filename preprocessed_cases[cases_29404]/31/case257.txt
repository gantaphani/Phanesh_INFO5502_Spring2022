cglic denial of administrative record 
cglic terminated connors benefits on march.in reaching this decision,cglic relied on information from a physician hired by cglic who examined connors on one occasion,a cglic employee who performed an analysis of connor transferrable skills,and an cglic medical consultant who reviewed connors medical file.
in may of,cglic retained alan mazurek,a neurologist,to evaluate connors physical condition.following his examination of connors,mazurek confirmed that connors was suffering from lumbosacral radiculopathy,that connors had experienced only temporary improvement after the surgery,and that connors suffered from recurrent pain.mazurek also noted that connors could benefit from continued physical therapy and traction,and recommended evaluation by a neurosurgeon.

connors challenged cglic determination that he was not totally disabled and submitted additional evidence from his treating orthopedist,reddy.reddy wrote in a report dated july,that connors continues to have pain in the back radiating down his right lower extremity.his recent mri was positive for herniated disc he is totally disabled at this time.report of surendranath reddy,on cliff connors of.connors submitted additional evidence from his neurologist,shields,as well.on september,shields diagnosed connors as suffering from chronic pain syndrome and recommended connors admission to a pain management program.

proceedings before the district court 
on december,connors filed suit in the southern district of new york challenging cglic termination of his disability benefits as a breach of the terms of his insurance contract.cglic answered and moved to strike connors demand for a jury trial on the ground that his state law claims were preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,which does not provide a right to trial by jury.tischmann,cir.at the same time,connors urged the court to consider evidence beyond the administrative record,if connors jury demand were denied.
