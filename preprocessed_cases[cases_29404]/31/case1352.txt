introduction 
donna little,the widow of robert padgett and the personal representative of his estate,appeals the trial court entry of a final qualified domestic relations order qdro enforcing the interest of robert former spouse,beverly padgett,in robert pension plan,following the court nunc pro tunc entry of an order dividing robert pension plan survivor benefit as a community asset in their dissolution 
donna contends that surviving spouse benefits irrevocably vested in her at robert death.she further contends the provision of the employee retirement income security act of,et erisa prevented the court from ordering the pension plan to pay part of the survivor benefit to beverly where beverly took no steps to inform the pension plan of her community property claim until after robert died,before his retirement and while married to donna.
we shall conclude that,where the plan participant dies or retires before the former spouse secures an order awarding that spouse any interest in the pension plan,a domestic relations order entered before the plan participant death that does not award the former spouse an interest in the participant pension plan but simply reserves jurisdiction over the plan provides an inadequate basis for entry nunc pro tunc of either a qdro or of an order determining the former spouse interest in the pension plan that later may be qualified as a qdro.we shall therefore reverse the trial court order.
background 
robert and beverly were married on june.they had two children.they separated on august,and the court entered a judgment of dissolution on march,nunc pro tunc to december.beverly had counsel.while married to beverly,robert worked as a mechanic and was a participant in the automotive industries pension plan the plan.the judgment of dissolution did not adjudicate beverly interest in robert pension plan,but the court expressly retained jurisdiction to do so.the sole reference to robert pension is contained in paragraph of the judgment of dissolution as follows husband pension plan the court shall reserve jurisdiction over husband pension plan.
robert married donna on march.they had one child.robert continued to work in positions that added to his potential benefits from the plan.robert died on january,before he had retired and before receiving any benefits from the plan.the plan provides a survivor benefit of half of the monthly pension benefit robert would have received if he had retired immediately before his death.donna became the personal representative of his estate.
during robert lifetime,beverly took no steps to notify the plan of her community property claim and did not seek to obtain an order giving her an interest in pension benefits or a qdro in connection with the court reservation of jurisdiction.at no time before robert death did beverly or her attorney communicate with the plan in writing or provide the plan with a copy of the judgment of dissolution.beverly stated she did not know that she had to do anything until robert retired and benefits became payable.
in february,after robert death,beverly contacted the plan and advised that she was making a claim for benefits payable under the plan.the plan informed her the domestic relations order contained in the judgment of dissolution was not a proper qdro.the plan notified both beverly and donna,alerting them to the possibility of a conflict between them relating to their possible claims to survivor benefits.the plan took no position on the dispute.it withheld from payments to donna its estimate of the sums payable to beverly should her claim be determined to be valid,and offered to interplead the issue.on march,the plan advised the parties that it intended to segregate per month,representing an estimated amount that might be assigned by the court to beverly were the court to determine that she had a qdro.
on july,beverly applied ex parte to the superior court for a qdro.the court entered the order.the order was vacated pursuant to a stipulation of the parties,because donna had not been noticed and had not appeared in the action until she joined in the stipulation to vacate the order.in november,the plan was joined in the action.beverly moved to divide the plan survivor benefit as an unadjudicated community asset and to have the requested qdro made effective nunc pro tunc to a date before robert death.donna opposed the motion.
on april,the superior court adopted its tentative ruling,granting beverly motion,declaring that beverly was not required to obtain a qdro before robert death and that she was not required to notify the plan of her community property claim to plan benefits before his death.the court directed further adjudication of beverly exact community interest according to a formula it set forth in the order based upon the length of her marriage to to her a portion of the survivor ordered beverly attorney to prepare a proposed qdro,nunc pro tunc as of march,consistent with its ruling and in compliance with erisa,and to serve it on the plan.the plan was ordered to advise beverly by may,whether it accepted the proposed qdro and,if not,why not the court retained jurisdiction to implement the ruling and the judgment filed march.
donna appealed from the april,order.on august,we dismissed the appeal as from a nonappealable order.in re marriage of padgett,wl nonpub.opn.
on december,the superior court entered the qdro pursuant to family code,division,part,chapter employee pension benefit plan as party.the qdro provisions were consistent with the court previous order dividing the survivor benefits as an unadjudicated community asset,effective nunc pro tunc as of march,assigning from donna to beverly the right to receive surviving spouse benefits payable under the plan in an amount equal to half of the community interest in the surviving spouse benefits payable under the plan.it further identified the annuity starting date of payments to the alternate payee beverly as february.the court retained jurisdiction,if necessary,to amend the qdro and the judgment of dissolution to establish its qualifications as a qdro,and to implement beverly right to receive surviving spouse benefits under the plan.
donna timely appealed the court entry of the qdro.
ii.standards of review and overview of erisa qdro provision 
the interpretation of erisa,including whether erisa preempts state law,is a question of law which we review de novo.carmona carmona cir carmona.t he decisions of the lower federal courts,although entitled to great weight,are not binding on state courts.t he decisions of the lower federal courts on federal questions are merely persuasive where lower federal court precedents are divided or lacking,state courts must necessarily make an independent determination of federal law.rohr aircraft san diego cal.citations.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
two recent ninth circuit decisions,carmona,supra,and hamilton wa state plumbing pension plan cir hamilton,provide an overview of the erisa statutory framework relevant to the questions presented here.we therefore quote them at length 
congress originally enacted erisa to protect the rights of workers who earn pension benefits and to encourage plan participation.paul schneider,brian pinheiro,erisa a comprehensive guide ed.in addition to protecting plan participants,congress also sought to protect plan beneficiaries.see boggs boggs,d boggs.in order to meet those ends congress enacted an intricate,comprehensive statute that governs both pension and welfare plans.id.at.erisa pension plans must comply with participation,vesting,and funding requirements.id.carmona,supra,at.
erisa contains an provision and a preemption provision that restrict the ability of state courts and plan participants to transfer and alter interests in retirement benefits.see d each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.a establishing that erisa supercede s any and all state laws insofar as they may relate to any employee benefit plan.despite this broad preemption and scheme,congress has recognized that states,in some circumstances,should be able to enforce their own domestic relations laws with respect to erisa pensions.as a result,state domestic relations orders dros that comply with statutory requirements are exempt from both the and preemption provisions of erisa.b d hamilton,at.carmona,supra,at.
more recently,congress further refined the statutory framework with the retirement equity act of rea,stat,which particularly sought to protect the rights of surviving spouses.carmona,supra,at.
the rea,stat,amended erisa in two important ways with respect to surviving spouses.rea first sought to ensure a stream of income to surviving spouses by requiring pension plans to provide automatic surviving spouse benefits.boggs,at.section,as amended by rea,provides that if a vested participant dies before the annuity start date,leaving a surviving spouse to whom he has been married for at least one year,a qualified preretirement survivor annuity qpsa shall be provided to the surviving spouse.a.the qpsa is an annuity for the life of the surviving spouse that must be at least fifty percent of the annuity amount which would have been payable during the joint lives of the participant and spouse.id.at e.provision of the qpsa may be waived by the participant only if the spouse consents in writing to the designation of another beneficiary.id.at c.hamilton,supra,at,final fn.omitted.
rea also introduced the qdro exception d which elevates a plan participant legal obligations,commonly to a former spouse or children of a previous marriage,over the participant express wishes to provide for other individuals as designated beneficiaries.citation.the qdro is a subset of domestic relations orders that recognizes the right of an alternate payee to receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under the plan.d b i i.hamilton,supra,at accord,carmona,supra,at.t he statute specifically contemplates the assignment of surviving spouse rights,a qpsa to a former spouse in a qdro hamilton,at,citing d f i.in crafting the qdro exception,congress resolved any uncertainty concerning the authority of state courts to adjudicate marital dissolutions and to affect erisa pension plan benefits.citation.hamilton,at,fn.omitted.in other words,through the qdro vehicle,the rea amended erisa to create a mechanism whereby a participant former spouse is entitled to be treated as the current spouse for purposes of receiving surviving spouse benefits.
although state courts,via dros,may create enforceable interests in the proceeds of an erisa plan,there are limitations on the ability of state courts to create enforceable property interests in alternate payees.see trs.of the dirs.guild of am.producer pension benefits plans tise,cir amended cir tise.first,in order for a dro to be considered a qdro,the state courts must fulfill certain specificity requirements.these requirements allow a plan administrator to more easily administer the plan and reduce the risk of making improper payments.see hamilton,at citing in re gendreau,cir.a dro meets the requirements of a qdro and thus is enforceable only if the order clearly specifies the name and mailing address of both the participant and the alternate payees,the amount or percentage of the participant benefits to be paid to each alternate payee,the number of payments to which the order applies,and the plan to which the order applies.d c.if the state court fails to substantially comply with the statutory qdro requirements,even a valid domestic relations order is not enforceable against a pension plan.see hamilton,at.carmona,supra,at,fn.omitted.
second,the dro itself must create an enforceable interest that is permitted under erisa statutory scheme.see hamilton,at.a valid dro can be any judgment,decree,or order which relates to the provision of child support,alimony payments,or marital property rights to a spouse,former spouse,child,or other dependant of a participant,and is made pursuant to a state domestic relations law.d b ii.among other things,a dro is valid under erisa only if it recognizes the existence of an alternate payee right to receive benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan.id.at d b i i.additionally,a dro may not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit,or any option not otherwise provided by the plan,or to provide increased benefits to an alternate payee.id.at d d.
the two limitations work together.the first limitation concerns the form of the state court order the state dro may create an alternate payee enforceable interest,but the alternate payee may not enforce that interest unless and until he or she has complied with the qdro specificity provisions.see tise,at.the second limitation is substantive certain alterations to the benefits provided by a plan governed by erisa are forbidden.thus,in certain respects,erisa limits what a state family court can order.see hamilton,at.carmona,supra,at.
iii.hopkins,tise,carmona 
at the time the trial court entered its order in this case,there appeared to be two lines of authority on the question of whether a former spouse with an interest in the participant spouse pension is required to at least to qdro before the plan participant retirement or preretirement death,where the plan participant is married to another at that event 
hopkins.one line of cases holds that without a preexisting qdro,the surviving spouse benefits vest entirely in the subsequent spouse on the date the participant retires so that a state dro is not an enforceable qdro where it has not been obtained before retirement of the plan participant.hopkins v.at t global information solutions cir,hopkins accord,rivers central and south west cir,rivers see also samaroo samaroo cir,holding nunc pro tunc amendment of a dro obtained after plan participant preretirement death was not a qdro under erisa,because the order had the effect of increasing the plan liability by conferring survivor benefits on a former spouse after her right to those plan benefits had lapsed on plan participant death.
tise.in contrast to the line of cases,the reasoning of the ninth circuit in tise,supra,footnote,appeared to lead in a different direction.the ninth circuit held that a state court dro obtained before a plan participant retirement,death,or other event,creates an enforceable interest in the participant surviving spouse benefits even if the alternate payee former spouse is unable to qualify the dro before the participant death.id.at see carmona,supra,at.the plaintiff was therefore able to qualify the state court dro as a qdro in the months following the plan participant death.tise,at.
tise reasoned that because the qdro provision is an exception not only to erisa rule against assignment of plan benefits but also to erisa broad preemption provisions b,state family law can create enforceable interests in the proceeds of an erisa plan,so long as those interests are articulated in accord with the qdro provision requirements.tise,supra,at.tise recognized the distinction between the alternate payee interest in the pension plan proceeds,which is established by the state court dro and the enforceability of that interest which requires a qdro,stating because a qdro only renders enforceable an interest,there is no conceptual reason why a qdro must be obtained before the plan participant benefits become payable on account of his retirement or death.id.at.
tise noted,but expressly did not address,the question whether,as hopkins,supra,and rivers,supra,determined,the plan participant retirement cuts off a putative alternate payee right to obtain an enforceable qdro substituting the alternate payee for the surviving spouse with regard to statutory surviving spouse benefits.tise,supra,at,fn.tise reasoned that w hether a qdro issued after a plan participant retirement may affect the distribution of surviving spouse benefits pursuant to implicates statutory provisions and policy considerations other than those here applicable.citations.tise,at,fn.
following tise line of reasoning,the tenth circuit in patton denver post cir,patton,expressly rejected the third circuit conclusion in samaroo,supra,that any change in beneficiary after a plan participant death would wreak actuarial havoc on administration of the pension plan.samaroo,at.rather,patton agreed with the samaroo dissent that t he holding in samaroo work s an unwarranted interference with the states ability to administer their domestic relations law and to effectuate equitable divisions of marital assets.citation.patton,at,citing samaroo,supra,at dis.opn.of mansmann.
the hawaii supreme court in torres torres,torres,relied upon tise,supra,to hold that survivor benefits did not vest in the plan participant widow on the date of the participant eligibility for retirement or upon his death.torres,at.torres affirmed the family court order amending the initial divorce decree after the plan participant death,so that it could be approved as a qdro.id.at.the court held that a s long as erisa qualification requirements are met,any dro permissible under state domestic relations law should be binding upon a pension plan.torres,at.torres declined to follow the holding of hopkins,supra,that surviving spouse benefits vest in the participant current spouse at the time of the participant retirement.torres,at.because the widow did not argue that the family court dro required the plan to pay increased benefits beyond those it would have been expected to pay on the date of the plan participant preretirement death,the court found it unnecessary to resolve the competing interpretations of tise,supra,patton,supra,and samaroo,supra,regarding actuarial soundness of pension plans or the related question of notice to the plan of the potential interest in pension plan benefits.torres,at,fn.
in files exxonmobil pension plan cir files,the third circuit appears to have retreated somewhat from the full implications of the majority opinion in samaroo,supra,reiterating that samaroo was expressly limited to its facts.files,at.files held that a property settlement agreement psa granting an unmarried pension plan participant former spouse a separate interest in percent of the participant pension as of the date of the psa,constituted a qdro pursuant to the process contemplated within d,providing the with a separate interest in the pension benefit prior to her death files,at.it concluded that samaroo did not control as the former spouse in files was seeking a survivorship benefit provided for in the psa.id.at.the files court also distinguished hopkins,supra,on the grounds that in hopkins,there was an attempt to divest benefits already vested in a subsequent spouse,whereas here,there was no such vesting,and therefore,no such disruption to actuarial planning.files,at,fn.
hamilton and carmona.in hamilton,supra,the ninth circuit held that a surviving spouse benefit must be explicitly assigned to a former spouse in a qdro in order to overcome the surviving spouse right to a qpsa under erisa.id.at.the dispute in hamilton was between the widow of the plan participant and the plan participant children from a previous marriage.the marital dissolution order required the plan participant to name the children as beneficiaries under his pension plans,but made no reference to surviving spouse rights,nor did it delineate which pension rights were at issue,the amounts to be paid or when the payments were to begin.id.at.the ninth circuit held,first,that the purported assignment of pension rights did not meet the strict requirements of a qdro and,second,that even were the dro liberally construed as a qdro,under the statutory language coupled with a complementary interpretation of the plans,the surviving spouse benefit must be explicitly assigned to a former spouse in a qdro in order to overcome the surviving spouse right to an annuity under erisa.ibid.
in a case involving a dispute between the eighth and ninth wives of the plan participant,the ninth circuit in carmona,supra,at,recently appears to have moved away from the full implications of its opinion in tise,supra,at page,and has followed the fourth circuit holding in hopkins,supra,while not adopting its entire rationale.in carmona,the final two wives of the plan participant his spouse at the time of his retirement and his spouse at the time of his death argued over who was the rightful surviving spouse beneficiary for purposes of his retirement plan.id.at.joining the fourth circuit in hopkins,the ninth circuit held that qjsa surviving spouse benefits irrevocably vest in the participant spouse at the time of the annuity start this case the participant may not be reassigned to a subsequent spouse.carmona,at,fn.omitted.the court identified the issue as one of first impression in this circuit whether a plan participant retirement cuts off a putative alternate payee right to obtain an enforceable qdro with regard to the surviving spouse benefits of a qjsa.id.at,citing tise,supra,at,fn.leaving open the question.
carmona relied upon hopkins analysis of section and the v arious changes to erisa created by the rea indicat ing that the participant retirement or the start of the annuity establishes a vesting point for the surviving spouse benefits.carmona,supra,at,citing hopkins,supra,at.at the same time,carmona reaffirmed its holding in tise,supra,at page,that so long as a valid dro creates an alternate payee legally enforceable property interest in qpsa benefits,a qdro can be obtained even after the plan participant death.citation.carmona,at see id.at.reaffirming tise rejection of part of the fourth circuit reasoning in hopkins,the court was nonetheless persuaded by the structure and purpose of erisa that the rule enunciated in hopkins is the proper rule for qjsa benefits.carmona,at.
carmona identified uniformity of interpretation and simplicity of application of pension plans one of the principal goals underlying erisa served by a vesting rule.carmona,supra,at,citing mcgowan njr serv.cir,disapproved on another ground in kennedy plan adm r for dupont sav.and inv,fn,d.the court also embraced the actuarial certainty and finality rationale as noted in hopkins,supra,at page,footnote.carmona,at.
carmona was at pains to note that this opinion does not disturb our prior holding in tise.fundamentally,tise answers a very different question from the one presented here.in tise,we determined when a dro,which creates an enforceable interest in an alternate payee,can be qualified for qpsa benefits.tise established that a state court domestic relations order may be qualified even after a participant death,b ecause a qdro only renders enforceable an interest.tise,supra,at.in contrast,here we ask whether there are any restrictions as to when a state can create an enforceable interest in an alternate payee for qjsa surviving spouse benefits.we hold here only that a state dro may not create an enforceable interest in surviving spouse benefits to an alternate payee after a participant retirement,because ordinarily at retirement the surviving spouse interest irrevocably vests.carmona,supra,at,italics added,fn.omitted.the caveat is the carmona court recognition that there may be other situations in which a contrary result may be appropriate.for example,it is possible that a former spouse could obtain a dro prior to the annuity start date and present it to the plan,but the actual determination of whether the dro is a qdro might not be finalized prior to the date on which the benefit would normally become payable.see,d h.carmona,at,fn.moreover,citing its opinion in hamilton,supra,at page,the carmona court reiterated that erisa only permits state court dros to reassign surviving spouse benefits if they meet the specificity requirements of section d f and then only if the qdro expressly assigns surviving spouse rights to a former spouse.carmona,at.
the ninth circuit also concluded that the state court had impermissibly created a constructive trust on pension annuity proceeds,finding such action preempted by erisa.carmona,supra,at.a state court can not achieve through a constructive trust on the proceeds of a pension plan what this court maintains it can not achieve through a qdro.any alternative rule would allow for an around erisa rules and congress policy objective of providing for certain beneficiaries,thereby greatly weakening,if not entirely abrogating,erisa broad preemption provision.id.at.consequently,the court concluded that the eighth wife interest in surviving spouse benefits vested at the plan participant retirement and that federal law preempted the state court orders directing the plans to change the beneficiaries and creating a constructive trust.id.at.
iv.application 
in ruling that former spouse beverly could obtain a qdro after robert death years after the dissolution,the court below relied upon tise,supra,reiterating its reasoning that there was no conceptual reason why a qdro must be obtained before the plan participant benefits become payable on account of his retirement or death.id.at.donna attempted to distinguish tise on the grounds that in tise spousal survivor benefits were not at issue and the plan in tise had notice of the claim before the plan participant death.the trial court rejected these distinctions.
donna argues,based upon hopkins,supra,and rivers,supra,that uniform federal appellate precedent holds that retirement irrevocably vests an erisa surviving spouse benefit and that a qdro after the retirement or preretirement death of the plan participant can not alienate part of that benefit to an alternate payee.we shall conclude,consistent with the holdings of the ninth circuit in both carmona,supra,and tise,supra,that while preretirement death ordinarily irrevocably vests the right to survivor benefits in the existing spouse,a dro possessed by a former spouse before the plan participant death may be qualified as a qdro postmortem where the dro substantially complies with erisa specificity requirements for a qdro.here,however,the dro did not substantially meet qdro requirements at the time of the plan participant preretirement death.although the nunc pro tunc order of the court amended the dro to meet qdro requirements,it went far beyond the limits recognized in california for entry of nunc pro tunc orders.therefore,we must reverse.
those federal circuits considering the question of vesting of survivor spouse benefits in the plan participant spouse at the time benefits become payable on the plan participant retirement or preretirement death have concluded either that the former spouse must have perfected a qdro at the time the benefits become payable hopkins,supra,rivers,supra,or that in order to effect a postmortem qualification of the dro as a qdro,there must have been a dro awarding the former spouse an interest in the pension plan and substantially complying with qdro specificity requirements at the time benefits became payable.see carmona,supra,hamilton,supra.
federal circuits that have allowed postmortem qualification of a dro as a qdro have taken pains to point out that the plan participant had not remarried and there was no spouse at the time benefits became payable.consequently there was no issue of vesting of pension plan benefits in an existing spouse.see files,supra,at,hogan raytheon cir,patton,supra,at tise,supra,at,fn.but see torres,supra,at hawaii supreme court.
in tise,supra,the ninth circuit expressly had left open the questions of whether a plan participant retirement cut off the former spouse right to obtain a qdro with regard to statutory surviving spouse benefits id.at,fn,whether such order could be entered nunc pro tunc id.at,fn,and whether a qdro could issue after a plan participant death if the plan lacked notice of the interest before death id.at,fn.the ninth circuit answered the surviving spouse question in carmona,supra,concluding that it ordinarily would follow the irrevocable vesting rule of hopkins,unless at the time of the plan participant retirement or preretirement death,the former spouse possessed a dro specifically awarding surviving spouse benefits and had presented it to the plan.in such circumstances,the surviving spouse could engage in the statutorily contemplated process of qualifying the dro as a qdro even after the plan participant death.carmona,at,fn.
the cases are inconsistent in their views of whether notice to the plan of an alternate payee claim is required to be received before the event.compare,carmona,supra,at calculation and payment of pension benefits make it important for plan administrator to know to whom benefits are payable at event hopkins,supra,at,fn.same with files,supra,at nothing in erisa requires notice to plan before participant death patton,supra,at declining to infer a notice requirement.actuarial certainty is related to the question of notice.carmona adopts the hopkins court view of actuarial certainty,reasoning that it is important for the plan administrators to know,with some finality,who the spouse is at the time that the benefits become payable.carmona,at.
although the trial court in this case concluded that the fund apparently knew that there was an who might be making a claim,as evidenced by its letter to donna dated march,all indications in the record are that this letter relates to beverly contacting the plan in february after robert death in january,and providing them with a copy of the judgment of dissolution.there is no evidence in the record that any notice was provided to the plan at any time before robert death that beverly might have a claim.beverly herself declared that her counsel had not sought a qdro perfecting her interest,that she did not know she needed to take further legal action to protect her community property interest in the pension plan,and that she had intended to take further action after robert retired.
nevertheless,the plan did segregate funds and did not pay to donna any funds that arguably were due beverly under the amended dro.moreover,as in torres,supra,at page,footnote,on appeal donna has made no specific claim that the actuarial certainty of the plan would be compromised or otherwise affected by qualification of the amended dro as a qdro or by beverly failure to notify the plan before robert death of beverly claimed interest therefore,we need not determine whether erisa requires notice to the pension plan before the event here robert preretirement death,as carmona appears to conclude.see carmona,supra,at,fn.
there is no doubt that the original dro in this case did not meet the specificity requirements of erisa to allow it to be qualified as a qdro.the only reference at all to robert pension benefits in the dro was the provision that the court shall reserve jurisdiction over husband pension plan.italics added.this language gives no indication that the parties intended to divide the pension benefits,or how,or that they or the court intended to create an interest in the plan in beverly.in none of the cases we have reviewed was the mere reservation of jurisdiction sufficient to support amending the order nunc pro tunc to award surviving spouse benefits.in each case allowing postmortem qualification of a dro as a qdro,the court found either that the original dro substantially met qdro requirements or,at a minimum,that the spouse seeking to amend the dro nunc pro tunc to meet qdro specification requirements had been awarded some interest in the retirement plan in the original dro.see files,supra,at property settlement agreement incorporated into judgment of divorce entered before participant death constituted a qdro where it awarded former spouse of the pension patton,supra,at parties divided the one disclosed plan in a qdro,naming former spouse as surviving spouse in the event of participant death hogan raytheon,supra,at decree awarded former spouse of participant present retirement funds,to be set forth in a separate qdro torres,supra,at decree awarded former spouse a share of retirement plan if,as,and when plan participant commences to receive the same according to a formula specified in the decree tise,supra,at writ of execution issued before participant death and directing the plan to pay alternate payee specified sum from monies held in plan participant name recognized alternate payee right to receive all or a portion of benefits payable with respect to the plan participant and sufficed to allow alternate payee to perfect the dro into a qdro within the period specified in erisa.
after robert death,the trial court here granted beverly motion to divide the plan survivor benefit as an unadjudicated community asset and to have the requested qdro made effective nunc pro tunc to a date before robert death.
the ninth circuit has interpreted the provisions of erisa allowing state court dros to reassign surviving spouse benefits d f as permitting a transfer of surviving spouse benefits established under section only if the qdro expressly assigns surviving spouse rights to a former spouse.citation.carmona,supra,at,italics added see hamilton,supra,at.we would not necessarily go so far as to preclude nunc pro tunc amendment where the original dro creates some rights in the pension plan in a former spouse,but does not specifically award surviving spouse benefits.however,we believe the nunc pro tunc amendment here went too far where the original state court dro did not award beverly any actual interest in the pension plan,but simply reserved jurisdiction in the court to do so at some future point.
a nunc pro tunc order or judgment is one entered as of a time prior to the actual entry,so that it is treated as effective at the earlier date.this retroactive entry is an exercise of inherent power of the court,the object being to do justice to a litigant whose rights are threatened by a delay that is not the litigant fault.citations.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,judgment.there are limits on a court power to enter orders nunc pro tunc,at.
in hamilton laine th,d,we addressed these limits in holding that the trial court had exceeded its authority by entering nunc pro tunc an order establishing a special needs trust for a minor years after entry of judgment establishing a medical trust for the minor,where the special needs trust was not initially intended by the court and where it deprived another party of its rights under a statutory lien.we acknowledged that our decision did not turn on equities of the case or the policy arguments on each side.instead,it turns on principles limiting the use of nunc pro tunc entries to correct an error or omission in the original order or judgment.id.at,d.
the scope of orders and judgments nunc pro tunc in california has consistently been described by our supreme court in the following terms a court can always correct a clerical,as distinguished from a judicial error which appears on the face of a decree by a nunc pro tunc order.citations.it can not,however,change an order which has become final even though made in error,if in fact the order made was that intended to be made the function of a nunc pro tunc order is merely to correct the record of the judgment and not to alter the judgment actually to make an order now for then,but to enter now for then an order previously made.the question presented to the court on a hearing of a motion for a nunc pro tunc order is what order was in fact made at the time by the trial judge estate of eckstrom cal d,italics omitted.the court went on to hold nunc pro tunc orders may not be made to make the judgment express anything not embraced in the court decision,even though the proposed amendment contains matters which ought to have been so pronounced.citations.ibid.it is only when the form of the judgment fails to coincide with the substance thereof,as intended at the time of the rendition of the judgment,that it can be reached by a corrective nunc pro tunc order.id.at,accord,citations.hamilton laine,supra,th at,d accord,apri ins.superior court th,d.to summarize,it is not proper to amend an order nunc pro tunc to correct judicial inadvertence,omission,oversight or error,or to show what the court might or should have done as distinguished from what it actually did.an order made nunc pro tunc should correct clerical error by placing on the record what was actually decided by the court but was incorrectly recorded.it may not be used as a vehicle to review an order for legal or judicial error by correcting the order in order to enter a new one.hamilton laine,at,d.
here,the most that can be said with respect to the provision of the dro reserving jurisdiction over the plan participant pension is that the parties likely did not agree to disposition of pension assets and the court intended to address the issue at a later day.we can only speculate that,because california is a community property state,the court could have intended to confirm to beverly an interest in the pension at some point,and that such interest might include surviving spouse benefits.such speculation is inadequate based on the complete absence of any support in the record as to the court or the parties intentions beyond the reservation of jurisdiction itself.
we are mindful of the broad authority of courts to enter judgment nunc pro tunc in dissolution proceedings.see,authorizing a court to enter judgment nunc pro tunc in cases in which the court has determined that a judgment of dissolution of the marriage should be granted,but by mistake,negligence,or inadvertence,the judgment has not been signed,filed,and entered patton,supra,at samaroo,supra,at dis.opn.of mansmann.the patton court agreed with the samaroo dissent that t he holding in samaroo that a state court power to enter or modify a qdro with respect to a participant interest in a pension plan ends with the participant death work s an unwarranted interference with the states ability to administer their domestic relations law and to effectuate equitable divisions of marital assets.citation.patton,at,citing samaroo,at dis.opn.of mansmann.quoting from an article from the periodical of the american bar association family law section,written by gary schulman,author of the qualified domestic relations order handbook,the patton court stated nunc pro tunc qdros are desperately needed in the domestic relations arena.there must be a way to secure a former spouse property rights to a pension that could suddenly disappear as a result of a technicality or a family law attorney inexperience in drafting qdros.gary schulman,ticking time bomb,family advocate.patton,at.patton concluded,in sum,this is precisely the type of situation,particularly in the domestic relations arena,for which the nunc pro tunc doctrine is appropriate.courts in domestic relations contexts must have the power to effect equitable settlements by responding to newly acquired information or to changes in circumstances.if necessary changes once effected by the state court are not then recognized by plan administrators or by federal courts adjudicating disputes,state courts are effectively stripped of their ability to equitably distribute marital assets in a divorce.id.at,fn.omitted.
in his dissent in samaroo,supra,at pages,judge mansmann argued that important policy interests were furthered by giving effect to the state court decree there is good reason to allow state courts some leeway in entering or modifying domestic relations orders even after a participant death,or retirement or other event.the state courts are charged with administering the important,and often complex and volatile,area of domestic relations law.the evident purpose of the erisa recognition of qdros is to avoid undue interference with state courts fulfillment of that charge.imposing a date by which a state court orders must be in prescribed that does not appear anywhere in the text of unnecessarily impede those courts efforts to provide for a just disposition of marital assets.id.at,fns.omitted dis.opn.of mansmann.
however,as we have observed,those decisions allowing nunc pro tunc amendments of the dro to meet qdro specificity requirements after the death or retirement of the plan participant,did so in circumstances where the original state court dro at a minimum created in the former spouse some interest in the pension plan.in patton,supra,the court analogized the nunc pro tunc order awarding the former spouse surviving spouse benefits in the newly discovered plan in the same manner as the parties had agreed to distribute assets in the known pension plan.the court reasoned that the nunc pro tunc order was not being used to rewrite historical facts.rather,it is more akin to the correction of a clerical error,which is an accepted use for nunc pro tunc orders.id.at.the parties previously lacked full information as to the assets to be distributed in the settlement.wh
