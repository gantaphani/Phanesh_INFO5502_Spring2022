in exchange for a payment of disability benefits,nancy ross barron gave a general release to unum life insurance company of america as administrator of her employee benefit plan.when barron had a claim five years later against a different employee benefit plan,of which unum coincidentally was also the administrator,unum relied on this general release to deny barron benefits.
citing the broad language of the general release,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of unum.because we conclude that unum could not,consistent with its fiduciary duty,rely on the release involving a different plan to deny barron benefits and that,in any event,the scope of the release language was not sufficiently broad to cover barron claim,we reverse.
nancy barron was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ms in,at a time when she was employed by advanced computer techniques in new york,and she consequently began receiving disability benefits under advanced computer techniques employee benefits plan the advanced computer plan.those benefits were obtained by advanced computer techniques through insurance policy number issued by unum life insurance company of america unum.unum was also the administrator of the plan.by the terms of the advanced computer plan,barron was entitled to receive disability payments until august,if she remained totally disabled.
following inquiries by barron to unum about receiving her benefits in a lump sum for each year or about compromising all future benefits,the parties reached a settlement under which unum,as plan administrator,paid barron a lump sum of for all future liability under the plan in exchange for a settlement release the release,which barron executed on may.the release provided in relevant part 
upon execution by me of this settlement and release,unum will pay me the sum of in addition to benefits provided to date,if any,as full,final,and complete satisfaction and settlement of its past,present,and future liability to me under policy number.
i understand that by signing this settlement and release,i am forever relinquishing any and all claims i have or may have against unum,including,but not limited to,any claim for additional benefits from unum under policy number and that this is a legally binding document.i also understand and acknowledge that i have the right to have this settlement and release reviewed by an attorney other personal,financial or medical advisor s prior to signing this settlement and release.
after barron ms went into remission and approximately months after barron signed the release,she returned to work.after working for several different employers,she commenced work on september,for comcast cablevision of delmarva,as a customer service representative.as a employee,barron became a participant in the comcast corporation employee benefits plan the comcast plan and began paying participating premiums.the comcast plan provided for and disability benefits through insurance policy number that it had obtained,coincidentally,from unum.this plan was also administered by unum.
effective january,the comcast plan obtained a revised policy from unum.this plan applied without a waiting period to all employees working at least hours per week and sales people in active employment as of january.employees who became covered on january,were not required to provide evidence of insurability.the comcast plan,however,did not provide disability benefits to employees with a condition.under the terms of the plan,a plan participant has a condition if the participant received medical treatment during the three months before the effective date of coverage and the disability began within months of the effective date of coverage.
there is no suggestion in the record that barron prior ms condition was a preexisting condition under the terms of the comcast plan because there is no evidence that she was receiving any medical treatment for ms during the three months before january.indeed,when ms symptoms did reappear in march,barron stated as recorded by a unum claims adjuster that she did go to a doctor for many years for of a sudden had flare been in problem.
after working on saturday,february,barron suffered the flare up of her ms symptoms.she experienced dizziness,double vision,and numbness in her hands.instead of returning to work,she went to her doctor on march,who confirmed that the symptoms were caused by 
a couple of days later,barron submitted an application to her benefits representative for disability benefits under the comcast plan.unum,as administrator of the plan,provided the benefits.as the symptoms persisted,however,barron applied for benefits.by this time,unum discovered that it had been the administrator of the advanced computer plan sponsored by barron previous employer and had,in connection with barron disability benefits under that plan,obtained a settlement and a general release from barron running in favor of unum.accordingly,on june,unum denied barron disability benefits under the comcast plan,stating 
per our conversation and our discovery upon further research of your claim,you had previously signed a settlement release with unum on.a copy of that release is enclosed a copy will not be provided to your employer.this release precludes you from filing any additional claims against unum.
in a subsequent letter,unum explained that barron settlement under the advanced computer plan released unum not only from any future claims under policy number the advanced computer plan,but also any other unum policy.because unum provided benefits to the comcast plan through unum policy number,unum concluded that when barron had signed the settlement release in,she relinquished her rights under policy number issued to comcast corporation.unum relied on the general release language in which barron stated,i am forever relinquishing any and all claims i have or may have against unum,including,but not limited to,any claim for additional benefits from unum under policy number the advanced computer plan.
barron commenced this action against unum for a judgment declaring that the release,which she had executed in may,was not a bar to nancy barron claim for longterm disability benefits under unum policy number the comcast plan and that policy number was in effect in march when she became disabled.barron also sought an injunction directing unum to process nancy barron request for disability benefits,beginning in june,in accordance with the usual standards of the company with regard to disability determinations.
barron filed a motion for summary judgment to obtain the relief she requested,and unum filed a for summary judgment,relying solely on the release to support its position.the district court,concluding that the comcast plan gave unum discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to interpret the terms and provisions of that plan,held that unum did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff claim for disability on the basis of the may,release in view of the release language providing that the release was not limited to policy number.accordingly,the court denied barron motion for summary judgment and granted unum for summary judgment.barron noticed this appeal.
barron contends first that even though unum,as administrator of the comcast plan,is given discretion to interpret its provisions,it breached its fiduciary duty to her and made a determination based on the of unum,rather than pursuant to the terms of the plan.she argues that by making a decision based upon the language of a release,rather than in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the current erisa plan with comcast corporation,unum violated its duties as a fiduciary under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.
barron also contends that even if the release is relevant to a claim made under the comcast plan,the release terms do not reach future claims such as the one she made against the comcast plan.we address these arguments in order.
the comcast plan,under which barron has made her claim for benefits,specifies that the plan administrator is comcast corporation.comcast corporation provided disability benef
