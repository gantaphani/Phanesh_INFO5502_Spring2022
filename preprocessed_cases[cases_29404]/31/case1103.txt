we must decide whether a state practice of disapproving insurance policies with clauses vesting discretion in insurers runs afoul of the employee retirement income security act of.
montana requires its commissioner of insurance to disapprove any insurance form if the form contains any inconsistent,ambiguous,or misleading clauses or exceptions and conditions which deceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the contract ann.john morrison,who is commissioner by virtue of being state auditor,has announced that this statute requires him to disapprove any insurance contract containing a discretionary clause.he has consistently disapproved such policy forms.we will call this his practice,as there is no specific montana law forbidding discretionary clauses.
under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,insureds who believe they have been wrongfully denied benefits may sue in federal court.the court determines the standard of review by checking for the presence of a discretionary clause.such a clause might read insurer has full discretion and authority to determine the benefits and amounts payable as well as to construe and interpret all terms and provisions of the plan.if an insurance contract has a discretionary clause,the decisions of the insurance company are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.absent a discretionary clause,review is de novo.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.
discretionary clauses are controversial.the national association of insurance commissioners naic opposes their use,arguing that a ban on such clauses would mitigate the conflict of interest present when the claims adjudicator also pays the benefit.the use of discretionary clauses,according to naic,may result in insurers engaging in inappropriate claim practices and relying on the discretionary clause as a shield.see also john langbein,trust law as regulatory law the scandal and judicial review of benefit denials under erisa,nw,as regards unum policies,unum program of bad faith benefit denials was all but invited by an passage in firestone tire which allows erisa plan sponsors to impose terms that severely restrict the ability of a reviewing court to correct a wrongful benefit denial.according to naic,as of,a dozen states had limited or barred the use of discretionary clauses in at least some form of insurance.
insurers and other supporters of discretionary clauses argue they keep insurance costs manageable.they assert that more cases will be filed in the absence of a discretionary clause and that the wide ranging nature of de novo review will lead to increased costs as well.failure to control litigation costs,they suggest,will discourage employers from offering employee benefit programs in the first place.see,metro.life ins.glenn,d roberts,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment ensuring that reviewing courts respect the discretionary authority conferred on erisa fiduciaries encourages employers to provide medical and retirement benefits to their employees through they are not required to do.
standard insurance company standard duly applied to morrison for approval of its proposed disability insurance forms which contained discretionary clauses morrison denied the request.standard responded by suing in district court,arguing that the subject is preempted by erisa.the district court granted the commissioner summary judgment,and standard timely appeals.
with certain exceptions,erisa preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any covered employee benefit plan.a.relevant here,the savings clause saves from preemption any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.id.b a.thus,while erisa has broad preemptive force,its saving clause then reclaims a substantial amount of ground.rush prudential hmo,moran,d.as the supreme court has stated,the tension between the broad preemption and the savings clause is marked 
the unhelpful drafting of these antiphonal clauses occupies a substantial share of this court time.in trying to extrapolate congressional intent in a case like this,when congressional language seems simultaneously to preempt everything and hardly anything,we have no choice but to temper the assumption that the ordinary meaning accurately expresses the legislative purpose with the qualification that the historic police powers of the states were not meant to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.

federal courts have interpreted erisa as directing them to make substantive law as well.see firestone tire,at.c ourts are to develop a federal common law of rights and obligations under plans.internal quotation marks omitted.in doing so,we are guided by principles of trust law.id.at.
is commissioner morrison practice of denying approval to insurance forms with discretionary clauses preempted by erisa here,no one disputes that commissioner morrison practice relate s to any covered employee benefit plan.a.it is thus preempted unless preserved by the savings clause.to fall under the savings clause,a regulation must satisfy a test laid out in kentucky ass of health plans,miller,d.first,the state law must be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance.id.also,it must substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.id.we now turn to those two prongs.
standard asserts initially that morrison practice of disapproving discretionary clauses is not specifically directed at insurance companies because it is instead directed at erisa plans and procedures.unfortunately for standard,erisa plans are a form of insurance,and the practice regulates insurance companies by limiting what they can and can not include in their insurance policies it is that a law which regulates what terms insurance companies can place in their policies regulates insurance companies.see,kentucky ass n,at.citing rush prudential,at.unum life ins.of am.ward,d upholding a rule that required insurers to demonstrate prejudice before denying untimely claims metropolitan life ins.massachusetts,d upholding massachusetts rule dictating a minimum amount of mental health coverage in medical insurance plans.that an insurance rule has an effect on third parties does not disqualify it from being a regulation of insurance.see kentucky ass n,at.noting that the regulation in question would change the options open to third parties but holding that this did not alter the nature of the regulation.
we agree with the sixth circuit decision in american council of life insurers ross,cir.in that case,the sixth circuit confronted a michigan prohibition on discretionary clauses.it concluded,as we do,that g iven that the rules impose conditions only on an insurer right to engage in the business of insurance in the state,the rules are directed toward entities engaged in the business of insurance.id.at.
standard next argues that the practice is not specifically directed at insurers because it merely applies laws of general application that have some bearing on insurers.kentucky ass n,at.to standard,the practice is nothing more than an attempt to apply the rule that contracts are interpreted against their drafter.
the cases standard offers in support involve basic rules which were applied to a wide variety of contracts.for instance,in pilot life insurance dedeaux,d,the supreme court found suits for tortious breach of contract or the mississippi law of bad faith preempted under erisa.the court looked to to determine whether the state law was merely general in application,noting that the law applied to any insurance contract in the state and allowed for punitive damages.id.at.the court observed that the law of bad faith was no more integral to the relationship than any state general contract law is integral to a contract made in that state.id.at.finally,the law developed from general principles of tort and contract law available in any mississippi contract case.id.in the end,the mississippi statute was not applicable because it was preempted by the exclusive remedial provisions of erisa.id.at.citing a.
likewise,we held in security life insurance meyling,cir,that certain provisions of california insurance law governing contract rescission were preempted.we noted that the provisions at issue could not be readily distinguished from california common law as borne out in cases involving used cars,machines,and real estate.id.at.
however,the practice disapproval of insurance forms which contain discretionary specific to the insurance industry.the practice admittedly achieves some of the same ends as the contra proferentem rule.it is,however,unexceptional that most state policies would further somewhat similar conceptions of the public interest.in any event,the state does not require approval of most contracts its requirement that insurance forms be approved by the commissioner is an expression of its special solicitude for insurance consumers.thus,the state bar on discretionary clauses addresses an problem,because discretionary clauses generally do not exist outside of insurance plans.
this view finds support in unum life,which upheld california rule as falling under the savings clause.the rule required that an insurer show substantial prejudice before denying a claim based on untimely filing.the court first looked to common sense.at.the rule thus appears to satisfy the view as a regulation that homes in on the insurance industry and does not just have an impact on that industry.internal quotation marks omitted.the court rejected the insurer view that the rule was merely an application of the general principle that disproportionate forfeiture should be avoided in the enforcement of contracts,stating 
it is no doubt true that diverse california decisions bear out the maxim that law abhors a forfeiture and that the rule is an application of that maxim.but it is an application of a special order,a rule mandatory for insurance contracts,not a principle a court may pliably employ when the circumstances so warrant in short,the rule is distinctive most notably because it is a rule firmly applied to insurance contracts,not a general principle guiding a court discretion in a range of matters.

here,the commissioner practice forces all insurers to omit discretionary clauses it is more than a principle which may be pliably employ ed when the circumstances so warrant.id.at.if it is an application of the general rule that contracts are interpreted against their drafters,it is clearly an application of a special order.id.furthermore,the supreme court found the grounding of the rule in policy concerns specific to the insurance industry to be key to its decision.id.at.likewise,morrison practice is grounded in policy concerns specific to the insurance industry,such as ensuring fair treatment of claims by insurers with potential conflicts of interest.it is indeed directed at insurance companies.
turning now to the second kentucky ass prong,standard asserts that the disapproval of discretionary clauses does not substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement.see kentucky ass n,at.insurance companies core function is to accept a number of risks from policyholders in exchange for premiums.some of the risks accepted will result in actual losses.risk pooling involves spreading losses over all the risks so as to enable the insurer to accept each risk.union labor life ins.pireno,d.by receiving a large number of relatively small premiums,the insurer can afford to compensate the few insureds who suffer losses.in this way,the insured no longer bears more than a small amount of his own has been transferred into a common pool into which all members of the pool contribute by paying premiums.
the requirement that insurance regulations substantially affect risk pooling ensures that the regulations are targeted at insurance practices,not merely at insurance companies.see kentucky ass n,at.noting that,absent the risk pooling requirement,any state law aimed at insurance companies could be deemed a law that regulates insurance internal quotation marks omitted.for instance,a state law requiring insurers to pay their janitors twice the minimum wage would not regulate insurance because it would have no effect on the relationship between insurers and the insured.id.standard argues for a definition of risk pooling that it claims is used in the insurance industry.according to such definition,risk is pooled at the time the insurance contract is made,not at the time a claim is made.administrative factors such as claim investigations,the appeals process,and litigation can affect amounts paid to insureds under a policy,but are outside of the risk pooling arrangement.we can not accept such narrow conception,as a review of the supreme court case law demonstrates that risk pooling extends to a much wider variety of circumstances than standard definition would suggest.
for instance,in kentucky ass n,the state passed an any willing provider awp statute,which forbade insurance companies from discriminating against any doctor who is willing to meet the terms and conditions of the health plan.id.at.this was enough to affect risk pooling substantially b y expanding the number of providers from whom an insured may receive health services,awp laws alter the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds no longer may kentucky insureds seek insurance from a closed network of providers in exchange for a lower premium.id.at.accordingly,the awp rule substantially affect ed the type of risk pooling arrangements that insurers may offer.id.at.
montana insureds may no longer agree to a discretionary clause in exchange for a more affordable premium.the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds has thus narrowed.the supreme court has repeatedly upheld similar regulations.see,rush prudential,at.scope of permissible bargains narrowed in that consumers could not agree to waive independent review of a medical decision unum life,at.scope narrowed in that insureds can not reject rule metro.life,at.denying insureds the ability to accept plans without minimum coverage.the sixth circuit,furthermore,recently upheld a prohibition on discretionary clauses nearly identical to that in this case,reasoning that michigan rules substantially affect the arrangement between insurers and insureds because they alter the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds.ross,at internal quotations omitted.
as the district court put it like the rule at issue in unum,morrison disapproval of discretionary clauses dictates to the insurance company the conditions under which it must pay for the risk it has assumed.std.ins.morrison,d,quoting kentucky ass n,at.one could go even further consumers can be reasonably sure of claim acceptance only when an improperly balking insurer can be called to answer for its decision in court.by removing the benefit of a deferential standard of review from insurers,it is likely that the commissioner practice will lead to a greater number of claims being paid.more losses will thus be covered,increasing the benefit of risk pooling for consumers.
standard next asserts that r isk does not concern legal risks borne by the insured or insurer,such as the availability of remedies.it may well be true that risk pooling does not contemplate damages for a bad faith breach of contract,see pilot life,at,or factor in the burden of contract misrepresentations,see meyling,at see also provident life accident sharpless,cir.however the only risk at issue here is the risk of the insured becoming risk that the insurance company has contracted for,not a legal risk created by state tort law or contract law.the commissioner practice merely alters the terms by which the presence or absence of the insured contingency is determined.it indeed affects the risk pooling arrangement.
accordingly,the commissioner practice is specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance,kentucky ass n,at,and it substantially affect s the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured,more so than other laws which have been upheld by the supreme court.the practice of disapproving discretionary clauses is thu
