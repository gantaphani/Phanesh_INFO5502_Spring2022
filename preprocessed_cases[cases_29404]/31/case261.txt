background 
in,pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a d e f g,and section of the labor management relations act lmra,the trustees brought suit against the defendant companies for unpaid contributions to the local welfare,pension,annuity and job training trust funds the funds.although only one of the companies,sandimo materials,sandimo,was a signatory to collective bargaining agreements requiring such contributions,the district court found the defendant companies jointly and severally liable for the unpaid contributions.the companies were held liable for unpaid contributions under agreements signed by sandimo,as well as for payments under two agreements never signed by any of the defendants,but found by the court to have been adopted by sandimo.
the defendant companies are all owned and operated by alfredo lamanna and his family.in,alfredo lamanna formed alfredo lamanna trucking,alt,which began as a trucking company,but in ceased all of its trucking operations to sell sand,gravel,and other building materials.alfredo lamanna,the president of alt,owns fifty percent of alt,and his sons,sabatino lamanna and emilio lamanna,who are both officers,each own percent.in,alfredo lamanna and his,rudolfo branchinelli,formed defendant rual trucking,rual to haul the types of building materials sold by alt.again,alfredo lamanna,who served as an officer of rual,owned fifty percent of the company,and his sons each owned percent.rual ceased its operations in.in,sabatino lamanna and emilio lamanna,with the help of their father,formed sandimo,a unionized trucking company engaged in the hauling of building materials.the brothers are officers of sandimo,and each owns fifty percent of its stock.finally,in,alfredo lamanna helped his daughter,rossana lamanna bartone form almar supplies,almar,which until operated a nursery and sold related materials.in,the same year rual was dissolved,almar stopped selling gardening materials and became instead a trucking business,hauling the same kinds of building materials hauled by rual and sandimo.rossana is an officer of almar,and its sole shareholder.
sandimo signed a series of collective bargaining agreements cbas with local,a labor union representing truck drivers.as stated by the district court,the relevant contracts for the purposes of this case are the new york city concrete,sand,gravel and bulk cement contract,covering the period from july,to june,the agreement the new york city concrete,sand,gravel and bulk cement agreement contract,covering the period from july,to june,the agreement and the new york city heavy construction and excavating industry,memorandum of agreement,covering the period from july,to june,but which was signed by sandimo and became effective march,the excavating agreement.the district court found that these agreements,in conjunction with an agreement and declaration of trust entered into by local and signatory employers,required sandimo to make contributions to the funds in specified amounts for each hour of work in employment covered by the agreements.the agreement and the excavating agreement prohibit sandimo from running a operation that is,creating union and the new york region.
as indicated above,sandimo was not a signatory to any local cba between july,when the agreement expired and february,after which it signed the excavating agreement.the district court found that there were at least two applicable cbas sandimo could have signed during this period the new york city concrete,sand,gravel and bulk cement contract,covering the period from july,to june,the agreement and the new york city sand,gravel and bulk cement industry,memorandum of agreement,covering the period from july,to june,the agreement.
although it did not sign the and agreements,the district court determined that sandimo complied with the terms of these two agreements in numerous respects.in particular,the court found that after the expiration of the agreement,sandimo continued to work with only union drivers who were members of local continued to perform the same work out of the same location with the same trucks paid wages in accordance with the and cbas continued to remit hourly building fund dues and hourly union dues checkoff on a monthly basis,increasing the amount remitted when changes were made to the cbas continued to recognize a local shop steward and continued to recognize seniority rights submitted to audits by the fund trustees and paid any delinquent amounts indicated by those audits and made certain contributions to the health and welfare funds,resulting in benefits being paid out by the funds to sandimo workers.in addition,in a letter to local dated march,emilio lamanna,on behalf of sandimo,stated,please be advised i will no longer make any payments against the new york city contract.i respectfully request that all of my payments be applied to the new york city excavation contract.the district court declared that this statement evinced a prior intent to comply with the agreements.
the district court found considerable overlap in the management and operation of the lamanna family businesses.regarding the management of these businesses,the court stated that alfredo is the president of alt and was an officer of rual.sabatino and emilio are both officers of alt and sandimo.sabatino and emilio signed rual and sandimo checks,and had check signing authority for alt.the court also noted the integrated operations of the defendant companies.first,it found that sandimo,rual,and alt all operated out of the same truckyard in maspeth,new york,and that almar operated from a rosedale,new york,property owned by alfredo,sabatino and emilio lamanna.sandimo and rual shared an office,telephone number which was answered lamanna and not sandimo or rual,and office equipment,and employed the same clerical staff.
the court next found that sandimo did not own its trucks,but rather used trucks that were owned by alt and rual and maintained and insured by alt.while these trucks were ostensibly leased on a daily basis,there were no written agreements memorializing the lease arrangement,and although there were transfers of funds among alt,rual,and sandimo,no documentation indicated that such transfers were made in connection with the leases.in,when rual dissolved,alfredo lamanna gave sabatino lamanna the fleet of rual trucks,which were used to transform almar from a nursery business into a trucking company.the court found that while rossana lamanna bartone is an officer of almar,emilio and sabatino lamanna have been significantly involved in the management of the company,and that alfredo lamanna has directly paid some of almar expenses.moreover,family members were paid management consulting fees or placed on the payroll of companies for which they did not formally work.since,the defendant companies have shared an accountant,who is paid per month,by different companies at different times.
the district court found that between january and december,rual and sandimo shared drivers,and that the drivers worked alongside each other every day and were dispatched by alfredo,sabatino or emilio,sent to the same locations,and delivered to the same customers.each driver drove the same truck every day and performed the same work,and hauled the same materials,regardless of which defendant paid him.the extent of the overlap in workforce was emphasized by the district court,which declared 
i n the pay periods of,there were instances when a sandimo driver received a check from both sandimo and rual in the same week,a total of of the time.in a week period in,there were instances when a sandimo driver received a check from both sandimo and rual in a given wee
