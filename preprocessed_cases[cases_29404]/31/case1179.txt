the oregon metallurgical corporation oremet in the late established a stock bonus pension plan for its employees the plan.the plan terms mandated that a defined minimum percentage of each plan participant portfolio had to be invested in oremet stock.following oremet merger with another company,oremet employees richard wright,greg buchanan,and darell hagan plaintiffs and other plan participants requested that oremet,the oremet plan fiduciary,and former oremet officers and pension plan administrators oremet defendants investigate investment alternatives and amend the plan to permit its participants to sell a higher percentage of employer securities than the percentage permitted by the plan express terms in order to capture the premium generated by the merger.the oremet defendants rejected the plan participants demands.
plaintiffs subsequently brought suit under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,against the oremet defendants,key trust company of the northwest the plan trustee key,and united steel workers of america local the union collectively defendants,for breach of erisa prudence,exclusive purpose,and provisions.the district court dismissed their claims with prejudice pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and plaintiffs appealed.
plaintiffs fail to state any legally cognizable claims under erisa.based upon the facts alleged,the oremet defendants decision to comply with the lawful terms of the plan following the merger was entirely consistent with erisa fiduciary requirements.because the union and key are neither fiduciaries nor de facto fiduciaries,they likewise can not be found liable under erisa.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims.
background 
statutory framework 
erisa is designed to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries by establishing standards of conduct,responsibility,and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans.b.to this end,congress has mandated that private pension plan assets are to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and beneficiaries.id.a a.moreover,the authority to administer the plan must be vested in one or more named fiduciaries.id.a.the fiduciary need not be an independent party the employer or plan sponsor may appoint its own officer,employee,agent,or other representative to serve in a fiduciary capacity.id.c.
section a of erisa imposes three general duties on pension plan fiduciaries.erisa fiduciaries must discharge their duties with prudence diversify investments to minimize the risk of large losses and act solely in the interest of the participants and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to those participants.id.a.erisa also expressly prohibits certain transactions where the potential for abuse is particularly acute.section of erisa forbids a fiduciary from engaging in a transaction that the fiduciary knows or should know is a transaction with a party in interest.id.a.furthermore,employer securities ordinarily may not comprise more than ten percent of the aggregate fair market value of plan assets.id.a a.finally,erisa requires that fiduciaries discharge their duties in accordance with the terms of the plan,except when such terms conflict with titles i or iv of erisa.id.
eligible individual account plans eiaps,profit sharing,stock bonus,thrift or savings plans,employee stock ownership plans esops or money purchase pension plans are exempt from several key erisa provisions.eiaps are exempt from erisa diversification requirement and its prudence requirement to the extent that it requires diversification.id.a.similarly,eiaps are exempt from the percentage limitation on investments in employer securities.id.b.finally,only eiaps may borrow funds from the plan sponsor.id.b.but for these exceptions,eiaps,due to their very nature,would run afoul of erisa.see fink sav.trust,noting that a cquisition of employer securities by an eiap does not,in and of itself,violate any of the absolute prohibitions of erisa.
factual summary 
as this case is appealed from the district court granting of a rule b motion,the following alleged facts are taken primarily from plaintiffs first amended complaint and its attachments.
oremet established the plan in november of.the plan agreement and the trust agreement set forth the terms of the plan as amended and restated in.the plan agreement provided that the plan was a stock bonus plan and an employee stock ownership plan invested primarily in shares of oremet stock.the plan agreement also established a trust.the trust assets initially consisted of shares of oremet common stock valued at approximately million.the plan financed its purchase of these shares with a loan from oremet.the loan was repaid in full in,and all shares of oremet stock held by the plan were allocated to the plan participants accounts.
a administrative committee the plan administrators,consisting of one hourly union employee of oremet and one salaried management employee of oremet,was designated to manage the plan.oremet board of directors was responsible for appointing a plan trustee and both plan administrators.defendants gary weber and jack cox were the plan administrators at all relevant times.defendant carlos aguirre was a director,officer,and shareholder of oremet.defendant dennis kelly was oremet chief financial officer from to.defendant union represented approximately of oremet employees and plan participants for the purpose of collective bargaining with oremet.
the plan originally allowed participants to sell up to of the oremet shares in their individual stock accounts each year so long as the participant remained employed by oremet the participant diversification provision.employees who ceased to be employed by oremet were not subject to the participant diversification provision and could withdraw of the shares of oremet stock allocated to their respective stock accounts.in and,as a agreement was set to expire,oremet and the union conducted negotiations on the terms and conditions of a new agreement to be effective from august,to july.the agreement was executed in the spring of.
oremet stock at all relevant times was traded over the counter on the nasdaq exchange.the stock price fluctuated widely between and from a low of per share to a high of.during and,the trading price of oremet stock steadily rose.plan participants consequently expressed a desire for greater diversification rights under the participant diversification provision,which would have allowed them to sell their oremet stock and invest the proceeds in other assets while maintaining their individual accounts within the plan.oremet management became concerned that increasing numbers of oremet employees would be motivated to terminate their employment in order to withdraw and to sell their oremet stock.acting in response to these concerns and under pressure from plan participants,oremet amended the plan in may may amendments to permit plan participants to sell increasing amounts of their oremet stock first up to then up to and finally,after july,up to.
in addition,the may amendments provided that the plan would cease to be an esop but would remain a stock bonus plan at such time as the majority of plan assets were no longer invested primarily in oremet common stock the transformation date.moreover,the may amendments stated that the plan requirement that plan assets be invested primarily in oremet stock would be replaced with a requirement that plan assets be invested as provided in the trust agreement.the trust agreement,in turn,provided that up to of the assets of the trust fund may be invested in company stock,and any stock of an affiliate of oremet counted as company stock.
the union opposed any further diversification of plan assets although it agreed to the may amendments.for this reason,the may amendments included a side agreement between oremet and the union that prohibited subsequent amendment of the plan to permit further diversification of the plan investments through the sale of oremet stock until at least the year.plaintiffs allege that the side agreement was motivated by the union desire to maintain its current level of representation on oremet board of directors pursuant to oremet.in,oremet amended its to provide that the plan would nominate and elect four of the nine members of the board as long as the plan owned or more of the outstanding shares of oremet common stock.if the plan ownership fell below,the plan would be able to nominate and to elect only two members of the board,one union and one nonunion.
in october,allegheny teledyne and oremet publicly announced a merger whereby oremet shareholders would receive shares of allegheny teledyne stock for each share of oremet stock.oremet stock closed at per share on october,and at on november,the first day of trading after the merger was announced.in january,two months before the merger was consummated,a group of plan participants submitted a petition to the plan advisory committee asking for the immediate release of the remaining of oremet common stock in their plan accounts so as to capture the stock appreciation.the plan advisory committee met in february of to discuss the petition and other matters.according to the minutes of one of their meetings,defendant weber told the advisory committee that the plan was a bargained for item in the labor contract and that the advisory committee did not have the authority to act on this petition without concurrence from management and the union.the meeting minutes further state that t he current agreement is that the last of a participant account would remain in the trust until at least the year,the next scheduled labor agreement negotiations.plaintiffs contend that the current agreement refers to the side agreement.the request contained in the petition was turned down the plan was not amended.
in march,the merger of oremet and allegheny teledyne was consummated,resulting in the formation of allegheny technologies.as a result of the merger,allegheny teledyne acquired all of oremet stock,and oremet became a wholly owned subsidiary of allegheny teledyne.plaintiffs allege that at this time the transformation date provision of the may amendments was triggered and the plan ceased to be an esop though it remained a stock bonus plan.in the words of the first amended complaint,the trading value of the allegheny technologies stock fluctuated dramatically and began and continued to decrease substantially after the merger.in november,allegheny instituted a reverse stock split whereby each plan participant received one share of allegheny technologies stock for each two shares of allegheny teledyne stock held by the participant.the plan held shares of allegheny technologies stock after the reverse split.after the merger,the value of one split share of allegheny technologies stock decreased from to per share.
on march,plaintiffs filed their initial complaint against the oremet defendants,key,and the union.the complaint argued that the oremet defendants violated erisa prudence,exclusive purpose,and provisions by refusing the demands of plaintiffs and other plan participants to amend the plan to permit the participants to sell a higher percentage of employer securities allocated to their plan accounts than the percentage permitted by the plan express terms.plaintiffs further contended that key and the union were liable as because they participated in,permitted,or failed to remedy the oremet defendants alleged violation of erisa exclusive purpose requirement.after the district court identified a number of factual and legal deficiencies in plaintiffs complaint,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.the district court subsequently dismissed all of plaintiffs claims with prejudice.

erisa prudence requirement 
erisa requires that a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.a court task in evaluating a fiduciary compliance with this standard is to inquire whether the individual trustees,at the time they engaged in the challenged transactions,employed the appropriate methods to investigate the merits of the investment and to structure the investment.donovan mazzola,cir.plaintiffs contend that the oremet defendants violated a b by failing to investigate whether to sell the plan company stock when the company was involved in a merger and a substantial premium could have been realized.they also contend that the oremet defendants violated the provision by failing to investigate whether to sell the plan company stock when the stock value declined and continued to decline following the merger.selling the stock in either scenario would have been in violation of the plan express terms.
eiaps are exempt from erisa diversification requirement and its prudence requirement to the extent that it requires diversification.a.eiaps are also exempt from the percentage limitation on investments in an employer securities.id.b.despite these exemptions,courts have emphasized that erisa prudence requirement continues to apply to an eiap fiduciaries.see,fink,at.indeed,the third circuit in moench robertson,cir,followed by the sixth circuit in kuper iovenko,cir,has adopted a prudence standard pursuant to a b that requires eiaps to diversify their employer stock holdings in certain circumstances.under this standard,an eiap fiduciary who invests in employer stock is presumed to have acted consistently with erisa however,a plaintiff may overcome this presumption by showing that the fiduciary abused his or her discretion.moench,at.to rebut the presumption,the plaintiff must show that the erisa fiduciary could not have believed reasonably that continued adherence to the plan terms was in keeping with the settlor expectations of how a prudent trustee would operate.id.
the third circuit intermediate prudence standard is difficult to reconcile with erisa statutory text,which exempts eiaps from the prudence requirement to the extent that it requires diversification.see in re mckesson hboc.erisa,no,wl,at,unpublished disposition if there is no duty to diversify esop plan assets under the statute,it logically follows that there can be no claim for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of a failure to diversify,or in other words,arising out of allowing the plan to become heavily weighted in company stock.interpreting erisa prudence requirement to subject eiaps to an albeit tempered duty to diversify arguably threatens to eviscerate congressional intent and the guiding rationale behind eiaps themselves.see fink,at noting that eiaps are exempt from certain erisa provisions because of the strong policy and preference in favor of investment in employer stock internal quotation marks omitted 
that said,the facts of this case do not necessitate that we decide whether the duty to diversify survives the statutory text of a.plaintiffs prudence claim is unavailing under any existing approach.if eiaps are unconditionally exempt from erisa duty to diversify,defendants refusal to diversify the plan beyond the level of clearly does not constitute an actionable violation of erisa prudence requirement.if the moench standard controls plaintiffs prudence claim still loses.unlike moench,this case does not present a situation where a company financial situation is seriously deteriorating and there is a genuine risk of insider.see moench,at c ourts should be cognizant that as the financial state of the company deteriorates,esop fiduciaries who double as directors of the corporation often begin to serve two masters.see also lalonde textron,d,applying moench,and reasoning that an esop fiduciary presumption of reasonableness may be overcome when a precipitous decline in the employer stock is combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or undergoing serious mismanagement emphasis added 
though plaintiffs contend that the district court prematurely dismissed their claims at the motion to dismiss stage,plaintiffs alleged facts effectively preclude a claim under moench,eliminating the need for further discovery.see weisbuch county of,cir a plaintiff may plead herself out of court if the pleadings establish facts compelling a decision one way,that is as good as if depositions and other expensively obtained evidence on summary judgment establishes the identical facts.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the published accounts of oremet earnings and financial fundamentals during the relevant period,attached to the complaint,demonstrate that oremet was far from the sort of deteriorating financial circumstances involved in moench and was,in fact,profitable and paying substantial dividends throughout that period.see textron,d at it is common knowledge that the stock market suffered dramatic losses during and,but the plaintiffs fail to allege any facts that would indicate textron or the plan should have had reason to think the decline in the price of textron stock was anything unusual or specifically related to textron viability as a company.emphasis added 
mere stock fluctuations,even those that trend downward significantly,are insufficient to establish the requisite imprudence to rebut the moench presumption.see kuper,at concluding that company acknowledged failure to even consider diversifying an esop during an period where company stock declined from more than per share to approximately per share did not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.as the sixth circuit noted in kuper,a fiduciary failure to investigate an investment decision alone is not sufficient to show that the decision was not reasonable a plaintiff must show a causal link between the failure to investigate and the harm suffered by the plan.id.at second emphasis added.plaintiffs,with hindsight,argue that the oremet defendants acted improvidently in declining to sell the stock and capture the premium before the stock price declined.the premium plaintiffs emphasize is nothing more than a rise in share value following a major,though not necessarily unique,corporate development.stock price benefits accruing from the merger could likewise be generated years into the future.the moench standard does not compel fiduciaries to permit further diversification of eiap pension plans upon each subsequent rise in share value attributed to a merger or,for that matter,any other major corporate development.it merely requires fiduciaries to act reasonably.it does not require them to act in an extraordinarily prescient manner.
the district court therefore did not err in concluding that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for a violation of erisa prudence requirement.
erisa exclusive purpose requirement 
erisa exclusive purpose provision requires that plans be administered for the exclusive purpose of i providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and ii defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.a a.plaintiffs argue that the oremet defendants violated erisa exclusive purpose requirement by deferring to the union judgment regarding the propriety of selling plan assets pursuant to the side agreement and by failing to make a scrupulous independent determination that continued investment in employer securities was prudent or in the best interests of the plan participants.plaintiffs further allege that key and the union are liable as because they participated in,permitted,or failed to remedy the oremet defendants alleged violation of erisa exclusive purpose requirement.
plaintiffs exclusive purpose claim is derivative of their prudence claim and fails for the reasons outlined above.erisa requires fiduciaries to comply with a plan as written unless it is inconsistent with erisa.erisa does no more than protect the benefits which are due to an employee under a plan.bennett conrail matched sav.plan admin,cir.the duty to act in accordance with the plan document does not require a fiduciary to resolve every issue of interpretation in favor of plan beneficiaries.collins pension ins.comm.of cal.rock prods.ready mixed concrete ass ns,cir per curiam citing ret.plan for salaried employees of rko,cir.erisa does not create an exclusive duty to maximize pecuniary benefits.id.citing foltz,at.because defendants complied with the plan lawful terms and were under no legal obligation to deviate from those terms,they provided plaintiffs with their benefits due.the district court did not err in concluding that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for violation of erisa exclusive purpose requirement.
erisa provision 
erisa provides that a fiduciary of a plan shall not cause the plan to engage in a transaction if the fiduciary knows or should know that the transaction constitutes a direct or indirect 
a sale or exchange,or leasing,of any property between the plan and a party in interest 
b lending of money or other extension of credit between the plan and a party in interest 
c furnishing of goods,services,or facilities between the plan and a party in interest 
d transfer to,or use by or for the benefit of a party in interest,of any assets of the plan or 
e acquisition,on behalf of the plan,of any employer security or employer real property in violation of section a of this title.
a.similarly,a plan fiduciary shall not deal with the assets of the plan in his own interest or for his own account.id.b.the supreme court has interpreted to prohibit fiduciaries from involving the plan and its assets in certain kinds of business deals congress enacted to bar categorically a transaction that is likely to injure the pension plan.lockheed spink,d quoting comm r keystone consol,d 
plaintiffs argue that the oremet defendants violated erisa provision by dealing with the plan assets for the benefit of a party in interest,specifically,the union.plaintiffs contend that the oremet defendants decision not to sell the allegheny stock through denying a petition by plan participants falls within a d because it constitutes a use of the plan assets by or for the benefit of,a party in interest.the union,plaintiffs contend,acted as a de facto fiduciary and violated by persuading the plan fiduciaries not to investigate the benefits of retaining the allegheny stock and not to sell the allegheny stock after the merger.the union purportedly acted in this manner to maintain positions on the oremet board.
plaintiffs fail to identify any transaction that falls within a or b.they have pointed to nothing akin to a sale,exchange,or leasing of property,or the lending of money or extension of credit,all commercial bargains defined by the supreme court in lockheed as falling under.lockheed,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the decision by the oremet defendants to continue to hold of plan assets in employer stock was not a transaction.it was merely a lawful decision to remain in full compliance with the explicit language of the plan terms.plaintiffs therefore fail to state a claim for violation of based on the plan fiduciaries decision to adhere to the plan terms.
plaintiffs argument also loses because they have failed to establish that the union is a fiduciary.lockheed specifically states that to establish liability under,a party must prove that a fiduciary caused the plan to engage in the allegedly unlawful transaction.id.at.as discussed in the section below,the union actions do not constitute those of a fiduciary or even a de facto fiduciary.
d.the union is not a plan fiduciary or a de facto fiduciary 
to be found liable under erisa for breach of the duty of prudence and for participation in a breach of fiduciary duty,an individual or entity must be a fiduciary.see.an individual or entity performs a fiduciary function with respect to a pension plan when exercis ing any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercis ing any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets under erisa.a.
