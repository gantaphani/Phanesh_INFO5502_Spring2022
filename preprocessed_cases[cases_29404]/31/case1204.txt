plaintiff karla schikore,a employee of bank of america,nt sa,seeks disbursement of retirement benefits she has accrued as a participant in the bankamerica supplemental retirement plan,an employee benefits plan covered under the erisa statute.the defendant plan denied schikore request on the ground that she failed properly to follow the plan payment election procedure.specifically,the plan contends that schikore failed to submit the requisite benefit payment election form one year in advance of her request for disbursement,as mandated by the plan rules,and that it has no record of having received the form.schikore asserts that she mailed the form well in advance of the deadline,that she submitted evidence of such a mailing,and that the common law mailbox rule,under which receipt is presumed upon proof of mailing,should apply.whether the federal and state common law mailbox rule applies to an erisa plan benefit decisions is a question of first impression in this circuit.as schikore was appealing a denial of benefits under her retirement plan,the district court had jurisdiction under a b.the district court order remanding to the plan administrator constitutes an appealable final order,over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to stating that courts of appeals have jurisdiction solely over appeals from final decisions of the district courts of the united states 
factual and procedural background 
schikore was employed by bank of america,nt sa bank from to march,when she voluntarily terminated her employment.the bank is a subsidiary of bankamerica corporation corporation,which established the bankamerica supplemental retirement plan plan for its employees and employees of its subsidiaries and affiliates.the rules of the plan are contained in the summary description document plan description.during schikore employment with the bank,she participated in several retirement plans offered by the corporation the one at issue here is an unfunded retirement benefits plan intended to provide supplementary benefits for certain management and highly compensated employees of various subsidiaries and affiliates of the corporation.as an unfunded plan,the plan is not required to segregate the funds to be used to pay benefits.the plan administrator for purposes of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a,is the bankamerica corporation employee benefits administrative committee plan administrator,which consists of senior officers of participating corporation subsidiaries and affiliates.the plan administrator has discretionary authority under the plan to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the plan.
the plan rules,contained in the plan description,provide that an employee with at least in her account who wishes disbursement of benefits following termination of employment must submit a benefit payment election form to the bankamerica retirement plans service center service center at least one year prior to the termination date.the daily administration of the service center is handled by a administrator,kwasha lipton administrator,but overseen by the plan administrator.if employment is terminated before the anniversary of the filing of the election form,the request for disbursement is not honored and benefits are instead paid in five annual installments beginning in the calendar year after the employee reaches years of age.
schikore,who is years old,stated that she completed the election form in december and mailed it to the service center,retaining a copy for her records.in march,prior to terminating her employment with the bank,schikore applied for disbursement of her benefits.schikore was informed by the plan that she did not have an election form on file at the service center.immediately upon learning this,schikore faxed a copy of the completed form to the service center.the plan nevertheless denied schikore request for disbursement on the basis that it did not have her election form on file one year prior to her march,request.
schikore appealed the plan decision to the plan administrator,asserting that the common law mailbox rule creates a presumption of receipt which the plan had failed to rebut.the plan administrator denied schikore appeal on the grounds that because erisa preempts common law rules,the mailbox rule is inapplicable to employee benefit plans,even if the mailbox rule would otherwise apply,the plan rules,as a matter of contract,expressly require actual receipt as opposed to mere mailing of the document,and the plan rules do not permit disbursement because the service center did not have her election form on file one year prior to her march request.
schikore filed suit under a b of erisa,which permits a participant to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of schikore,concluding that the plan administrator abused its discretion by refusing to apply the common law presumption of receipt.the court remanded for the plan administrator to determine whether schikore had presented sufficient evidence of mailing to invoke a presumption of receipt and,if so,whether the plan had sufficiently rebutted that presumption by contrary evidence of.the plan filed a timely notice of appeal.schikore on the issue of remand to the plan administrator and on the district court denial of attorney fees.both parties argue that a remand to the plan administrator is neither necessary nor desirable.
standard of review 
in an erisa case,we review the district court determinations de novo.friedrich intel,cir.where the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,we ordinarily review the plan administrator decisions for an abuse of discretion.sandy reliance standard life ins,cir firestone tire rubber bruch,d.
the abuse of discretion standard requires reversal of the findings of the plan administrator if they are found to be arbitrary and capricious.we have held that plan administrators abuse their discretion when they render decisions without any explanation,or construe provisions of the plan in a way that conflicts with the plain language of the plan.eley boeing,cir internal quotations omitted.similarly we have held that an abuse of discretion occurs when a plan administrator fails to develop facts necessary to make its determination,taft,at.as a more general matter,an error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.see cooter gell hartmarx,d a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law levi strauss shilon,cir a district court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the correct law.the abuse of discretion rule is equally applicable in the case of errors of law made by plan administrators.
additionally,if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a facto r in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.firestone tire and rubber,at.quoting restatement second of trusts,comment d the district court,citing winters costco wholesale,cir,found that a less deferential standard of review was appropriate because a conflict of interest existed.schikore urges us to apply that lesser standard here.see id.applying less deferential standard of review where potential conflict of interest exists.we need not decide which standard of review is applicable because even under the more deferential traditional standard,we conclude that the plan administrator decision must be vacated.
discussion 
the plan determination was arbitrary and capricious and it abused its discretion in finding that erisa preempted the common law mailbox rule,finding that the rule was one of construction and therefore inapplicable to the plan requirement of actual receipt,and failing to adequately develop the factual record before denying schikore claim of eligibility for benefits.
i.the application of the common law mailbox rule to schikore eligibility determination 
the mailbox rule provides that the proper and timely mailing of a document raises a rebuttable presumption that the document has been received by the addressee in the usual time.it is a settled feature of the federal common law.hagner united states.rosenthal walker.lewis united states,cir.as a rebuttable presumption,it does not operate as a rule of construction,dictating that a requirement of receipt should be read as a requirement of timely mailing.rather,it is a tool for determining,in the face of inconclusive evidence,whether or not receipt has actually been accomplished.therefore,the application of the rule is not contrary to the plan requirement of actual receipt,as the plan contends.rather it helps establish whether actual receipt occurred.the plan document contains no terms or provisions addressing how it is to be determined whether a required form was received.for the reasons enumerated below,we hold that in such circumstance it was an abuse of discretion for the plan to fail to apply the rebuttable presumption that a letter mailed is received,developed precisely to aid finders of fact in circumstances where direct evidence of either receipt or is,as here,not available 
the common law mailbox rule is consistent with the purposes of erisa and applies to erisa plans where receipt is a factual issue in dispute as the district court noted,federal common law is applicable when evaluating claims for benefits unless that common law is inconsistent with erisa objectives.in enacting erisa,congress painted with a broad brush,expecting the federal courts to develop a federal common law of rights and obligations interpreting erisa fiduciary standards.bins exxon,cir en banc quoting varity howe,d in formulating the federal common law applicable to erisa,courts are to be governed by the federal policies at issue.menhorn firestone tire rubber,cir.the purpose of erisa is to protect the rights of employees in their benefit plans.b congressional findings and declaration of erisa policy.thus,for example,this court has held that there is a common law right of rescission under erisa for an insurance contract entered into under a false representation of health.sec.life ins.of am.meyling,cir particularly relevant to the instant case is horton reliance standard life ins,cir.there,the eleventh circuit held that federal common law presumptions against suicide and in favor of accidental death applied to erisa benefit claims.id.at.the court concluded that the presumptions against suicide and in favor of accidental death further erisa goals by provid ing courts and juries with uniform rules to resolve coverage questions where the evidence of how the insured died is inconclusive.id.
in the instant case,there is a critical evidentiary question specifically,who bears the ultimate burden of establishing receipt when receipt is disputed and the evidence is inconclusive.we note that the plan requires only actual receipt and does not require any particular form of mailing.in the absence of the use of registered or certified mail,on the one hand,and a returned envelope or other indication of failed delivery,on the other,both receipt and are difficult to prove conclusively.nunley city of los angeles,cir.this case exemplifies the reason for the common law application of the mailbox rule.the evidence is inconclusive schikore claims that she mailed the form,and the plan claims that the form is not contained in its files.as the district court reasoned,the presumption of receipt established by the mailbox rule applied precisely to avoid the type of swearing contest in which the parties are presently involved.in the absence of such a rule,plan participants could easily be disadvantaged and their rights made wholly dependent on the choice that plan administrators would be forced to make between unproved assertions by the participant and similarly unproved assertions by the plan they administer.permitting such arbitrary decisionmaking would be directly contrary to the purpose of erisa to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries.b congressional findings and declaration of erisa policy.application of the common law mailbox rule,which allows a plan to rebut an unfounded claim by adequate evidence,avoids such arbitrariness and is therefore consistent with erisa policies and purpose.it was an abuse of discretion for the plan administrator to conclude that the rule was inapplicable in this case.
we have never previously considered the question of precisely how the common law mailbox rule should be applied to an erisa plan benefit decisions.the answer is not difficult.like the application of all common law rules,the application of the mailbox rule to an erisa plan benefit decisions must be done in a manner consistent with the purposes of erisa,the central purpose of which is to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries.b congressional findings and declaration of policy.see also shaw delta air lines,d.
because the common law mailbox rule operates as a rebuttable presumption,the factfinder must determine whether schikore has presented sufficient evidence of mailing to invoke the presumption of receipt and,if so,whether the plan has presented sufficient evidence of to rebut the presumption.
schikore has presented,as evidence of mailing,a sworn declaration that she mailed the benefit payment election form to the service center in december.we have held a sworn statement is credible evidence of mailing for purposes of the mailbox rule.lewis united states,cir.
the plan relied in its factual determination of only on the fact that the form is not presently contained in its records.permitting a retirement plan to find simply on the basis that the records office now can not find the document,although there is evidence of mailing,is inconsistent with erisa purpose to protect employee rights employees are often asked to make crucial determinations about the management and disbursement of their retirement benefits by submitting certain documents,payment election forms to their retirement plans.in a large number of cases,submission will occur by mail.the function of the mailbox rule in this context is to provide employees with a guarantee that,if the retirement plan claims not to have received a document that an employee mailed,the document will nevertheless be presumed to have been received by the plan unless the plan can produce probative evidence of.at the very least,this requires a plan to describe in detail its procedures for receiving,sorting,and distributing mail,to show that these procedures were properly followed at the time when the document in question might conceivably have been delivered by the postal service,to provide evidence that it has conducted a thorough search for the document at the addressee physical facility,and to establish that had the document been received around the time the claimant asserted it was mailed,it would presently be at the location searched by the plan administrator 
the plan has asserted that the entirety of its administrative record on this determination has been admitted into evidence.there is nothing in that record to suggest that the administrator conducted any beyond that of confirming with the administrator that schikore form was not currently on file at the retirement plans service center.
it is clear that the common law mailbox rule was not applied to schikore claim we find that the determination that the common law mailbox rule is inapplicable under erisa,and the failure to develop any meaningful factual record upon which to make a determination,were both arbitrary and capricious and demonstrate a clear abuse of discretion by the plan administrator 
ii.remand to plan administrator 
neither party sought to introduce evidence beyond the administrative record in district court,and neither party sought a remand to the plan administrator for any other purpose.both parties agree that such a remand is not necessary or desirable,because what is required here is a legal determination that the courts must ultimately make we agree that the central question in this case is not a question of discretion or the application of a standard contained in a plan or some other document.rather,here,it is simply a matter of applying the correct legal common law the simple and undisputed facts.in that circumstance,we will not order a remand to the administrator contrary to the expressed views of the parties.we therefore remand to the district court to review the administrative record before it,to apply the common law mailbox rule,and to determine whether the plan received schikore form in a timely manner.
iii.attorneys fees 
schikore requests an award of the attorney fees incurred at the district court level and in this appeal under g,which authorizes recovery of attorney fees and costs in any erisa action under a b.the district court gave no reasons for its denial of fees to schikore the court therefore abused its discretion to grant or deny an award of fees.accordingly we are required to set its decision aside.smith pension trust,cir.schikore is entitled to fees upon appeal,canseco constr.laborers pension trust,cir,the amount of which we remand to the district court for determination.
conclusion 
we conclude that the plan administrator abused its discretion in denying schikore disbursement of her retirement benefits without applying the mailbox rule.in light of the parties agreement that remand to the plan administrator by the district court was inappropriate,we hereby vacate that part of the court order and remand to that court to apply the common law mailbox presumption to the facts contained in the administrative record already before it.
schikore is awarded attorneys fees incurred on this appeal,the amount to be determined by the district court,which shall also reconsider its prior denial of fees to schikore.
affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded.
i disagree with the majority that the plan administrator abused its discretion in denying schikore claim.
first,the majority implies that a heightened standard of review may be appropriate because of a potential conflict of interest between the employer responsible for funding schikore benefits and the plan administrator responsible for determining schikore eligibility for benefits.op.at.it is true that an apparent conflict of interest exists when a plan administrator is responsible for both funding and paying claims mcdaniel chevron,cir.however,unless the plan participant comes forward with material,probative evidence,beyond the mere fact of the apparent conflict,tending to show that the fiduciary self interest caused a breach of the administrator fiduciary obligations,the district court should apply the traditional abuse of discretion standard.id.quoting atwood newmont gold,cir bendixen standard ins,cir.schikore has not pointed to any evidence in the record to support her claim of a conflict of interest,let alone material and probative evidence her generalized assertions are insufficient to support her claim see atwood,at explaining that,the simple fact that employees of the participant employer made the decision to deny benefits is not enough to establish a breach of fiduciary duty.the plan administrator decision to deny accelerated payment of the benefits therefore should be reviewed under the more deferential abuse of discretion standard.
under the traditional abuse of discretion standard,the plan administrator decision to deny benefits must be upheld if it is based upon a reasonable interpretation of the plan terms and if it was made in good faith.the question we must ask is not whose interpretation of the plan documents is most persuasive,but whether the interpretation is unreasonable.mcdaniel,at citation omitted quoting canseco constr.laborers pension trust,cir second alteration in original.indeed,an administrator decision is not arbitrary unless it is not grounded on any reasonable basis.accordingly,a court may overturn a decision only where it is so patently arbitrary and unreasonable as to lack foundation in factual basis authority in governing case or statute law.hensley northwest permanente ret.plan trust,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
it is true that,u nder erisa,congress has authorized the courts to formulate a nationally uniform federal common law to supplement the explicit provisions and general policies set out in the act.sec.life ins.of am.meyling,cir quoting peterson am.life health ins,cir second alteration in original.nonetheless,the plain language of an erisa plan should be given its literal and natural meaning.health cost controls isbell,cir.thus,although federal common law fills the gaps of erisa to assist in the interpretation of erisa plans,federal courts may not apply common law theories to alter the express terms of written benefit plans.id.citation omitted see also richardson pension plan of bethlehem steel,cir agreeing with the sixth circuit statement that w hen disputes arise,courts should first look to the explicit language of the agreement to determine,if possible,the clear intent of the parties quoting armistead vernitron,cir.
the plan states that the election form shall become effective on the one year anniversary of the date the election is received by the service center.plan b emphasis added.the plan also provides that i f the participant does not have a benefit payment election in effect when employment ends,the participant benefits under the supplemental plan shall be paid in five annual installments commencing in the calendar year after the participant attains age.plan b.the plan thus explicitly states that the election form must be received,not mailed,in order to be effective.the plan administrator interpreted these terms as requiring actual receipt,not merely evidence of mailing.again,we may overturn a decision only where it is so patently arbitrary and unreasonable as to lack foundation in factual basis authority in governing case or statute law.hensley,at internal quotation marks omitted.the plan administrator interpretation is certainly not patently arbitrary and unreasonable and,consequently,must be upheld.see mcdaniel,at stating that a plan administrator decision to deny benefits must be upheld if it is a reasonable interpretation of the plan terms and was made in good faith.
the majority attempts to distinguish hensley by stating that the instant case is not concerned with the interpretation of a plan term op.at.it is precisely the interpretation of a plan term that is at issue,however.the question is whether schikore had an election form in effect when her employment ended.the plan administrator determined that the service center had not received schikore election form one year prior to her termination date,as required by the plan,and that she accordingly did not have a form in effect.it was not unreasonable for the plan administrator to interpret receipt of the form as requiring the service center to have the form on file on the contrary,plan administrators should be given the full benefit of the discretion afforded to them by their respective plans in interpreting plan terms,be they defined or undefined,with the reasonableness of those interpretations being evaluated against the relevant factual and legal backgrounds.hensley,at.
the majority relies on horton reliance standard life ins,cir,in which the court held that common law presumptions against suicide and in favor of accidental death applied in an erisa suit.id.at.the holding in horton did not,however,contradict any express terms in the plans,nor did it encroach on the companies discretion in interpreting the plans.the policies at issue provided benefits if the insured death was accidental and occurred while the insured was on company business.the insurance companies denied benefits,based on speculation that the insured death was a suicide,not an accident.id.at.the eleventh circuit held that,when the evidence is inconclusive as to whether the deceased died by accidental or intentional means,use of the legal presumptions against suicide and in favor of accidental death are appropriate.id.at.the presumption against suicide therefore was employed as a means of weighing the evidenc
