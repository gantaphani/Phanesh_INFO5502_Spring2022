the ibm personal pension plan is a plan.it is almost,but not quite,a plan.although each employee in a plan has a fully funded individual account,the personal account in a plan is not separately funded.instead ibm imputes value to the account in the form of credits there are pay credits set at of the employee gross taxable income and interest credits set at basis points above the rate of interest on treasury bills.a trust holds assets that may or may not be enough to fund all of the individual accounts when workers quit or retire.ibm plan permits an employee who quits or retires after working long enough for pension benefits to vest a maximum of five years to withdraw the balance in cash or roll it over into a fully funded annuity.during the time before the employee takes the risk that ibm will suffer business reverses and be unable to pay the full stated value of the account if the amount already in trust for participants as a group turns out to be insufficient otherwise ibm plan is economically identical to a plan funded the same way and invested in a bond fund that returns above the treasury rate.
plaintiffs in this litigation contend that ibm plan violates a subsection of erisa the employee retirement income security act that prohibits age discrimination.the district court ruled in plaintiffs favor,see d,and proceedings continued as the parties debated how much ibm owes and how it must change its plan in future years as a remedy.that subject has been resolved to mutual on the district judge being right on the this appeal is limited to the question whether the plan is unlawfully discriminatory.
all terms of ibm plan are.every covered employee receives the same pay credit and the same interest credit per annum.the basis of the plaintiffs the district court that younger employees receive interest credits for more years.the language on which plaintiffs rely was added to erisa in congress also enacted a parallel provision covering plans,stat.we set these out alongside to facilitate comparison 
these appear to say the same thing,except that the rule for plans tells us what is not allowed,while the rule for plans tells us what works.either way,the employer ca stop making allocations or accruals to the plan or change their rate on account of age.the ibm plan does neither of these things and therefore,one would suppose,complies with the statute.if this were a real,rather than a phantom,plan,that much would be taken for granted.yet if the formula is when used in a plan,why should it become unlawful because the account balances are book entries rather than cash 
plaintiffs persuaded the district court,however,that the two subsections are radically different.that difference is attributable to the phrase benefit accrual,which appears in the subsection for plans but not the one for plans.neither erisa nor any regulation defines this phrase,so the district judge went looking for some equivalent elsewhere in the statute.it found the phrase accrued benefit,which is defined in a,a.an accrued benefit is an amount expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.plug this back into b h i,and the rule against discrimination then refers not to what ibm puts into the plan,but what the employee takes out on retirement.someone who leaves ibm at age,after years of service,will have a larger annual benefit at than someone whose years of service conclude with retirement at age.the former receives years more interest than the the judge assumed that this is not counterbalanced by the fact that older workers generally draw higher salaries.under the district court analysis,compound interest becomes a scourge,for the younger the employee when any given year salary is earned,the greater the payout expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.
this approach treats the time value of money as age discrimination.yet the statute does not require that equation.interest is not treated as age discrimination for a plan,and the fact that these subsections are so close in both function and expression implies that it should not be treated as discriminatory for a plan either.the phrase benefit accrual reads most naturally as a reference to what the employer puts in either in absolute terms or as a rate of change,while the defined phrase accrued benefit refers to outputs after compounding.that where this litigation went off the rails a phrase dealing with inputs was misunderstood to refer to outputs.as long as we think of benefit accrual as referring to what the employer imputes to the understanding reinforced by the use of the word allocation in the subsection addressing is no statutory difference between the treatment of economically equivalent and plans.for plans,where the account is an accounting entry rather than cash,benefit accrual matches the money allocated to a plan.
nothing in the language or background of b h i suggests that congress set out to legislate against the fact that younger workers have statistically more time left before retirement,and thus a greater opportunity to earn interest on each year retirement savings.treating the time value of money as a form of discrimination is not sensible.hazen paper biggins,d variables correlated with age must be kept analytically distinct from age when searching for discrimination.the parallel between the subsections for and plans shows as much.all sorts of things go wrong unless we treat both b h i and b a as addressing the rate at which value is added or imputed to an account,rather than the annual pension at retirement age.consider a formula that adds to annual pension benefits for every year worked.this setup economically favors older workers as does a multiplier because it ignores the time value of money and treats the last year of work as contributing equally with the first.yet on the plaintiffs understanding it would be a form of discrimination against the old,because the is a smaller rate of benefit accrual as time passes.someone who worked two years would get a rate of increase in his second year his annual benefits on retirement would jump from to,while someone who works years receives only a increase from to in year.
our conclusion that benefit accrual for plans and allocation for plans both refer to the employer contribution rather than the time value of money between contribution and retirement has the support of regulations that the treasury department proposed.appropriations riders have prevented the treasury from taking final action on the draft regulations,but they still help to inform our understanding of the statute.the draft regulations treat the rate of benefit accrual as the increase in the participant accrued normal retirement benefit for the year.for plans in particular the phrase would have been defined as the additions to the participant hypothetical account for the plan year.at.the draft specifies that interest credits must accrue at a reasonable rate of interest that does not decrease because of the attainment of age and be provided for all future periods,including after normal retirement age.ibid.
thus the treasury view,like our independent reading,looks at the rate of contribution what goes into the account rather than the annual rate of withdrawal at retirement.the treasury asks if this employee were younger,would the hypothetical balance have grown more this year for ibm plan,the answer is no.when an employee is,his account is increased monthly by of his salary plus credits based on the account balance multiplied by a prescribed interest rate.the same is true when the employee turns,or.neither the contribution rate nor the interest rate changes with age.no one contests the rate at which interest is basis points over the treasury rate looks low compared with what investments could earn in the private market and therefore could be understood to disfavor younger employees.
plaintiffs propose a different definition of benefit accrual annual pension at retirement age divided by salary.contributions at age produce an annual pension benefit that equals about of each year income in nominal dollars,while contributions at produce annual bene
