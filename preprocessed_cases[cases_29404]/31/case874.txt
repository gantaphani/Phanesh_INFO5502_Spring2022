lou mazzei,trustee of the local building material teamsters and helpers welfare fund and local building material teamsters and helpers pension fund the funds,filed suit against rock n around trucking rna,claiming that pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement the cba rna entered into with the international brotherhood of teamsters,local local,rna owes the funds in contributions on behalf of its.the district court found that the cba obligates rna to contribute to the funds on behalf of its.the court concluded,however,that such contributions would violate section of the labor management relations act lmra,because rna are independent contractors.therefore,the court granted rna motion for summary judgment.mazzei now appeals the district court decision.because we agree with the district court conclusion that the contributions called for in the cba are illegal under section of the lmra,we affirm its decision granting rna motion for summary judgment.
rna is an illinois corporation that provides trucking services to the construction industry.in april,rna entered into the cba with the local,a labor union representing truck drivers and yard employees engaged in the processing and delivery of building materials.the controversy in this case centers around what obligation,if any,rna has,under the terms of the cba,to contribute to the funds on behalf of its,those individuals who own and drive their own trucks.
most of rna hauling operations are performed by.these individuals sign equipment leases with rna and operate under rna license to operate as a motor carrier the lease term is for three years,though either party may terminate the lease at any time without penalty.additionally,are free to lease their services to other carriers during this term,and they can refuse to work for rna for any reason.working for rna store and maintain their own trucks,pay for their own gas,pay their own taxes,and provide their own insurance coverage.with regard to compensation,are paid on a form basis and receive a gross percentage of the payments rna receives from its customers,rather than an hourly wage.
an who accepts an assignment from rna is told the location and time of the delivery of his or her respective load.when an accepts an assignment from rna,that is required by illinois law to place a sign on the side of the truck cab that reads leased to operated by rock n around trucking,this sign must be covered up or removed,however,whenever an is not performing work for rna under rna ilcc license and must return these signs along with all other rna materials at the end of a lease term.
the funds are multiemployer benefit plans as defined in a,and therefore,they are governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.a.in the course of auditing employers contributing to the funds,local concluded that rna owed in delinquent contributions on behalf of its.mazzei,a trustee of the funds,filed suit in the northern district of illinois pursuant to section of erisa,alleging that rna violated section of erisa,by failing to make contributions required by the cba on behalf of its.rna disputed mazzei claim,advancing three reasons why it should not be required to make these contributions the contract language is ambiguous and does not require contributions the signed waivers of contributions,and thus,none are required and the are independent contractors and not employees,thereby making the contributions illegal.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted rna motion,finding that although the cba unambiguously obligates rna to contribute to the funds for each of its,the form of contribution called for in the cba is illegal under section of the lmra because rna are independent contractors.mazzei now appeals the court decision,challenging its determination that the are independent contractors instead of employees and its conclusion that the contributions called for in the cba violate federal law.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to grant rna motion for summary judgment de novo.see contreras suncast,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.a genuine issue of material fact exists,and summary judgment is improper,if a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party.see anderson liberty lobby,d.in making this determination,we review the record in the light most favorable to the party,in this case mazzei,drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.see amadio ford motor,cir see also liberty lobby,at.
rna obligation to contribute under the cba 
mazzei alleges that rna failure to contribute to the funds on behalf of its violates the terms of the cba and section of erisa.section requires employers to comply with the terms of their agreements to make contributions to funds,cent.states,southeast southwest areas pension fund transp,cir,to the extent that such terms are not inconsistent with the law see cent.states,southeast southwest areas pension fund hartlage truck,cir.thus,we must first review the language of the cba and determine whether it obligates rna to contribute to the funds on behalf of its.see.conference of teamsters employers welfare fund mrowicki,cir.
the district court found that the terms of the cba unambiguously obligates rna to contribute to the funds on behalf of its.see mazzei trucking,c,wl.rna disputes the district court finding with respect to this issue.instead,rna contends that the cba unambiguously establishes that rna does not have to contribute to the funds on behalf of its.
we review the district court interpretation of the cba de novo.see cent.states,southeast southwest areas pension fund kroger,cir.we will enforce the terms of a collective bargaining agreement if those terms are unambiguous.see young drury lane,cir.the cba is unambiguous if it is susceptible to only one reasonable interpretation.moriarty svec,cir.furthermore,if we find no ambiguity in the terms of the cba,then,in determining its meaning as a matter of law,we need not review extrinsic evidence suggesting how those terms should be interpreted.see mrowicki,at.
article of the cba,entitled health and welfare and pension,obligates rna to contribute into a trust for the payment of health and welfare or pension benefits for an employee covered by this agreement.in article,employee is defined as the employee or employees in the classifications of work covered by the cba.while this definition does not address whether rna are considered covered employees,article,entitled,explains that operating their own vehicles and who are not certified carriers with proper illinois commerce commission authority are covered within the terms and conditions of this agreement,including union security,hours,wages,overtime,health welfare and pension and working conditions.cba emphasis added.article clearly extends rna responsibilities under article,health and welfare or pension,to the terms of employment for rna.therefore,we find that there can be no mistaking the fact that the cba attempts to impose an obligation on rna to contribute to the funds for each of its.
furthermore,we agree with the district court determination that this interpretation of the cba is straightforward and not inconsistent with other provisions therein.mazzei,wl,at.rna disagrees,arguing that sections and conflict with our interpretation and demonstrate that the terms of the cba do not obligate it to contribute to the funds on behalf of its.section explains that noncertified,the group of individuals at issue in this case 
shall receive the full wages,supplemental allowance,and all working conditions provided in this agreement and shall receive as a minimum salary after payment of all direct and indirect operating expenses including contributions to the health welfare fund and pension fund the sum equal to the amount he would have received for the time he would have worked as an hou
