in this appeal,we are asked to decide whether an employee benefit plan participant is required,under the employment retirement income security act of erisa,et,to exhaust an administrative claims procedure that was adopted by his plan only after he had already brought an erisa action to recover benefits.the district court held that the exhaustion of such remedies was a prerequisite to seeking relief in court,and so dismissed the plaintiff suit without prejudice.we hold that the exhaustion of such remedies is excused under l.accordingly,we vacate the decision of the district court,and remand to the district court for a benefits determination.
background 
while an employee of sterling winthrop sterling,martin coyne began participating in benefit plans these included sterling standard retirement plan as well as its supplemental benefit plan supplemental plan or plan,a top hat plan top hat plans are designed to provide certain employees with payments over and above the benefits provided by qualified employee benefit,plans that are eligible for favorable tax treatment,such as sterling standard retirement plan.the internal revenue code limits the value of benefits that may be paid under qualified plans,see a,the need for top hat plans when employers wish to provide a higher level of deferred compensation to some of their employees.top hat plans are exempt from many provisions of erisa,including the participation and vesting,funding,and fiduciary responsibility requirements,see,a,a,but like qualified plans,they are subject to disclosure requirements,to civil enforcement,and to the duty to have a claims procedure,see.
in coyne case,sterling supplemental plan promises to make up the shortfall between a what the qualified plan actually pays,and b the level of regular pension benefits participants would receive,the limits placed on qualified plan payouts by the tax code.the supplemental plan confers full power and authority on the plan committee to make binding and conclusive decisions on benefit claims and all other issues arising under the plan.based on estimates from an actuarial consulting firm,coyne places the value of his benefits under the plan at roughly per month.
coyne started working for sterling in.he and the company eventually parted ways amid a string of corporate recombinations.as a result,responsibility for coyne benefits under the supplemental plan seemed,for a time,to have gotten lost in the shuffle.sterling was bought by eastman kodak company kodak in,at which point sterling retirement programs became part of kodak retirement plan.sterling changed hands again in,becoming a subsidiary of bayer corporation bayer through a,transaction that also involved smithkline beecham.see eastman kodak stwb,d.the parties agree,however,that none of the transactions described above terminated sterling liability for any payments due to coyne under the terms of the supplemental plan.coyne continued to work for sterling until shortly after the company sale to bayer,when coyne became an employee of kodak,for whom he worked until his retirement in july.
starting in may,as coyne approached retirement,representatives of kodak contacted bayer by on coyne behalf to arrange for payment of coyne benefits under the supplemental plan.it seems that no employee prior to coyne had asserted a claim under the,coyne may be the only person eligible for benefits under it.coyne request for benefits was thus far from routine,and bayer was not adequately prepared to handle it.bayer had no claims procedure in place,and none was described in the plan.over the course of a year,kodak made a number of entreaties to bayer,by,express mail,and fax,and these were met variously with skepticism,befuddlement,and silence.initially,bayer representatives expressed some doubt that the company was liable for coyne benefits.after requesting a copy of the plan and related documents,which kodak duly sent,bayer then voiced some confusion as to why the claim was being pursued before coyne had reached the retirement age of.on october,bayer reported that it would convene its benefits group to address coyne claim.although kodak followed up with,bayer appears not to have responded.finally,on january,kodak controller to announce that kodak would proceed as necessary to enforce our rights under the stock purchase agreement pursuant to which bayer acquired sterling and assumed its liabilities.
coyne became eligible to receive benefits under the supplemental plan on march.still having heard nothing from bayer,kodak paid coyne first month of benefits.kodak controller again contacted bayer,now seeking indemnification for the payment under the terms of the sale of sterling to bayer.bayer did not respond,and in june kodak and coyne together filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.in the amended complaint coyne sought recovery of benefits owed under the plan,pursuant to a b.kodak sought indemnification for the payments it had made to coyne,and kodak and coyne together sought a declaratory judgment that bayer is obligated to pay coyne benefits under the supplemental plan for the rest of coyne life,and to coyne wife for the rest of her life if he her.stwb,bayer,sterling supplemental benefit plan committee,and the sterling supplemental benefit plan were named as defendants 
in its answer,filed october,bayer alleged that coyne had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.at a conference held the following week,bayer explained that those administrative remedies consisted of a new claims procedure added to the plan by amendment amendment,which sterling board of directors adopted on july.the amendment was retroactive,and made the claims procedure effective as of january.
kodak and coyne moved for summary judgment.coyne argued that the amendment had an adverse impact on his vested rights under the plan,and hence,was invalid under the terms of the plan,which forbade amendments that retroactively impair or otherwise adversely affect vested rights.the district court agreed with coyne that his rights under the plan were vested,but found that these rights were not impaired or adversely affected by the purely procedural introduction of a claim procedure.eastman kodak bayer,d.accordingly,the district court concluded that the amendment was valid,and that coyne had failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies.the action was dismissed without prejudice to its refiling after coyne exhausted the claims procedure.the district court also directed bayer to accept coyne complaint as a claim for benefits that triggered the plan administrative procedures.id.at.
kodak and coyne filed a notice of appeal,but kodak subsequently withdrew from the appeal.in response to an inquiry from coyne,the district court clarified that the administrative claims proceeding was not stayed pending appeal

appellate jurisdiction
