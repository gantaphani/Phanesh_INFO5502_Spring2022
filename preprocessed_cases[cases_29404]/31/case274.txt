opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal from an order entered in an action that joseph stevens,a former employee of a subsidiary of santander holdings usa santander,brought against santander seeking to recover benefits from two disability benefit plans that santander provided for its eligible employees.as an employee of a santander subsidiary,sovereign bank,stevens participated in these plans,a disability plan std and a disability plan ltd.in october,stevens sought std benefits through the administrator of santander plans,liberty life assurance company of boston,doing business as liberty mutual liberty mutual.after it initially awarded std benefits to stevens,liberty mutual determined that stevens no longer suffered from a qualifying disability,a determination that led it to terminate his std benefits.stevens responded by bringing this action pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,seeking reinstatement of the payment of benefits.the district court found that liberty mutual decision to terminate stevens std benefits was arbitrary and capricious and remanded the case to the plan administrator with instructions to reinstate stevens std benefit payments retroactively and to determine his eligibility for ltd benefit payments.
santander and liberty mutual appealed to this court,but stevens moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that the district court remand order to the plan administrator was not a final decision appealable pursuant to at that time.before reaching the merits of this appeal,we must determine whether the district court remand order is presently final and appealable under or is otherwise appealable.upon review,we hold that the district court has retained jurisdiction over the case and that the order from which appellants have appealed is not yet appealable.we therefore will dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
ii.background 
factual background and administrative proceedings 
sovereign bank employed stevens as a retail investment financial consultant ii from october,through october.during his employment,stevens received treatment for ankylosing spondylitis,a chronic inflammatory disease.as we have indicated,santander sponsored and funded an std benefits plan for its employees and engaged liberty mutual as the plan administrator.but even though liberty mutual was the plan administrator,santander retained final authority in the review of std claims and santander paid any benefits awarded.under the std plan,a covered employee,such as stevens,is considered disabled if objective medical evidence demonstrates that he is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his own occupation,in stevens case as a retail investment financial consultant ii.material and substantial duties are those normally required to be performed that can not be eliminated or modified.
santander also purchased an ltd benefit plan from liberty mutual.the administration and funding of the ltd plan differed from that of the std plan because liberty mutual both administered and had final authority under the ltd plan and paid benefits awarded under the plan.to qualify for ltd benefits,an employee needs to show that he is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his own occupation for an elimination period of days,and thereafter can not perform these duties for the next months.during the elimination period,an employee does not receive benefits under the ltd plan,but he can receive ltd benefits during the month own occupation period that follows.however,during the elimination period the employee may be eligible for std benefits,and thus the two plans complement each other as ltd benefits can start when std benefits stop after the expiration of the month own occupation period,an employee will be eligible for ltd benefits only if he demonstrates that he is unable to perform,with reasonable continuity,the material and substantial duties of any occupation.
on or about october,stevens began a leave of absence from sovereign bank due to worsening symptoms related to his medical condition.consequently,stevens filed a claim with liberty mutual for std payments as he asserted that he was subject to qualifying physical restrictions and cognitive impairments.liberty mutual reviewed records of stevens treating rheumatologist and approved his request for std benefits through december,in december,liberty mutual reviewed updated medical information and approved payment of std benefits through february.
liberty mutual again reviewed stevens updated records in february,this time determining that his medical reports did not substantiate stevens subjective complaints of pain.accordingly,it forwarded the case for review to an independent physician,sara kramer,a board certified physician in internal medicine and rheumatology.after kramer reviewed stevens records and spoke with stevens treating rheumatologist,she concluded that stevens could return to work provided that he was allowed certain accommodations,including being permitted to stretch and change positions as needed throughout the course of an day liberty mutual subsequently informed stevens that his condition no longer met the definition of disability and therefore it would not award him additional std benefits.the termination of stevens eligibility for std benefits effectively rendered stevens ineligible for ltd benefits as he could not demonstrate that he was unable to perform his own occupation duties throughout the day elimination period.
after liberty mutual notified stevens that he was not eligible for further std benefits,stevens filed a series of administrative appeals with liberty mutual that he supported with medical records and additional documentation.in response to each of stevens requests for review of additional information,liberty mutual enlisted medical professionals to evaluate the information in his record and the new information that he provided.on november,liberty mutual made a final determination that stevens was no longer eligible for std benefits,and it provided its final recommendation and analysis to that end to santander,which,in turn,approved the decision a short time thereafter.liberty mutual then notified stevens of the final decision to deny him further std benefits.
district court proceedings 
on december,a little over a month after liberty mutual notified him of the final decision that he no longer qualified for std benefits,stevens filed this action in the district court pursuant to erisa,seeking both retroactive reinstatement of his std benefits starting on february,and continuing through april,and ltd benefits starting on april,the end of the elimination period.the parties filed for summary judgment,and on january,the district court granted stevens motion and denied santander motion in an oral decision.the court pointed to a number of procedural anomalies that can lead to a finding of an arbitrary and capricious termination of stevens std benefits and explained that it was most important that despite retaining final approval authority over the std plan santander failed to conduct any meaningful independent review of stevens file,a procedure that the court viewed as rubber stamping liberty benefit determinations.the court determined that the decision to terminate stevens std benefits and thus,in effect,to deny him ltd benefits was not a product of reasoned decision making and determined that the appropriate remedy was to reinstate std benefits because they had been terminated after being awarded and remand stevens claim to the plan administrator for full consideration of his eligibility for ltd benefits.id.the court entered a separate judgment on january,evidencing its determination and directing the clerk of court to close this case.id.
santander and liberty mutual timely appealed to this court,but stevens moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.in contending that we do not have jurisdiction,stevens argues that the district court january,decision and judgment were not final because they did not resolve the amount of own occupation benefits to which he was entitled under the std plan or his eligibility for benefits under the ltd plan santander and liberty mutual contend that the district court decision was final because the calculation of the amount of std benefits owed to stevens was a ministerial task not subject to genuine dispute,and an analysis of stevens eligibility for ltd benefits could be made separately from the other issues in this case.they also cite as indicia of finality the district court direction to its clerk to close the case and its entry of a separate judgment evidencing its determination.
iii.discussion 
as we have explained,prior to reaching the merits of an appeal,we determine if we have jurisdiction.see poole family court of new castle,cir.courts of appeals most commonly have jurisdiction over appeals taken from final decisions of the district courts of the united states.consequently,our first inquiry is to decide whether the district court order remanding stevens claim to the plan administrator was a final appealable order under.we analyze our jurisdiction under primarily by applying the test we recognized in papotto hartford life accident insurance,cir.for the reasons that we will explain,our consideration of the papotto test and the other cases that we discuss leads us to conclude that we do not have jurisdiction over the district court order under,and inasmuch as we do not have jurisdiction on any other basis,we will dismiss the appeal.
case law applicable to our jurisdictional analysis 
papotto three prong test 
in papotto,an erisa case involving a claim for accidental death benefits under an accidental death and dismemberment ad d policy,the plan administrator denied benefits because the plaintiff decedent was intoxicated at the time of his accidental death.at.after both parties filed summary judgment motions,the district court found that a provision in the ad d policy precluding recovery for accidental death or injury if the decedent was intoxicated at the time of his death or injury was applicable only if there was a causal connection between the intoxication and the death or injury.id.at.as a result,the court denied both parties summary judgment motions and remanded the case to the plan administrator for consideration of whether the decedent intoxication caused or contributed to his death.id.the insurer appealed,and the plaintiff.id.at.
we raised the issue of jurisdiction sua sponte and considered whether the district court order remanding the case was final under.at.we noted that the remand order directed the plan administrator to take two actions to consider additional evidence,and to read a causation requirement into the intoxication exclusion provision and determine whether the decedent intoxication caused or contributed to his death.id.at.we considered the case to be analogous to cases dealing with appeals from orders remanding cases to administrative agencies.this conclusion led us to distill a test for determining the finality of the order in that case.id.at.under that test,we may exercise jurisdiction over remand orders in erisa benefit cases when the remand finally resolves an issue,the legal issue is important,and denial of immediate review will foreclose appellate review in the future.id.at in fashioning this test,we noted that we consistently have accorded significant weight to the third factor,potential for evasion of future review.id.applying that test in papotto,we easily determine d that we lacked appellate jurisdiction over the first portion of the order remanding for consideration of additional evidence.id.at.not only had we held previously that orders directing remands to administrative agencies to consider additional evidence are nonfinal,but we also reasoned that the order failed the first prong of the test that we had distilled because it did not finally resolve anything.id.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.
the second portion of the order for remand in papotto directing the plan administrator to read a causation requirement into the intoxication exclusion provision when evaluating papotto case required a separate analysis.beginning with the first prong of our test whether the order finally resolve d the underlying issue of the case we followed the lead of other courts of appeals by asking does the remand order make an ultimate determination as to eligibility,thus leaving the plan administrator with nothing left to do but issue an order id.at.we held the order did not finally resolve the issue of the plaintiff eligibility and therefore required further action by the plan administrator.id.at.
after noting that the second papotto prong importance was met,id.at,we addressed the third prong,stating that no provision in the erisa statute permit s an insurance company to challenge the decision of its own plan administrator in district court.id.at.we nevertheless held that the insurer was not left without recourse because the district court retained jurisdiction over the case,inasmuch as administrative closings do not end the proceeding.rather,they are a practical tool used by courts to prune overgrown dockets and are particularly useful in circumstances in which a case,though not dead,is likely to remain moribund for an appreciable period of time.id.at first alteration in original quoting freeman pittsburgh glass works,llc,cir.we also pointed out that a court may reopen an administratively closed case either on its own or at the request of a party at any time.id we concluded that the district court order in papotto administratively closed the case but did not dismiss it.overall,we were satisfied that the third papotto test prong for allowing immediate appeal was not met.
we further held that the order was not appealable under the collateral order doctrine because it did not conclusively determine the disputed question,was not effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment,and was not separate from the merits of the action as it directly implicate d the heart of the case whether papotto death was an eligible event for distribution of benefits.id.we therefore dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.id.at.
mead and finality considerations 
a recent erisa case from the court of appeals for the second circuit,mead reliastar life insurance,cir,is useful in our consideration of the finality of the remand order now on appeal.mead concerned an employee disability benefits claim in circumstances factually similar to those that we address now.there,the employer,reliastar,provided a group insurance policy to its employees that included two kinds of benefits comparable to the std and ltd benefits that santander provided benefits for up to months and benefits thereafter.id.at.mead filed suit under erisa after reliastar denied her claim for disability benefits under its group policy.id.at.
the district court entertained mead suit twice and both times remanded it for reconsideration,first because reliastar reason for denial of benefits did not identify the evidence that reliastar credited and the evidence that it rejected in arriving at its decision,and second because the court believed that reliastar ignored several physical requirements of mead former position,refused to recognize the ample objective evidence supporting her subjective complaints of pain,and provided what the district court believed were obviously false or misleading reasons for discrediting the conclusions of its own neurologist.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.after issuing its second remand order instructing reliastar to calculate and award the benefits and to determine whether mead was entitled to benefits,the district court directed its clerk to close the case,though it indicated that it would entertain a separate motion from mead for prejudgment interest,attorneys fees,and costs.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.reliastar appealed from this second remand order to the court of appeals for the second circuit.
the court of appeals in its analysis of its jurisdiction observed that remands to erisa plan administrators generally are not final because,in the ordinary case,they contemplate further proceedings by the plan administrator.id.
