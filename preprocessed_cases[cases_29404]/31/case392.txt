opinion of the court 
in this appeal we determine that a ruling on a statute of limitations issue in a declaratory judgment action had preclusive effect despite the fact that other requests for a declaration were denied because of unresolved factual matters.as a consequence,the district court erred in applying a different limitations period in a related erisa case and barring the claims of some of the employee plaintiffs.we also conclude that the district court properly found that an erisa plan was in existence and provided benefits for employees at the time of a plant shutdown.accordingly,we will reverse in part,and affirm in part.
plaintiffs are former salaried employees of crucible,who worked at one of the company steel manufacturing facilities in pennsylvania that closed in.most of the plaintiffs were at the midland plant,and most were terminated that year,with a few remaining in their positions until as late as.in,crucible changed its name to colt industries operating corporation,which today is a dormant corporation.we described in detail the background facts leading up to this litigation in henglein informal plan for shutdown benefits for salaried employees,cir henglein i,and need not repeat them here.
the employees first filed suit against the employer in august,presenting a number of claims.those for shutdown benefits were dismissed on appeal because the complaint failed to name the proper defendant.schake colt indus.operating,cir.may,
in september,the employees filed the present action henglein under erisa section a b,a b,against two plans alleged to be administered by colt,an informal plan and a parity plan.the complaint alleged that plaintiffs were entitled to shutdown benefits pursuant to an informal plan that was created by crucible plan,and amended by and documents.in addition,some of the employees sought a monthly supplement under the parity plan.
as described in the complaint,the informal plan provided plant closing benefits for older,employees who had not yet qualified for pension benefits under the company formal plan.these supplemental benefits were to be paid monthly until the recipient reached the age when social security benefits became available.the claim for parity plan benefits was based on management alleged promise to equalize plant shutdown benefits between union and employees.
rather than answering the employees complaint,colt in its capacity as administrator of the putative plans,filed a declaratory judgment action seeking rulings that the informal plan and parity plan did not exist,and the employees rights to a pension were governed solely by the formal plan in effect in.the district court stayed the employees action and proceeded with the declaratory judgment.
in november,the district court ruled that there was no parity plan,and that the statute of limitations for the employee claims was six years.colt frenn.colt counts seeking declarations of the of other benefit plans were dismissed because unresolved material issues of fact precluded summary judgment.id.neither party appealed.
the employees suit henglein then resumed.after taking testimony,the district court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the employees had failed to prove that an informal plan existed under erisa.on appeal we reversed and remanded for to determine whether the alleged informal plan straddled the enactment of erisa.we also held that the employees were collaterally estopped from raising the parity plan matter because of the ruling in the frenn declaratory judgment.henglein i,at.
extensive district court proceedings that followed resulted in two more appeals to this court.henglein ii,cir,henglein iii,cir.in both instances,we remanded for additional consideration by the trial court.during the pendency of the third appeal,the district judge who had presided over the litigation retired on remand another judge was assigned the case.following a bench trial,the second judge filed extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law,and entered the judgment now on appeal.we will summarize the district court findings.
evidence of the employer representations and conduct extended from before the effective date of erisa up until the time the claims arose in.in crucible adopted an early severance and disability program.this document and a memorandum were distributed to the employees.the plan was amended in by the hardship retirement guidelines,which,however,was not generally distributed to the employees.in,a board of directors resolution purported to rescind the early severance and disability programs.no notice of this action was given to the employees.
in,crucible amended and rewrote its retirement plan entitled crucible.retirement plan for eligible salaried employees.it was printed in booklet form and circulated to all salaried employees.various amendments were made by the salaried retirement plan,which the employees received in.those booklets failed to contain any statement that the employees benefits were limited to those described therein.
crucible never issued to its employees in general any written notice that the and early severance and disability benefit programs had been rescinded.in a memorandum,march,group vice president of crucible,wrote to division presidents,controllers,personnel directors,and the retirement board informing them that there is no informal pension plan to which new names can be added.when advising the vice president of employee relations for the midland plant of this news,march directed,i do want anyone to talk about it.
three crucible vice presidents who served as members of the executive committee were never informed about the cancellation of plant shutdown compensation for salaried employees.john vensel,president of crucible alloy division at midland,pennsylvania,testified to his belief that shutdown benefits for salaried employees were in existence in.vensel also told the employees he supervised that the benefits were available.
at various meetings during through,senior members of crucible management told salaried employees that their benefits would always equal or exceed in value those extended to union members.the employees believed this meant they would receive additional compensation in the event of plant shutdown.
in conformance with its factual findings,and following this court legal analysis in the three appeals,the district court concluded that the informal plan for shutdown benefits for salaried employees was a defined benefit employee plan at the time of the shutdown in,and was governed by the early severance and disability benefit plan as amended by the hardship benefits program.the court also observed that the employees met the requisite age and service criteria.
however,in considering an issue not raised in any of the appeals,the court concluded that the applicable statute of limitations was three years.as a consequence the claims of all but six of the plaintiffs were.
in accordance with the parties stipulation,the claims of the six individuals were referred to the plan administrator for calculation of the benefits due.the court approved the awards to five of the employees,but disagreed with that of the sixth employee,fahnert,who was granted monthly payments to age.reviewing the administrator calculations,the district court focused on the plan use of the term life income and modified fahnert award,directing that the payments continue for his lifetime.
in reviewing the claims to the parity plan benefits,the district court reaffirmed the prior dismissal in accordance with the directive in henglein 
both parties have raised substantial issues on this appeal.the employees challenge the ruling on the three year statute of limitations,contending that the six year period set out in colt frenn controls.they also renew their claims for parity payments and assert that the plan administrator used an inappropriate basis for determining the amounts due the successful plaintiffs.
the plans defend the three year statute of limitations ruling,but in their contend that the district court erred in allowing fahnert a double recovery.the plans also challenge the calculation of the benefits payable.
this case comes to us after a trial.we review the findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard,fed.of civ.proc.a,and the conclusions of law de novo.gregoire centennial school,cir.the statute of limitations is the predominant issue in this case,and we will therefore address it first 
the parties agree that erisa contains no statute of limitations applicable to the controversy at hand,and conducted the litigation on the premise that the court should look to the most analogous state provision,in this case that of pennsylvania according to the plans,the wage payment and collection law.stat.ann.tit,fills the gap.that statute defines wages to include fringe benefits due under erisa plans,and establishes a three year statute of limitations.stat.ann.tit,a,a.the plans cite syed hercules,cir,gluck unisys,cir,and vernau vic market,cir,as supporting a three year limitations period for this case.the plans argue that despite its ruling in frenn,the district court was obliged to apply the shorter statute of limitations in the henglein suit.
as noted earlier,the declaratory judgment action was brought by colt as plan administrator,against frenn and one other employee,both named as plaintiffs in the henglein action.the complaint sought a declaration that the informal plan and the parity plan did not exist,and,therefore,the henglein case should be dismissed.in response,the employees sought summary judgment on the basis that the informal plan and parity plan were in effect in.both parties to the declaratory judgment suit were represented by the same attorneys who appeared in the henglein case.there can be no question about privity or identity of issues in the two cases.
as we mentioned previously,the first judge made several rulings in the declaratory judgment action.finding that a parity plan did not exist,he entered judgment against the employees on that claim.whether the informal plan was properly terminated in,and whether it existed after erisa was enacted,however,depended upon disputed issues of fact.therefore,the court denied the for summary judgment and dismissed the requests for declarations on those points.
the district judge then turned to the question of the employees timeliness in filing the henglein case finally,colt contends that the henglein action is.after some discussion the judge concluded that the accrual of the statute of limitations did not begin until.next,he determined that the pennsylvania six year statute of limitations for actions on contracts was applicable.here,the employees initially brought the henglein suit in.therefore,the employees properly brought this suit within the applicable limitations period.
although the plans did not take an appeal from the frenn declaratory judgment,they contend that the ruling on the statute of limitations issue should not be given preclusive effect.they correctly identify the standard requirements for collateral estoppel,more generally,termed issue preclusion the identical issue was previously adjudicated the issue was actually litigated the previous determination was necessary to the decision and the party being precluded from relitigating the issue was fully represented in the prior action.raytech white,cir see also restatement second of judgments cmt.j henglein i,at temple university white,cir arab african intern.bank epstein,cir gregory chehi,cir.
preliminarily,we observe that much of the plans argument rests upon a concept of finality that is unduly rigid.in dyndul dyndul,cir per curiam,we commented that f inality for purposes of issue preclusion is a more pliant concept than it would be in other contexts.id.at footnote omitted.we quoted approvingly from judge friendly opinion in lummus commonwealth oil refining,cir finality in the context here relevant may mean little more than that the litigation of a particular issue has reached such a stage that a court sees no really good reason for permitting it to be litigated again.id.at.
in in re brown,cir,we made the point clearly u nlike claim preclusion,the effectiveness of issue preclusion,sometimes called collateral estoppel,does not require the entry of a judgment,final in the sense of being appealable.we also cited section of the second restatement of judgments,which states that for purposes of issue preclusion,final judgment includes any prior adjudication of an issue in another action that is determined to be sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect.see also hawksbill sea turtle federal emergency mgmt.agency,cir restatement second of judgments cmt.
we need not,however,rely on those applications of the finality factor because here the basis is an even more compelling one,the actual entry of a final judgment.
appealability 
in henglein i,we observed that the employees did not appeal frenn unfavorable ruling on the parity plan.at.because they did not do so,we held that the district court ruling that a parity plan did not exist was a final judgment on the merits,and collateral estoppel barred further litigation on that issue.id.
despite the clear language in henglein i,the plans argue that they could not have appealed the frenn judgment because the district court dismissal of the informal plan count based on unresolved factual issues was an interlocutory order.the plans say also that they could not have appealed because the ruling on the parity plan was in their favor.
the plans arguments fail to appreciate the unique nature of a declaratory judgment action.in a case of actual controversy,the declaratory judgment act provides that a court may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.
once a judgment disposing of all issues on which the parties sought a declaration is entered by a court,the case is ripe for appeal.even if the court decides in its discretion that it will not entertain the case in any aspect whatsoever,that ruling is subject to appeal.wilton seven falls,d in the declaratory judgment context,the normal principle that federal courts should adjudicate claims within their jurisdiction yields to considerations of practicality and wise judicial administration.see also exxon,cir.
because it has discretion to decline jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action in its entirety,it follows that a court may decide some of the issues raised and refuse to rule on others.the maxim that the greater includes the lesser applies if the court may choose to rule on all or none of the issues presented,it may decide only those it finds appropriate for a declaration.
once a district court has ruled on all of the issues submitted to it,either deciding them or declining to do so,the declaratory judgment is complete,final,and appealable.nothing remains for the trial court to do and the case is at an end in that forum.see catlin united states.
we would not be understood to say,however,that every ruling in a declaratory judgment is immediately appealable.in peterson lindner,cir,the trial judge entered an order on one phase of a declaratory judgment action,but specifically left open significant issues relating to damages and other relief.moreover,he did not enter a formal judgment.id.at.in those circumstances,the court of appeals held that the order was interlocutory and.id.at.similarly,in liberty mutual insurance wetzel,d,the supreme court noted that an order establishing liability,even if considered as a declaratory judgment,was not final where the trial court had not ruled on the injunction and damages that had been requested.that,however,is not the situation here where the court issued a judgment and a ruling on every issue submitted.
the normal civil action differs from the declaratory judgment in that courts deciding the latter are not required to adjudicate the ultimate dispute between the parties.consequently,the disfavor generally shown to appeals from orders in the usual civil action,see,fed.of civ.proc.b,is not present once a declaratory judgment has been entered.in this sense,some loose ends in the underlying controversy that would negate finality for appellate purposes in most civil actions,do not have that effect in the declaratory judgment setting.see also restatement second of judgments cmts.b,e noting that if declaratory judgment is valid and final,it is conclusive with respect to matters declared.
in frenn,the district court could have chosen to decide all of the issues,including resolution of the contested factual issues on the existence of the informal plan.it is understandable that the court did not do so,more than likely believing that the disputed factual matters were at the heart of the henglein case and would be better resolved in that litigation.
the plans arguments dance nimbly around the fact that the determination of the statute of limitations was adverse to them,and was independent of the ruling on the unresolved factual disputes.if,in the main henglein case,the plans had moved for summary judgment alleging of the informal plan,an order denying the motion because of the presence of factual disagreement would have been interlocutory and order.but since the plans chose to use the declaratory judgment vehicle,they are bound by its differing characteristics as to finality 
generally,to have preclusive effect,the challenged ruling must be necessary to the prior judgment.multiple issues are frequently presented in declaratory judgment actions,however,and on appeal all of those decided lie within the scope of review.the plans,nonetheless,contend that the statute of limitations decision was entirely irrelevant and unnecessary to the ruling on the informal plan because some plaintiffs had filed timely claims even under the three year statute.
the fact that the employees would have been barred by a shorter period demonstrates that the limitations question was a substantial one for both parties.in addition,the issue was separable from the others presented,and potentially dispositive.therefore,the decision to resolve the question in the declaratory judgment was appropriate.it does not matter if the limitations period was irrelevant in part to some other phases of the case.
the necessity principle has diminished importance in the declaratory judgment setting.charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper make the reasoning for this clear 
multiple findings also may figure in declaratory judgment actions.since the very purpose of declaratory relief is to achieve a final and reliable determination of legal issues,there should be no quibbling about the necessity principle.every issue that the parties have litigated and that the court has undertaken to resolve is necessary to the judgment,and should be precluded.
charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure.
in this case,each individual ruling on the multiple issues presented was subject to appeal and preclusive effect.because the plans were free to appeal the ruling on the six year statute of limitations,and having failed to do so,they are bound by it,and precluded from attempting to secure a more favorable ruling at this late date.
actually litigated 
the plans final the issue was not actually belied by the district court specific statement in its memorandum opinion,f inally colt contends that the henglein action is the opinion then discussed both the question of when the cause of action accrued and the choice of the most analogous state limitation period.we have no doubt that the statute of limitations was contested and was done so at the instance of colt as administrator of the plans.
unmixed question of law 
as a final matter,we address briefly an exception to normal application of issue preclusion called the unmixed question of law reservation,articulated in united states moser.there,the court wrote that res judicata does not apply to unmixed questions of law.see restatement second of judgments.
this exception has been discussed by courts,but none has yet delineated its boundaries very well.united states stauffer chem,d.significantly,the supreme court has had no trouble finding the exception inapplicable where there is close alignment in both time and subject matter between the two cases.id.
because the declaratory judgment addressed the same facts and claims between the same parties,there was precise alignment between the decision in frenn and the pending henglein case.to recognize an exception in these circumstances would eviscerate the doctrine of issue preclusion.
we conclude,therefore,that the holding in frenn precluded the henglein parties from relitigating the six year statute of limitations.consequently,the second judge erred in subsequently holding that the employees claims in henglein were by the three year statute of limitations.
because the district court concluded that a three year period applied,it had no occasion to address the question of whether a group of employees who joined the suit after were barred by the six year statute of limitations the arguments as to these employees are the same,however,as were considered by the court with respect to application of the three year limitation that the statute of limitations was tolled,and that the application of the continuing violation theory would permit recovery.see meagher international ass of machinists and aerospace workers pension plan,cir.
in its general discussion of the statute of limitations issue,the district court concluded that there had been no tolling because at the time the employees were terminated,they were advised that they would not receive shutdown benefits.according to the court,the statute of limitations began to run at the time of that notice.see adamson armco,cir.
the employees also contended that the plans were guilty of a continuing violation that extended the limitations period,but the court concluded that that theory was not applicable.
the employees asserted that the plans had an obligation to provide benefits through a series of monthly payments.in effect,such obligations are similar to installment agreements,or as some courts have termed them,continuing contracts.an agreement to provide support for life may be termed a continuing contract,and so may be an insurance policy to pay a monthly sum of money during a period of disability 
the recurring question with such agreements is whether failure to pay each installment establishes a separate cause of action on each occasion a payment is withheld,or whether only one cause of action accrues for breach of the contract.corbin on contracts devotes substantial discussion to the subject and suggests simply that much depends on the circumstances.the treatise pithily comments,a ccrual of the cause of action has not one eternal and exclusively correct meaning,ordained by god or by the legislature.there is no infallible logic that compels one application rather than another.arthur corbin,on contracts,at.
in vernau,this court considered whether the statute of limitations barred a claim for past due employer contributions to a pension fund.we concluded there was no tolling because plaintiffs had not been reasonably diligent.at.the question of accrual in vernau was raised only in connection with the tolling argument,but we noted that even if each delinquency gave rise to a separate claim,the plaintiffs were on inquiry notice that the terms of the plan had been breached.id.at.
two years after vernau,we had occasion to again consider the proper statute of limitations in a section a b erisa claim.in gluck,we noted that differing factual situations require consideration of varying periods,and that the controlling limitations period in vernau should not be rotely applied.gluck,at.as an example,we commented on the incongruity of classifying future benefits as wages under the pennsylvania wage payment and collection law,because it provides no period of repose to an employer.id.at.a current claim for an erisa violation affecting the retirement benefit of a hypothetical twenty employee thus might accrue at age.id.the opinion stated,we are unwilling to open the door to a limitations period.id.
although neither of these cases squarely addressed the continuing violation theory,both pointed to problems inherent in such an approach.in the circumstance
