in this appeal,we are called upon to assess a district court issuance of injunctive relief to a putative class of plaintiffs alleging that they are in imminent danger of suffering irreparable harm.plaintiffs are all retirees,or surviving spouses of retirees,of bendix corporation.they average years of age,and,due to the actions of one of the,recently suffered a drastic reduction in their level and quality of health care benefits.plaintiffs contend that honeywell international,a successor of obligated to remedy this reduction under the terms of an agreement that bendix entered into in.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court correctly ruled that honeywell is liable under the agreement,and properly issued an injunction ordering honeywell to comply with that agreement.we remand,however,for the district court to clarify and modify its injunctive relief in two material respects.

ii.discussion 
at the outset,we are presented with a jurisdictional question.this court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the district court september issuance of the preliminary injunction under a.although the august judgment is not a final order,where an issue is inextricably intertwined with a question that is the proper subject of an immediate appeal,or where review of a jurisdictionally insufficient issue is necessary to ensure meaningful review of a jurisdictionally sufficient one,an appellate court may exercise pendent jurisdiction.rein socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,cir quoting swint chambers county comm n,d.thus,since the issuance of the preliminary injunction was premised in part on the grant of summary judgment,we assert pendent jurisdiction over the latter.and for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment and issuance of the preliminary injunction,but remand for clarification and modification of that injunction.
a.the district court grant of summary judgment 
defendants challenge the district court grant of summary judgment on several grounds.first,defendants note that under the terms of the guaranty,honeywell obligation to provide for the maintenance of benefit levels may be reduced in an amount equal to the reduction,if any,in the insurance coverage below that provided for in the insurance agreement as of april,pursuant to any agreement between facet and the union.defendants argue that the uaw tacitly agreed to motor components reduction of benefit levels insofar as it did not vigorously contest that therefore that honeywell is not liable to provide for benefit levels above those resulting from this agreement.
the record is to the contrary.in april,motor components informed uaw representative scott montani that it could no longer afford to pay benefits at rates.montani responded by explaining that the uaw would fight any reduction in benefits.in july,motor components announced that it would be reducing benefits.in an,montani explained,inter alia,that t he uaw does not cease to represent our retirees that is our heritage.in an august letter to the retirees,montani assured them that t he union is on the verge of taking action,if appropriate,on your behalf.while this conduct is squarely in accordance with the uaw history of resisting benefit reductions,defendants claim that subsequent conduct was to the contrary.
during motor components negotiations with the uaw over their collective bargaining agreement,motor components reiterated its position that it could no longer afford levels of benefits,and proposed discontinuing them.the uaw then filed suit against honeywell,seeking to hold it to the guaranty.motor components and the uaw continued to negotiate regarding employees,but ceased negotiations over retiree benefits.defendants argue that this course of conduct raises a genuine issue as to whether the uaw acquiesced in the benefit reduction sufficient to permit the conclusion that it had an agreement with motor components that the latter could reduce retiree benefits.
the district court found this argument to be without merit because the guaranty does not purport to place an affirmative obligation on the uaw to vigorously challenge benefit reductions.laforest i,wl,at.the court further noted that the uaw had little motivation to do so when the full payment of those benefits had been ensured by the guaranty,and where the uaw knew that the proposed change could not be properly effected absent its consent.id.defendants attempt to turn this reasoning on its head,suggesting that because the uaw believed it could maintain benefit levels by pursuing honeywell,it had every reason simply to acquiesce in reductions and then file suit on the guaranty.this argument makes little sense.
the uaw knew that any agreement between it and motor components would preclude recovery against honeywell.the very act of filing suit against honeywell,then,indicates that the uaw believed it had a viable action,that it had not made an agreement with motor components to reduce benefits.in more basic terms,even if defendants could persuade this court that motor components made an offer to the uaw regarding the reduction of benefits,the uaw in its initial reactions to motor components and in its filing suit against clearly inconsistent with the suggestion that it accepted that offer.thus,we agree with the district court that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the uaw agreed to motor components september benefit reduction.it did not.
defendants also challenge the district court grant of summary judgment on the grounds that a guaranty is a secondary obligation which requires a showing that the primary obligor defaulted before liability will attach,and no such showing was made here the guaranty fails on the ground that it is illegal,specifically,that it contravenes the ftc directive that bendix not guaranty any obligations of facet the guaranty fails for lack of consideration and the guaranty is unenforceable because plaintiffs can not demonstrate with reasonable certainty the amount for which honeywell is putatively liable under its terms.
the agreement into which bendix entered in reads in relevant part 
bendix will pay,or cause to be paid,on behalf of each protected person,an insurance premium to provide insurance coverage equal to the excess,if any,of 
i insurance coverage such protected person is eligible to receive,or would have become eligible to receive,pursuant to the provisions of the insurance agreement in effect on april,over 
ii any insurance coverage provided by the payment of premiums by facet on behalf of such protected person.
defendants first and second arguments fail for the simple reason that the guaranty is not a guaranty.it does not create a secondary obligation to provide benefits if and only if facet successors breach a contractual obligation to do so.weissman sinorm deli.rather,honeywell is under a clear contractual obligation to provide for the maintenance of benefit levels if and only if a successor of facet at some point permits those benefits to fall below the guaranteed level.once that triggering event occurs,regardless of the cause of that event,honeywell becomes liable.
the district court recognized that the guaranty neither creates nor alludes to any promise by facet to provide bendix retirees with any particular level of insurance coverage.laforest i,wl,at.further,the court explained that e ven if such a promise had been made by a separate agreement between facet and bendix,or between facet and the uaw or retirees,honeywell fails to demonstrate how that agreement could take precedence over the guaranty and create a hierarchy of obligors,something which the guaranty does not contemplate.id.as evidence of the fact that the guaranty does not create a hierarchy of obligors,the district court quoted a may letter sent to employees potentially covered by the guaranty,which stated that certain pension benefits and payment of certain insurance premiums are guaranteed by bendix for life in the case of insurance,bendix will make up any difference in insurance premiums necessary to provide coverage.id.at.indeed,as the district court reasoned 
bendix did not condition its promise upon the failure of its retirees to obtain relief from facet or any of its successors it simply promised to make up any difference in insurance premiums necessary to provide coverage to those employees willing to remain in the employ of an enterprise that was embarking on a risky new venture.as those employees weathered the company transition from bendix to facet,that letter described,and in fact embodied,a covenant between them and bendix,assuring them that their benefits would always be covered by the protective umbrella of the parent corporation.it was bendix promise to facet.facet was not a party to that compact then,and therefore,facet successor can not be said to have undertaken obligations as a primary obligor under the guaranty now.
id.thus,the district court took the view that the guaranty constituted a contract between bendix and its successors and those covered by the guaranty.the plain language of the guaranty and the explanatory letter sent to prospective retirees support such a view.
thus,we agree that honeywell obligation under the agreement arises not by operation of a guaranty,but rather out of an ordinary contractual promise.the guaranty may have been loosely titled as such,but it would appear that the parties to it intended the more common understanding,guarantee,they intended that bendix guarantee that benefit levels would remain that it guaranty the obligation of facet.therefore,we reject the argument that honeywell liability can be established only on a showing of a default by motor components.similarly,although it is true that the ftc consent order prohibited bendix from guarantying the obligations of facet,this agreement does not violate that prohibition 
defendants third argument is belied by the record.plaintiffs assert,and the district court found,that bendix entered into the guaranty in order to forestall the early retirement of employees wary of joining the newly formed facet.see laforest i,wl,at.defendants note that no retiree has testified that,but for the guaranty,he or she would have retired early.but such evidence is not necessary to demonstrate consideration.rather,the record reveals that a uaw bargainer expressed the concern to bendix during bargaining that the uaw commented on the concern to the ftc that a summary of the tentative divestiture agreement between the uaw and bendix suggests that the guaranty was entered into in exchange for,among other things,the uaw agreeing to the of facet and that a bendix official involved in the negotiation of the guaranty considered it to have been entered into in exchange for the uaw executing a enabling agreement.thus,the record supports the conclusion that the guaranty was supported by consideration.
finally,defendants suggest that the guaranty is unenforceable because plaintiffs can not prove with reasonable certainty the amount for which honeywell is liable.while we disagree that the amount due is unascertainable,we do find,as discussed infra,that the district court has a bit of work to do in this regard.nevertheless,we hold that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to plaintiffs on the issue of honeywell liability under the guaranty.
b.the district court issuance of the preliminary injunction 
the district court correctly stated that i n this circuit,to obtain a preliminary injunction the requesting party must demonstrate irreparable harm and either a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of the case to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting preliminary relief.laforest ii,wl,at citing jackson dairy,hood sons,cir.given that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the issue of honeywell liability under the guaranty,it also did not err in concluding that plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.
primarily at issue,then,is whether plaintiffs adequately demonstrated irreparable harm.additionally,defendants raise concerns regarding whether plaintiffs engaged in undue delay in seeking the injunction,whether the injunction was overbroad as to whom and what it covers,whether it was sufficiently specific,and whether the district court erred in waiving the requirement of a bond.this court reviews the granting of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.new york magazine metro.transport,cir.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction,but we remand for clarification and modification of that injunction as to the issues of who and what are covered by the guaranty.
whether plaintiffs suffered irreparable harm 
the district court held that plaintiffs had demonstrated irreparable harm by showing that,absent an injunction ordering honeywell to provide premiums sufficient to secure guaranteed levels of benefits,the reductions in medical coverage will cause substantial risk to plaintiffs health severe financial hardship the inability to purchase life necessities and anxiety associated with uncertainty.laforest ii,wl,at.indeed,if substantiated by the evidence,the district court holding comports with this court understanding of irreparable harm as harm shown to be in terms of money damages.wisdom import sales,labatt brewing,cir.
in concluding that plaintiffs demonstrated irreparable harm,the court relied on this court holdings in whelan colgan,cir,and communications workers of america,dist.one,nynex,cir,that the termination of medical benefits will ground a claim of irreparable harm.the court also relied on united steelworkers of america textron,cir,an opinion written by justice breyer while still on the first circuit.
in whelan,this court affirmed the granting of a preliminary injunction ordering the defendant to continue providing medical benefits to striking workers.in doing so,it stated that the threatened termination of benefits such as medical coverage for workers and their families obviously raised the spectre of irreparable injury.whelan,at.and in nynex,the defendant informed its employees that it intended to terminate medical benefits,but also informed them that they were eligible for replacement benefits under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of,cobra.nevertheless,because the defendant then frustrated the employees efforts to receive cobra benefits,the court treated the defendant conduct as,effectively,a threatened termination of benefits.citing whelan,the court affirmed the district court grant of a preliminary injunction ordering the defendant to facilitate cobra benefits.nynex,at.
in textron,the defendant ceased paying medical insurance premiums for retired former employees,in circumstances somewhat analogous to the present case.in affirming the district court grant of a preliminary injunction ordering the defendant to resume payment of premiums,the court considered 
general facts that either are commonly believed or which courts have specifically held sufficient to show irreparable harm such general facts as most retired union members are not rich,most live on fixed incomes,many will get sick and need medical care,medical care is expensive,medical insurance is,therefore,a necessity,and some retired workers may find it difficult to obtain medical insurance on their own while others can pay for it only out of money that they need for other necessities of life.
textron,at citing,inter alia,whelan.the court then explained that it was accepting as proof of the actual existence of these general facts a single affidavit of a union official stating that three of the retirees had actually suffered a reduction in medical care as a result of the termination of benefits.id.
after considering these authorities,the district court turned to plaintiffs evidence.it noted that plaintiffs provided affidavits of six people entitled to benefits under the bendix guaranty.each undoubtedly demonstrates that they will suffer much more than monetary harm.laforest ii,wl,at.on this basis,the district court held that plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrated that honeywell refusal to pay the shortfall in premiums needed to restore benefits to the guaranteed level caused irreparable harm to the putative class.
defendants contest the district court conclusion by noting,first,that in the cases on which the district court relied,plaintiffs suffered the threat of termination,or the actual termination,of their medical here plaintiffs suffered a reduction in benefits or increased costs of maintaining benefit levels.defendants argue that approximately ninety percent of the putative class is eligible for medicare,and thus is able to secure alternative coverage,and that every member of the class was given the opportunity to participate in an alternative prescription drug program.however,it is not clear that this difference is dispositive.so long as plaintiffs demonstrated injury in terms of money damages,wisdom import sales,at,they have demonstrated irreparable injury.
the district court found that plaintiffs demonstrated more than mere monetary harm,and the record supports this finding.most significantly,rather than the prescription drug program with no deductibles,no maximum,and a for drugs that plaintiffs previously enjoyed,the alternative plan provided by motor components imposes a per year deductible,a annual maximum,and for generic,preferred,and prescriptions.plaintiffs provided individualized evidence of the impact of these changes on the retirees,including an imminent threat that they would have to forego needed prescriptions.in addition,plaintiffs note that the approximately ten percent of the class that is ineligible for medicare received a replacement stipend of only per month from motor components,and presented evidence that this amount was seriously inadequate for their needs.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in relying on this evidence in concluding that the class suffered irreparable harm warranting a preliminary injunction 
our conclusion is not affected by defendants attack on the evidence on which the district court relied.defendants note that the district court granted relief on the basis of affidavits submitted by persons who were not named plaintiffs,and,moreover,that the court relied on only six affidavits in a case involving nearly six hundred putative class members.the procedural posture of this case is relevant in this regard.the district court first properly granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on the issue of liability,and then issued a preliminary injunction ordering relief for the putative class.but before reaching this court,the putative class became a certified class.that the six affidavits relied upon by the district court were submitted by unnamed plaintiffs gives us little pause,given that these persons are now members of the certified class.
regarding the adequacy of the six affidavits,defendants urge this court to adopt the evidentiary standard set forth in adams freedom forge,cir,and assert that adams requires a more exacting level of proof to support injunctive relief in a case such as this.the facts of adams are analogous to the present case insofar as,in each,the dispute is over the increased cost of medical benefits.there,retirees and surviving spouses brought suit to enjoin the defendant from altering the health care benefits it had been providing them since they retired.adams,at.the proposed modifications to the plaintiffs benefits included a shift from a plan to one in which the retirees could choose between plans,all of which provided substantially similar coverage as the original also required the retirees to pay monthly premiums.id.at.the district court granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction,precluding the defendant from instituting the changes.on appeal,the third circuit reversed in part.the court first noted that only of the plaintiffs testified as to the effect the changes would have.id.at.it then found that only three of these plaintiffs provided testimony sufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm,as opposed to mere monetary harm,id.at,and that only two of these plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits,id.at.the court thus reversed the district court grant of a preliminary injunction for all but two of the plaintiffs.
in severely trimming the scope of the injunction,the adams court criticized breyer reliance in textron on general facts and common sense,regarding the sort of harm suffered by retirees whose health benefits are terminated,as an insufficient foundation on which to conclude that individuals had suffered irreparable injury.see adams,at.the adams court asserted that t he law does not take judicial notice of matters of common sense,and common sense is no substitute for evidence.id.at.the court thus articulated a standard by which the plaintiffs must present individualized proof of irreparable harm.
notably,the adams court recognized that its standard could be met in a representative fashion as in a class action,and explained that so long as the plaintiffs lay an adequate foundation from which one could draw inferences that the testifying plaintiffs are similarly terms of irreparable all the other plaintiffs,a court could permissibly engage in inductive reasoning to reach the conclusion that every plaintiff suffered the threat of irreparable harm.id.because the plaintiffs in that case did not lay such a foundation,the court held that they presented insufficient evidence to justify a preliminary injunction protecting all of the plaintiffs.id.at see also cooper twa airlines,llc,d,denying injunctive relief in the absence of,among other things,some indication that individuals suffering irreparable harm were representative of the class.
in urging this court to adopt the standard set forth in adams,defendants suggest that the district court citation to textron indicates that it relied heavily on the general facts noted by justice breyer.however,the district court explicitly relied on the affidavits of six persons covered by the guaranty,each of whom alleged circumstances amounting to irreparable injury.as adams concedes,plaintiffs should be allowed to adduce evidence of harm representatively,so long as they l
