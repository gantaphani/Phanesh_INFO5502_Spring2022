appellant,unum life insurance company unum,appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of appellee,david billings billings,as to his claim under the employment retirement income and security act of erisa,et,for wrongful denial of disability benefits due to obsessive compulsive disorder ocd.unum contends that the district court erred in finding that its policy mental illness limitation,limiting benefits to months due to mental disorders,is ambiguous,and thus erred in holding that the limitation does not apply to limit billings benefits due to ocd.in this appeal,we are presented with an issue of first impression in this circuit,whether a mental illness limitation of an contract,which fails to provide whether an illness is categorized as mental based on its symptoms or etiology,is ambiguous.we hold that it is and affirm the district court order granting summary judgment.
additionally,unum appeals the district court final judgment awarding billings benefits for his claim under erisa for wrongful denial of disability benefits due to meniere disease.unum challenges the district court findings of fact and conclusions of law that billings is disabled under the terms of the policy due to meniere disease.alternatively,unum challenges the district court award of disability benefits for the time period between the last day of trial and the day the district court entered judgment months later.
billings was a pediatrician employed at pediatric professional associates,and was covered under a group long term disability policy policy issued by unum when he was diagnosed in november as suffering from ocd and major depression.billings was advised by his treating physician that due to ocd,he could not practice pediatrics.on january,billings stopped working as a pediatrician and has not practiced medicine since.billings filed a claim with unum on or about june,for disability benefits under the policy due to ocd and major depression.unum approved his claim and began paying disability benefits effective july.
unum policy provides that it will pay the insured monthly benefits upon proof that the insured is disabled due to sickness or injury.vol,tab,second am,ex.a,policy at.the policy further provides that d isability and disabled mean that because of injury or sickness the insured can not perform each of the material duties of his regular occupation.note for physicians,regular occupation means the speciality in the practice of medicine which the insured was practicing just prior to the date disability started.policy at.sickness is further defined as illness or disease.policy at.however,the policy contains the following limitation for mental illness b enefits for disability due to mental illness will not exceed months of monthly benefit payments.policy at.the policy goes on to define mental illness as mental,nervous or emotional diseases or disorders of any type.policy at.
in february,unum informed billings that,pursuant to the policy mental illness limitation,his benefits based on ocd and major depression would terminate on july.billings then filed a disability claim based on meniere disease unum initially approved billings continuation of disability benefits due to meniere disease.however,after further investigation unum determined that billings did not meet the policy definition of disabled because the severity of the meniere disease did not render billings incapable of performing the material duties of a pediatrician.accordingly,unum terminated billings benefits effective august.
billings filed a complaint against unum under erisa alleging wrongful denial of benefits and sought back benefits from august.in count i of the complaint he alleged that unum wrongfully denied him benefits due to ocd and in count ii he alleged that unum wrongfully denied him benefits due to meniere disease.both parties filed for summary judgment as to count i.the undisputed facts established that ocd is a physiological condition,that is,it has a physical or organic cause,with symptoms that are mental in nature.billings argued that the mental illness limitation is ambiguous because it does not provide whether an illness is classified as mental based on its symptoms or its origin,and thus has to be construed against the insurer and when construed against the insurer,the limitation does not apply to organically based illnesses such as ocd.unum contended that the mental illness limitation applies to all disorders or diseases which are characterized by mental symptoms,regardless of cause,because to do otherwise would render the limitation meaningless.
the district court held that the policy mental illness limitation is ambiguous and must be construed against unum under the applicable florida state law doctrine of contra proferentem.when construed against unum,the district court held that the limitation does not apply to an illness with an organic or physical cause.accordingly,the district court granted billings summary judgment as to count i.after a bench trial,the district court entered final judgment in favor of billings as to count ii.at trial,it was undisputed that billings suffered from meniere disease however,the dispute centered on the severity of billings disease.based on billings testimony,documentation of his episodes and the testimony of his family members and his treating physician,the district court found that billings was disabled due to meniere disease under the terms of the policy.
in unum opposition to billings proposed final judgment,it requested the district court remand billings claim for back benefits due to meniere disease to unum,rather than award back benefits up to the day judgment was entered.in doing so,unum argued it could determine in the first instance whether billings continued to be entitled to benefits.the district court entered final judgment months after the last day of trial and awarded billings back benefits due to meniere disease up to the day it entered judgment.unum timely appeals.
whether the policy mental illness limitation is ambiguous,and thus must be construed against unum such that organically based illnesses do not fall within the limitation.
whether the district court erred in awarding billings disability benefits based on clearly erroneous findings of fact that he was disabled due to meniere disease under the terms of the policy.
alternatively,whether the district court erred in awarding benefits up to the day it entered judgment,rather than remanding to unum as the plan administrator to determine whether billings disability continued up to the day judgment was entered months after trial.

iv.discussion 
at the outset,we address whether we must reach the merits of all the issues before this court on appeal.billings contends that we need not reach the merits of whether his disability benefits due to ocd are limited to months under the mental illness limitation if we affirm his entitlement to disability benefits due to meniere disease.unum,on the other hand,asserts that we must reach the merits of the mental illness limitation issue because the district court order granting summary judgment to billings as to count i represents an ongoing legal impediment to unum for example,unum argues that if billings meniere disease ceases,under the district court order it will be required to continue to provide disability benefits to billings due to ocd.we conclude that because the district court order continues to affect the rights of unum,and unum continues to have a cognizable interest in the outcome,we must address the mental illness limitation issue.see iron workers local bowen,ci
