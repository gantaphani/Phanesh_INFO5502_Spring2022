plaintiffs salvatore lascala,douglas janese,and richard marino appeal from so much of a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york,entered after a bench trial,as found defendant santo scrufari not liable for certain breaches of fiduciary duties imposed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,and as held that damages based on certain other fiduciary breaches that the district court found scrufari did commit would stop accruing on december,and not be based on the pension benefits scrufari would receive in the future.for the reasons that follow,we grant the appeal in all essential respects.
the underlying action,commenced in,charged several violations of federal labor law and erisa.by,the primary issue remaining in the case was whether scrufari,as the plan manager of the vicinity carpenters local welfare and pension funds the funds,breached his fiduciary duties under erisa by unilaterally increasing without trustee approval his compensation and benefits and the compensation of his son,who was also employed by the funds.the pertinent facts,set forth by the district court in its findings of fact and conclusions of law dated january,as modified july,lascala scrufari,d lascala i,and in its further decision dated february,lascala scrufari,civ.f,wl lascala ii,are as follows.
the funds were established pursuant to trust agreements among the fund trustees,carpenters local,and the building industry employers association of niagara county,new york.lascala i,d at.these trust agreements provide for five trustees and five trustees,all of whom are fiduciaries of the funds.id.the agreements further give the trustees the power to designate a salaried fund manager and the power to incur and pay the ordinary and necessary expenses of administration,including the fund manager salary.id.the trustees may exercise these powers only by majority vote of the quorum.id.
in the fall of,scrufari had been a trustee of the funds for some ten years and wanted to be appointed plan manager of the funds.id.at.scrufari met with his fellow trustee sarkee sanoian,who was the general business agent of local,to seek sanoian help in obtaining this position.id.sanoian apparently agreed to help scrufari,because at a trustees meeting in september,sanoian suggested that the current plan manager,lorelei collins,be replaced by a union member trained in collection procedures scrufari,and asked her when she expected to retire.id.although collins said she planned to stay another seven years,she suddenly and somewhat mysteriously resigned on october.id.
shortly thereafter,at a trustee meeting held on october,a trustee made a motion to appoint scrufari as the new plan manager.id.at.two votes were taken and both resulted in a deadlock,with the five trustees including scrufari voting for scrufari and the five trustees voting against scrufari.id.
at a subsequent trustees meeting held on december,sanoian raised again the possibility of appointing scrufari as the plan manager of the funds and noted that scrufari was qualified for the job and should be paid journeyman wages for it.id.after a vote to reconsider the motion to appoint scrufari once more resulted in a deadlock,the trustees agreed to refer the question to an arbitration of an unrelated dispute over a pension benefit increase.id.
at still a further trustees meeting held on march,several union members expressed dissatisfaction with the acting plan manager,kathy vance.id.a motion was made to put scrufari in the fund office along with vance and a separate motion was made to fire vance.id.the votes on both motions deadlocked.id.shortly after the meeting,however,vance resigned.id.the trustees held an emergency meeting on march,and a motion was again made to appoint scrufari as acting plan manager.id.once again,the vote deadlocked.id.instead,the trustees voted to appoint the funds actuary,the firm of maloney,as acting plan manager.id.shortly thereafter,however,without consulting the trustees,maloney hired scrufari to supervise the plan office.id.at.scrufari subsequently acknowledged that he was effectively the plan manager while he was maloney employee.id.
meanwhile,the arbitrator issued a decision favorable to the trustees on the issue of appointing scrufari as plan manager.id.at.at a meeting on may,the trustees accepted the decision without comment.id.at.nonetheless,scrufari remained a maloney employee for almost a year without any move by the trustees to make him plan manager.id.at.
while he was a maloney employee,scrufari was paid the general foreman rate on the carpenters union scale,which the trustees had generally agreed would govern the plan manager salary.id.at.on this scale,the lowest rate was the journeyman or carpenter rate the foreman rate was percent above the carpenter rate and the general foreman rate,which was scrufari rate,was percent above the foreman rate.id.there was an additional general agent rate,which was percent above the general foreman rate,but this rate was not part of the collective bargaining agreement and was paid only to sanoian,who was the general agent of the union,pursuant to the of local.id.
although scrufari was being paid the general foreman rate while he was maloney employee,rather than sanoian higher general agent rate,scrufari repeatedly testified that he made an agreement with sanoian that,upon becoming plan manager,scrufari would be paid the same rate as sanoian.id.citing tr.at.sanoian denied that he had any such agreement with scrufari,noting that he was just one vote on the board of trustees,and was therefore not authorized to set scrufari compensation by himself.id.quoting tr.at.
at a meeting on march,the trustees finally made scrufari the plan manager by passing the following resolution motion by sarkee sanoian seconded by merton marshall to appoint santo scrufari as plan manager as opposed to the present arrangement with maloney.his present rate of pay as a salaried employee will remain.id.at emphasis added by the district court.scrufari himself was not present at the meeting and only one person at the,of maloney what scrufari present rate of pay was.id.but nobody asked what the rate was.subsequently,at trial,sanoian,who was present at the march meeting but who was subsequently alienated from scrufari,testified that his understanding was that the reference to scrufari present rate of pay referred to a salary based on the journeyman rate,the very lowest rate of pay on the carpenters union scale and well below what maloney was actually paying him.id.at the other extreme,thomas hartz,a trustee who had remained friendly to scrufari,testified that his understanding was that scrufari was being paid at the same rate that the general business agent,sanoian was making.id.
in any event,scrufari unilaterally concluded that he was authorized to be paid at the same rate as sanoian.id.further,he concluded that he was authorized to match sanoian salary,increase by increase,for the remainder of his tenure as plan manager.id.in accordance with this understanding,on july,just three months after he became plan manager,scrufari gave himself a raise without trustee approval from an hour roughly the general foreman rate to an hour roughly the general agent rate,which was also sanoian rate.id.between and,scrufari raised his salary five additional times,each time without trustee approval.id.at.
scrufari also received two other forms of compensation weighted fringe and overtime compensation.the weighted fringes represented fringe benefits such as pension and health care contributions payable to fund employees on a weighted scale,to be commensurate with fringe benefits paid to union members covered by the collective bargaining agreement.id.the trustees approved payment of weighted fringe benefits to employees in the fund office in,when scrufari was plan manager,and the trustees further approved payment of these benefits retroactive to march,when scrufari began his employment with maloney.id.at.scrufari also began paying himself four hours a week in overtime pay at time and,starting in,without approval of the trustees.id.at.
