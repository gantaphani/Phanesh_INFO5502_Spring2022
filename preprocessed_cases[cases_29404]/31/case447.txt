unum life insurance company of america appeals from the order of the district court granting wanda stup summary judgment on her claim that unum improperly denied her disability benefits in violation of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.unum does not dispute that stup suffers from lupus,fibromyalgia,and other afflictions.rather,unum argues that it acted reasonably in determining that,despite these disabilities,stup could perform a job commensurate with her training and,therefore,was not entitled to disability benefits under the erisa plan.the district court rejected this argument and concluded that unum abused its discretion in denying stup benefits.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.

in the,stup was diagnosed with lupus and fibromyalgia the record reveals that a rheumatologist,nathan wei,began treating stup in january and monitored her closely for the next five years,examining stup or monthly.
a biopsy conducted in january verified that stup suffered from lupus erythematosus.periodic lab tests consistently showed high levels of an antibody associated with lupus in stup blood.stup medical records evidence that she has suffered the following manifestations of lupus rashes,lesions,livedo,swelling,temperature fluctuations,chest pains,and pneumonia.
stup fibromyalgia is also well documented.she initially responded well to the treatment prescribed by wei,but her condition rapidly worsened.wei notes from his frequent examinations of stup state that she had diffuse trigger point tenderness and complained of fatigue,weakness,and pain.wei changed stup medications regularly to try to alleviate her pain,often to no avail.
wei recommended that stup,along with taking prescribed medications,limit her activities and take daily naps as necessary.but stup disregarded his advice by continuing to work as an administrative assistant to the president of frederick underwriters,where she had been employed since.in wei view,stup attempted to work far past her physical abilities for several years.by march,stup debilitating pain and fatigue prevented her from performing her duties.only then did she apply for disability benefits under frederick erisa plan.
frederick plan is contained in an unum insurance policy,which unum administers.the policy entitles a class employee unum classification of stup to months of disability benefits if the insured can not perform each of the material duties of h er regular occupation emphasis added.under the policy,disability benefits for class employees cease after two years unless the insured can not perform each of the material duties of any gainful occupation for which s he is reasonably fitted by training,education or experience emphasis added.unum paid stup disability benefits from september until november,at which time it terminated her benefits,explaining that s ince the definition of disability now applies to any occupation we feel you could return to work in a sedentary occupation.
stup appealed unum denial of disability benefits.in support of her appeal,she submitted her voluminous medical records and an unum estimated functional abilities form filled out by wei,stating she could lift only one to ten pounds occasionally and was unable to perform even sedentary sic for more than hours at a time.
unum referred her medical file to parke,an physician,who determined that b ased on medical objective studies,stup has evidence of a connective tissue disorder.he concluded that the best way to fully assess her ability to work would be a visual assessment,possibly coordinated with a physical and rheumatological independent medical examination.instead of following this recommendation,unum associate medical director,bielawski,decided to obtain a functional capacity evaluation fce.accordingly,unum requested that wei write stup a prescription for an fce,which he did.
on april,a physical therapist conducted the fce.the therapist reported that stup flexibility and range of motion were within functional limits but that she e xhibited pain behaviors during testing.the therapist could not measure stup strength because stup g a ve out before an adequate assessment could be made.similarly,the therapist could not determine stup aerobic capacity because stup could not move at the minimum speed necessary for the treadmill walking test mph.stup was able to walk for minutes at a speed of mph prior to stopping the test due to hip and leg pain she averaged about pounds of grip strength with her right hand,and pounds with her left.tests also showed that she could occasionally lift pounds from floor to knuckle,pounds from knuckle to shoulder,and pounds from shoulder to overhead and could carry pounds for feet.stup performed inconsistently on squat lift,isometric pull,and hand grip tests,which the therapist interpreted as a sign that stup did not make a consistent effort.the fce did not measure stup positional tolerance because after the remaining tests were explained to her,stup indicated she did not feel she could go on and the physical therapist agreed that testing should not continue.
in total,the functional capacity evaluation lasted only two and a half hours.the physical therapist opined that t he results of this evaluation indicate that stup could perform sedentary work,but immediately cautioned that the results of this evaluation may not be truly indicative of the clients sic functional capabilities.the therapist noted inconsistencies that became apparent in the examination.for example,stup showed stronger grip strength in her left hand than her right even though she is right handed and the dominant hand is usually ten to fifteen percent stronger than the other.the therapist also pointed out that at the time stup complained of severe pain,her heart rate was lower than it had been after thirty minutes of sitting.the physical therapist concluded it would not be prudent to make recommendations regarding specific job duties that this client can or can not perform due to a lack of consistent and true information.
nevertheless,an unum doctor,burton mcdaniel,after stating that he reviewed stup file with special attention to recent fce,concluded that the fce appears to be very thorough and valid and the results concur with the statement that she is capable of performing sedentary level work.his report focused entirely on the fce test results.using as a baseline the measurement of stup heart rate during a stress test taken the previous year,which was referred to in the fce,the doctor implied stup had not given a full effort during the fce because if she had,her heart rate would have been higher during testing.he concluded that w ithout inconsistencies claimant may well be able to function at a higher work level such as light.unum then informed stup that its initial decision to deny her claim was appropriate.
stup asked unum to review its decision a second time,challenging unum assertion that she could perform sedentary work in support of her appeal,stup submitted an affidavit in which she explained her daily activities 
on an average day,i do go anywhere.i go outside in the morning to get to the mailbox,have breakfast and then read or nap,depending on my pain level.i try to stay awake in the morning and sometimes i will make efforts to pick up around the house.my daughter helps me clean up,and i try to do a little bit each day.some days i can not do any cleaning or picking up because of the pain other days i can do a few minutes.i can not do any type of normal house chores at a normal pace.i only live in one half of my house because there is no way that i could take care of a house.sometimes i eat a light lunch and sometimes i skip lunch.then i take my pain medication and lay down for the afternoon.i watch the news,and on some days i go sit outside on the front porch and read.i eat dinner sometimes.i then watch tv or sit on the porch.
stup also stated in her affidavit that she had offered to try to continue the tests for the fce,but the physical therapist said that she rather i not start the tests if i was going to complete them,and that she did think i was going to make it.
in addition,stup provided unum with a detailed letter from wei dated august,explaining his diagnosis and opinion that stup could not perform even sedentary work 
stup fibromyalgia diagnosis is supported by the following criteria positive reaction to all trigger points,nine positive tender points,sleep,short term memory deficiency,aches and pains with minimal activity,and severe,persistent fatigue on minimal exertion.stup fatigue is best described as profound and prevents her from being able to perform normal daily activities,such as personal grooming and household chores,without experiencing draining,marked loss of energy.her memory deficiency is evident in her inability to remember simple directions and the purpose for which she sets out on driving excursions.
in addition to fibromyalgia,stup suffers from low back pain that radiates down her legs as a result of degenerative disc disease.as for her lupus erythematosus,the most significant symptom is limited mobility and pain in both her hands.
i have recommended to stup that she limit her activities,take daily naps as necessary to replenish her energy level,and continue with medications and treatment to document and monitor her symptoms.despite my recommendations,she attempted to work far past her physical abilities.i have explained to her that she will experience symptom and periodic improvement relative to her baseline condition.i also explained that the ability to predict when she may experience or periods of improvement is minimal at best.
based upon my history of treatment with stup,i do not believe that she is physically capable of performing even sedentary work.she must be able to perform physical activities at her own pace with frequent rest periods she needs to nap on a daily basis and she will suffer an exacerbation of symptoms as a result of stress common in any workplace.furthermore,as a result of fatigue and back pain,she is limited in her ability to stand,sit or walk for periods of time greater than thirty minutes.i recommend against repetitive bending,kneeling,crawling,and climbing stairs.she is also limited in her ability to lift,carry,push or pull more than ten pounds.the limitation of the use of her hands makes anything more than simple grasping beyond her ability 
stup has never shown herself to be a malingerer or less than fully motivated to do whatever is necessary to improve her health.she is compliant with all recommendations for treatment,except to the extent that she worked past the time that it was advisable for her to do so.it is my professional opinion that stup is totally disabled from all work.this total disability from all work has been present since march.due to the chronic nature of her condition,sic will be totally disabled to work into the foreseeable future.
an unum doctor,maureen lee,reviewed wei letter to determine whether it should affect unum prior opinion that claimant has sedentary work capacity.on a brief form,the doctor stated that because it was not accompanied by new objective testing,t he updated medical letter does not change the prior conclusions to the file based on fce.unum again denied stup disability claim.
having exhausted her administrative appeals,stup filed this suit,claiming unum violated erisa by wrongfully denying her disability benefits.after consideration of memoranda submitted by the parties,the district court granted summary judgment to stup.unum appeals.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,employing the same standards applied by the district court in reviewing the fiduciary decision to deny erisa benefits.see sheppard enoch pratt,travelers ins,cir citation omitted.two facts affect which standard we apply in reviewing unum decision to deny erisa benefits.
first,the erisa plan frederick underwriters insurance policy with unum provided unum with the discretionary authority both to determine an employee eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of this policy.although this grant of authority is not as broad as that in some erisa plans,see,booth stores,cir,it does invest unum with discretion.when an erisa plan affords an administrator discretion,a court reviews the administrator decision to deny benefits for an abuse of that discretion,asking whether the denial of benefits was reasonable,bernstein capitalcare,cir citation omitted,based on the facts known to the administrator at the time.sheppard enoch pratt,at.an administrator decision is reasonable if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.bernstein,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the other fact determinative of the appropriate standard of judicial review is that in denying benefits,unum acted under a conflict of interest.that is,its decision to deny benefits impacted its own financial interests because it both administers the plan and pays for benefits received by its members.id.at see also doe group hospitalization med,cir.as we noted in booth,the supreme court has directed that this conflict must be weighed in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.booth,at emphasis in original citing firestone tire rubber bruch,d.in these circumstances,we will not act as deferentially as would otherwise be appropriate t he fiduciary decision will be entitled to some deference,but this deference will be lessened to the degree necessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from the conflict.doe,at accord ellis metro.life ins,cir bedrick travelers ins,cir citing bailey blue cross blue shield,cir.under this standard of review,t he more incentive for the administrator or fiduciary to benefit itself by a certain interpretation of benefit eligibility or other plan terms,the more objectively reasonable the administrator or fiduciary decision must be and the more substantial the evidence must be to support it.ellis,at.
we can not hold that unum decision to deny benefits was either supported by substantial evidence or the product of a principled reasoning process.
stup has offered overwhelming and uncontradicted evidence that she suffers from lupus and fibromyalgia,as well as a number of other afflictions.unum does not dispute or question this evidence.rather unum insists stup ailments do not render her unable to perform sedentary work commensurate with her training.
on this issue,stup submitted her medical records and the detailed opinion of nathan wei,the rheumatologist who had treated her for years.wei reported that stup fibromyalgia caused her sleep,memory deficiency,aches and pains with minimal activity,and severe,persistent fatigue,concluding that her fatigue and memory loss prevent her from being able to perform normal daily activities or remember simple directions.wei also concluded that stup degenerative disc disease caused low back
