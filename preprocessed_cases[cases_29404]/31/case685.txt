plaintiffs,former employees of defendant pirelli armstrong tire corporation pirelli or the company or its predecessor in interest,armstrong rubber company armstrong,appeal from the judgment dismissing their claims of breach of fiduciary duty arising under the employment retirement income security act erisa.during the relevant time periods,plaintiffs were salaried employees or retired salaried employees at pirelli plant in madison,tennessee.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
pirelli is a delaware corporation with headquarters in new haven,connecticut,and is in the business of tire production.pirelli bought the madison,tennessee plant from armstrong in.pirelli provided medical benefits for its salaried employees and retired salaried employees through group insurance policies with connecticut general life insurance company,including a policy,a policy,and a policy.pirelli had the right to terminate the policy by giving the insurance company advance written notice,as well as the right to amend the policy with the insurance company approval.in,armstrong gave its salaried employees a summary plan description spd,which stated as follows under the heading termination of insurance 
your insurance will terminate when you are no longer a member of an eligible class of employees,when the group policy terminates or when you are no longer working for the employer,whichever happens first.however,if you retire,your life insurance and your medical care benefits other than pregnancy benefits will be continued until the employer stops payment of premiums for you.
the insurance for a family member terminates when your insurance terminates,or when the family member is no longer eligible,whichever happens first.
under certain circumstances,it may be possible to continue part or all of your insurance during temporary,plant closures or leave of absence or when you are unable to work because of sickness or injury.it may also be possible for the insurance to continue on your family members after your death.see your benefit plan administrator for this information.
the spd contained no other language regarding modification or termination of medical benefits.the and policies had the same or substantially the same provisions regarding cancellation and amendment,and the spd was relied upon until,when pirelli distributed a new spd.this spd contained a provision in which pirelli reserved the right to modify or terminate the plan at any time.under the section concerning the comprehensive medical insurance plan,the spd provided 
d.when your coverage ends 
please refer to section l of the handbook for details concerning termination of coverage under this plan.
similarly,in the section about the prescription drug plan,the spd provides 
c.when coverage ends 
please refer to section l of the handbook for details concerning the termination of your coverage in the event you cease to be an active employee.in certain circumstances you may be able to continue to have coverage and this is explained.
however,section l of the handbook,entitled termination of benefits,was left blank when the spd was distributed,and pirelli never issued any materials to be placed in that space.despite being presented to employees in,the spd was not actually implemented until.
from through,armstrong and pirelli,in an effort to reduce their salaried workforce,encouraged employees to take early retirement.after acquiring the madison plant,pirelli held a series of meetings in december of,with groups of salaried employees to encourage eligible employees to take early retirement.during these meetings,salaried employees were given copies of the spd and were encouraged to consider retirement before the end of to avoid anticipated increases in the cost of health insurance and other major changes in employees health insurance benefits,effective january,when an increase in the cost of health insurance was expected to go into effect.
thereafter,in july of,pirelli put into effect an optional ops plan,again seeking to encourage early retirement by providing various incentives.pirelli provided written descriptions of the ops plan to its salaried employees and required all salaried employees to attend one of several mandatory meetings.pirelli corporate headquarters also provided information about the ops plan for pirelli plant managers to disseminate to salaried employees at these meetings.the information included a script for the plant manager to read to the salaried employees at the group meetings,a slide presentation and a recorded audio presentation.at these meetings,charles wright,the plant manager,read the scripted presentation,while shirley pike,the assistant employee relations manager,and a human resources liaison since,made a slide presentation and a recorded audio presentation,and answered employees questions.salaried employees were told in the script read by plant manager wright that o ur plan affords many of you the opportunity to act now to obtain a deductible during retirement and not be affected by the upcoming changes in retirement insurance.at.wright testified that he told the salaried employees that their medical benefits would not change during their retirement.employees also received a copy of a letter from paul james,pirelli president,and a written description of the ops plan.these materials informed the employees that early retirees would receive the benefit of the lowest deductible and maximum expense amounts available for salaried employees,that they would receive these reduced deductibles and maximum expenses during retirement,and that they would not be affected by the upcoming changes in retirement insurance.employees were generally told to bring any questions they might have to pike,and many of them did just that.
in answering employees questions,pike consulted the company current spd and personnel policy directive book,and if those sources did not provide an answer,she would call corporate headquarters for assistance.pike testified that her actions were in conformity with the procedures established by armstrong and pirelli.however,pike admitted that she did not have the ops plan documents in her nashville fact,she had never seen or read them during her employment with armstrong and pirelli.according to pike,the ops plan documents were in the corporate office in new haven,connecticut and were not available for examination in the employee relations department in nashville.
when employees who were at meetings with pike asked her how long their benefits would last,she would tell them during retirement.in her testimony,pike defined retirement to mean during their lifetimes and the lives of their spouses unless the latter remarried.at.pike also informed employees that their benefits would remain unchanged during their lifetimes.when employees asked pike about language in the spd that allowed the company to alter or amend the plan,pike stated that it was written for the benefit of pirelli to enable the company to change insurance carriers.as pike put it,if i had that discussion,i am sure i would have talked about insurance carrier.at.although pike could not remember if anyone from corporate headquarters inquired to determine whether she was disseminating accurate information,she admitted that no one from the company told her that her statement that medical benefits would remain unchanged during their lifetimes and that of their spouses unless they remarried was inaccurate because pirelli reserved the right to change the ops plan.pike also admitted that she did not know whether she had the role of a fiduciary relating to the dissemination of information about the ops plan to the company employees because she was not sure what a fiduciary is.pike added that to the best of her knowledge,the company provided her with truthful and accurate information to present to the employees and the plan beneficiaries,and that the company advised her to answer questions posed by employees about the benefits so as not to mislead them.in any event,pike testified that she did not intentionally mislead any employees with the information that she provided to them.
however,as acknowledged by pirelli general counsel and secretary,sherwood willard,it would have been prudent for pike to have read the ops plan and to have had a copy of it in her office because she was responsible for providing accurate information to employees about the terms and conditions thereof.willard also admitted that if pike told employees that the company could not change their benefits during retirement,then she was not providing accurate information.willard further acknowledged that if pike told employees that the language in the spd concerning the company right to alter or amend the ops plan meant that the company could change insurance carriers,then that information was also incorrect.
in january of,pirelli adopted a new health care plan setting forth the terms of its medical benefit plan for salaried employees and retirees.subsequently,in february of,all retired salaried employees received a letter advising them that pirelli had unilaterally changed the terms of their health insurance benefits.as stated in the written stipulation of facts,plaintiffs incurred greater expenses for health care under pirelli plan than they would have incurred if their medical benefits had not changed.in,pirelli again revised its medical benefit plan,increasing premium contributions,deductibles and maximum amounts for plaintiffs in and.
as pirelli points out,plaintiffs fall into four distinct groups based upon when they retired.five plaintiffs retired in or before pirelli acquired the madison plant.those plaintiffs are dewey meador,donald rosso,bobby richardson,roy kemp and vada haston.a second group consists of plaintiffs who retired in before the announcement of the ops program in july.these plaintiffs are joe smith,paul skelley,and doyle denton.a third group of plaintiffs retired in and under the ops program.these plaintiffs are clay james,ernest custer,john carney,dean carney,ruby panzera,andrew panzera,billy fykes,cook and robert adkins.the final plaintiff is james wallace,who retired in.
at the bench trial,plaintiffs provided testimony about the information supplied to them at the meetings when pirelli induced them to take early retirement or resign.clay james,who accepted early retirement on september,at age,testified that after attending mandatory meetings about the ops plan with other employees in the summer of,he met privately with pike to talk about his pension options.according to james,pike told him an insurance change will affect you if you stay here as an employee,but that he had an opportunity to lock in on the benefits as of today regardless even if you retire and work on into.specifically,pike told james that he would get the benefits of a dollars deductible,dollars max at.
vada haston testified that she was offered early retirement as part of armstrong reduction in force program in.before accepting early retirement on may,haston met with pike who assured her that if she took early retirement,she and her husband would receive all the medical benefits that they had while she was employed,except for dental and eye care.according to haston,pike told her benefits would be f or as long as i lived or for life,and that in the case of my husband,if he should outlive me,until his death,unless he remarried.haston testified that pike also advised her that her husband should drop other coverage that he had when haston asked over and over again if he would be covered,pike told her that he would be for life.at.
don rosso,who retired in june of at the age of,also testified that he relied upon representations that wright and pike made during both group meetings and private interviews in opting for early retirement by bridging three years of service.according to rosso,wright assured him at the group meeting that he would get to keep his medical benefits for the rest of his life.at.afterwards,rosso met privately with pike and asked her about medical benefits he and his wife would get upon retirement.pike told rosso that he would get medical benefits at no cost and that his wife would not lose the benefits unless she divorced or remarried.at.
bobby richardson also retired in june of at age.before retiring,richardson went with roy kemp to meet with pike to discuss early retirement.richardson testified about the meeting with pike as follows 
since i had the number of the bridge that they offered me was not enough to get me to years,it only got me to age which left me with my pension being reduced to at least percent or better,which was not much of an incentive.the only thing that was an incentive was the fact that the insurance insurance coverage was better than what i had then and that my concern was with my wife who is a from a very family,and i was very concerned about providing for her after my death and made sure that this in fact did that.and pike assured me that it did and so i talked to my wife that night about it and decided to accept it based on that basis even though the financial loss of my pension was bad.
at.richardson testified that the retirement form signed by him provided upon retirement you will have the following benefits at no cost to you your benefits r emain the same except your deductible will be decreased to a hundred dollars individual,family and maximum expense will be individual,family,effective.at the time richardson retired,he did not have a deductible of,and he had a maximum expenses for me and my wife.according to richardson,pike assured him that after his death the same benefits would remain in effect for his wife.
roy kemp,who also retired in at the age of under the same bridging program as richardson and rosso,testified that at the meeting that he and richardson attended with pike,she stated that i would receive my insurance for me and my wife at no cost to me for a lifetime,except for dental and vision coverage.at.
ruby and andrew panzera,who are husband and wife,retired under the july ops program after having two individual meetings with pike.when panzera asked pike if the company could change their health insurance benefits after they retired,pike answered that it would not change and would remain this way until our death.at.panzera also testified that pike told her that she would have prescription drug coverage for life and that the company would pay for all of it.at.
emery paul skelley,who retired in june of at the age of,testified that pike told him that,upon retirement,he would lose his vision and dental coverage,but would keep his prescription drug and medical coverage as well as his retirement benefits for the rest of his life.according to skelley,he asked pike whether there was anything in small print anywhere else in any kind of contract that i lose any of this after i become and whether he kept the benefits coverage until the day i die.skelley testified that pike replied by telling him that i would until the day i die.at.relying upon pike representation,skelley decided to take early retirement.
cook,who retired under the ops program in july of at the age of,testified that after the group meeting conducted by wright and pike,he also met privately with pike,who assured him that he would receive medical benefits,including prescription drug benefits,for as long as i live and if i died before my wife then she would receive those benefits as long as she lived providing that she did remarry.at.
ernest custer,who retired in october of at the age of,testified that after the july meetings conducted by wright and pike,he spoke with pike,who told him that if he retired under the ops program,he would keep the deductible and the maximum for his entire retirement.at.
joe smith,who retired on march,at the age of,attended a meeting in december of in which pike told him and other employees that if they were going to retire,it would be advisable to do so in because the company was changing its insurance coverage.smith also met separately with pike,who told him that she thought there was a change coming and if you was sic going to retire,would be the time to get out.at.
doyle denton,who retired in april of at the age of,also attended a meeting in december of in which pike advised employees that it would be to their advantage to retire in because there was going to be a change in medical coverage,effective january.denton also met separately with pike,who told him that his medical benefits were locked in for life and would cost my wife and myself anything,and that,upon retirement,his deductible would actually decrease down to dollars.at.

james wallace,who retired on september,at the age of,testified that after attending a meeting in july of regarding the ops program,he delayed his retirement because his department manager,who needed wallace to continue working,advised him that he would be entitled to retire later with all the same benefits if he stayed.before retiring,wallace had a meeting with both pike and robert mische,pike supervisor.according to wallace 
well,we talked about what my benefits would be in retirement,and i was a little reluctant and the sic taking it.i was two years from drawing any social security so i did know if i could live on what i was going to get.but then in talking with them they assured me that i would have my life insurance and my drug card,my insurance.and mische himself said it would be for the rest of my life and he wished at that point that he could get in the same position,and shirley concurred that she would be in that position.and the fact that two years had transpired since i had talked to them before and decided it was time to go.

following a bench trial,the district court,applying the principles set forth in varity howe,d,sprague general motors,cir en banc,and krohn huron memorial hospital,cir,issued a decision on january,ruling that pirelli breached its fiduciary duty only with regard to the two retired salaried employees who are not appellants here,jack jarrard and ron fitzsimmons.specifically,the district court found that under krohn,jarrard and fitzsimmons were entitled to damages from pirelli because the company breached its fiduciary duties to them by providing inaccurate and misleading responses to their direct questions regarding erisa plan benefits as part of early retirement incentive programs.however,as to plaintiffs,the district court found that pirelli did not breach its fiduciary duties to them because there was no evidence that pike or wright deliberately or negligently misled them in answering their direct questions,or that pirelli planned in advance to modify their retiree medical benefits years later.
thereafter,plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to amend make additional findings of fact regarding the district court january,order,claiming that the principles articulated in sprague and krohn required that the court ruling with respect to jarrard and fitzsimmons be extended to them.the district court denied this motion on may.the parties then reached a settlement concerning damages owed to jarrard and fitzsimmons.the january,order and the may,order were both incorporated into a final judgment entered by the district court on october.it is this judgment from which plaintiffs now appeal.
discussion 
this court reviews findings of fact following an erisa bench trial for clear error.davies centennial life ins,cir.the district court legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.id.
the issue on appeal is the district court entry of judgment against plaintiffs with regard to their erisa breach of fiduciary duty claim.
pursuant to a of erisa 
a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.
a.erisa also provides that a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.a.as pointed out by this court in krohn,erisa imposes high standards of fiduciary duty upon administrators of an erisa plan.at.erisa fiduciary duty involves three components a duty of loyalty,requiring that all decisions regarding an erisa plan must be made with an eye single to the interests of the participants and beneficiaries a prudent person fiduciary obligation,requiring that a plan fiduciary exercise his or her duties with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence of a prudent person acting under similar circumstances and a duty to act for the exclusive purpose of proving benefits to plan participants.id.quoting berlin.bell,cir.erisa therefore imposes an unwavering duty on an erisa trustee to make decisions with devotion to a plan participants and beneficiaries and,in so doing,to act as a prudent person would act in a similar situation.berlin,at.erisa fiduciary standards are derived from the common law of trusts bearing in mind the special nature and purpose of employee benefit plans.varity,at.quoting conf,at.
a fiduciary breaches his duty by providing plan participants with materially misleading information,regardless of whether the fiduciary statements or omissions were made negligently or intentionally.krohn,at citing berlin,at.misleading communications to plan participants regarding plan administration for example,eligibility under a plan,the extent of benefits under a plan will support a claim for a breach of fiduciary duty.drennan motors,cir quoting berlin,at.a misrepresentation is material if there is a substantial likelihood that it would mislead a reasonable employee in making an adequately informed decision in pursuing disability benefits to which she may be entitled.krohn,at citing in re unisys.retiree med.benefit erisa,cir.
to establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on alleged misrepresentations concerning coverage under an employee benefit plan,a plaintiff must show that the defendant was acting in a fiduciary capacity when it made the challenged representations that these constituted material misrepresentations and that the plaintiff relied on those misrepresentations to their detriment.see ballone eastman kodak,cir unisys,at mcmunn pirelli tire,llc,d.whether an affirmative misrepresentation was material is a mixed question of law and fact a misrepresentation is material if there is a substantial likelihood that it would mislead a reasonable employee in making an adequately informed decision about if and when to retire.fischer phila,cir.
plaintiffs in the matter at hand essentially argue that the district court applied the appropriate case,varity,sprague and applied it incorrectly.consequently,plaintiffs seek to have the district court ruling in favor of jarrard and fitzsimmons expanded to encompass all plaintiffs.
the supreme court held in varity that an employer breached its fiduciary duty to former employees and retirees when it induced them to transfer their employment to a newly formed subsidiary that the employer knew was unstable.see varity howe,at.as the court noted,t he thrust of varity remarks made at special meetings designed to persuade employees to transfer was that the employees benefits would remain secure if they voluntarily transferred to the subsidiary.id.at.the court further noted that a s varity knew,however,the reality was very different.id.the court therefore easily concluded that varity had breached its fiduciary duty to the employees,uncontroversially finding that l ying is inconsistent with the duty of loyalty owed by all fiduciaries and codified in section a of erisa.id.at.internal quotation omitted.because the employer had deliberately misled its employees,the court declined to reach the question whether erisa fiduciaries have any fiduciary duty to disclose truthful information on their own initiative,or in response to employee inquiries.id.
in sprague,this court,sitting en banc,explicated the contours of an erisa fiduciary duty to disclose information to beneficiaries.facing a factual scenario similar to the one involved in this case,sprague considered whether general motors gm breached its fiduciary duties under erisa by its oral and written representations to early retirees regarding its retirement program.see at.in that case,gm,in an effort to avoid involuntary layoffs,tried to persuade employees to take early retirement.for more than two decades,gm had provided continuing health insurance benefits to salaried retirees.although the plan documents and information booklets changed over the years,they all contained statements to the effect that basic health care coverage would be provided to retirees at gm expense for your lifetime.id.most of the booklets,however,also contained a reservation of rights clause,putting employees on notice that gm could amend,modify,suspend,or terminate its benefit plans at any time.id.early retirees were required to participate in an exit interview,at which many of the early retirees received plan documents,and some of the employees were orally put on notice of gm right to amend or terminate the plan.id.at.the small number of early retirees who asked specifically about future changes to health care benefits were accurately told that benefits could be changed in the future.id.in fact,as here,the plan was later modified in a way that adversely affected the retirees.
in addressing the plaintiffs claims that gm breached its fiduciary duties by modifying the plan,this court first noted that,although employers do not act in a fiduciary capacity when they amend or terminate a benefit plan,conveying information about the likely future of plan benefits is a discretionary act of plan administration giving rise to a fiduciary duty.id.at quoting varity,at.this court held that,as a matter of law,gm had not breached this fiduciary duty,noting that gm never told the early retirees that their health care benefits would be fully paid up or vested upon retirement.what gm told many of them,rather,was that their coverage was to be paid by gm for their lifetimes.this was undeniably true under the terms of gm plan.id.the court added 
explanations of benefits 
tend to sound promissory by their very nature.while these explanations may state a company current intentions with respect to the plan,they can not be expected to foreclose the possibility that changing financial conditions will require a company to modify welfare benefit plan provisions at some point in the future.gable sweetheart cup,cir.
gm failure,if it may properly be called such,amounted to this the company did not tell the early retirees at every possible opportunity that which it had told them many times,that the terms of the plan were subject to change.there is,in our view,a world of difference between the employer deliberate misleading of employees in varity and gm failure to begin every communication to plan participants with a caveat.
the employees in sprague had received prior warnings about the company right to amend or terminate the plan.in fact,some employees were reminded of that fact during their exit interviews just prior to early retirement.however,the sprague court did not find these previous warnings of the employer right to modify the plan determinative.rather,this court noted that erisa contains detailed disclosure provisions regulating the contents of summary plan descriptions.id.citing b.under these provisions,an erisa fiduciary need not disclose its reservation of the right to amend or modify benefits in plan documents.see also adams avondale,cir.we then noted that no court of appeals has imposed fiduciary liability for a failure to disclose information that is not required to be disclosed,and that at least three circuits have held that there is no fiduciary duty to disclose planned changes in benefits or even a planned termination of the plan before those actions become official.id.at citing pocchia nynex,cir payonk hmw,cir stanton gulf oil,cir.this court therefore concluded that there can be no fiduciary duty to disclose the possibility of a future change in benefits.id.
pirelli liability to jarrard and fitzsimmons,which plaintiffs wish to have extended to themselves,stems from the last paragraph of the sprague court analysis of the fiduciary duty issue,wherein this court stated 
had an early retiree asked about the possibility of the plan changing,and had he received a misleading answer,or had gm on its own initiative provided misleading information about the future of the plan,or had gm been required by erisa or its implementing regulations to forecast the future,a different case would have been presented.but we do not think that gm accurate representations of its current program can reasonably be deemed misleading.gm having given out no inaccurate information,there was no breach of fiduciary duty.
following the bench trial in the matter at hand,the district court concluded that sprague shielded pirelli from liability as to plaintiffs,but not as to fitzsimmons and jarrard,because the latter two had posed direct questions to pirelli contact person,pike,about the reservation of rights clause in the plan documents,asking what effect the clause might have on their future benefits.in response,pike told the employees not to worry about that provision and inaccurately explained that the language only meant that the employer could change insurance carriers.although there was no evidence that pike deliberately misled jarrard and fitzsimmons,the district court held that her negligently rendered misleading responses to direct questions about the effect of the reservation of rights clause on future benefits gave rise to fiduciary liability under krohn.
in krohn,this court held that a plan administrator breached its fiduciary duty to a participant by not providing complete and accurate information in response to the participant questions about available benefits.the participant was an employee who had been in a car accident.krohn,at.at the time of her accident,krohn was eligible for both and disability benefits.the benefits were available on the fifteenth day of an injury up to a maximum of per week,for up to weeks.the benefits were available on the day of an injury up to a maximum of per month,until age years in krohn case.when asked about what benefits would be available to krohn,however,a personnel assistant responded only that disability was available and that most employees involved in automobile accidents found it advantageous to take disability and recover under their automobile insurance for lost wages.id.at.krohn elected this option.three years later,her benefits under her auto insurance expired,and she applied for disability benefits under the plan.under the terms of the policy,however,krohn had been obligated to give notice within thirty days of the accident of her intent to apply for benefits,and her application was denied as untimely.id.
we then held as follows 
our review of the record thus reveals that the fiduciary received notice repeatedly that the plaintiff would b
