this appeal requires us to consider what limitations,if any,the employee retirement income security act erisa imposes on the enforceability of a judgment rendered against pension plan assets under section a of that statute,a.plaintiff robert milgram seeks to recover approximately million in pension assets and accrued earnings and interest from the orthopedic associates defined contribution pension plan the plan,which in erroneously transferred half the balance of milgram pension account to his,norah breen.following a bench trial in,the united states district court for the northern district of new york gary sharpe,judge granted milgram judgment against the plan in that amount and granted the plan an equivalent judgment against breen.the plan now challenges the enforceability of the judgment against it on the ground that requiring its payment before the plan has fully recovered from breen would violate erisa provision,erisa d,d,as well as other provisions of federal and state law.the plan also argues that the district court erred in interpreting the plan document to afford compensation to milgram for the lost use of his funds during the fifteen year period since the erroneous distribution.
as the majority of the plan claims assert legal errors in the district court judgment,unless otherwise noted our standard of review is de novo.see hobson metro.life ins,cir.applying the appropriate standards of review,we find the plan arguments to be without merit.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
until he retired from the practice of medicine in,milgram worked as an orthopedic surgeon affiliated with the medical group orthopedic associates of pennsylvania avenue,binghamton,new york,orthopedic.by virtue of his membership in the group,milgram became the beneficiary of two separate pension plans.one was a defined contribution plan,the proceeds of which are at issue in this litigation the plan or the mpp the other was a plan the psp.under both plans,orthopedic itself was formally designated as plan administrator.in practice,however,orthopedic employed an outside entity on a contract basis to provide administrative services.during the period relevant to this lawsuit,those services were provided by the bay ridge group,which was headed by robert sedor.
in milgram and his wife,norah breen,divorced.their divorce settlement entitled breen to half the balance in milgram psp fund a share valued at at the time of the settlement and a fixed sum of from milgram mpp account plus accumulated earnings.due to a clerical error,however,bay ridge transferred half of both accounts to a separate account created in breen name.this resulted in breen receiving more than she was entitled to receive under the settlement.
milgram did not discover the error immediately.shortly after the accounts were segregated,he terminated his membership in the plans and rolled the remaining balances over to an individual retirement account.breen withdrew the balance of her account in september.it was only in june of that milgram,at his lawyer insistence,reviewed his plan account statements and discovered the overpayment to breen.by that time,none of the erroneously transferred funds remained in the plan.in october orthopedic,acting as plan administrator,demanded that breen give back the excess distribution.when she refused,orthopedic sued bay ridge,sedor,and breen to recoup the overpayment.two years of litigation failed to result in a settlement or a dispositive ruling by the district court.as a result,milgram,who still had not recovered his money,sued orthopedic,the plan,the trustees,sedor,bay ridge,and breen asserting both contract and fiduciary duty claims under erisa a,a.
the district court consolidated the two cases and discovery proceeded for several years thereafter.in october of,milgram moved for partial summary judgment against orthopedic and the plan,relying on a theory of contractual liability under erisa a,a.he sought a judgment for both the principal amount that was erroneously transferred to breen and for accumulated earnings.the plan opposed the motion,arguing,as relevant here,that the requested relief would be inconsistent with the policies of erisa,because an award against the plan before it had recovered from breen would impair the interests of other plan members.while milgram motion for summary judgment against the plan was pending,orthopedic moved for summary judgment against breen.
in march,soon after both motions were fully briefed,the district court announced that it would postpone decision and instead hold a bench trial on milgram equitable claims.on the first day of trial,however,the judge announced that he would grant milgram motion for partial summary judgment against the plan in the principal amount.though no summary judgment order had yet been entered,milgram relinquished his equitable claims against the other defendants,believing,with good reason,that he had prevailed on his contract claim after these actions,the only issues remaining for trial were breen equitable defenses whether sedor was a fiduciary such that he could be held liable to the plan orthopedic and whether milgram was entitled to accumulated earnings and interest on the principal amount of the judgment.
the trial took place over several days in the summer of.shortly after it concluded,the district court executed an order the text of which was prepared jointly by attorneys for milgram and orthopedic granting milgram summary judgment against the plan in the principal amount that was erroneously transferred to breen.the court reserved decision as to whether milgram was also entitled to accumulated earnings and interest.in december,milgram moved to enforce the judgment.the plan opposed the motion,for the first time arguing that payment of the judgment would violate a specific erisa provision the statute prohibition on alienation of pension plan benefits.see erisa d,d.
the district court did not act on the motion until march,at which time it issued the written opinion that is the subject of this appeal.the district court held that milgram was entitled to recover accumulated earnings and interest,as well as the principal amount of his loss.it also recognized that its award of partial summary judgment in favor of milgram had been unenforceable because it had not been certified as final pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.accordingly,the court vacated the earlier award and entered a new judgment against the plan in the amount of the principal sum,plus accumulated earnings and interest on that amount.the court rejected the plan argument that erisa rule precluded enforcement of this judgment.addressing the other issues that had been left unresolved following the trial,the court found that sedor and bay ridge had no fiduciary duty to the plan or its participants and therefore dismissed all erisa claims against them.finally,the district court ordered breen to make restitution to the plan in the same amount that it awarded milgram.breen was directed to make the payment within thirty days or risk having a constructive trust placed on any funds in her possession that could be traced to the erroneous transfer.
the plan subsequently moved to prohibit enforcement of the district court award in favor of milgram,reasserting its claim that requiring payment of the award before the plan recovered from breen would violate erisa provisions.the plan also argued,apparently for the first time,that it was entitled to relief from the judgement under and and federal rule of civil procedure b.milgram opposed the motion and for the court to reinstate the equitable claims he had released on the eve of the bench trial.the district court rejected both motions and issued a writ of execution against the plan in august.the plan appeals both from that order and from the district court march decision.
discussion 
plan liability and erisa anti alienation provision 
erisa provides that a n employee benefit plan may sue or be sued under this subchapter as an entity and that any resulting money judgment shall be enforceable only against the plan.erisa d,d.the supreme court has recognized that this language clearly contemplates the enforcement of money judgments against benefit plans.mackey lanier collection agency.although mackey concerned a welfare benefit plan rather than a defined contribution pension plan like the one at issue in this case,the plain language of section does not distinguish between types of plans.the text of the statute thus appears to make clear that erisa permits milgram both to sue the plan for its misapplication of his funds and to seek enforcement of the resulting award against plan assets.
nonetheless,the plan asks us to read an exception into the unqualified language of section.although implicitly acknowledging that the sue or be sued language applies on its face to all plans,the plan argues that distinctions between types of plans that are drawn in other sections of the statute operate to constrain the remedial authority of the district court in proceedings under section.
the starting point for this argument is erisa provision,which applies only to pension plans.erisa d mandates that a pension plan governed by the statute shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.d.the internal revenue code likewise conditions preferential tax treatment on a pension plan prohibiting alienation and assignment of participant benefits.see a a.in conformity with these requirements,section of the plan at issue here provides 
subject to the exceptions provided below,no benefit which shall be payable to any person including a participant or his beneficiary shall be subject in any manner to anticipation,alienation,sale,transfer,assignment,pledge,encumbrance,or charge 
the plan argues that,although mackey unqualified assertion that money judgments may be enforced against plan assets may have been a correct statement of the law with regard to welfare benefit plans,when the plan being sued is a pension plan,limitations like those in section and the provisions of federal law that mandate their inclusion in the document require a more nuanced approach.
the plan does not dispute that under certain circumstances a defined contribution pension plan may be subject to a money judgment under section.rather it argues that,in this particular case,the district court erred by requiring the plan to make good on its debt to milgram before it had recovered the equivalent funds from breen.that is because,in the plan view,all of the assets currently held in the plan constitute benefits allocated to plan participants other than milgram or breen.therefore,the plan argues,the provisions of erisa,the irc,and the plan document prohibit those funds from being used to satisfy the district court judgment.we disagree both because undistributed funds held in trust for the members of a defined contribution pension plan do not constitute benefits within the meaning of the provisions,and because the rule does not prevent pension plan assets from being used to satisfy a judicial judgment that has been entered against the plan itself.
as to the first point,the plan takes its definition of benefits from section of the plan document,which provides that,upon retirement,a plan participant is entitled to collect all amounts credited to such participant combined account.elsewhere,the participant combined account is defined as the account established and maintained by the administrator for each participant with respect to his total interest under the plan resulting from the employer contributions.see plan document.reading these provisions together,the plan maintains that a participant inalienable benefit consists of all assets held by the plan that are attributed at any point to that participant,whether or not the participant is currently entitled to collect them.
but the plan argument proves too much.if it were true that,once credited to a particular participant account,plan funds become benefits whose alienation and assignment is prohibited by erisa,then the plan administrator would be prohibited from debiting participants accounts even to cover expenses that erisa and the plan specifically contemplate they will bear.for example,in years in which the trust corpus suffers an investment loss,section c of the plan document requires the administrator to debit each participant account in the same proportion that each participant and former participant nonsegregated accounts bear to the total of all participants and former participants nonsegregated accounts.similarly,section d provides that participants accounts shall be debited for any insurance or annuity premiums paid,and erisa a a ii authorizes the plan administrator to use pension assets to defray reasonable expenses of administering the plan,a a ii pension and welfare benefits,advisory opinion.
moreover,the plan reading of the plan document is highly selective.section,from which the plan draws its definition of benefits,is entitled determination of benefits upon retirement and clearly states that the relevant calculations are to be performed u pon the plan participant normal retirement date or early retirement date.plan assets therefore become benefits only when they are finally distributed to the participant at the time of retirement.indeed,prior to that point,a participant can not truly be said to have a claim to any particular assets in the trust corpus.a defined contribution plan is not merely a collection of unrelated accounts.la rue,at thomas,concurring.rather,all of the plan undistributed assets are legally owned by the trustee and managed for the benefit of all plan participants,with gains and losses shared by them on a pro rata basis.a single participant account is merely a bookkeeping entry that is used at the time of his retirement to determine what benefits he is entitled to receive.see see also arlington trust,cir distinguishing between trust corpus and benefits to conclude that erisa provision does not prevent a creditor of the plan from garnishing pension trust funds.
in this regard,it is significant that each of the cases that the plan cites to support its argument concerns an effort to levy against pension income already being received by plan members.thus,in guidry sheet metal workers national pension fund,the supreme court cited erisa provision in refusing to allow a union that guidry had defrauded to satisfy its judgment against him by garnishing current pension income.and,in kickham hanley kodak retirement income plan,this court refused,on grounds,to permit the withholding of attorney fees from pension plan benefit payments to which the plan participants were presently entitled,cir.
nor do these cases support the plan claim that if undistributed account funds could be considered benefits,their use to satisfy a judgment against the plan would be prohibited.both guidry and kickham hanley concerned a creditor efforts to levy on pension assets to satisfy obligations that had allegedly been incurred directly or indirectly by pensioners themselves.neither case stands for the proposition that erisa provision would prevent the attachment of pension assets in order to satisfy the debts of the plan.indeed,the structure of the statute strongly suggests a distinction between using plan assets to satisfy the debts of the plan and using plan assets to satisfy debts of plan participants.erisa d outlines several carefully circumscribed exceptions to its general prohibition on the alienation or assignment of pension benefits.see d.each of these exceptions addresses restrictions that the provision places on pension beneficiaries no mention is made of similar restraints on plan administrators,at making a similar point.treasury department regulations that interpret the corresponding provisions of the internal revenue code tell a similar story.see a c in short,we find no authority statutory or decisional to support the argument that erisa prohibition on alienation impairs a plan ability to pay its own debts 
the plan argues,however,that the absence of authority in support of its position should not end our inquiry.it notes that the alienation issue it identifies is particular to defined contribution pension plans,which,until relatively recently,were far less popular and therefore far less likely to be the subject of litigation than defined benefit plans.see larue,at see also edward zelinsky,the defined contribution paradigm,yale,discussing the significant reversal of historic patterns under which the traditional defined benefit plan was the dominant paradigm for the provision of retirement income.the plan maintains that a close examination of the distinctions between defined contribution and defined benefit plans compels the conclusion that enforcement of a judgment against the former poses problems that enforcement against the latter does not.it suggests that our failure to recognize those dangers in previous cases is not because they do not exist,but because the historical dominance of defined benefit plans has prevented the issue from being litigated previously.the argument is unpersuasive.
the plan is correct that the two types of pension plans differ in important respects.defined benefit plans promise participants a specified,periodic benefit at retirement.although the investment pool from which those benefits are drawn may be funded in various ways,the employer typically bears the risk associated with operating the plan and must cover any shortfall.see hughes aircraft jacobson.in contrast,in a defined contribution plan,the employer contributes a fixed sum on a periodic basis.the employee benefits on retirement are a function of the contributions his own and those of his employer that have been credited to his account,and any income,expenses,gains and losses,and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants which may be allocated to such participant account.erisa.under such plans,by definition,there can never be an insufficiency of funds in the plan to cover promised benefits,since each beneficiary is entitled to whatever assets are dedicated to his individual account.hughes,at internal citation,quotation marks and brackets omitted.
a consequence of these distinctions is that,whereas satisfaction of a judgment from the corpus of a defined benefit plan may not affect individual participant benefits in the case of a defined contribution plan,it will almost certainly do so,since the employer is under no ongoing obligation to fund the plan to maintain benefits at a set level.the plan argues that imposing these costs on pension beneficiaries undercuts erisa policy goals and violates the provision.yet it is the distinctive feature of defined contribution plans that they require the employee rather than the employer to bear the pension risks associated with investment instability,underfunding,beneficiary longevity and,indeed,litigation.see zelinsky,supra,at.by design,participants in a defined contribution plan bear the risk that the value of their accounts will be reduced as a result of actions taken by the plan administrator just as the provision does not protect participants against poor investment decisions by the plan administrator it does not protect them against the risk that poor management decisions will expose the plan assets to liability.
contrary to the plan suggestion,then,the relative novelty of defined contribution plans does not explain our failure heretofore to recognize limits on the litigation risk that participants in such a plan can be required to bear on the plan behalf.rather,it is the fact that defined contribution plans eschew any such limitation that is,at least in part,responsible for their increasing prevalence.see id.
ii.the plan other arguments against enforceability 
in its attempt to avoid enforcement of the district court judgment,the plan also relies on several other provisions of the plan document,erisa,and new york state law that,it argues,prohibit milgram from recovering from the plan before the plan has recouped the funds that it erroneously disbursed to breen.these arguments are no more persuasive than the plan argument.
for example,section of the plan document reads,except as provided below and otherwise specifically permitted by law,it shall be impossible for any part of the corpus or income to be used for,or diverted to,purposes other than the exclusive benefit of participants,retired participants,or their beneficiaries.the plan suggests that the use of plan funds to compensate milgram for the plan misapplication of funds from his account would contravene this provision.that argument,however,ignores both the fact that milgram himself is a retired participant and that,under erisa d,the enforcement of a money judgment against plan assets is specifically permitted by law.see mackey,at.
the plan further objects that to permit enforcement of the judgment would require orthopedic,as plan administrator,to violate its fiduciary duties under the statute.erisa requires the plan administrator to discharge its duties solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,but it defines defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan to be a purpose consistent with that duty.see erisa a a ii,a a ii.although the plan maintains that the cost of compensating milgram does not constitute a reasonable expense within the meaning of the statute,the authority that it cites,an advisory opinion published by the pension and welfare benefits administration,see advisory opinion,addresses a situation entirely different from the one that we confront here.to the extent that the opinion is relevant to this case as all,its assertion that as a general rule,reasonable expenses of administering a plan include direct expenses properly and actually incurred in the performance of a fiduciary duties to the plan,cuts against the plan argument.we have little trouble concluding that the payment of a judicial judgment that the plan is required by law to satisfy,in favor of a plan beneficiary whose rights have been violated by the plan,is an expense that the administrator would properly and actually incur in the performance of its duties.indeed,it could well be argued that it is the failure to pay milgram the money to which he is entitled as a plan participant that would violate the administrator fiduciary duties.
this conclusion also answers the plan claim that withdrawing plan assets to pay the judgment would constitute a prohibited transaction under erisa b,b.that section prohibits an erisa fiduciary from deal ing with the assets of the plan in his own interest or for his own account.the plan argues that if orthopedic were to use plan assets to satisfy the judgment it would be acting in its own interest,since milgram also had a claim against orthopedic for its misconduct as plan administrator.but,as we noted above,the plan is under a legal duty to reimburse milgram.orthopedic payment of the judgment is therefore a ministerial function,not a discretionary one to which fiduciary liability might attach.see harris trust and sav.bank.john hancock mut.life ins,cir.
the plan also maintains that permitting recovery against plan assets would run afoul of erisa directive that a money judgment against an employee benefit plan shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in his individual capacity.erisa d,d.in the plan view,the district court judgment is effectively a prohibited judgment against plan members,because it is their individual retirement accounts that will suffer.while enforcement of the judgment may cause current plan participants to receive less generous pension benefits than they otherwise might have received,that does not change the fact that,as a matter of law,milgram seeks enforcement against the plan rather than against any of the participants individually.moreover,because each participant potential loss on a judgment against the plan is capped at the balance of his individual account,suing the plan is not the economic or legal equivalent to suing the participants directly.
finally,the plan argues that the district court erred in refusing to suspend enforcement of the judgment pursuant to either n.and or federal rule of civil procedure b.but and are state procedural rules they provide no substantive rights and therefore have no relevance to this proceeding in federal court.in contrast,rule b is a federal rule that permits the d
