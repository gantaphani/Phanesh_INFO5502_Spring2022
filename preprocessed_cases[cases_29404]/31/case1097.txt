factual and procedural background 
lunde electric company pension plan 
until,when it ceased operations,lunde electric company lunde electric or the company of seattle,washington,was in the business of maritime electrical repair.sigmund eriksen sigmund served as lunde electric chairman,and his son raymond eriksen raymond was president and chief executive officer.
sigmund purchased lunde electric in.in,the company established the lunde electric,profit sharing plan the plan to provide retirement benefits for its union employees.sigmund and raymond served as the plan trustees.initially,lunde electric was the sole financial contributor to the plan,and the plan assets were held in a brokerage account at a local bank the plan account.from until the,earl sommerfeld served as the plan bookkeeper.in,earl son,brad sommerfeld,assumed those responsibilities.
the plan was amended in and the plan.the government and defendants sharply disagree as to whether the plan was subsequently amended.according to the government,the plan was again amended in and then restated in.defendants contend that there is no evidence of either event.
a.the amendment and restatement 
according to the government,article iv of the plan,titled contribution and allocation,was amended in to add a k feature the amendment.the amendment replaced contributions made exclusively by the company with a system whereby plan participants contributed a percentage of their elective deferrals into the plan.lunde would then match fifty percent of each participant elective deferral with an employer contribution.funds in the plan account were pooled and administered by the eriksens.
according to the government,when the eriksens added the k feature,they did not redraft the plan instead,only article iv of the plan was amended.as evidence of this change,the government introduced two versions of the plan.in the first version,which the government proffered as the original plan,article iv refers only to discretionary employer contribution s for each plan year,the employer shall contribute to the plan such amount as shall be determined by the employer.however,in the second document,article iv sets forth procedures for a participant salary reduction election.article of that document provides,inter alia,that e ach participant may elect to defer his compensation which would have been received in the plan year,but for the deferral election,by up to percent.in addition to the documentary evidence,the government presented testimony that the plan was amended in.for instance,the plan stockbroker testified that new trust certification papers were filed with the plan brokerage firm in.
on january,the plan was restated and a new document titled lunde electric company,k profit sharing plan became operative the restatement.although the date of the plan effectiveness was not written in one space provided in the document,several documents signed and dated by sigmund and raymond contained information about the restatement effective date.these included a consent to corporate authorization,which resolved that the form amended k profit sharing plan and trust effective january,presented to this meeting is hereby approved and adopted.additionally,the restatement included a supplemental participation agreement dated january,and signed by raymond as participating employer and by both raymond and sigmund as trustees.this document also referred to a k plan.
missing remittances to the plan account 
in,lunde electric began experiencing financial difficulties and was unable to pay its operating expenses with revenues.the government alleged that,as a result of these financial problems,the eriksens caused the company to stop remitting elective deferrals to the plan.
brad sommerfeld regularly reviewed the trust brokerage statements as part of his responsibilities as plan accountant.those statements reflected deposits into and withdrawals from the plan account.sommerfeld noticed that regular deposits into the plan account were no longer made after october.indeed,the only deposit made to the plan account for the plan year was for,on december.although money continued to be withheld from participants paychecks,no deposits were made into the plan account in,in,or from january through march.
from to,lunde electric employed three different halcomb to,brad mansker may to december,and toni wunsch december to.both halcomb and mansker testified that they would meet with the eriksens on a regular basis to decide which bills to pay.according to mansker,within a few months of his starting work at the company,he learned that elective deferrals were not being remitted to the plan.mansker testified that he raised the issue of the outstanding liability on several occasions,but that the eriksens did not direct the company to make payments to the plan during his tenure.moreover,starting in,employees elective deferrals were shown as receivables on the plan balance sheet and reflected as a liability on lunde electric books.from to december,the plan account receivables grew from to.by,the receivables had increased to from to,the receivables ballooned from of the plan assets to.
on december,the eriksens participated in a conference call with attorney ronald braley.defendants asked braley about the consequences of not funding k trust accounts.braley informed the eriksens that they could be personally liable as fiduciaries and,in his own words,informed them that while the department of labor usually does not take a keen interest in plans with fewer than,if an employee knew about it and complained to the department of labor,that an investigation may open up and they would have a more serious issue.during the conference call,braley emphasized that the eriksens had to pay the unfunded liability as soon as possible.thereafter,braley memorialized the conversation in an email he transmitted to the eriksens.that email reads,in part apparently,for the past year and one half,they have failed to contribute to the k plan after taking elective deferrals from employees.
on may,brad sommerfeld wrote to bookkeeper toni wunsch concerning the company accounting 
as you know the company is significantly behind in depositing its contributions.this is a huge problem because most of the money comes from employees paychecks and the officers of the company and trustees of the plan have a fiduciary responsibility to deposit these funds timely deposits are due monthly.this is possibly the worst liability to fall behind on in terms of legal and tax problems.
sommerfeld testified that he also had a conversation with sigmund about the plan delinquency and that sigmund stated,we doing the best we can.
lunde electric tax filings 
after,lunde electric began providing yearly participant valuation reports to employees enrolled in the k plan.these reports purported to show each participant assets in the plan and contributions made for the prior plan year.the valuation reports were prepared by brad sommerfeld and signed by raymond.until,a statement of net assets,which detailed the total plan assets,was also delivered to each participant.after the plan year,lunde electric ceased providing statements of net assets when it delivered copies of valuation reports to participants.nevertheless,sommerfeld continued to prepare statements of net assets for those years,which he provided to the eriksens.
lunde electric filed certain documents with the internal revenue service irs,including a form,in connection with its operation of the plan.form,titled,annual of employee benefit plan,details contributions made to an erisa fund.brad sommerfeld prepared the form each year,and either raymond or sigmund,as plan administrators,signed the document before submitting it to the irs.
among other questions,form asks was there a failure to transmit to the plan any participant contributions within the time period described in code of federal regulations the reference to the code of federal regulations is to an erisa regulation titled definition of plan assets participant contributions the plan asset regulation,which provides 
a general rule.for purposes of subtitle a and parts and of subtitle b of title i of erisa and section of the internal revenue code only but without any implication for and may not be relied upon to bar criminal prosecutions under,the assets of the plan include amounts other than union dues that a participant or beneficiary pays to an employer,or amounts that a participant has withheld from his wages by an employer,for contribution or repayment of a participant loan to the plan,as of the earliest date on which such contributions or repayments can reasonably be segregated from the employer general assets.
b maximum time period for pension benefit plans.
i n no event shall the date determined pursuant to paragraph a of this section occur later than the business day of the month following the month in which the participant contribution or participant loan repayment amounts are received by the employer in the case of amounts that a participant or beneficiary pays to an employer or the business day of the month following the month in which such amounts would otherwise have been payable to the participant in cash in the case of amounts withheld by an employer from a participant wages.
a,b.for the,and tax years,the form filed by lunde electric indicated that all participant contributions had been transmitted.sommerfeld testified that this was not true and that he had falsified the three forms because 
the answer yes is a flag to the internal revenue service that the plan is delinquent or behind on their contributions.and that would result in either an irs audit or a department of labor investigation.and i was afraid that i would be blamed for blowing the whistle or causing either one of those actions to take place and cause harm to the company.
department of labor investigation and indictment 
in early,bookkeeper wunsch discussed her concerns about the k plan with the eriksens.thereafter,wunsch contacted the department of labor dol and met with an investigator.in march,the dol issued a grand jury subpoena to lunde electric.after the april subpoena was served,lunde electric resumed remitting elective deferrals to the plan.by october,lunde electric had lowered its outstanding obligations to the plan from approximately to.when lunde electric ceased operations in april,all plan participants received their full k distribution.
in,based on the events detailed supra,sigmund and raymond were indicted on one count of conspiracy to embezzle from an erisa employee plan,in violation of count seventeen counts of embezzlement or conversion from an erisa employee benefit plan,in violation of and counts,and three counts of making false or misleading statements in an erisa benefit plan document that federal law requires to be kept,in violation of and counts.
ii.trial and sentencing 
the eriksens jury trial commenced on october.raymond testified that he did not play a role in preparing any of the plan documents and that he did not remember signing the amendment establishing the k.according to raymond,neither he nor sigmund was involved in the preparation or review of the valuation reports,the form,or the plan statements of net assets.raymond testified that he was unaware that employee elective deferrals were not being forwarded to the plan account in,and.however,raymond acknowledged making personal contributions to the k starting in october.
at trial,the eriksens presented the testimony of william whitman,an expert witness on erisa issues.although whitman testified that there are no hard deadlines for when an employer must contribute the employer portion of a k plan,he did not testify about when an employer must remit employee contributions.according to whitman,an amendment to an erisa plan must be in writing and executed by a corporate officer and the plan trustees.
the jury returned identical verdicts for both defendants,convicting them on counts and,for failing to remit elective deferrals from december and march paychecks.the jury also convicted defendants on count,which concerned making a false statement in the valuation report.the jury deadlocked on counts through and and acquitted defendants on counts through and.defendants moved for judgments of acquittal,which the district court denied in an order dated november.
the district court sentenced both defendants to two years of probation,a fine,hours of community service,and the mandatory special assessment of.defendants timely appeal.
discussion 
defendants seek to overturn the jury verdict on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence of criminal intent or that lunde electric established the k plan,and that the government improperly referred to the plan asset regulation at trial.we are not persuaded.
embezzlement or conversion of the elective deferrals 
scope of the offense 
defendants were convicted under for embezzling or converting the plan assets in december and march.section provides 
any person who embezzles,steals,or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use or to the use of another,any of the moneys,funds,securities,premiums,credits,property,or other assets of any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan,or of any fund connected therewith,shall be fined under this title,or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
as used in this section,the term any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan means any employee benefit plan subject to any provision of title i of the employee retirement income security act of.
we have held that the operative terms embezzles and converts are to be given their meanings.united states andreen,cir woxberg united states,cir.thus,e mbezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of property by a person to whom such property has been entrusted,or into whose hands it has lawfully come.woxberg,at see also andreen,at citing united states dupee,cir.conversion encompasses the use of property,placed in one custody for a limited purpose,in an unauthorized manner or to an unauthorized extent.andreen,at citing morissette united states.
we have also recognized that does more than recapitulate offenses.because and other laws,see,c prohibiting embezzlement from a labor organization fund,are aimed at preserv ing welfare and pension funds for the protection of those entitled to their benefits,we have held that imposes liability for a broad class of unauthorized acts willfully committed by those in a fiduciary or advisory capacity.see andreen,at,examining the legislative history of.as kennedy explained 
the essence of the crime is theft and in the context of union funds or pension plans the offense includes a taking or appropriation that is unauthorized,if accomplished with specific criminal intent.in this respect lack of authorization may be shown if the diversion is substantially inconsistent with the fiduciary purposes and objectives of the union funds or pension plan,as set forth by statutes,bylaws,charters,or trust documents which govern uses of the funds in question.whatever imprecision attends this definition is remedied substantially by the requirement of scienter,which is an essential element of the crime.the act to be criminal must be willful,which means an act done with a fraudulent intent or a bad purpose or an evil motive.
id.at emphasis added citation omitted.
we have consistently declined invitations to engraft additional elements onto,or create affirmative defenses for,violations.in andreen,we rejected the participant benefit theory by holding that so long as a fiduciary used plan assets in an unauthorized manner,the lack of benefit to the plan beneficiaries is not an element of the offense required to be shown as part of the prosecution case.id.at.likewise,the conferring of any benefit in such a case is not a defense,except insofar as it may bear upon the defendant state of mind in committing the acts in question.id.at.we thus rejected the appeal of an attorney who had assisted the trustees of a pension plan in drafting an unauthorized compensation plan that rewarded the trustees for merely executing their fiduciary duties.id.at.we reasoned that the attorney attendance at trustee meetings where the compensation plan was discussed,coupled with his knowledge that the plan was unauthorized,was sufficient to show that he aided and abetted a violation of.id.at.
in united states ford,a companion case to andreen,we affirmed the convictions of the trustees whom andreen had assisted.cir,overruled on other grounds,as recognized in united states miller,cir.in reviewing a challenge,we highlighted repeatedly certain circumstantial facts that showed the trustees awareness that their behavior was not authorized by the trusts that the trustees were offering themselves benefits from the trust at a lower cost than was available to beneficiaries.id.at.
in two related appeals,united states mett,cir,and united states wiseman,cir,we again disavowed a defense and further held that fiduciaries could not be implicitly authorized to use assets in a manner that jeopardizes their availability for the beneficiaries.mett,at.mett and wiseman were separate appeals of the same underlying prosecution against two executives of an art gallery who withdrew million from a pension plan to finance their floundering enterprise.id.at.mett,the gallery president,and wiseman,the,served as the trustees of two pension benefit plans.id.at.after being indicted for felony art fraud,their gallery fell on hard times,and the trustees withdrew money from pension plans and deposited it into the company general operating account without informing the.id.at.while mett and wiseman admitted making the withdrawals,they sought to avoid liability by characterizing their appropriations as implicitly authorized loans necessary for the business to survive.id.at.this implied authorization was founded on the premise that,because the gallery would have had to be closed and the would otherwise have been laid off and faced with unemployment,the acts were not criminal.
we rejected the implied authorization defense based on a fiduciary purported intention to serve the broader interests of employee welfare.id.at.because erisa funds are protected so that they will be available at retirement and are therefore subject to numerous observed that an authorization argument was illogical.after all,if the beneficiaries themselves are not at liberty to dispose of the funds for a purpose other than retirement,they could not lawfully authorize someone else to do it for them.id.at i t is little different from arguing that complete strangers authorized the illicit transactions.
following retrial in light of other errors,the mett defendants returned to us in united states wiseman,claiming that the district court had committed new errors by not giving a instruction or an instruction that the government had to show the defendants were not borrowing from the pension.at.we rejected both contentions.with respect to the argument,we held that,although the defendant must knowingly act wrongfully to deprive another of property,there is no requirement that the defendant also know his conduct was illegal.id.at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.we likewise rejected the gallery executives borrowing defense.id.at.we stated that evidence of borrowing,or for that matter evidence of intent to repay,is relevant to criminal intent,but that i ntent to repay generally is not a defense to embezzlement or conversion.id.citing united states ross,cir see also united states thordarson,cir.
sufficiency of the evidence 
the jury convicted defendants of two crimes counts and.count concerned of employee elective deferrals withheld in december.count involved in deferrals from march.the district court gave the same jury instruction for both of these counts,requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt that 
first,the lunde electric company k plan was established or maintained as an employee pension benefit plan subject to title i of the erisa and 
second,the defendant either 
a embezzled or stole funds of the plan or 
b unlawfully and willfully abstracted or converted funds of the plan to his own use or the use of another.
the district court defined embezzled,stole,converted,and abstracted.
defendants contend that there was insufficient evidence to support these elements.evidence is sufficient for conviction if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states bush,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in a motion for a directed verdict,defendants asserted that the government had not established the existence of the plan and thus claimed that any deferrals withheld were actually discretionary employer contributions.this argument was not renewed in defendants.motion.defendants also assert that the failure to remit elective deferrals within the time frame established by the dol plan asset regulation,b,is not tantamount to embezzlement or conversion and that the government references to the plan asset regulation were prejudicial.because defendants rule motion regarding counts and was limited to an argument about mens rea,our review is for plain error.united states,cir w e interpret rule a to suggest that failure to renew the motion at the end of trial does not mean that it has been waived,but only that a higher standard of review is to be imposed.we may review an unrenewed motion for judgment of acquittal,but only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice,or for plain error.
establishment of the lunde electric k plan 
defendants assert that there was insufficient proof that the plan contained a k feature.they argue that all erisa plans contain an amendment procedure and that t hese procedures,once set forth in a benefit plan,constrain the employer from amending the plan by other means.winterrowd am.annuity ins.co,cir citing schoonejongen.according to defendants theory,the government had to introduce a properly executed version of the amendment.because the government does not have such a document,defendants argue,the elective deferrals were actually discretionary employer contributions that do not become plan assets until they are remitted to the plan.defendants argument regarding the validity of the amendment is a red herring.defendants were convicted only for their failure to remit deferrals after the restatement.even though the form submitted to the irs by lunde electric,the testimony of brad sommerfeld,and the email by attorney braley all indicated that the k plan existed before,because counts and concerned conduct that occurred after the plan restatement,we need only consider that document.the eriksens do not dispute that the plan was governed by title i of erisa,but contend that the evidence did not allow the conclusion that the plan was thereafter amended or restated.
generally,whether a plan is subject to title i of erisa is an issue of fact to be decided by the jury,guided by applicable legal principles.united states wofford,cir citing united states helbling,cir.the amendment procedures for any erisa benefit plan must be specified by the employer and identify the persons with the authority to amend.winterrowd,at citing b.here,the plan,at section,specified that amending the plan shall only be by the written action of each and every participating employer and with the consent of the trustee where such consent is necessary.to show such an amendment occurred by at least,the government introduced a written copy of the restatement,which included a k provision and was signed by raymond as employer and trustee and by sigmund as trustee.the government also introduced addenda ref
