discussion 
the merits 
mcdonald sued the pension plan of the pension trust fund and its trustees collectively,ptf in august of,based on a belief that his pension calculations failed to reflect years during which he had accrued benefits.mcdonald pension plan of the pension trust fund,cir mcdonald iv.this court vindicated mcdonald belief by affirming a decision of the district court buchwald,which invalidated a plan provision that permitted the ptf to disregard years of service rendered prior to a break in service that occurred before the passage of erisa.mcdonald iv,at citing et.specifically,we agreed with the district court that erisa,trumps the plan provision.id.citing mcdonald pension plan of the pension trust fund,d,mcdonald i.nevertheless,we remanded the case for further fact finding based on ptf argument that,had it known its provision would be invalidated,the plan would not have defined a year of service as service in excess of hours per year,but rather would have used a higher minimum number,such as the description of a year of service under erisa a a,a a.see mcdonald pension plan of the pension trust fund,civ.pkc,wl,at,mcdonald v.as we said in mcdonald iv we are concerned with the effects of nullifying the plan provision with regard to benefit accrual and leaving the plan year of credited service definition to stand on its own,when under the terms of erisa itself the ptf was not required to recognize any of mcdonald service.at,quoted in mcdonald v,wl,at.although ptf argument gave this court pause sufficient to require a remand based on the record then before us,and despite the fact that we had otherwise affirmed mcdonald victory in the district court,we are now confident that had we known in mcdonald iv what we now know as a result of facts disclosed on remand in mcdonald v,we would not have remanded in the first place.the district court first learned on remand that although the parties had been under the assumption that the plan was the plan that applied to mcdonald service there was in fact a plan,which the parties do not dispute was the plan that was in play.see mcdonald v,wl,at.
it is the difference between the two plans that conclusively resolves the issue that troubled us in mcdonald iv.the plan required a longshoreman,like mcdonald,to have worked a continuous period of not less than years.art.iii,c of the plan emphasis added.it was the continuous service requirement that spawned this litigation by implicating the plan provision,and thereby excluding thirteen of mcdonald years of service.of course,we invalidated the plan provision in mcdonald iv,but as mentioned above,we remanded because of ptf argument that it would never have defined a year of service as hours in the absence of the provision.
in contrast to the plan,the plan added an alternate method of eligibility that did not require continuous service,but rather allowed a longshoreman to be eligible when his employment in the industry reached a total period of years as defined by the plan,art.iii,c ii of the plan emphasis added,no matter how long it took to accumulate the years.therefore,while the plan still retained the definition of a year of service,it provided an alternate way for employees to accumulate the required years without implicating the provision.ptf takes issue with the district court reference to the plan,because,based on a requirement not relevant here,mcdonald could not have satisfied the alternative total service provision.but it does not matter that mcdonald would not have satisfied the new alternative provision.the mere existence of an alternative that still defined a year of credited service at hours,yet allowed for eligibility without continuous service and its attendant and now invalid provision,undercuts completely ptf argument when it last came before this court that it would have jettisoned the definition in the absence of the provision.
in light of the foregoing,we affirm the district court application of the ptf plan provisions to mcdonald work history.we also affirm the injunctive relief ordered by the court,which directed ptf to reform its plan provisions in accordance with judge buchwald judgment dated october.apart from this measure of equitable relief,we agree with the district court that no further modification of the plan is necessary.we have considered the parties remaining arguments,including ptf argument pursuant to firestone tire rubber bruch,d,and we find them to be without merit.accordingly,the district court march,order and judgment on the merits of this appeal is affirmed.
the fee awards 
each of the two district court judges in this case issued attorney fee awards for work done by pauk,mcdonald attorney the first fee award was made by judge buchwald following the resolution of initial district court proceedings.see mcdonald pension plan of the pension trust fund,civ.nrb,wl,mcdonald ii.after resolution of the case on remand from this court,judge castel entered the second fee award on july,following a hearing during which the district court discussed its reasoning.we find that the first fee award was not erroneous,but that the district court did err in its calculation of the second fee award.
