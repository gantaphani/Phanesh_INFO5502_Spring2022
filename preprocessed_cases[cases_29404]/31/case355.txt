opinion of the court 
this case is a of corporate america recent effort to curb costs by,inter alia,scaling back the benefits provided under pension plans.john depenbrock depenbrock claims that his employer,cigna corporation cigna,violated the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,by denying him benefits without the required notice and lawful amendment to the pension plan.depenbrock also alleges that cigna violated erisa by failing to provide him an opportunity to review pertinent documents relating to his claim,and by breaching the fiduciary duty owed as plan administrator.
the district court granted cigna motion for summary judgment and denied depenbrock cross motions.we reverse the summary judgment in favor of cigna and remand with directions to enter summary judgment for depenbrock.
in,depenbrock began working at cigna.at that time,cigna provided its employees with a generous traditional pension plan on november,presumably to cut costs,cigna proposed amendments to its plan that were to become effective january.according to the amendments,younger,employees were to be transferred to a more modest cash balance pension formula the new plan while as grandfather in under the traditional plan the old plan and receive higher benefits in addition,the proposed plan amendment included a rehire rule which stated that employees who left cigna and were after december,would not participate in the old plan upon return but instead would be transferred immediately into the new plan.for reasons unknown,cigna did not formally adopt the amendment and rehire rule until december,when cigna ceo executed a written adoption in accordance with the amendment procedure set forth in the plan.
on january,depenbrock resigned from cigna to work for another company.however,depenbrock was rehired at cigna on november.depenbrock claims that the pension rule in effect when he was rehired provided that he immediately resume participation under the old plan.depenbrock bases this assertion on the fact that the proposed amendment to cigna plan had not yet been formally adopted when he was rehired on november.because the formal adoption date came days after depenbrock returned to work,depenbrock asserts that the amendment does not apply to him.to hold otherwise,depenbrock argues,would amount to an impermissible retroactive reduction of his rights 
cigna counters that although the amendment was not formally adopted until december,the announcement of the proposed changes on november,coupled with the ceo conduct subsequent to the announcement,served to implement and retroactively ratify the amendment as of november.as such,cigna asserts that the effective date of the amendment was january,effective date specified in the internal announcement of the amendment.because depenbrock resigned from cigna on january,one day after the specified effective date of the rehire rule,cigna contends the rehire rule lawfully applies.
depenbrock filed suit against cigna in the eastern district of pennsylvania on december,for wrongful denial of erisa benefits,disclosure violations,and breach of fiduciary duty.during discovery,depenbrock moved to compel the production of documents that cigna claimed were protected by the privilege work product doctrine.the district court invited cigna to submit an ex parte memorandum in support of its claims.after conducting an in camera review,the district court denied depenbrock motion to compel without offering any explanation for its finding.the district court held oral argument on cross motions for summary judgment and on july,issued an opinion and order granting summary judgment to cigna.depenbrock timely appealed.

we review de novo the district court order granting cigna motion for summary judgment.bixler cent.teamsters health welfare fund,cir.motions for summary judgment must be granted if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c ryan by fed.express,cir.
depenbrock initially raised five issues on appeal whether the rehire rule was effective january,whether the plan amendment adopted december,can be given retroactive effect whether cigna complied with erisa notice and disclosure requirements whether depenbrock claim against cigna fails as a matter of law and whether the fiduciary exception to the privilege compels cigna to produce ostensibly privileged documents.disposition of the first two issues renders discussion of the remaining issues unnecessary.we therefore turn to the effective date of the amendment and analyze whether the amendment may be applied retroactively.
effective date of the amendment 
before turning to the merits,we first set forth some background on erisa.erisa does not create any substantive entitlement to welfare benefits.employers or other plan sponsors are generally free under erisa,for any reason at any time,to adopt,modify,or terminate welfare plans.schoonejongen,d see bellas cbs,cir erisa neither mandates the creation of pension plans nor in general dictates the benefits a plan must afford once created.however,erisa requires that all employee benefit plans be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,a ryan by,at.thus,t his section precludes oral or informal amendments to employee benefit plans.confer custom eng g,cir citing hozier midwest fasteners,cir.although the supreme court has established a de minimus standard for compliance with erisa,see,d,the plan must identify the person who has the authority to amend the plan,and amendments must be conducted according to formal procedures.w hatever level of specificity a company ultimately chooses,in an amendment procedure or elsewhere,it is bound to that level,at.thus,an amendment is ineffective if it is inconsistent with the governing instruments.delgrosso spang,cir see confer,at only a formal written amendment,executed in accordance with the plan own procedure for amendment,could change the plan.
as a threshold matter,depenbrock claims that cigna ceo lacked authority to amend the plan.alternatively,depenbrock contends that even if the ceo was authorized to amend the plan,he failed to comply with cigna own written amendment procedures so that the amendment was not effective until december,the date when cigna finally executed revised formal plan documents in accordance with the amendment procedure set forth in the plan.because the amendment effective date came days after depenbrock was rehired,depenbrock contends the adverse amendment does not apply to him.
cigna counters that its ceo was duly authorized to amend the plan and he did so pursuant to the doctrine of ratification.according to cigna,although the plan amendment was not formally adopted until december,the ceo approval on november,of a summary of the proposed cash balance pension formula and rehire rule,coupled with his subsequent conduct,effected a retroactive ratification of the plan amendment to be effective january.accordingly,cigna claims that the rehire rule was effective as of the date specified for the,applied to depenbrock because he resigned on january,one day after the alleged effective date of the rule.
we first address the ceo authority to amend.as a threshold determination,we agree with the district court that the ceo was authorized to amend the plan and adopt the rehire rule.section of the cigna plan specified three methods for amendment a resolution of the board of directors a resolution of the people resources committee of the board of directors prc or a written instrument approved and executed by one or more duly authorized officers of cigna.on july,the prc adopted a resolution authorizing the ceo to 
adopt amendments to the cigna pension plan to be effective january,or a later date if deemed appropriate by the ceo,as necessary or appropriate to c hange the plan current final average pay benefit accrual formula to a cash balance formula for all eligible participants under the plan exc
