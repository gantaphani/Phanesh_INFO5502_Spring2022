we review de novo questions of subject matter jurisdiction,including those relating to the propriety of removal.mayes rapoport,cir.the burden of demonstrating jurisdiction resides with the party seeking removal.mulcahey columbia organic chems,cir.we are obliged to narrowly interpret removal jurisdiction because the removal of proceedings from state courts raises significant federalism concerns.id.
on appeal,sonoco maintains that the district court erred in declining to remand this case to state court.specifically,it asserts that the court applied an incorrect legal standard in its preemption analysis and that,using the proper standard,remand is appropriate.php responds that,even if the court erred in its preemption analysis,the breach of contract claims are nonetheless completely preempted,and the motion to remand was properly denied.
before addressing whether the district court erred in denying the motion to remand,we briefly review the scope of removal jurisdiction generally,and with respect to erisa specifically.typically,an action initiated in a state court can be removed to federal court only if it might have been brought in federal court originally.darcangelo verizon communications,cir internal quotation marks omitted alternation in original.the federal courts possess original jurisdiction over,among other things,civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.generally,a cause of action arises under federal law only when the plaintiff complaint raises issues of federal law.metro.life ins.taylor,d.
in analyzing whether the district court erred in denying the motion to remand,we must first distinguish between ordinary preemption also known as conflict preemption and the jurisdictional doctrine of complete preemption.under ordinary or conflict preemption,state laws that conflict with federal laws are preempted,and preemption is asserted as a federal defense to the plaintiff suit.darcangelo,at quoting taylor,at.because conflict preemption constitutes a defense to a cause of action,the supreme court has recognized that it normally does not appear on the face of a complaint,and,therefore,does not authorize removal to federal court.id.quoting taylor,at.
the jurisdictional doctrine of complete preemption,by contrast,does provide a basis for federal jurisdiction where congress so completely preempt s a particular area that any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character,the state law claims are converted into federal claims,which may be removed to federal court.id.quoting taylor,at.alteration in original.as judge luttig recently observed in king marriott international,slip op.at cir,when complete preemption exists,the plaintiff simply has brought a mislabeled federal claim,which may be asserted under some federal statute.
in the erisa context,the doctrines of conflict preemption and complete preemption are important,and they are often confused.section of erisa defines the scope of erisa preemption of conflicting state laws state laws are superseded insofar as they relate to an erisa plan.a.the fact that a state law claim is preempted by,that it conflicts with erisa exclusive regulation of employee welfare benefit not,however,provide a basis for removing the claim to federal court.the only state law claims properly removable to federal court are those that are completely preempted by erisa civil enforcement provision,a darcangelo,at emphasizing that the civil enforcement provision completely preempts state law claims that come within its scope and converts these state claims into federal claims under see also taylor,at.same.
in denying sonoco motion to remand,the district court concluded that the breach of contract claims in the complaint relate to erisa,and that they were thus preempted pursuant to.order at.on the basis of this conclusion,the court justified its denial of the motion to remand and its assertion of federal jurisdiction over sonoco state law claims.contrary to this reasoning,however,conflict preemption under does not provide a basis for fe
