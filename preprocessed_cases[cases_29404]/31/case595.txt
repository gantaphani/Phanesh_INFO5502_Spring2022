from january until october,plaintiff cari ann hamilton worked at general motors planworks gm planworks,which provided advertising services solely to the general motors corporation.the advertising services involved creating,managing,and executing media plans to promote gm.an unrelated third party,general motors mediaworks mediaworks,was responsible for buying the media.
gm planworks is a division of defendant starcom mediavest group,which is a subsidiary of defendant leo burnett usa.leo burnett usa,in turn,is a subsidiary of publicis groupe sa.
hamilton began working at gm planworks in as an administrative assistant in detroit,michigan.in,she began suffering from fibrocystic breast disease,and on july,she took a medical leave of absence.she applied for disability benefits under the publicis groupe short term disability plan.
on august,hamilton application for benefits was denied.hamilton contacted the human resources office in detroit to assist with obtaining her benefits,and this led to some negative interactions.victoria kruslemsky,the detroit human resources director,advised hamilton to seek assistance from the company chicago personnel because they handled administration of benefits.
on november,hamilton medical leave ended.while hamilton had been out on leave,a temporary employee who filled in for hamilton was given her position.upon her return from leave,hamilton accepted a broadcast coordinator position in the gm planworks broadcast group,changing her work location from detroit to troy,michigan.during this transition,kruslemsky instructed a senior member of the management team to counsel hamilton to encourage her to view the change of locations as an opportunity to put any hard feelings she had against detroit personnel aside and move forward positively in a position that allowed her to learn new skills.as a broadcast coordinator,hamilton reviewed whether advertisements and other media that general motors mediaworks ordered from broadcast vendors was aired as ordered if not,she was to determine how to resolve the discrepancies.
on december,hamilton filed an erisa lawsuit the benefits suit against the publicis groupe short term disability plan seeking the benefits she was denied.
in may,gm announced that it would start using gm planworks,instead of mediaworks,for its media buying.an article from starcom mediavest group website described this change,which involved a billion account,as the biggest account switch in the history of advertising.the target date for this change was october,and it contributed to an increase in the number of gm planworks employees from roughly to people.gm planworks significantly reorganized its operations and determined that its broadcast media buyers should be located in new york city,the center of the national broadcast industry.additionally,gm planworks determined that the buyers should take on the responsibilities of the broadcast coordinators,such as resolving discrepancies in media orders.accordingly,broadcast coordinators,including hamilton,were to have their positions eliminated.hamilton learned this in july.
gm planworks took steps to provide replacement employment for hamilton and the other broadcast coordinators whose positions were eliminated.on september,kruslemsky sent an to the broadcast coordinators to clarify issues relating to the reorganization.gm planworks added a number of positions during the reorganization,but hamilton did not have experience.the explained that persons who did not find replacement employment with gm planworks would be terminated and would be eligible for severance and unemployment compensation.in september,hamilton interviewed for three positions at the reorganized gm planworks.
first,she interviewed with jeff hughes for an assistant buyer position.the assistant buyer was to provide assistance to media buyers and planners in detroit and new york.a knowledge of computer systems used for planning media was an important aspect of the position.hamilton was one of ten candidates interviewed.hughes selected another candidate for the position because the candidate had experience working in the group and had superior experience and knowledge of the requisite computer systems.at that time,hughes did not know that hamilton had brought her benefits suit against gm planworks or its related entities.
second,hamilton interviewed with lisa stearn for one of five open print coordinator positions.the print coordinators were to ensure that vendors were paid for general motors advertisements and to resolve discrepancies between the advertising ordered and the advertising delivered.stearn,along with two colleagues,also interviewed other broadcast coordinators from the troy office for the positions.stearn selected five other candidates for offers because each had performed functions for at least four years hamilton,by contrast,had been in the broadcast coordinator position for only one year.stearn relayed her choices to her managing director,mark rowlands,who approved offering each of these individuals the position.one candidate decided not to accept the offer.stearn then interviewed another candidate who also had multiple years of experience in a coordinator position.upon stearn recommendation,rowlands approved an offer to this new candidate.stearn affidavit does not mention whether or not she was aware of hamilton benefits suit.
third,hamilton interviewed with kelly malin for an interactive billing coordinator position.the person in this position was to coordinate billing and resolve discrepancies for digital media.malin selected another candidate for the position because of the candidate specific experience with coordinating digital media and her experience as a supervisor for gm planworks.at that time,malin did not know that hamilton had brought the benefits suit against gm planworks or its related entities.
hamilton employment ended on or about october.she was the only employee in the broadcast coordination department who desired,but was not offered,a reassignment.she ultimately prevailed in her benefits suit on september.
on november,hamilton filed a complaint against the defendants,alleging that they violated erisa,by terminating her in retaliation for exercising her right to claim disability benefits.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,concluding that hamilton failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,and,alternatively,she failed make the required showing that defendants proffered reason for firing reorganization and hiring of candidates with greater a pretext masking their retaliation against her.hamilton now appeals.
