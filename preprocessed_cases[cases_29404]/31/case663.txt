this appeal shows that the distinction between law and equity can still have consequences.the forms of action we have buried,maitland observed in a very different context,but they still rule us from their graves.
the plaintiff,a participant in a retirement plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,claimed that the plan administrator had acted improperly in using a mortality discount factor when calculating lump sum benefits.as a result,the plaintiff asserted,he was paid a benefit that fell short of what he was entitled to receive.invoking a of erisa,a and purporting to act on behalf of a class of approximately plan participants said to be similarly situated,the plaintiff brought suit against the plan and its administrator for what he described as equitable and injunctive relief.at the heart of the plaintiff prayer for relief was a request for recovery of additional lump sum benefits.
after a wave of motions had been filed,the district court entered an order granting class certification,granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff and the class,ordering a recalculation of lump sum benefits without the mortality discount,and requiring the defendants to immediately refund the 
for the district court to order the defendants to refund to pay the difference between the amount calculated without a mortality discount and the amount actually received was to grant a form of relief not typically available in equity.such relief,we conclude,was thus not available under the statutory provision on which the plaintiff elected to base his action.see life annuity ins.knudson,d,and mertens hewitt associates,d.
if we assume,for purposes of analysis,that the defendants had no discretion to use the mortality discount factor in making the benefit calculation,the fact remains that erisa a,which authorizes only suits for injunctive or other equitable relief,does not,in most situations,authorize an action for money claimed to be due and owing.an action in which the plaintiff complains that the defendant owes him money and has refused to pay the debt is,of course,the locus classicus of an action at law if we were to say that such an action qualifies as a suit in equity,we should be giving the words used by congress in a a meaning that and mertens teach they will not bear.the challenged judgment will therefore be reversed.
the individual plaintiff,frank crosby,was a participant in an erisa retirement plan administered by defendant bowater incorporated,the parent corporation of crosby sometime employer,great northern paper.before he reached his normal retirement age,but after his pension rights had vested,crosby lost his job as a result of great northern having been sold to another company.the termination of crosby employment accelerated his right to receive benefits under the retirement plan.
the bowater plan was of the cash balance variety,a species of the defined benefit genus.the plan gave crosby a hypothetical personal account,and his benefits were to be a function of the balance in that account.the balance reflected credits geared to crosby monthly compensation and a specified rate of interest.the personal account was nothing more than a computational construct,and benefits were to be paid from the plan general assets.
if crosby had been able to retire from great northern at age normal retirement age specified in the annuity would have been payable as long as he or his wife continued living.the amount of the annuity would have been determined by taking the balance in crosby personal account at age and dividing it by a prescribed annuity factor.and had crosby died before age while still employed by great northern,a death benefit would have been payable in an amount equal to the then present value of his accrued retirement benefit.
when crosby ceased to be an employee of great northern,not having retired or died on the job,he became eligible,under the terms of the plan,for a distribution of his retirement benefit.crosby,who was years old at the time,elected to take his distribution in a lump sum.
bowater,as plan administrator told crosby that the lump sum would be.that was the balance in crosby personal account.article xii of the plan provided that a participant accrued benefit could only be distributed in a form of payment selected by the participant from a list of options incorporated in of the plan.the second option,set forth in b,was a single lump sum payment equal to the amount credited to the participant personal account as of the end of the month preceding his benefit commencement date.
claiming that the relevant statutory law,as interpreted by the internal revenue service in irs notice irb,entitled him to receive more than the amount credited to his personal account,crosby asked bowater to recompute his lump sum by projecting interest credits to normal retirement age,dividing the resultant account balance by the annuity factor prescribed in the plan,and discounting the annuity to its present value.bowater acceded to this request,notwithstanding that the internal revenue service had approved the plan provision pegging the lump sum entitlement to the amount credited to the participant personal account.crosby was advised that his claim for a larger benefit had been granted and that his lump sum entitlement had been recalculated.the resulting figure was.we presume that this amount was paid in full.
in a detailed explanation of how it arrived at the,bowater told crosby,among other things,that it had used a mortality discount factor in its calculation.when it determined the present value of an annuity,in other words,bowater took into account the possibility that crosby might die before reaching the age at which he would be entitled to start receiving annuity payments.
crosby objected to the use of the mortality discount factor,filing an appeal with bowater in which he made the following argument 
this discount factor is not consistent with the calculation method described in irs notice.further,i believe this discount reduces my accrued benefit,and,thus,is not allowed under erisa.
bowater pension administration committee denied the appeal,issuing a explanation of its decision to do so.
crosby then sued the bowater plan and bowater incorporated in the united states district court for the western district of michigan.the complaint alleged,among other things,that when bowater discounted crosby annuity to present value,it should not have used a mortality discount for the period before normal retirement age that i f bowater had utilized the mortality discount factors for the period after normal retirement age only,crosby lump sum entitlement would have been instead of the produced by the method bowater in fact used and that bowater use of a mortality discount for the period before normal retirement age caused a partial forfeiture of crosby accrued benefit,thereby violating erisa a,a.
the complaint stated that crosby brought his claim under erisa a,a,and the enabling statute,erisa a,a.as noted above,crosby did not bring his claim under erisa a b the section that authorizes a party to sue for benefits due to him under the terms of his plan under the language of the plan,crosby was entitled to less than he had already been circumstance that explains the decision not to invoke a b 
the complaint alleged that approximately plan participants or beneficiaries were in the same boat as,they were victims of bowater insistence on use of a mortality discount factor for the period before normal retirement age.joinder of such a large number of individuals was said to be impracticable,and the complaint stated that crosby seeks both equitable and injunctive relief for the class,as permitted under erisa a.
the complaint prayer for relief asked the court to enter a judgment ordering the defendants to r any and all lump sum benefits previously paid,using the methodology followed in the recomputation of crosby lump sum entitlement but without any mortality discount for the period before normal retirement age.the court was further asked to order the defendants to p ay all plan participants or their beneficiaries who previously received a lump sum distribution the difference between the amount so computed and the lump sum amount the participant or beneficiary received from the plan,plus and interest on this amount to e njoin defendants from utilizing a mortality discount for the period before normal retirement age when computing a lump sum distribution from the plan in the future and to order the defendants to p ay reasonable attorney fees and costs the prayer for relief also included a request that the court impose a constructive trust over the amount of plan assets necessary to pay the amounts determined and award any other equitable relief this court deems appropriate.
the defendants responded to the complaint with a motion to dismiss under rule b.the first and second numbered paragraphs of the defendants motion read as follows 
crosby purports to bring this action under section a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a,and styles it as an action to enforce section a a of erisa.
crosby sues to recover an increased lump sum distribution of his retirement benefit under the plan,a retirement benefit plan sponsored and administered by bowater.in particular,crosby claims that in calculating the present value of his retirement benefit,defendants incorrectly used a mortality discount for the part of that calculation dealing with the time before crosby had reached age.
the brief accompanying the motion pointed out that the statutory provision on which crosby purported to sue did not authorize a suit for the relief he was seeking 
although what he really seeks is an award of additional benefits,a claim properly brought under erisa a b,a b footnote omitted,crosby purports to sue under erisa a,a.that provision only authorizes crosby to bring an action to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of erisa or the terms of the plan.
crosby filed a response to the b motion in which he admitted the substance of paragraphs and of the motion 
crosby agrees that he brought this action under a and a of the employee retirement income security act erisa.a and a.
crosby agrees that a he is suing to recover additional lump sum benefits b the plan is sponsored and administered by bowater and c he claims that bowater incorrectly utilized a mortality discount for the period before age when it computed his lump sum.
the response was accompanied with a cross motion for summary judgment based on the complaint as filed at no time did crosby seek leave to amend the complaint.
in due course,after crosby had filed a motion for class certification,the district court ordered briefing on the appropriateness of the requested equitable remedies in the event the plaintiff succeeded on his summary judgment motion.in the brief filed pursuant to the court direction,crosby reiterated he had brought his claim under a,which authorizes appropriate equitable relief.arguing that the relief he sought was equitable as well as appropriate,crosby cited life annuity ins.knudson,d,as suggest ing that if the relief requested does not seek to impose liability for a contractual monetary obligation,it is probably an appropriate equitable remedy.the district court was told that crosby does not seek to impose liability on defendants for any contractual obligation to pay money.
after the completion of briefing,and having dispensed with oral argument,the district court entered a final judgment in which the court granted class certification denied the defendants motion to dismiss granted the plaintiff summary judgment motion enjoined the defendants to recalculate the lump sum benefits of class members who had previously received lump sum benefits,in accordance with the court opinion,and to immediately refund,plus and interest and to calculate lump sum benefit payments for class members who have not yet received any lump sum benefits in accordance with the court opinion.
the opinion comprehensive and analysis of a variety of issues,some of which are not in contention on that because the plan provided for payment of a death benefit in the amount of the present value of the participant accrued benefit,the death benefit was not incidental to the participant accrued benefit and the plan administrator thus lacked discretion to use a mortality discount factor in reducing the projected annuity to its present value.the bottom line,in the district court view,was that the lump sum payment to which crosby claimed to be entitled,as the court not have undergone the mortality reduction that resulted in a lump sum payout of only.
the defendants perfected a timely appeal.much of the argument they present to our court is a defense of the merits of the plan administrator decision to take mortality risk into account.the defendants argue further that the decision should have been reviewed under an standard,and that the district court was required to uphold the decision as reasonable.we do not reach these issues,the defendants also primary relief sought by crosby did not qualify as equitable relief of the sort authorized by erisa a,a.
the present opinion is not the place for a history lesson on the development of the parallel systems of jurisprudence known as law and equity.it will suffice,we trust,to remind the reader that courts of which the common law of the english speaking peoples had its principal for a number of centuries separate and distinct from chancery courts originally the court of an ecclesiastical person appointed by the king to be his chancellor that the rules of decision followed in chancery courts were not common law rules,but rules of equity that chancery courts courts of equity likewise had their own under which,for example,the chancellor performed the role that in courts of law would be performed by a jury and that the remedies typically available to a party who prevailed in a court of equity injunctive relief,were far from identical to the remedies the prevailing party could obtain in a court of law.although,in most jurisdictions,the same courts have long administered both law and equity the unified courts have been administering what professor geldart described as distinct bodies of law,governed largely by different principles.
against this background,we return to the text of erisa a,the statutory section under which plaintiff crosby brought his suit.under a,as codified at a,crosby could institute a proceeding a to enjoin any act or practice which violates erisa or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of erisa or the terms of the plan.emphasis supplied.section a does not authorize a plan participant to sue for recovery of benefits due to him under the terms of the plan.that is the office of b a section with which crosby has always insisted he will have nothing to do.
but what if the benefits are not claimed to be due under terms of the plan,strictly speaking,but under the terms of a this case erisa a,a setting forth requirements that the plan must satisfy the answer,we believe,depends on whether the claim for benefits allegedly due under the statutory requirements is or is not,at bottom,a claim for injunctive or other equitable relief.no matter how well founded it may be as a matter of substantive law,a claim for benefits is not cognizable under a of erisa unless it is a claim for equitable relief.
as used in a,the supreme court has repeatedly held,equitable relief refers to those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.mertens hewitt associates,d life annuity ins.knudson,d.and a lmost invariably suits seeking whether by judgment,injunction,or declaration to compel the defendant to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff are suits for money damages,as that phrase has traditionally been applied,since they seek no more than compensation for loss resulting from the defendant breach of legal duty.bowen massachusetts,d scalia,dissenting,as quoted with approval in,at.and m oney damages are,of course,the classic form of legal relief.id.quoting mertens,at.
crosby acknowledged in the court below that suits seeking to compel the defe
