emeritus employee handbook,which was in effect during kampmier employment,outlined a harassment prevention policy that advised employees to report harassment or discrimination to their immediate supervisors,the executive director,the business office director,or any member of emeritus management team.under the policy,if a complaint was reported to management,emeritus was required to perform an investigation and subsequently inform the aggrieved employee of the outcome of the investigation.kampmier contends that she complained about badell behavior to badell,grover,and stine.grover says that she reported kampmier claims to lawson,but lawson denies ever receiving them.emeritus did not discipline badell while at the loyalton.
kampmier endometriosis 
kampmier suffers from endometriosis,a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus the endometrial stroma and glands,which should only be located inside the uterus is found elsewhere in the body.she was diagnosed when she was years old and has had an average of one to two surgeries a year since that time,including fifteen laparoscopic surgeries and cervical scrapings.as a result of the endometriosis,kampmier had pregnancy complications with both of her children.she also had an ectopic pregnancy in.kampmier endometriosis flares up a week or two before and after her menstrual cycle,during painful periods,and for a month and a half after surgery.for two weeks after her surgery in,kampmier had difficulty walking,cleaning her house,caring for her child,engaging in sexual intercourse or driving she was on vicodin.when emeritus hired her,kampmier did not indicate that she required accommodation for any physical impairment and did not inform emeritus of her condition.kampmier did not take off any time from work for illness between march and.
kampmier termination 
in,kampmier was scheduled to work on friday,august and monday,september,which was labor day weekend.on thursday,august,kampmier went to her physician,higgins,because she was in pain.he recommended that kampmier have a hysterectomy to correct her endometriosis.higgins informed kampmier that he would have someone contact her on monday,september,or tuesday,september,to set up the hysterectomy.in the interim,he instructed her to take off work.
after speaking with higgins,kampmier called badell at home to cancel her friday and monday shifts.kampmier told badell that she might need a hysterectomy and that it would be scheduled as soon as possible.badell said that was fine and that badell had recently undergone a hysterectomy and knew exactly what kampmier was going through.
on friday,august,badell contacted kampmier and requested a doctor note kampmier called higgin office and spoke with his office nurse who told kampmier that the doctor was out of the office.kampmier asked the nurse to call badell however,badell never received a phone call or a note and kampmier never followed up with the doctor,badell,or the nurse.
on september,kampmier called badell and informed her that surgery was scheduled and she would need some time off,indicating that it might be two weeks,three weeks,or eight weeks depending on whether she had a hysterectomy or laparoscopic surgery.
later that day,badell and skinner called kampmier home.kampmier mother answered and told badell and skinner that kampmier was sleeping.badell and skinner asked kampmier mother to tell kampmier that she needed to send a doctor note to the loyalton.badell testified that she made the phone call because another nurse claimed to have seen kampmier at a labor day parade.kampmier mother promised that kampmier would call the loyalton as soon as kampmier woke up.kampmier did not return badell phone call.
on september,several hours after the beginning of kampmier scheduled shift,kampmier called badell and told badell she was having surgery that evening.she told badell that she would be back at work in two weeks.kampmier did not come to work or call in for her shifts on september.badell and skinner contacted kampmier doctor office and asked that the office fax a note,but they never received one.badell and skinner then contacted lawson and informed her of the situation.lawson told them to speak with the human resources director,michelle see,to discuss the process to follow.
skinner told see that kampmier was not showing up for her scheduled shifts and had failed to provide emeritus with a doctor note.together,see,skinner,and badell reviewed the facts,the schedule,and emeritus attendance policy,which provides,if an employee is unable to report to work,they are required to contact their supervisor a minimum of two hours prior to the start of their shift.the attendance policy also states in bold capital letters,a,is grounds for immediate termination.on september,badell spoke separately by telephone with see and lawson,and the three agreed to terminate kampmier for job abandonment because she did not report or call in for her scheduled shifts and because she failed to provide emeritus with a doctor note.
kampmier received a letter,dated september,stating that emeritus interpreted her failure to call or show up for work as voluntary resignation.kampmier complained about her termination to both see and lawson,neither of whom would reinstate her.in her phone call with see,kampmier complained that badell had sexually harassed her.after speaking to kampmier,see informed both lawson and badell about the allegations,which badell denied.
on september,kampmier filed a complaint against emeritus in the northern district of illinois.kampmier brought disparate treatment count i,reasonable accommodation count ii,and retaliation claims count iii under the ada disparate treatment count iv,sexual harassment count v,and retaliation claims count vi under title vii an erisa claim and state law claims for negligent hiring,negligent training and supervision,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
on august,emeritus filed a motion for summary judgment.on february,the district court granted the motion on counts of kampmier complaint.the district court also declined to assert jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.
ii.analysis 
this court reviews a district court entry of summary judgment de novo.davis transp.cent.express,cir.summary judgment is inappropriate if there is a genuine issue of material fact.see mccoy harrison,cir.to survive summary judgment,the nonmoving party must make a sufficient showing of evidence for each essential element of its case on which it bears the burden at trial.see celotex catrett,d.
disability discrimination 
kampmier first claims that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on her ada discrimination claim.because she does not have direct evidence of disability discrimination,she must proceed on the basis of the indirect method of proof.see leffel valley fin,cir.to make a prima facie case of disability discrimination at the summary judgment phase,a plaintiff must offer evidence that she is disabled within the meaning of the ada,she was meeting her employer legitimate employment expectations,she was subject to an adverse employment action,and similarly situated employees received more favorable treatment.rooney koch air,llc,cir.both parties agree that kampmier was meeting emeritus legitimate employment expectations,and,for purposes of appeal,emeritus concedes that it terminated kampmier.thus,the parties only dispute the first and fourth prongs of kampmier prima facie case.
disability 
an individual can prove that she is disabled under the ada by establishing that she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,she has a record of such an impairment,or she is regarded as having such an impairment by her employer.a.
kampmier has not proven that she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.substantially limits means that kampmier is unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or is significantly restricted as to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.j i ii.in deciding whether a person is disabled,we consider the nature and severity of the impairment,the duration and expected duration of the impairment,and the permanent or long term impact or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.j i iii furnish svi,cir.
kampmier testified that she cleans her own house,cooks on a regular basis,plays with her children,takes her daughter to gymboree,swims,and does her own grocery shopping.she has no difficulty brushing her teeth,bathing,combing her hair or dressing herself.she claims that in the two weeks following her september,surgery she could not lift anything and could not drive as often because she was taking vicodin.she alleges that she does not do any gardening or lawn mowing,but does not allege that her failure to do these activities has anything to do with her endometriosis.she had two natural pregnancies and engaged in sexual intercourse both before and after her surgery.
moreover,kampmier is not limited in her ability to work.it is undisputed that she did not take off any time because of her endometriosis before august,and she regularly worked shifts.although endometriosis is undoubtedly painful,in this case it does not rise to the level of disability under the ada.kampmier own testimony leaves no doubt that she is able to perform the tasks central to most people lives,and this dooms her claim that she is suffering from a disability cognizable under the ada.see rooney,at.
kampmier cites to a district court case for the proposition that courts have recognized endometriosis as a disability.see erickson bd.of governors of state colls.univs.for ne,wl.however,the district court in erickson actually found the plaintiff disability to be infertility,not endometriosis.id.at.kampmier has two children by natural means,and thus,erickson is not on point.
kampmier also cites bragdon abbott in which chief justice rehnquist,concurring in part and dissenting in part,stated in dicta that there are numerous disorders of the reproductive system,such as endometriosis,which are so painful that they limit a woman ability to engage in major life activities such as walking or working,d.however,whether or not a medical condition rises to the level of a disability is to be made on an individualized basis.sutton united air lines,d.here,kampmier has not offered evidence that her endometriosis limited her ability to engage in major life activities.
nor has kampmier offered evidence that she has a record of a disability.to succeed under this theory,kampmier must again show that her impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.k rooney,at.as demonstrated above,however,kampmier did not submit evidence to this effect.instead,she claims that she had a long record of problems with reproduction,including one ectopic pregnancy,three failed in vitro procedures,and six failed artificial inseminations.we have held that an employer possession of records detailing injuries and surgeries does not mean that the employee is statutorily disabled.rooney,at.moreover,kampmier does not even claim that emeritus had a record of her prior surgeries or procedures.
finally,kampmier has not offered evidence suggesting that emeritus regarded her as disabled.if the condition that is the subject of the employer belief is not substantially limiting,and the employer does not believe that it is,then there is no violation of the ada under the regarded as prong of the statute.mack great dane trailers,cir.kampmier has provided no evidence that emeritus thought she was unable to perform the functions of her job as a registered nurse.emeritus never limited kampmier responsibilities even after they learned she had endometriosis.kampmier suggests that badell considered her unable to work because she called badell and told her that she was unable to work on august and september.however,kampmier has not offered evidence that badell considered her unable to work because of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.
similarly situated individuals 
under the fourth prong of the prima facie case,kampmier is required to identify a similarly situated individual who received more favorable treatment.however,kampmier has not identified any similarly situated individuals at emeritus.in fact,she does not mention the words similarly situated with regard to her ada claims in either her opening or reply brief.because kampmier is not disabled and failed to identify a similarly situated individual who emeritus treated differently,the district court properly granted emeritus motion for summary judgment.
failure to accommodate and retaliation 
because kampmier has not offered evidence that she is disabled within the meaning of the ada,her ada failure to accommodate and retaliation claims are without merit.
gender discrimination 
kampmier claims that she offered direct evidence of sex discrimination.a plaintiff may prove discrimination using the direct method by establishing either an acknowledgment of discriminatory intent or circumstantial evidence that provides the basis for an inference of intentional discrimination.phelan cook county,cir.with regard to her direct method proof,kampmier makes one conclusory statement that her termination would not have occurred but for her endometriosis,a condition that is inherently female,just like pregnancy.this bare assertion is insufficient to establish discrimination under the direct method.the only proof that kampmier has is the fact that she had endometriosis and was terminated.temporal proximity,alone,is not enough to establish discriminatory intent.bilow much shelist freed denenberg ament rubenstein,cir the mere fact that one event preceded another does nothing to prove that the first event caused
