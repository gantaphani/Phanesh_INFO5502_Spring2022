background 
factual background 
the facts surrounding the merger of the brewery fund and teamsters fund have been described numerous times by this and other courts,and are not disputed by the parties.see,baum,at pbgc,at new york state teamsters conference pension and ret.fund hoh,cicatello brewery workers pension fund.the starting point for all these cases is the agreement and plan of integration merger agreement executed by representatives of the brewery fund and teamsters fund on july,and august,respectively.the merger agreement provided,inter alia,that upon approval of the merger by the internal revenue service irs,the brewery fund would merge into the teamsters fund,with the assets of the former transferred and assigned to the trustees of the latter.see merger agreement,art.iv.the teamsters fund would thereafter receive all employer contributions formerly paid to the brewery fund and would pay out benefits to current and future participants and beneficiaries of the pension plan of the brewery fund brewery plan.see,art.iv.under the terms of the merger agreement,members of the brewery fund could elect either to continue receiving benefits under the terms of the brewery plan or,subject to certain conditions,receive benefits under the preexisting pension plan of the teamsters fund teamsters plan.depending on various factors,benefits received under the teamsters plan could be greater than benefits received under the brewery plan.eligibility to elect teamsters plan benefits,however,was limited by the terms of the merger agreement to current and active members of the brewery plan for whom contributions were made to the teamsters fund after the effective date of the merger agreement.see,art.iii,e.said effective date was defined as thirty days after notification of irs approval.see,art.iii.
the merger agreement required that an application for irs approval be made forthwith.see,art.ix.but rather than seeking such approval,defendant board of trustees instead attempted to repudiate the merger agreement on the grounds that soon after the agreement was signed,rheingold brewery,a major contributor to the brewery fund,terminated operations and laid off approximately workers,thereby threatening the brewery fund financial solvency.after receiving notice that the board of trustees would not proceed with the merger,representatives of the brewery fund brought suit in new york state supreme court,queens county,to compel performance.on april,the new york supreme court declared that,despite the closure of the rheingold brewery and changed economic circumstances,the merger agreement remained valid and binding.the court also ordered specific performance of the merger agreement by the board of trustees,including the filing of an application for approval with the irs.see brewery workers pension fund new york state teamsters conference pension and ret.fund,order at.the lower court judgment was unanimously affirmed by the appellate division,see,dep t,and leave to appeal was thereafter denied by the new york court of appeals.see.nevertheless,the board of trustees did not undertake performance of the merger agreement or seek irs approval,but chose instead to pursue other means of challenging the merger.see pbgc,at.
rather than waiting for the board of trustees to exhaust its legal remedies,the brewery fund sought irs approval itself,filing the necessary application on april.five months later,on september,the district director of the irs in buffalo,new york,sent a letter to the board of trustees,informing it that the merger had been approved.thereafter,the brewery fund transferred all its assets to the teamsters fund,effective december.the board of trustees objected to the manner in which irs approval had been obtained,refused to recognize the transfer or accept the assets,and sought reconsideration by the irs,which was denied.consistent with past practice,the board of trustees went back to the courts and launched a series of challenges to the irs approval,all of which proved unsuccessful.see,wenzel,supra new york state teamsters conference pension and ret.fund commissioner,wl.
while the board of trustees sought to overturn the irs approval,representatives of the brewery fund returned to state court and,on may,moved to compel compliance with the original order of specific performance and for a declaration that the pension funds were now integrated.on april,the new york supreme court,queens county,declared that the brewery fund is now and has been since december,fully integrated with the teamsters fund and ordered,inter alia,the board of trustees forthwith to accept assignment of the brewery fund assets and property,assume the financial obligations of the brewery fund,pay all benefits due under the brewery plan,and notify active members of the brewery fund of their right to elect teamsters plan benefits.see brewery workers pension fund new york state teamsters conference pension and ret.fund,order supplemental.when the board of trustees continued to challenge the validity of the merger,the new york supreme court entered an order of contempt on september,fining the board of trustees but allowing it to purge the contempt within five days.see brewery workers pension fund new york state teamsters conference pension and ret.fund,final order upon contempt proceedings at.another round of legal action ensued in the state court,resulting,on october,in a second finding of contempt and an order of imprisonment and fines for members of the board of trustees.the state court concluded that the board of trustees had not made a good faith effort to comply with the original contempt order,citing numerous deficiencies in the notice of election rights that the board of trustees distributed to members of the brewery fund one year after entry of the original contempt order.see brewery workers pension fund new york state teamsters conference pension and ret.fund,mem.at.after further negotiations,a revised notice was eventually distributed in june.
procedural background 
dorothy casey is the widow of patrick casey,who was a participant in the brewery plan and who retired on a disability pension effective february.in july,plaintiff casey,who theretofore had been collecting her deceased husband pension under the brewery plan,applied to the teamsters fund for coverage under the teamsters plan.by letter dated july,the board of trustees denied her application on the grounds that no contributions were made on casey behalf after december,and he was not a participant of the new york state teamsters pension plan.thomas rocco,ceased employment in the brewing industry on march,and thereafter collected benefits under the brewery plan.he,too,applied for teamsters plan benefits and,by letter dated november,was denied on the grounds that to be eligible for teamsters plan benefits,a member must have worked past december.
plaintiffs thereafter brought suit in federal court,seeking a declaration that by its contumacious conduct in breaching the merger agreement,the board of trustees waived its right to a delayed effective date of the merger agreement,and that,therefore,the merger became effective upon its execution on august.am.in the alternative,plaintiffs sought to establish a constructive effective date of february,six months after the merger agreement was executed.according to plaintiffs,this date was appropriate because,once irs approval was finally sought,it took the irs five months to approve the merger and the merger agreement was to become effective days after such approval.id.plaintiffs also sought injunctive relief to enforce compliance with these declarations.
in their amended complaint,plaintiffs cite a of erisa,which requires a pension plan fiduciary to administer the plan for the sole benefit of the plan participants and beneficiaries and to provide benefits in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.a.most of plaintiffs claims for relief are based on the assertion that the board of trustees did not adhere to the terms of the merger agreement in refusing to provide brewery plan participants actively employed or with vested rights on or after august,and their beneficiaries,with benefits equal to those available to the teamsters plan participants.am.plaintiffs contend that by violating the terms of the merger agreement,defendants violated erisa and the fiduciary duties established under a.see id.plaintiffs also assert what they label pendent claims for relief,which state that the board of trustees breached its common law fiduciary and contractual duties by failing to comply with the terms of the merger agreement.id.
on march,plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on their erisa claims,arguing that federal courts have adopted as federal common law the principle that erisa does not permit a party to profit from its own wrong.mem.law in support of pls.mot.for partial summ,at.in response,the board of trustees filed its own for summary judgment,seeking dismissal on the grounds that the conduct of which plaintiffs complain,namely,the breach of the merger agreement,occurred prior to the enactment of erisa and thus is not actionable under that statute.the district court agreed with the board of trustees,pointing out that in pbgc,the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia had previously held that the execution and repudiation of the merger agreement occurred prior to erisa effective date.see seitz i,wl,at citing pbgc,at.in light of the fact that courts have uniformly rejected the theory that acts are actionable under erisa even if they generate consequences after erisa effective date,id.quoting baum,at alteration omitted,the district court dismissed plaintiffs case in its entirety,finding that plaintiffs had alleged no other basis for federal jurisdiction.
plaintiffs moved the district court for reconsideration,arguing that the court committed clear error in three ways.first,plaintiffs argued that the district court had misconstrued the amended complaint in that the misconduct that formed the basis of the action was not defendant repudiation of the merger agreement,but its subsequent decision to use the delayed effective date of the merger to deny plaintiffs benefits under the teamsters plan.see seitz ii,wl,at.the district court rejected this argument,finding that the amended complaint sought to establish an earlier effective date for the merger agreement in order to cure the effects of defendant repudiation of that agreement,specifically,the denial of plaintiffs request for teamsters plan benefits.it was therefore the repudiation that was the conduct at issue in the amended complaint,not the denial itself.see id.at.
second,plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs had no other basis for a claim under erisa because plaintiffs,as participants in the teamsters plan,were entitled to sue for a review of benefit decisions.again,the district court rejected plaintiffs argument,finding that because plaintiffs were not eligible for teamsters plan benefits,they did not fall under erisa definition of participants.see id.at citing.third,and finally,plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing the amended complaint in its entirety because defendant never sought dismissal of plaintiffs pendent state law claims.the district court concluded,however,that plaintiffs had not brought state law claims and had not asserted jurisdiction or raised arguments under new york law prior to their motion for reconsideration,thus preventing any finding of clear error.see id.at.
defendant thereafter moved for attorney fees and costs under erisa fee shifting provision,g.the district court found that such an award was inappropriate because plaintiffs claims were dismissed not only on the merits but for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as well.see seitz iii,supra,at.
the instant appeal ensued,with plaintiffs challenging dismissal of their amended complaint and defendant seeking reversal of the district court decision on attorney fees.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see,brown volante,cir,cert.denied,d.on appeal,plaintiffs assert substantially the same arguments as they pressed in their motion for reconsideration below.we conclude that plaintiffs amended complaint failed to state an actionable claim under erisa and that dismissal of plaintiffs amended complaint in its entirety was appropriate.as for defendant motion for fees and costs,we affirm the district court decision on an alternative ground.
plaintiffs erisa claims for breach of fiduciary duty 
sections a and b of erisa provide that,as of january,erisa preempts state law concerning employee benefit plans,except that such preemption shall not apply with respect to any cause of action which arose,or any act or omission which occurred,before january.a,b.thus conduct that occurred before the effective date of erisa is not actionable under that statute.see,malone white motor,d baum,at.plaintiffs acknowledge this rule,but argue that it does not apply to their case because they are not challenging defendant conduct,the conduct that led to the delayed effective date of the merger agreement,but only defendant refusal to take into consideration the wrongfulness of that conduct when determining plaintiffs eligibility for teamsters plan benefits.in other words,plaintiffs claim merely to seek review of defendant denial of their respective applications for teamsters plan benefits.
plaintiffs argument ignores the text of the amended complaint,which explains that p laintiffs seek a declaration that by its contumacious conduct in breaching the merger agreement,the board of trustees waived its right to a delayed effective date of the merger agreement,and that,therefore,the merger became effective upon its execution on august.am.this clear statement of intent indicates that plaintiffs brought their suit to do more than simply challenge defendant eligibility decision as erroneous or invalid rather,they sought to obtain teamsters plan benefits for themselves and those similarly situated by establishing a new effective date for the merger agreement,based on the wrongfulness of defendant contumacious efforts to repudiate that that began in.see also mem.law in support of plaintiffs motion for partial summ,at the motion seeks to establish that the effective date of the merger between the brewery and the teamsters pension funds was february,rather than december.accordingly,plaintiffs action does arise from conduct and seeks redress for the continuing consequences of that conduct.
we have previously held that erisa
