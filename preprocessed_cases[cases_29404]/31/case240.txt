background 
from through approximately april,plaintiff,a resident of schenectady county,new york,worked as a real estate broker affiliated with a franchise of prudential realty,known first as blake realty and then manor homes by blake hereinafter prudential.beginning in,plaintiff and prudential entered into an series of statements of understanding which declared plaintiff to be an independent contractor and recited various terms of their relationship such as paying plaintiff only on commission and allowing her to set her own work hours.
prudential was,at all times,a member of the chamber.cdphp,a health services provider incorporated in new york,entered into a contract with the chamber by which cdphp made available its emerald hmo plan the chamber plan to members of the chamber and their employees.the chamber was named as the policyholder under the contract and was responsible for collecting premiums on behalf of the plan subscribers and forwarding them to cdphp.the chamber also set the rules subject to cdphp approval by which individuals would be deemed eligible to participate in the plan.
in june,plaintiff applied to enroll,and was accepted by cdphp,in the chamber plan.the application form had a space for employer,in which the name prudential was entered,but plaintiff claims she left this space blank and does not know who filled it in.it is undisputed that,from that point on,plaintiff was a subscriber to the chamber plan.she states,however,that she,not prudential,paid all of her own premiums to the chamber for remittance to cdphp,and defendant does not dispute this.
in,plaintiff began operating a photoglazing business under the name of lasting memories,and she lasting memories joined the chamber as an individual member in october.as far as can be determined from the record,defendant was not notified that plaintiff had joined the chamber.plaintiff claims that from that point on she had access to the chamber plan by virtue of her own membership in the chamber,not through prudential.
in february,plaintiff began suffering from headaches and consulted physicians in albany,who told her that she suffered from a brain tumor meningioma and advised surgical removal.not satisfied that the physician was sufficiently experienced to perform the operation,plaintiff arranged for the removal of her tumor at brigham women hospital in boston,which is not part of the cdphp network.plaintiff requested in advance that defendant approve the operation,but cdphp refused.informed that her surgery needed to be performed immediately,plaintiff took out a loan to pay for it herself.following the successful removal of her tumor in boston,plaintiff sought reimbursement from defendant,which denied the claim on the ground that any surgery must be approved ahead of time.plaintiff intraplan appeals were all denied.
having exhausted her administrative remedies,plaintiff filed suit against cdphp on march,in new york supreme court,schenectady county,claiming breach of contract,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and prima facie tort,all under new york law.no erisa or other federal law claim was made.on april,defendant removed the case to federal district court on the ground of erisa preemption.
plaintiff moved to remand,and the motion was by consent of the magistrate judge david hurd.on august,magistrate judge hurd issued an order denying the motion to remand without prejudice to refiling upon submission of additional evidence regarding plaintiff relationship with prudential manor homes,plaintiff renewed the motion in september.following limited discovery including a deposition of plaintiff on the relationship between plaintiff and prudential,magistrate judge hurd again issued an order denying the motion to remand.the order first stated,with no explanation,that the chamber plan was a qualified erisa employee welfare benefit plan.second,the order stated that,because plaintiff application to cdphp had prudential listed as her employer,and because she became a member of cdphp through her affiliation with prudential,she was estopped from asserting that she was not an employee of prudential and therefore a valid participant in the chamber plan.the magistrate judge held that therefore plaintiff claims necessarily arose under erisa and that the district court had jurisdiction.plaintiff did not file any objections to this ruling with the district court.
in may,defendant moved for summary judgment on all claims,asserting that plaintiff claims must all be dismissed as preempted by erisa.in a decision dated april,judge kahn granted the motion and dismissed all claims.marcella capital dist.physicians health plan,d.judge kahn first held that magistrate judge hurd decisions in the remand,that the chamber plan was a qualified erisa plan,that plaintiff was an employee of prudential,and that jurisdiction was therefore law of the case.noting,however,that magistrate judge hurd had not specifically addressed whether each of plaintiff claims was preempted by erisa,judge kahn addressed each one in turn and found them preempted,rejecting plaintiff argument apparently the sole one raised in opposition to the motion that cdphp should be deemed an insurance company and that therefore erisa savings clause,b a,spared plaintiff claims from preemption.this appeal followed.
discussion 
removal jurisdiction and erisa preemption 
we begin by reiterating the basic principles of federal removal jurisdiction as they relate to the special case of erisa.a defendant may remove from state court to federal court any civil action of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction.a.normally,a defense that plaintiff claims are preempted by federal law will not suffice to confer federal question jurisdiction,which must be determined by reference to the allegations that appear on the face of a complaint.plumbing indus.bd.howell,cir see also metro.life ins.taylor,d federal is ordinarily a federal defense to the plaintiff suit.as a defense,it does not appear on the face of a complaint,and,therefore,does not authorize removal to federal court.however,in the case of claims falling within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of of erisa,congress has manifested its intent that such claims be removable,on the ground that such claims are of necessity so federal in character that they arise under federal law for purposes of.plumbing indus,at see also taylor,at.in such complete preemption cases,the burden is on the defendant,as the party asserting federal jurisdiction,to demonstrate the propriety of removal.grimo blue shield of,cir see also linardos fortuna,cir it is also hornbook law that the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of proving facts to establish that jurisdiction.
in order for a claim to be completely preempted by erisa so as to support removal,the defendant must demonstrate that the state law cause of action is preempted by erisa,and that cause of action is within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of erisa a,a.howell,at.in this case,plaintiff does not dispute that,if her policy with cdphp was part of an erisa plan,not only are her claims preempted by erisa a,a erisa supersede s any and all state laws insofar as they relate to any employee benefit plan,bu
