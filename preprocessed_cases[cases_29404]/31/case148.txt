in,in a prior lawsuit,the district court entered judgment in the amount of,plus interest,attorneys fees,and costs,against community action agencies insurance group caaig or the plan,a welfare benefits plan for employees of antipoverty agencies,and its trustees.the judgment was entered in favor of one of the participating agencies,plaintiffappellee head start child development services,lihs,on account of caaig failure to refund reserves that had been set aside for lihs after lihs withdrew from the plan.
in the present case,lihs and paul adams,derivatively on behalf of caaig and as representative of a class of lihs employees who were plan participants,sued the administrators of caaig,contending that they breached their fiduciary duties to caaig under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,by failing to ensure that caaig had sufficient assets with which to satisfy the judgment.following a bench trial,the district court agreed and entered judgment against the plan administrators.the administrators appeal.we affirm.
statement of the case 
a.the.caaig 
caaig was established as an erisa welfare benefits plan for the purpose of providing sickness,accident,life,disability and other welfare benefits for the employees of antipoverty agencies.at all relevant times,the participating employers consisted of economic opportunity commission of nassau county,eoc nassau,economic opportunity council of suffolk,eoc suffolk,yonkers community action program,yonkers cap,and lihs.
pursuant to a trust agreement dated october,the trust agreement,the caaig trust fund the trust was established to effectuate the purposes of the plan.section of the trust agreement provided that the participating agencies had authority to administer the plan.the agencies delegated their authority to their respective chief executive officers,who were to act as trustees the trustees upon the direction of the agencies.
in exercising their powers and duties,section of the trust agreement required the trustees to act solely in the interest of the plan participants and other persons entitled to benefits thereunder,for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the trust,and w ith the care,skill,prudence,and diligence of a prudent person in like circumstances.
employer contributions and the reserves 
the trust agreement required the participating agencies to make the necessary contributions to provide the benefits expected to become payable under this trust.according to the caaig health coverage plan,the failure of any participating agency to submit the appropriate premium charge within the grace period of days shall cause coverage for all claims to cease from that month forward.to ensure the financial integrity of the plan,the trustees maintained approximately million in reserves the plan reserves,which funds were for the security of the plan and could not be distributed to any member while the plan was in existence.
at some point,yonkers cap and eoc suffolk began experiencing difficulty paying their plan contributions.by,yonkers cap owed approximately in arrears.although the trustees initially terminated yonkers cap participation in the plan,they reinstated yonkers cap on assurances that it would pay down its overdue contributions.after reinstatement,however,yonkers cap failed to pay down the contributions in arrears.similarly,in,eoc suffolk owed the plan approximately in arrears,but the trustees permitted it to remain in the plan and pay down its delinquency on an as possible basis.
on september,lihs withdrew from the plan and requested the immediate return of the portion of plan reserves attributable to its past contributions the lihs reserves.the trustees refused to refund the lihs reserves.
the prior action and depletion of reserves 
in,lihs,anthony macaluso finance director of lihs and paul adams lihs employee formerly participating in the plan commenced a class action against the plan and its trustees,seeking,inter alia,a refund of the lihs reserves the prior action.
at a meeting of the board of trustees on december,the trustees discussed the fact that the prior action exposed the plan to a contingent liability of approximately,the amount of damages sought by lihs and its employees.at the very same board meeting,the trustees decided to write off the yonkers cap delinquency as bad debt and pay the claims of yonkers cap employees using the plan reserves.
over the next several years,the trustees depleted the plan reserves,notwithstanding the approximately contingent liability it faced in the prior action.in alone,the trustees expended of the plan reserves by recording a loss of approximately for the of the yonkers cap delinquency plus interest receivable,and by paying more in claims and expenses relative to prior years.the plan reserves fell below million for the first time in at least seven years.despite the quickly declining reserves,however,the trustees did not increase the contributions due from the agencies but collected approximately the same amounts as in prior years.
on june,yonkers cap and eoc suffolk withdrew from the plan,owing plus interest and,respectively.the plan ceased operations that year between and march,the trustees depleted the plan reserves,setting aside only for the in contingent liability it faced in the prior action.they did not exercise their power,under section j of the trust agreement,to retain any funds or property subject to any dispute.
in,the district court entered judgment in the prior action,awarding lihs and its employees for the lihs reserves that should have been refunded,plus interest,attorneys fees,and costs,for a total award of.the plan satisfied only a portion of the judgment,leaving over plus interest unpaid.
proceedings below 
on december,lihs and adams commenced the present action,principally asserting claims that eoc nassau,eoc suffolk,yonkers cap,and john kearse,chief executive officer of eoc nassau collectively,the administrators,breached their fiduciary duties in violation of erisa a and a.in the claims relevant to this appeal,lihs and the class alleged that the administrators breached their fiduciary duties by diverting the lihs reserves to pay the plan claims and expenses the diversion claim,failing to adequately fund the plan through contributions from the agencies the underfunding claim,and failing to collect overdue contributions from eoc suffolk the eoc suffolk delinquency claim 
the district court conducted a bench trial on a number of days during the period to and issued a series of decisions between and the district court held that,as a preliminary matter,lihs and the class were not collaterally estopped from bringing their claims because the were not parties in the prior action,but that certain findings of fact it had made in the prior action would be binding as law of the case.see head start child dev,econ.opportunity comm of nassau,d.the district court dismissed a number of claims as untimely under the applicable statute of limitations,erisa,but found the diversion claim,underfunding claim,and the eoc suffolk delinquency claim timely.see id.at.it held that lihs and the class had standing to sue under erisa a and,and that the administrators were fiduciaries within the meaning of erisa,and thus,subject to liability.see l.head start child dev,econ.opportunity comm of nassau,d.
proceeding to the merits of the three claims it found timely,first,the district court dismissed the diversion claim.it reasoned that the trustees,in refusing to refund the lihs reserves,reasonably relied on two trust amendments dated october,and august,which provided that the voluntary withdrawal or termination of any member of the plan shall result in forfeiture of all monetary participation in the trust and that the plan reserves must remain in the trust to be used or distributed for trust purposes.see id.at.the district court held that while the trust amendments were held void in the prior action,this ruling in could not have informed the trustees reliance on the amendments in the when they refused to refund the lihs reserves.see id.
second,the district court found that the administrators breached their duties as to the underfunding claim,that the agencies failed to make the necessary contributions to adequately fund the plan,and the administrators,as fiduciaries,failed to enforce the agencies contractual obligations to make the contributions.see id.at.
third,the district court found the administrators liable for the eoc suffolk delinquency claim,concluding,inter alia,that the administrators breached their fiduciary duties by failing to collect the delinquency and permitting eoc suffolk to remain in the plan.see id.at.
on the parties subsequent for reconsideration,the district court reaffirmed its previous rulings,except to acknowledge that it had erred in relying in part on erisa to conclude that the plaintiffs had standing.see head start child dev,econ.opportunity comm of nassau,civ,wl,at may.the district court nevertheless upheld its previous conclusion that plaintiffs had standing pursuant to a,an independent basis for standing.see id.at.
after a full damages hearing,the district court ordered the administrators to pay,allocated among the,plus prejudgment interest see head start child dev,econ.opportunity comm of nassau,d.in determining the damages amount,the district court relied on the testimony of plaintiffs expert witness,anthony macaluso,and accepted his assumptions and methodology as reliable.see id.at.lastly,the district court awarded in attorneys fees to the plaintiffs.see head start child dev,econ.opportunity comm of nassau,d.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,the administrators principally argue that lihs and the class lack standing under erisa a the claims are under erisa the agencies are not fiduciaries under erisa a and the administrators did not breach their fiduciary duties under erisa a.we review the district court findings of fact after a bench trial for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see united states coppola,cir.
applicable law 
erisa a confers standing on a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary to seek relief under erisa.a.erisa a in turn provides 
any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities,obligations,or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach.

application 
first,the administrators argue that the plaintiffs claims are not derivative in nature because the relief they seek recoupment of losses to the plan,which may ultimately be used to satisfy the judgment in the prior action does not inure to the plan.we disagree.
the district court found that lihs and the class were asserting claims in a derivative capacity for the benefit of the plan as a whole.in their verified consolidated amended complaint,the plaintiffs sought recoupment of funds the trustees should have collected to keep the plan financially solvent after paying its claims and expenses.lihs and the class asserted these claims on the plan behalf,and prayed for relief inuring to the plan.this relief,of course,surely would have benefitted the plan.it is of no moment that recovery inuring to the plan may ultimately benefit particular participants.see larue dewolff,boberg,d erisa a authorizes recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant individual account accord pfahler latex prods,cir t he fact that damages awarded to the plan may provide plaintiffs with an indirect benefit,the payment of their claims,does not convert their derivative suit into an action for individual relief.
second,the administrators argue that the members of the class lack standing because they were seeking only a refund of past contributions rather than asserting a claim for benefits.the argument fails,however,because the class is not asserting a claim for benefits under erisa a b,but rather,a claim for recovery of losses to the plan caused by the fiduciaries breach of duties under erisa a and a.see larue,at roberts,concurring distinguishing a claim for benefits under a b from a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under a.benefits as used to define participants is not limited to plan benefits but encompasses a benefit of any type.furthermore,erisa a and a require a fiduciary who breaches his duties to make good to the plan any losses to the plan resulting from the breach,and to restore to such plan any profits made by the fiduciary through use of plan assets.id.a.thus,the class members are participants.
section a confers standing on a participant to seek relief under a.id.a.because the class members are employees of lihs entitled to receive a benefit of any type from the plan,they are participants with standing under a.
as to lihs,the administrators argue that it lacks standing because it is no longer a fiduciary of the plan.there is no dispute that lihs was a fiduciary during its participation in the plan rather,the administrators argue that lihs lost its fiduciary status by withdrawing from the plan.
the administrators rely on chemung canal trust sovran,cir,for the proposition that a former fiduciary lacks standing under erisa a.the circumstances in chemung,however,are distinguishable.there,we held that a former fiduciary whose interests were adverse to those of the plan lacked standing where it no longer had an interest in protecting a plan to which it was now a complete stranger.chemung,at.here,far from being a complete stranger to the plan,the district court found that lihs had a continuing interest in protecting the plan assets,which consisted in part of the funds lihs had contributed to the plan during its participation.accordingly,we conclude that lihs has standing under erisa a as a fiduciary of the plan.our conclusion is consistent with erisa remedial scheme designed to remove jurisdictional and procedural obstacles which in the past appear to have hampered effective enforcement of fiduciary responsibilities.mullins,at quotation omitted 
statute of limitations 
applicable law 
erisa provides the applicable statute of limitations for claims asserting a breach of fiduciary duty 
the earlier of six years after a the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation,or three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation.
under the limitations period in subsection,actual knowledge is strictly construed and constructive knowledge will not suffice.see caputo pfizer,cir.while a plaintiff need not have knowledge of the relevant law,he must have knowledge of all facts necessary to constitute a claim.id.at internal citation omitted.
