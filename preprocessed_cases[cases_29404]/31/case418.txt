eaton corporation,a multinational manufacturing company that funds and administers a disability benefits plan for its employees,terminated brenda evans benefits in.she sued under erisa to recover them,and the district court,faced with substantial conflicting medical evidence and a good case on both sides,concluded that evans position was the stronger one.but eaton was entitled to an abuse of discretion standard of review,and the district court judgment,though abuse of discretion in name,was de novo in fact.we therefore reverse the district court award of benefits to evans and remand with directions that judgment be granted to eaton.
under eaton disability plan,a claimant illness or injury qualifies as a covered disability if during the first months of such disability you are totally and continuously unable to perform the essential duties of your regular position and thereafter you are totally and continuously unable to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit for which you are,or may become,reasonably well fitted by reason of education,training or eaton corporation or elsewhere.
proving a claim requires o bjective findings of a disability,such as physical examination findings,diagnostic test studies,and observation of anatomical,physiological or psychological abnormalities.as with so many erisa plans today,eaton reserves discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and the power and discretion to determine all questions of fact arising in connection with the administration,interpretation and application of the plan.a,broadspire services,was eaton claims administrator.
in,due to severe rheumatoid arthritis,brenda evans quit her job as an order processor at eaton and filed for disability benefits.eaton paid without controversy through.but that year,evans disability picture started to become cloudy.her rheumatologist,boyd,had prescribed a new arthritis medication,enbrel,which did her some considerable good this is the best she has felt since i have been seeing her,boyd notes from the time report.the enbrel has helped her quite dramatically.she has very little joint pain now.
from that point forth,medical ambiguity would be the theme of evans story.to start with,arthritis was no longer her only problem a car accident in had caused serious independent injuries to her back,and boyd did not see improvement on that front.evans other treating physician,a general practitioner named murphy,agreed both as to evans arthritic improvement and continuing back problems,and both doctors continued to certify that evans was totally disabled.on the other hand,an mri and radiology exam from the period indicated that the injuries to evans back were not severe.and in a questionnaire,evans stated that she could cook,shop,do laundry,wash dishes,and drive about seven miles a day.
in january,two of broadspire physicians reviewed evans medical records and concluded that she was no longer neither did they regard her as fully able.one wrote,for instance,that evans would appear to have some use of her hands,although perhaps not full use.the other,likewise noting evans limited movement and chronic back pain,found that her rheumatoid arthritis has stabilized and her back pain did not preclude the claimant from performing sedentary job duties.both indicated that more information might be helpful,but on balance recommended ending evans benefits.that winter,evans also took a functional capacity evaluation,which concluded that she was capable of performing any job in the light category of work in an hour period with occasional pushing,pulling,standing,walking,climbing stairs and ladders,balancing,stooping,crouching,overhead reaching,desk level reaching,and floor level reaching,and added that h er actual abilities to lift,sit,stand,walk and carry are greater than her perceived abilities.thus,on april,broadspire sent evans a benefits cancellation letter.
evans filed an appeal with broadspire,and the steady current of conflicting medical evidence and opinion continued.three more broadspire physicians,one a rheumatologist,reviewed her file during the appeal process all three wrote substantial analyses of her condition and concluded that her infirmity was serious but not totally disabling.in july,broadspire denied the appeal,and evans filed a second,final appeal the third review of her condition.this time she supplemented her file with a recent and report documenting serious spinal problems,as well as a letter from boyd t here have been notes in my medical reports that have shown that she has been better at times.saying that she is better is not to say that she is nearly normal or not to say that she is not disabled.one can have a severe arthritic problem and get some improvement with medications and still be incapable functionally of working in a job i do not think her situation will ever change and i think she will be disabled long term.
two new broadspire physicians one a rheumatologist reviewed the file,including the new materials,and after careful study concluded that evans could work noteworthy is the new letter from boyd,the broadspire rheumatologist remarked.however,his notes describe dramatic improvement and almost no synovitis.that is not to say that the claimant is simply better but that she has very low levels of disease.thus there seems to be a contradiction between the information being relayed in boyd letter and what is being relayed in his notes.in addition,broadspire sent evans file to an anonymous rheumatologist from the medical review institute of america,who concurred with broadspire reviewers that evans could work.at the end of,eaton issued its final denial letter.
evans filed a complaint in the district court for south carolina in september.see employee retirement income security act of erisa a b,a b.but,presumably with a view to settlement,the parties agreed to a stay of litigation.as the consent order explains,t he plaintiff and the ltd plan have agreed to stay litigation to permit a reconsideration of the final appeal by the plan administrator plaintiff has indicated that she intends to undertake certain evaluations which she plans to submit to the plan administrator for this final determination reconsideration.thus michael bucci,a neurosurgeon and the third doctor to examine evans in person,met with her in april.he found joint deformity significantly painful to touch,joint swelling,diffuse spinal tenderness,difficulty with toe and heel walking,and in sum,severe rheumatoid arthritis and severe spinal stenosis i concur with her rheumatologist that the lady is permanently and totally disabled at this time.
even at this stage,however,the medical opinion was not univocal.eaton forwarded evans file to an independent medical reviewer,trangle,who took issue with bucci report and concluded that evans was not disabled.trangle found that,as of the relevant date of review of the records indicates that she had barely detectable elevated rheumatoid factor markers.and i n regards to her lower back,the mri scans and other records from and indicate some spinal stenosis and some radiculopathy,but it was mild in nature.in july,eaton rejected evans remanded appeal,stating that the records given to bucci were incomplete that bucci incorrectly focused on evans current medical condition i concur that the lady is permanently and totally disabled at this time.rather than her condition when benefits were cut off in and that his view conflicted with trangle.litigation resumed,and the parties agreed to have the court resolve the matter on the basis of memoranda and a joint stipulation,with relevant documents attached.
the district court opinion of october,after reciting the abuse of discretion standard of review,examined the evidence on both sides in great detail.most important to the district court,the only physicians who physically examined evans concluded that she was totally disabled,and t hese doctors conclusions,unlike those of the reviewing physicians,are substantial objective evidence of disability under the plan.evans eaton,hmh,wl,at.by contrast,in the district court view,the reviewing physicians opinions rested on weak foundations,such as boyd notes recording evans improvement which,boyd explained,were never meant to indicate that evans was well enough to work,the functional capacity evaluation which proved no more than evans ability to exert herself for one day,not day in and day out,and evans statements that she could cook,wash dishes,do crafts,and drive which also did not prove an ability to work.id.at.
in addition,the district court believed that the medical review institute physician report was confused on basic matters of fact such as whether evans had ever been considered disabled,and trangle report was contradicted by most of the objective evidence in the record.id.at.finally,eaton could not in good faith set aside bucci conclusions after agreeing to a stay in order to get for no better a reason than the obvious and unavoidable fact,implicitly agreed to in the stay,that bucci examination in would focus on evans condition in.id.at.in sum,eaton abused its discretion in failing to find evans examining physicians opinions more credible than the opinions of trangle,broadspire physicians,and the medical review institute reviewer.id.at.eaton timely appealed.
this case turns on a faithful application of the abuse of discretion standard of review,and so we begin with what is most crucial a clear understanding of what that standard is,and what such standards are for.
the purpose of standards of review is to focus reviewing courts upon their proper role when passing on the conduct of other.standards of review are thus an elemental expression of judicial restraint,which,in their deferential varieties,safeguard the superior vantage points of those entrusted with primary decisional responsibility the clear error standard,for example,protects district courts primacy as triers of fact.see anderson bessemer city,d.aedpa reasonableness standards protect state courts authority over state criminal convictions.see d.chevron deference,like the administrative procedure act and substantial evidence standards,protects agencies authority in carrying out the missions for which they are created.see chevron natural res.def.council,d.rational basis review protects the political choices of our government elected branches.see fcc beach commc ns,d calling the standard a paradigm of judicial restraint.and trust law,to which erisa is so intimately linked,firestone tire rubber bruch,d,uses the abuse of discretion standard to protect a fiduciary decisions concerning the trust funds in his care.see restatement third of trusts.
the precise definitions of these various standards,the nuances separating them from one another,can not be imprisoned within any forms of words for we can not escape,in relation to this problem,the use of undefined defining terms.universal camera nlrb.frankfurter.but what these and other such standards share is the designation of a primary other than the reviewing court,and the instrument,deference,with which that primacy is to be maintained.
the undisputed standard of review in this case is abuse of discretion.although erisa itself is silent on the standard for denials of benefits challenged under a b,firestone establishes that a de novo standard applies unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,in which case the exercise of assigned discretion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.at.see also booth stores,cir.in the instant case,the plan language giving eaton discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and the power and discretion to determine all questions of fact arising in connection with the administration,interpretation and application of the plan is unambiguous,and evans does not dispute the standard it requires.thus the district court functions in this context as a deferential reviewing court with respect to the erisa fiduciary decision,and we review the district court decision de novo,employing the same standards applied by the district court in reviewing the fiduciary decision.stup unum life ins,cir internal quotation omitted.
it is notoriously difficult to venture a general definition of the term abuse of discretion,and none is canonical indeed the term has different meanings in different legal contexts.see steven alan childress martha davis,federal standards of review,at,ed explaining that the term fights simple definition and has a sliding contextual meaning with varying level s of deference.in one sense,abuse of discretion is a term of exquisite balance.the word abuse recognizes that authority can be misused.the word discretion recognizes that the exercise of authority is often impossible without some leeway for judgment.but taken together,the two words convey an unmistakable message that as a matter of priority as well as sequence,discretion is first,and review for abuse is only a posterior check on judgment which strays too far from the mark.
the language of and thus becomes all but irresistible in the abuse of discretion context,for the standard draws a rather,demarcates a the unsupportable and the merely mistaken,between the legal error,disorder of reason,severe lapse of judgment,and procedural failure that a reviewing court may always correct,and the simple disagreement that,on this standard,it may not.see harry edwards linda elliott,federal standards of review listing an erroneous view of the law,patently arbitrary application of the controlling law,clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,judgment call outside the range of choices permitted,and error in the weighing process by which discretion is exercised as factors cabining the deference owed on abuse of discretion review internal quotations omitted.at its immovable core,the abuse of discretion standard requires a reviewing court to show enough deference to a primary judgment that the court does not reverse merely because it would have come to a different result in the first instance.see henry friendly,indiscretion about discretion,emory,t he trial judge has discretion in those cases where his ruling will not be reversed simply because an appellate court disagrees.the deference that is the hallmark of review,joiner,d,is deference enough to appreciate reasonable disagreement.
the erisa context permits a still more particularized conception of the abuse of discretion standard.first,in erisa cases,the standard equates to reasonableness we will not disturb an erisa administrator discretionary decision if it is reasonable,and will reverse or remand if it is not.firestone,at.booth,at.second,the abuse of discretion standard is less deferential to administrators than an arbitrary and capricious standard would be to be unreasonable is not so extreme as to be irrational.see firestone,at.booth,at.third,an administrator decision is reasonable if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.bernstein capitalcare,cir internal quotation omitted.fourth,the decision must reflect careful attention to the language of the plan,as well as the requirements of erisa itself.booth,at.one adds new assemblages of words to this legal landscape with caution,but it seems on the whole that we require erisa administrators decisions to adhere both to the text of erisa and the plan to which they have contracted to rest on good evidence and sound reasoning and to result from a fair and searching process 
under no formulation,however,may a court,faced with discretionary language like that in the plan instrument in this case,forget its duty of deference and its secondary rather than primary role in determining a claimant right to benefits.the abuse of discretion standard in erisa cases protects important values the plan administrator greater experience and familiarity with plan terms and provisions the enhanced prospects of achieving consistent application of those terms and provisions that results the desire of those who establish erisa plans to preserve at least some role in their administration and the importance of ensuring that funds which are not unlimited go to those who,according to the terms of the plan,are truly dese
