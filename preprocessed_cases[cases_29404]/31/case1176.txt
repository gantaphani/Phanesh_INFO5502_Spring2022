facts and proceedings belowa.the pension plan 
the trust is an express trust established in.pursuant to the terms of various collective bargaining agreements between the southern california district council of laborers and numerous employers associations,the trust created and maintained a pension plan.the plan is a defined benefit pension plan within the meaning of the employee retirement income security act of,as amended erisa.
banuelos right to a pension is governed by the provisions of the pension plan.banuelos is a retired construction laborer who worked within the area covered by the trust from to.he retired from the construction field in and on january,he turned.
when banuelos retired,the pension plan provided for three different forms of regular pension.plan one provided for those people who have completed at least years of credited service plan two for those who completed at least years of credited service and plan three for those who completed at least years of credited service.the plan sets forth the applicable break in service rules and specifies how credits are to be calculated.a worker is credited with one year of service for each year in which he was employed more than hours.a break in service occurs in each calendar year during which the worker completed fewer than hours of service.the undisputed facts show that banuelos years of credited service total no fewer than six years and no more than seven years under any applicable break in service rules.
when banuelos retired,a minimum of credited years were required for a vested pension.in september,however,in a separate lawsuit involving a different worker,banuelos attorney received from the trust a copy of the apparently pension plan.the of that plan states it is the plan version a s amended to june.section e of that version of the plan specifies that only five credited years of service are required for a vested pension.section e of the version of the plan provides that 
an employee who i has accumulated five years of credited service computed as provided in section a and,ii is years or older,and iii has not had a break in service during the period referenced in i above shall have a vested pension.
according to a footnote in this version of the plan,the change was made retroactive to january.because banuelos did not retire until,section e,if valid,would apply to him.
banuelos pension application 
in august of,banuelos submitted an application for a pension to the trust through his attorney.the plan administrator issued a conditional approval based on its calculation that banuelos had earned six years of vesting credit.how because of several breaks in service beginning in,the administrator would not recognize any of the credit years unless banuelos complied with the trust credit year reinstatement provisions which required him to work more hours.
citing the vesting language of section e of the version of the plan,banuelos appealed the administrator computation of his credit hours and his amount of conditional benefits.the pension appeals committee denied banuelos appeal.
on may,banuelos brought this action,seeking declaratory relief and damages for violations of erisa and the age discrimination in employment act.banuelos subsequently dropped his age discrimination in employment act claim.
c.the denial of the summary judgment motions 
both parties filed summary judgment motions.in its motion for summary judgment,the trust alleged that the version of the plan upon which banuelos based his suit was an incorrect version of the pension plan.the trust alleged that the amendment banuelos attorney section e was considered by the board at one time but was never adopted.the trust further alleged that banuelos attorney received the unadopted amendment because it accidentally was compiled with the true plan.the cover letter accompanying the plan given to banuelos attorney from the trust,however,stated that enclosed was the construction laborers pension document,summary plan description dated may with enclosed blue insert on amendments through,plus amendments through.
clearly,evidence of this mistake was not in the administrative record before the plan administrator because the alleged mistake was not discovered until after the plan administrator had made its decision.moreover,the district court found as undisputed fact that the trust mistake claim and the evidence in support thereof are not part of the administrative record.
in banuelos summary judgment motion he argued that pursuant to section e of the version of the plan,he was entitled to a pension.the district court denied both parties motions.relying on evidence outside the administrative record,the district court concluded that there was a triable issue of material fact as to whether section e of the version of the plan was part of the trust plan.
after a bench trial,the district court determined that section e of the version of the plan was not part of the trust plan.the district court remanded the case to the plan administrator to determine if banuelos would be entitled to benefits on the basis of the plan without section e.banuelos appeals the district court denial of his summary judgment motion.banuelos asserts that the district court erred by considering evidence outside the administrative record,and without that evidence he is entitled to a pension under section e as a matter of law.

jurisdiction 
the trust argues that we do not have jurisdiction over banuelos appeal because banuelos is appealing the district court order denying his summary judgment motion after a full trial on the merits,and there has been no final order because the district court only remanded the suit to the plan administrator to determine banuelos benefits under the correct version of the plan.the trust is correct that generally this court will not review a denial of a summary judgment motion after a full trial on the merits.locricchio legal services,cir finding that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not reviewable on an appeal from the final judgment after a full trial on the merits.this is because o rdinarily a denial of a motion for summary judgment is not a final order and thus not appealable.abend mca,cir.
