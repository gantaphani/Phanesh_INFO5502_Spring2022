the life insurance company of north america lina appeals an order granting lynn jewell claim for disability benefits under the employee retirement income security act of,et,erisa,arguing that the district court should not have considered three exhibits from outside the administrative record.jewell,seeking an award of attorney fees and an earlier date for the accrual of prejudgment interest.because we hold that the district court abused its discretion in admitting and considering the exhibits,we reverse its judgment in lina appeal.jewell issues are therefore moot,and his appeal is dismissed.
factual and procedural history 
proceedings before the plan administrator 
lynn jewell was hired by sprint telecommunications venture as a director of national sales and began work on april.sprint employee health benefits plan,in which jewell participated,is underwritten and administered by lina.precisely a year later,on april,jewell filed a claim for disability benefits,stating that he was u nable to perform his job due to severe head pain,dizziness,misspelling,panic attacks where unable to do anything,unable to lead people.depressed.on medications.app.lina determined that he was disabled,paid him benefits of per month from april until they ended in october,and then agreed to pay him benefits.under the terms of the plan,if jewell disability was the result of physical injury or illness,his benefits would last until age.if,however,the disability was caused or contributed to by depression or mental illness,they would expire after two years.app.
in july,lina informed jewell that it was paying under the mental illness limitation and that his benefit payments would end on october.lina terminated jewell benefits on that date,and jewell did not challenge the decision to do so.nearly two years later,around the time his wife abandoned him and left him penniless,jewell requested reconsideration of his benefit termination and reinstatement of the benefit payments,writing that t hose benefits ended due to a,from day one.i should have been diagnosed with physical,organic and traumatic brain injuries,and i had a stroke.this is the actual cause of the cognitive difficulties and symptoms,which have caused me to be disabled.app.he submitted additional medical information,but lina denied his appeal on january.jewell submitted a second appeal on september,along with a list of head injuries he claims he had suffered in the past.lina denied that appeal on november.
proceedings in federal court 
jewell then brought suit against lina in state court in el paso county,colorado,for breach of contract and bad faith.on january,lina removed the action to federal court,where it was converted to an erisa claim arising under a b.lina moved for judgment on the administrative record on june,seeking to supplement the record beyond what lina had compiled during the claim administration process,jewell then moved for permission to augment the record at the time of hearing with expert testimony.app.the district court reserved ruling until specific evidence was presented,and on february,jewell submitted three exhibits he sought to have included in the record.
the first exhibit was a february,letter from bruce peters,jewell neurologist,to mark kane,his attorney.the second was a february,letter from david caster,jewell psychiatrist,to kane.the third was an affidavit executed by jewell on february.the district court accepted briefing from both parties on the admission of this evidence,and issued a written opinion on december.in its opinion,the court began by stating the applicable test for admission of evidence in de novo erisa benefit denial reviews as put forth in our decision in hall unum life insurance of america,cir.it found that the doctors letters and jewell affidavit do appear to include some information not contained in the administrative record that could assist the court in understanding the medical issues in this case.app.the district court then decided to admit the disputed exhibits.
on march,the district court held a hearing on the case,and granted judgment for jewell.the court oral opinion relied heavily on the letters of peters and caster.lina then took this appeal,arguing that the exhibits should not have been admitted under the hall standard and that the district court consideration of them tainted its judgment,requiring reversal.we begin with a discussion of hall and the rules it provides for admission of evidence and then consider,first,whether the doctors letters should have been admitted second,whether jewell affidavit should have been admitted.
ii.discussion 
standard for admission of evidence 
erisa,a comprehensive and reticulated statute,nachman pension benefit guar,d,governs employee benefit plans,including disability benefit plans such as lina.when an individual covered by the plan makes a claim for benefits,the administrator gathers evidence,including the evidentiary submissions of the claimant,and determines under the plan terms whether or not to grant benefits.if the administrator denies the claim,the claimant may bring suit to recover the benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.a b.federal court is the exclusive forum for such suits,as erisa preempts state laws relating to nearly all private employee benefit plans.id.a.
where,as here,a plan administrator did not have discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,district courts will review a benefit denial de novo.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.although erisa provides federal review for benefit denials,this does not entail that federal courts should function as substitute plan administrators.hall,at quoting perry simplicity eng g,cir.consequently we have said that the best way for a district court to implement erisa purposes in this context is ordinarily to restrict de novo review to the administrative record compiled during the claim administration process,instead of taking new evidence,hearing witnesses,and the like.id.at.
confining review in general to the administrative record,and thus encouraging the parties to develop the factual record as fully and as early as possible,is important for a variety of reasons related to the goals of erisa.for instance,it may avert problems related to the loss or staleness of evidence,since federal suits may be brought years after a disputed decision.more importantly,the availability of a complete factual record makes it easier for the plan administrator to come to an objectively correct,determination this,in turn,decreases both the likelihood of subsequent federal litigation and the costs that would be attendant thereto.erisa was designed to promote internal resolution of claims,and to encourage informal and proceedings,and these related aims are promoted by early and full development of the factual record before the administrator,rather than the federal district court.quesinberry life ins.of,cir quoting berry,cir internal quotation marks and further citation omitted.as we indicated in hall,a fully developed administrative record facilitates the goal of prompt resolution of claims by the fiduciary under the erisa scheme.at.and if litigation should ensue,requiring the parties to have developed the record during the claim administration process deters the practice of holding back evidence for presentation to the district court as a fallback or a surprise.
in hall,this court first had occasion to consider the standard for admission of evidence from outside the administrative record in the de novo review of an erisa plan administrator benefit determination.we made clear that it is the unusual case in which the district court should allow supplementation of the record,at,and that only exceptional circumstances could warrant the admission of additional evidence.id.today we again emphasize that erisa policy strongly disfavors expanding the record beyond that which was available to the plan administrator.supplemental evidence should not be used to take a second bite at the apple,but only when necessary to enable the court to understand and evaluate the decision under review.
a party seeking to introduce evidence from outside the administrative record bears a significant burden in establishing that he may do so.in particular,the evidence must be necessary to the district court de novo review the party offering the evidence must demonstrate that it could not have been submitted to the plan administrator at the time the challenged decision was made the evidence must not be c umulative or repetitive nor may it be evidence that is simply better evidence than the claimant mustered for the claim review.hall,at quoting quesinberry,at even then,district courts are not required to admit additional evidence when these circumstances exist because a court may well conclude that the case can be properly resolved on the administrative record without the need to put the parties to additional delay and expense.id.
for guidance in evaluating the necessity of evidence,we listed in hall several examples of the exceptional circumstances which could warrant the admission of additional evidence.id.those situations include 
claims that require consideration of complex medical questions or issues regarding the credibility of medical experts the availability of very limited administrative review procedures with little or no evidentiary record the necessity of evidence regarding interpretation of the terms of the plan rather than specific historical facts instances where the payor and the administrator are the same entity and the court is concerned about impartiality claims which would have been insurance contract claims prior to erisa and circumstances in which there is additional evidence that the claimant could not have presented in the administrative process.
id.quoting quesinberry,at.these are not exceptions to the hall rule they are merely examples of circumstances that might militate in favor of a finding of necessity.the existence of one or more of these circumstances does not make evidence automatically admissible,for if it did,then supplementation of the record would not be limited to unusual cases or extraordinary circumstances.this would undermin e the goal of not making district courts substitute plan administrators.id.at quoting quesinberry,at.district courts must conduct analysis to determine whether all four prongs of the hall test are met.
this court reviews the district court ultimate determination under hall for an abuse of discretion.
letters of peters and caster 
the district court entire explanation of its decision to admit the letters of peters and caster was the brief statement that they do appear to include some information not contained in the administrative record that could assist the court in understanding the medical issues in this case.app.that thin basis,however,is insufficient for admitting evidence under hall,and a full analysis according to our precedent does not support admission of the letters either.
in making a discretionary decision,a court must present an explanation for its choice sufficient to enable a reviewing court to determine that it did not act thoughtlessly,but instead considered the factors relevant to its decision and in fact exercised its discretion.patton life fin,cir see also,northrop grumman,cir district court must explain its discretionary denial of prejudgment interest okland oil conoco,cir district court must provide adequate explanation of its discretionary denial of costs.here,the district court accurately recited the terms of the hall test,but its conclusory analysis failed to explain how the doctors letters might meet these requirements for admissibility.
to be sure,the district court stated that the letters could assist the court in its review.app.but evidence that is potentially helpful is not perforce necessary to the district court de novo review,hall at emphasis added.we discuss the nuances of the term necessary below,see infra,but suffice it here to say that the word connotes a stronger requirement than the mere possibility of utility.and although the district court opinion shows that the letters were not merely cumulative or repetitive of the other evidence already in the record,hall,at,it does nothing to indicate that the other factors of the hall test were met.specifically,the court did not explain why this evidence could not have been submitted to the plan administrator at the time the challenged decision was made,or why it was not simply better evidence than the claimant mustered for the claim review.id.quoting quesinberry,at.without more than its meager finding that the letters might perhaps be useful,the district court should not have admitted them.
if our own analysis of the letters showed that they were admissible on a basis the district court did not provide,we may nonetheless affirm in the interest of efficiency and judicial economy.id.at quoting ohlander larson,cir see also hill smithkline beecham,cir.applying the hall test ourselves further persuades us that the letters admission was an abuse of discretion.
necessity of evidence 
first,evidence must be necessary to the district court de novo review.hall,at.necessary is a term with a spectrum of meanings.at one end,it may import an absolute physical necessity,so strong,that one thing,to which another may be termed necessary,can not exist without that other at the opposite,it may simply mean no more than that one thing is convenient,or useful,or essential to another.maryland,wheat.colautti franklin,d necessary in abortion statute suggested indispensable comm r tellier,d necessary in tax statute meant appropriate and helpful.neither end of this spectrum,we think,is appropriate here.
too strict a view of necessity is foreclosed by our very holding in hall.there,we allowed admission of evidence regarding two surgeries which took place after the closing of the administrative record.the decisive issue in hall was the degree of the plaintiff enduring pain,and we agreed with the district court that the fact the plaintiff chose to undergo the surgeries was strong evidence that her pain was real and unrelenting.at internal quotation marks omitted.the evidence was not,however,absolutely indispensable to reviewing the plan administrator decision.on the other hand,necessary evidence in this context can not be evidence that is merely convenient,or useful,or conducive to the end of conducting review,wheat.at.if this were what the term meant,the admission of evidence would not be limited to unusual cases or extraordinary circumstances,as we require.see hall,at quoting quesinberry,at 
rather,the term necessary,as we used it in hall,must be harmonized with its context.armour wantock.we are guided by our qualification in hall,following the fourth circuit opinion in quesinberry,that evidence may be admitted when necessary to conduct an adequate de novo review of the benefit decision.hall,at emphasis added quoting quesinberry,at.if,for instance,the administrator based its decision on information not in the on principles generally known within the medical district court likely could not meaningfully review the decision without the admission of that evidence.or if the court can not understand abstruse medical terminology central to the issues of a case,the claimant may supplement the record with explanatory evidence.likewise,if the administrator simply neglected to include in the record exhibits the claimant had submitted to it,those may be offered to the district court.even necessary evidence,however,may only be admitted if the other three prongs of the hall test are satisfied.the consequences of a record insufficient to allow meaningful review will be borne by the party responsible for the insufficiency.
jewell suggests that admission of the letters of peters and caster was justified by one or more of the exceptional circumstances which we said in hall could warrant the admission of additional evidence.at.first,jewell argues that the proper diagnosis of his disorder is a complex medical question and requires additional explanatory evidence.appellee opening br.the letters,however,provide no assistance to a court seeking to resolve on de novo review the medical complexities of the case.they state a diagnosis,but there are other diagnoses already in the peters and caster as well as from four other doctors.the letters do not elucidate the medical principles or terminology,nor offer any account of how the facts support the diagnosis.the letters are,in a sense,black boxes facts go in,diagnoses come out.when doctors offer new or revised diagnoses several years after the fact,one would expect to see explanations of what has changed and why.a doctor mere announcement of a new conclusion is not evidence genuinely directed toward helping a court engage in de novo review of the decision previously made.
second,jewell argues that,by disbelieving what he claims was his doctors diagnosis of an organic disorder,lina put the doctors credibility at issue.the question of the credibility of an opposed to the question of the reliability of the expert whether the expert is believable.see,washington schriver,cir.credibility embraces such matters as professional qualifications,mental capacity,bias and interest,and bad moral character.so,for instance,the size of an expert fee or the fact that he only testifies for plaintiffs in civil cases may be relevant to his credibility.see edward imwinkelried,the silence speaks volumes.whether,as is important here,these doctors were correct,or whether their conclusions were based on sufficient evidence and sound medical science,bears on their credibility in no genuine sense.and although lina brief before this court contains a few vague references to the doctors them loyal to jewell and stating that for reasons we do not know,a few doctors agreed to modify their diagnoses,appellant opening br,comments were in reaction to the recent letters the letters were not responsive to any challenges to the doctors credibility.even if they were,the statements and diagnoses contained in these letters have nothing to do with the doctors qualifications,bias or interest,or the like.we can not conclude that consideration of these letters would be at all helpful to evaluating the doctors credibility,properly understood still less that the district court could not conduct meaningful review without them.
jewell further argues that the letters are necessary to prove that his disability is ongoing.caster letter,in particular,indicates that,although jewell financial situation had improved by the time of writing,nevertheless this man can not be gainfully employed,and his sic is unable to adequately function,not only because of poor cognitive processing and poor attention and difficulties around cognition,but also because of a worsening at these times of his depression.app.lina,however,does not contest that jewell is disabled,or indeed that he has been since it began paying him benefits in.the issue in this case is the cause of his disability,not its duration.nor has jewell presented any evidence or argument tending to show that the ongoing character of his disability would be proof of an organic cause.because the necessity of evidence must be established by its proponent,see hall,at,jewell has not met his burden with respect to this argument.
inability to present evidence during administrative process 
second,the party attempting to bring evidence before the district court which it did not offer to the plan administrator must demonstrate that the evidence could not have been submitted at the time the challenged decision was made.hall,at during the claims administration process a claimant must come forward with all evidence which he knows or should know.see davidson prudential ins.of,cir.by evidence,we of course mean not just the particular document or testimony that a claimant might offer to the district court,but its substance.
in this case,then,it is not enough for jewell to demonstrate that he could not have offered to lina the particular letters in question.the letters were written some thirteen months after this litigation was commenced in state court,so meeting that requirement would be trivial.rather,he must show that the information contained in those letters was not of a substance known to him,or which should have been known to him,during the administrative process.we agree with the eighth circuit that where additional evidence,now believed by the claimant to be necessary to the benefit determination,is created after litigation had begun,but was known or should have been known to the claimant during the administrative proceedings,the claimant subsequent proffer of that evidence amounts to nothing more than a attempt to quarrel with the administrator benefit determination,and should not be permitted.id.emphasis added.
in the first disputed letter,dated february,peters states that he had conducted three examinations of jewell on december,november,and january.peters notes from those examinations were already in the administrative record compiled by lina.jewell has offered no reason why he could not have solicited this explanatory letter promptly,instead of waiting two years after the last examination to do so.nor do the contents of the letter seem to be outside the scope of information that was known or should have been known to jewell during the administrative process.the only new matter of real substance in the letter is the claim that jewell could be diagnosed with complex partial seizure disorder,apparently an organic defect,on the basis of his clinical history alone,and that any type of seizure is never diagnosed on the basis of an electroencephalogram.app.but in the same letter peters states that this method of diagnosing seizures is and even axiomatic in the neurologic community.app.if so,it is information jewell should have known,and could have presented to the plan administrator,long before.peters letter,therefore,fails under this prong of the hall admissibility test.see also davidson,at.
the second disputed letter,that of caster dated february,begins by reprinting verbatim the six paragraphs of a letter from caster which was already in the administrative record.the next paragraph contains information relating to the period up to june,which could have been presented to lina during jewell administrative appeals.the final paragraph,however,contains a statement that jewell had suffered grand mal seizures in march and july,names the medicines jewell was subsequently prescribed specifically to treat seizure activity and other manifestations of his organic mental disorder,and opines that jewell condition continued to be completely disabling up to the time the letter was written.app.the first seizure was reported by caster elsewhere in the record in an april,note.the rest,however,was new information concerning events that had not occurred by the time the administrative record was closed the second seizure and subsequent treatment history could not have been presented to lina during the claim administration.these portions of caster letter accordingly would survive the second prong of the hall test.
cumulative and repetitive evidence 
in an ordinary trial,evidence,even though relevant,may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of needless presentation of cumulative evidence.the trial judge discretion is wide,because cumulative evidence is excluded in the interests of trial efficiency,time management,and jury comprehension.united states oil.under hall,however,a judge must refuse admission to any evidence that is c umulative or repetitive.at.in this context,the concern is not only that cumulative evidence is a waste of time,but also,as discussed above,that all relevant evidence should be developed and presented to the plan administrator as early as possible.parties may not easily be able to judge at the administrative stage whether evidence will be important or merely cumulative.accordingly,under hall,the exclusion of new,cumulative evidence is not merely discretionary,so as to avoid waste of time it is mandatory,to spur the presentation of all potentially relevant evidence to the administrator.
evidence is cumulative if its probative effect is already achieved by other evidence in the record that is,if the small increment of probability it adds may not warrant the time spent in introducing it.united states davis,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.it is d
