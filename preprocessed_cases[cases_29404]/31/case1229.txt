this action arises under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.hans gerd rasenack seeks accidental paralysis and rehabilitation benefits from aig life insurance company,the insurer,and aig claim services,the plan administrator collectively,aig.the district court reviewed the administrator denial of benefits under an arbitrary and capricious standard and granted summary judgment for aig.we reverse and remand.
on may,rasenack,then years old,was struck as a pedestrian by a driver while saying goodnight to his friends in front of his home.the collision launched rasenack approximately feet through the air.he was severely injured and remained in a coma for approximately three weeks.
on june,rasenack was transferred to kindred hospital.he was transferred again on july,this time to craig hospital,where he was admitted to a brain rehabilitation program.rasenack remained at craig hospital until october,and received outpatient treatment thereafter.alan weintraub,the medical director of the brain injury program at craig hospital,served as rasenack regular treating physician throughout the course of his treatment.for the sake of clarity and brevity,we save the remaining details of rasenack medical treatment for part iii of the opinion.
at the time of the accident,rasenack was insured under an accidental death and dismemberment ad d policy issued to his employer,marriott international,by aig life insurance company and administered by aig claim services.both the insurer and the administrator are owned by american international group.rasenack purchased the ad d coverage through payroll deductions.in addition to accidental death and dismemberment,the policy provides an accidental paralysis benefit.at issue here is the policy hemiplegia provision the policy defines hemiplegia as the complete and irreversible paralysis of upper and lower limbs of the same side of the body.aplt.app.at.the policy defines limb as the entire arm or entire leg.id.the policy does not define paralysis.id.the covered loss,hemiplegia must occur within one year of date of the accident.
the policy provides ad d benefits for hemiplegia in the amount of one half of the principal sum.rasenack principal sum is.the policy also provides a rehabilitation benefit for expenses incurred within two years of the accident up to a maximum of.the rehabilitation benefit is only payable where the insured suffers an accidental dismemberment or an accidental paralysis for which an accidental dismemberment or paralysis benefit is payable under the policy.id.
jessica tribolet,rasenack spouse and duly appointed guardian and conservator,filed a claim for ad d and rehabilitation benefits on july,asserting that rasenack suffer ed what the summary plan describes as loss of use of both of his legs as well as his left arm.id.at.the plan provides that claims will be processed within ninety days unless special circumstances warrant an exception it instructs that in no event will processing take longer than days.these deadlines track the erisa regulations.on november,sixteen months after tribolet filed the claim,aig denied it,concluding that rasenack did not suffer from hemiplegia as defined by the policy.
tribolet submitted a timely administrative appeal on january,the summary plan description spd provides that aig will render a decision within sixty days unless special circumstances require an extension of an additional sixty days.on august,several months past the deadline for a decision on appeal,tribolet and rasenack filed a complaint in federal district court seeking a declaration that rasenack is entitled to benefits and an order requiring aig to pay him benefits under.on august,aig belatedly denied the administrative appeal 
on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court denied rasenack motion and granted aig.the court determined,as a matter of first impression,that the proper standard of review of the administrative decision was arbitrary and capricious,not de novo as plaintiffs urged.the court held that aig interpretation of the term hemiplegia was reasonable,and that there was substantial evidence that rasenack condition did not meet the policy definition.
on appeal,rasenack argues the correct standard of review of the plan administrator decision is de novo and the administrative record establishes that he suffers from hemiplegia as defined by the policy and is therefore eligible for benefits.
we review de novo the district court determination of the proper standard to apply in its review of an erisa plan administrator decision degrado jefferson pilot fin.ins,cir.erisa authorizes a judicial action challenging an administrative denial of benefits but does not specify the standard of review that courts should apply.see a b.applying the principles of trust law,the supreme court resolved this question in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,holding that a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.the parties do not dispute that the plan grants aig this discretionary authority.the plan provides,the insurance company retains sole and absolute final discretion to determine eligibility for benefits,to construe the terms of the policy and to resolve any factual issues relevant to benefits.aplt.app.at.
under trust principles,a deferential standard of review is appropriate when trustees actually exercise a discretionary power vested in them by the instrument under which they act.firestone,at.following firestone,we made clear in gilbertson allied signal,cir,that not only must the administrator be given discretion by the plan,but the administrator decision in a given case must be a valid exercise of that discretion.accord jebian hewlett packard,cir nichols prudential ins.of,cir gritzer cbs,cir matuszak torrington,cir applying de novo review where administrator only offered reasons for denial during the course of litigation restatement second of trusts,cmt.h i f the trustee without knowledge of or inquiry into the relevant circumstances and merely as a result of his arbitrary decision or whim exercises or fails to exercise a power,the court will interpose.
the question before us in gilbertson was whether a plan administrator with discretionary authority whose delay in deciding a claim results in its being deemed denied is entitled to judicial deference.gilbertson,at.we concluded that deference was not required,explaining 
it follows that where the plan and applicable regulations place temporal limits on the administrator discretion and the administrator fails to render a final decision within those limits,the administrator deemed denied decision is by operation of law rather than the exercise of discretion,and thus falls outside the firestone exception.
id.by the same analysis,in this case the administrator failed to render a final decision within the temporal limits.thus,the remedies were deemed exhausted by operation of law rather than the exercise of administrative discretion,and firestone rule of deference does not apply 
in holding so,we are not persuaded by aig argument that the amendments to erisa somehow abrogated the gilbertson rule.the amendments replaced in part the deemed denied provision which permitted a claimant to file suit if the administrator failed to respond to a claim within a certain prescribed period with the following paragraph 
in the case of the failure of a plan to establish or follow claims procedures consistent with the requirements of this section,a claimant shall be deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan and shall be entitled to pursue any available remedies under section a of the act on the basis that the plan has failed to provide a reasonable claims procedure that would yield a decision on the merits of the claim.
k l.this change does not alter our conclusion that when an administrator violates the statutory deadlines incorporated into the plan,firestone deference no longer applies.the amendments have,however,called into question the continuing validity of the substantial compliance test we have used to avoid creating a rule that would automatically permit de novo review for every violation of the deadlines.gilbertson,at see also kellogg metro.life ins,cir leaving open the question whether a decision made in the absence of the mandated procedural protections should be entitled to any judicial deference.finley hewlett packard.employee benefits org.income prot.plan,cir same because aig has failed gilbertson substantial compliance test,as we discuss below,we need not decide whether a minor violation of the deadlines or other procedural irregularities would entitle the claimant to de novo review under the amendments.see kellogg,at we find it unnecessary to conclusively decide the continuing validity of the substantial compliance rule because,even assuming its continued existence,there can be little doubt that metlife was not in substantial compliance with the erisa deadlines.
in gilbertson,at,we noted that courts have been willing to overlook administrators failure to meet certain procedural requirements when the administrator has substantially complied with the regulations and the process as a whole fulfills the broader purposes of erisa and its accompanying regulations.under this substantial compliance exception,in the context of an ongoing,good faith exchange of information between the administrator and the claimant,inconsequential violations of the deadlines or other procedural irregularities would not entitle the claimant to de novo review.id.we elaborated an administrator who fails to render a timely decision can only be in substantial compliance with erisa procedural requirements if there is an ongoing productive process in which the claimant is kept reasonably as to the status of the claim and the kinds of information that will satisfy the administrator.id.at.pursuant to this test,a plan administrator is in substantial compliance with a deadline if the delay is inconsequential and in the context of an,exchange of information between the administrator and the claimant.finley,at.
rasenack submitted his claim on july.the nurse hired by aig to interview rasenack met with him on december,and submitted her report the next day.following receipt of the nurse report,aig requested an outside review of rasenack medical record.the reviewing physician submitted his opinion letter on february,the last date of notable activity until aig november,claim denial eight months later.while aig did contact tribolet on july,with an administrative update,we do not consider a single contact over such a long span of time to be an,good faith exchange of information.id.rasenack appeal was met with similar delays.the appeal was filed on january,and a second reviewing physician submitted a report on may,but the appeal was not denied until august.
aig has not offered any explanation for these delays,other than to point out that in the fall of it had difficulty contacting rasenack and his wife to schedule an interview but the interview was successfully completed in december,and the claim was not denied until november.in sum,we agree with the district court assessment that the administrator delays in the initial and appellate decisions were months beyond the deadlines imposed by the policy and erisa and not simply the result of delays by plaintiffs,which amounted to a few weeks at most,or a good faith exchange of information.aplt.app.at.based on the foregoing,we conclude that aig has not met the substantial compliance standard,and aig delays in denying both the initial claim and the appeal are not excusable.
finally,aig argues that de novo review under gilbertson only applies where the administrator never issued a final decision on the merits.because aig eventually did deny both rasenack initial claim and his appeal,aig reasons,the proper standard is arbitrary and capricious.we have not previously read gilbertson holding so narrowly,and we decline to do so here.the fact that aig finally issued a letter denying rasenack appeal several weeks after rasenack filed suit does not distinguish this case from one in which the insurer never issued a final decision.in fact,we applied gilbertson to just such a scenario in finley,at.there,because the administrator did not respond to the claimant administrative appeal until after the deadline had passed,the claimant appeal was considered deemed denied under the erisa regulations.id.at.we held that gilbertson was applicable and proceeded to consider whether any exceptions to its general de novo rule applied.id.at.
the relevant fact is that the administrator failed to render a final decision within the temporal limits prescribed by the plan and erisa.gilbertson,at.as rasenack points out,permitting plan administrators to avoid de novo review by belatedly denying an appeal after the deadline has passed and the claimant has filed suit would conflict with the erisa stated purposes,namely protect ing the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries,by establishing standards of conduct,responsibility,and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans,and by providing for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.b.accordingly,we apply a de novo standard of review to rasenack claim for benefits.
we next turn to the merits of rasenack eligibility for benefits.we review the district court decision to grant summary judgement de novo.pitman blue cross blue shield of,cir.as to the scope of our de novo review,we have sided with the majority of our sister circuits in agreeing with the fourth circuit that the best way to implement erisa purposes in this context is ordinarily to restrict de novo review to the administrative record,but to allow the district court to supplement that record when circumstances clearly establish that additional evidence is necessary to conduct an adequate de novo review of the benefit decision.hall unum life ins.of,cir quoting quesinberry life ins.of,cir en banc.
policy construction 
our first task is to determine whether the policy is ambiguous.we interpret the policy according to its plain meaning.kellogg,at.under federal common law,the proper inquiry is not what the provider intended a term to signify rather,we consider the common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person in the position of the plan participant would have understood the words to mean.miller monumental life ins,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.ambiguity exists when a plan provision is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning,or where there is uncertainty as to the meaning of the term.admin.comm.of wal mart assocs.health welfare plan willard,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the doctrine of contra proferentem,which construes all ambiguities against the drafter,applies to de novo review of erisa plans.miller,at.erisa imposes upon providers a fiduciary duty similar to the one trustees owe trust beneficiaries.just as a trustee must conduct his dealings with a beneficiary with the utmost degree of honesty and transparency,an erisa provider is required to clearly delineate the scope of its obligations.id.at internal citation omitted.finally,the insured has the burden of showing that a covered loss has occurred,while the insurer has the burden of showing that a loss falls within an exclusionary clause of the policy.pitman,at.
rasenack contends the policy hemiplegia provision is ambiguous.he argues the policy definition of hemiplegia as complete and irreversible paralysis is wholly dependent on the meaning of paralysis,which the policy does not define.aig responds that the definition of hemiplegia carries a plain meaning,that the entire arm and leg of one side of the body must be completely paralyzed.aple.br.at.aig explains how it arrived at this interpretation 
aig,based on guidance from medical experts,determined that complete and irreversible paralysis on one side of the body means no movement at all of the left or right side.aig determined that the plan required that,as a necessary condition of such paralysis,there be no movement in the relevant extremities.lack of sensation or weakness might also be present in paralysis,but the fundamental underlying requirement for benefits for hemiplegia was that there be no movement at all of the entire arm and entire leg of the same side of the body,and that such paralysis be complete and irreversible.
id.at emphasis in original,internal citation omitted.in other words,anything less than no movement at all would not be complete paralysis.id.
we agree that the policy is ambiguous for its failure to define paralysis.aig interpretation of paralysis as limited to the absence of movement may be reasonable.but the question that confronts us is not whether their interpretation is reasonable,but whether there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the plan.miller,at.rasenack points us to mosby medical dictionary,which defines paralysis as the loss of muscle function,loss of sensation,or both and complete paralysis as paralysis characterized by a complete loss of motor function.mosby medical,nursing,and allied health dictionary,ed.motor is defined as.pertaining to motion,the body apparatus involved in movement,or the brain functions that direct purposeful activities.pertaining to muscle,nerve or brain center that produces or subserves motion.id.at.function is defined as.an act,process or series of processes that serve a purpose.to perform an activity or to work properly or normally.id.at emphasis added.other medical dictionaries similarly define paralysis in terms of loss of muscle function or sensation,not as the absence of all movement.see,matthew bender attorneys dictionary of medicine p defining paralysis as a condition marked by loss of muscle function,by the inability of the muscles to contract and noting l ess frequently,the term paralysis applies to a loss of sensation.see also webster new international dictionary ed.defining paralysis as a complete or partial loss of function involving the power of motion or of sensation in any part of the body.in fact,the summary plan description spd contains a chart classifying the various types of accidental loss in which it describes hemiplegia as the loss of use of both upper and lower limb on same side of body.aplt.app.at.we conclude that there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the meaning of paralysis,and the plan is thus ambiguous for its failure to define the term.see miller,at.
aig suggests that the plan definition of hemiplegia as complete and irreversible paralysis saves it from ambiguity.but complete and irreversible modifies paralysis,and therefore the definition still rests on the meaning of paralysis.we therefore apply the doctrine of contra proferentem and strictly construe the ambiguity against aig.id.at.we have explained the policy rationale behind contra proferentem strictly construing ambiguous terms presents erisa providers with a clear alternative draft plans that reasonable people can understand or pay for ambiguity.miller,at.here,aig easily could have defined paralysis,the key term in the definition of hemiplegia.it seeks to limit the definition to the absence of movement,but the term is not so limited in medical dictionaries and aig did not so define it.strictly construing the policy language against aig,we consider complete and irreversible paralysis to mean the complete and irreversible loss of muscle function or sensation,not the absence of all movement 
the final matter regarding construction of the policy concerns the plan requirement that the loss occur to an insured person within days of the accident.aplt.app.at see also summary plan description,aplt.app.at to be eligible for benefits,the covered loss must occur within one year from the date of the accident.rasenack interprets this provision to mean we may only consider his medical state during the first days following his accident.on appeal,aig does not object to this interpretation in fact,aig included this phrasing in the questionnaire it sent to one of the reviewing physicians,asking whether the paralysis occur red within days of the may,accident date.id.at.we note,however,that aig did not limit its review to the day period the administrative denial references rasenack progress in the last couple of years.id.at.
review of the administrative record 
resolving the plan ambiguity in rasenack favor,we proceed to our review of the record.the first piece of relevant information is a preadmission assessment dated june,performed by nurse karen hildebrand from craig hospital.she noted that rasenack had no volitional or spontaneous movement on his left side and only very limited movement in his right upper and lower extremities.on july,in a referral update,nurse hildebrand noted that rasenack left side remained plegic.on july,the date of rasenack admission to craig hospital,weintraub wrote in the section entitled history of present illness he is moving the right upper extremity more so than the lower extremity and does not move the left side.id.at emphasis added.in the neurologic section,weintraub recorded the left upper extremity is plegic and spastic,held in an extensor position.left lower extremity is plegic as well,spastic and hyperreflexic he had a painful sense with pressure throughout the entire left extremities.id.at emphasis added.under impressions,weintraub noted rasenack condition as bilateral hemiparesis,left worse than right.id 
a brain injury evaluation performed by a physical therapist at craig hospital on october,noted that rasenack required assistance for all functional mobility and had limited left upper extremity uses.id.at.an outpatient rounds note,dated october,describes rasenack progress after one week of outpatient care 
pt reports that the patient is physically making good progress.he is now minimum assist for squat pivot transfers he is,in therapy,walking in the parallel bars for two lengths,which is approximately feet,with minimum assistance and verbal cues the patient can do most and uses his left for a stabilizer.active movement is increased in his left upper extremity muscle groups,which is important as the patient was left dominant.
id.at emphasis added.in a clinic note dated november,weintraub observed 
hans gerd is making nice progress.he is improving in his ambulation.he is still using an assistive device.he is starting to navigate stairs.he is gaining range of motion and strength of the left side.he still has limits in range of motion at the left elbow,left knee and ankle that in the future he may need some surgery in this regard.
id.at.on february,weintraub noted,we discussed the eventual goal of household ambulation with a walker we anticipate the need for wheelchair use for longer distances,over the next six months.id.at.
nurse kellianne boris,hired by aig to assist with the processing of rasenack claim,interviewed him in december,seven months after the day period had passed.rasenack remained belted into a wheelchair for the duration of the interview,and nurse boris did not observe any leg movements.he did occasionally squeeze a therapy ball with his left hand,but she did not see him make any other motions with the left hand.id.in correspondence with aig,nurse boris advised that weintraub used the term hemiparesis,but that it means the same as hemiplegia.id.at.
we turn next to the assessments of weintraub,rasenack treating physician,and ronald devere and james sarno,the physicians hired by aig to review rasenack file.when weintraub was asked by aig in october whether rasenack suffered hemiplegia,he responded affirmatively,yes,the accidental injury did result in hemiplegia.id.at.he stated that rasenack paralysis does appear to be complete and irreversible,although from a quantitative standpoint,he has benefitted from rehabilitation treatment.id.
in february,aig sought review from an outside physician.it sent devere the claim file as well as a series of questions to complete.we quote aig questions indicated by italics and devere answers at length,as they are instructive 
did rasenack sustain any of the above paralysis conditions as a direct result of the may,accident according to the medical records,the best that i can tell from the detailed review is that this claimant was comatose and very poorly responsive the first few weeks of his hospital stay after the injury it appears from his current evaluations and throughout his progress in the last couple of years,that he currently has a left hemiparesis involving the left arm and left leg.hemiparesis is a weakness of the left arm and leg,or right arm and leg,weakness in one side of the body due to a disturbance in brain function he does not appear to be hemiplegic,which means no movement at all of the left or right side i t appears that the claimant has some movement and strength in the left arm and leg,which classifies the weakness as hemiparesis.
did the paralysis occur within days of the may accident date it appears that the hemiparesis,which is the term that i am using,occurred within days of the may,accident date.
does he have complete and irreversible paralysis of the entire limbs according to the recent notes of november of,the claimant still continued to have hemiparesis.the exact details of that weakness are not evident on review of the record.there is no detailed evaluation of specific muscle groups in his left arm and leg in regard to how much weakness there is.hemiparesis is the only term used.i can not give you a definite description of function of his left arm and leg muscles because of the incompleteness of records available for my review at this time.after this length of time,which is almost two years,there is a remote possibility that he could make a little bit more improvement.but more likely than not,he would not improve much more in his weakness of his left upper and left lower extremities after the next months.
if the paralysis is not complete,but permanent,please indicate his level of functioning regarding activities of daily living,ambulation,and transfer m ost likely his hemiparesis is likely permanent,but not complete.the exact level of functioning of his left arm and leg and capabilities is poorly described in the medical records that i have reviewed.the best i can state from the information available to me is that the claimant still requires continued assistance and supervision for all of his activities of daily living it appears that he has some function of his left upper and left lower extremities that enable him to assist in these activities of daily living unfortunately,the specific functional abilities of his left arm and leg are not well documented or described in this record to give you any further information 
one of the letters from the insurance company to one of the claim examiners asked about weintraub response that the accident resulted in hemiplegia with severe balance and coordination difficulties and the paralysis appears complete and irreversible.as stated previously,in all medical probability,i believe that the current state of the claimant is a hemiparesis,which i have already defined,and which may very well be complete and irreversible at this point in time,the beginning of.
devere undoubtedly concluded that rasenack suffered from hemiparesis,not hemiplegia,a distinction that became the basis for aig denial of rasenack claim.it is less clear whether or not devere considered rasenack to be completely and irreversibly paralyzed.he did not say,for example in response to question,that because rasenack has hemiparesis,he is not paralyzed.rather,devere predicts that the weakness will not improve much.id.at.in response to question,he indicated that the hemiparesis is permanent but not complete,but then later that it may very well be complete and irreversible.id.at.significantly,he stressed repeatedly that the records were insufficient regarding the exact level of functioning of rasenack left arm and left leg.finally,the file devere reviewed did not contain the medical records from craig hospital dated june,july,and july,which were notable as early assessments of rasenack condition.
aig hired a second outside physician,sarno,to review rasenack file while the appeal was pending.aig asked sarno whether the accidental injury resulted in hemiplegia.he responded 
no this claimant is a hemiparetic with the left lower extremity worse than the left upper extremity.the left lower extremity is spastic and rigid and demonstrates a righting reaction which keeps him up.the left upper extremity is also spastic and limited.however,he is able to use it somewhat in helping the right side in various activities of daily living.although he was a left handed individual prior to this,he can no longer use that left hand the way he did previously.hemiplegic means paralysis of one side of the body.there was no paralysis of either side.he is able to use the left side the word hemiparesis applies to this situation.the fact that he had sensory loss has nothing to do with hemiplegia.that is a hemisensory dysfunction based on the injury to the sensory parietal cortex the posterior frontal cortex for motor activity.
id.at.in response to the question,is the paralysis complete and irreversible,sarno concluded,the claimant has made significant strides.nonetheless he has a significant hemiparesis on the left side.this will be permanent.he may have some slight improvement but beyond what he has presently i doubt that there will be much more improvement.id.emphasis added.in the comment section,sarno wrote,this person is one who sit s on the cusp,enough to be called hemiparetic and not enough to be hemiplegic or uniplegic.he is severely disabled and will be disabled permanent sic and totally but just outside the meaning of this policy.id.at.
trioblet submitted a detailed affidavit regarding her husband condition.she reported that he had no control over or sensation in the left side of his body during the days following the accident.she explained that the references to movement in the medical record refer to therapists placing rasenack arms and legs in a passive motion machine.she provided the following chronology 
at the time he transferred to craig hospital,hans gerd could move only his right hand and occasionally but not consistently,he could twitch the toes of his right foot.the left side of his body,including left arm and left leg,remained paralyzed throughout the days after the accident,hans gerd did not have muscular control or sensation in his left arm and left leg from a standing position,hans gerd learned to lift his left foot off the floor and swing it forward with his hips.his left leg and left foot remain straight and stiff during this motion.he swings his left leg in a arc so it lands in front.he maintains balance by grasping my shoulder with his right hand.hans gerd uses his stiff left leg to bear weight like an amputee uses a prosthesis.this imitation of walking is only possible with assistance from me or a therapist.using a walker for support,hans gerd can move forward,if i am beside him or behind him to give verbal cues and prevent falls.without a walker and human assistance,hans gerd can not walk.
the overall picture that emerges from the record is that rasenack was unable to move his left arm and leg immediately after the accident but made some gains in mobility and strength as a result of intense physical therapy over the course of the year following the accident.in the letter to rasenack denying his claim for benefits,aig explained its decision 
after careful review of the information received,we have determined that we must decline payment of this claim as there is no evidence in the information received that you sustained a complete and irreversible paralysis of your limbs.rather,it appears that you have hemiparesis and are not paraplegic or hemiplegic.
id.at.aig provided a similar explanation in its letter denying rasenack administrative appeal the committee reviewed the entire administrative records of this claim and concluded that the record contains substantial evidence that hans gerd rasenack did not sustain a complete and irreversible paralysis of his limbs rather,it appears that he has hemiparesis and is not paraplegic or hemiplegic.id.at.in the section entitled pertinent facts,aig also noted,in addition,you failed to file the proof of loss and notice within the time line set forth in the policy and summary plan description.id.at.
