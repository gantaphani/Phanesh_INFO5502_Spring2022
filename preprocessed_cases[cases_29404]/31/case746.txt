george klein,the trustee of his company employee benefit plans,agreed to terminate and distribute the plans assets to its participants in order to settle a lawsuit with the department of labor.but instead of marking the end of his scrape with the department,the consent decree proved to be only the beginning.klein and his wife were also participants in the plans,and klein finagled the termination so that they would receive more than their fair share.the department,unwilling to let him off the hook,asked the magistrate judge sidney schenkier,sitting with the consent of the parties,who had entered the consent decree,to intercede.the judge did just that,removing klein as the trustee,forcing the sale of property formerly owned by the plans,and ordering klein to make restorative payments.klein now appeals these decisions.
george klein apparently is the president and sole stockholder of current development corporation cdc,a real estate acquisition and development company.cdc sponsored two employee benefit plans that are covered by the employee retirement income security act,erisa,which were administered and controlled by klein.both klein and cdc are defendants in this case,but for simplicity sake,and because they are essentially the same,we will refer to both as klein.
from what we can glean from the record,klein problems started with his failure to timely submit some annual reports to the department of labor.the problems snowballed from there.the department first filed suit in the district court because klein dipped into the plans funds to pay the legal expenses for his unsuccessful defense in the related administrative action.klein and the department reached a settlement in that case,which was embodied in a consent decree.in it,the parties acknowledged that klein had paid back the legal fees and klein agreed to terminate the plans,distributing the and a vacant parcel of land in westmont,the plan participants.the consent decree enjoined klein from violating his fiduciary duties under erisa,and,as is common in consent decrees,the court retained jurisdiction to enforce compliance with the judgment.
to terminate the plans,klein informed participants that they could take their share of the assets in either cash or in a combination of cash and a stake in the property owned by the plans.almost everyone opted to take cash one person elected to receive his share in a mixture of cash and property,which left klein and his wife with a percent interest in the land.meanwhile,and unbeknownst to the participants,klein was negotiating with the village of westmont to sell the property.some early negotiations had fallen by the wayside through no fault of klein,but by september,the village was ready to buy the property for million.klein rejected this offer and,three weeks later,cashed out the plan participants by then the two plans had merged.he calculated these payments off of an earlier appraisal of the property for million dollars,without regard to the village offer for more.
it was long before the department got wind of klein negotiations with the village so it filed a motion,arguing that by low balling the value of the property klein had shortchanged the participants who received their distributions in cash.since the property was worth more than the million,and klein and his wife all but owned it,the calculations would give the kleins more than they deserved.the department sought klein removal as the plan trustee,the appointment of an independent fiduciary in his stead,and the distribution to the participants of klein gains.over objections,the judge concluded that klein actions amounted to a breach of his duty of loyalty to the participants.the judge removed him as the trustee,appointed consulting fiduciaries,cfi to be the independent fiduciary,and placed the westmont property in a constructive trust,under cfi care.cfi continued to negotiate with the village for the sale of the property,and the two eventually settled on a price tag of million.klein filed a series of unsuccessful motions in hopes of stopping the sale,but the court rejected them all.
cfi also engaged an accounting firm to go through cdc books to make sure that klein previous withdrawals from the plan were all on the up and up.klein objected to this investigation,but the court allowed it to ensure that the sale proceeds would be fairly distributed.cfi eventually compiled a report adopted in all relevant parts by the department of labor which recommended that the court order klein to restore to the plan.cfi submission included the accountant report,which bolstered the recommendation with over a hundred pages of supporting evidence.klein objected to some of the restorative payments and provided two brief affidavits to support his position.the court,however,agreed with the analysis of both cfi and the department and so it ordered klein to repay the plan.
the court then asked the parties to weigh in on whether the refund should be paid back with prejudgment interest.predictably,cfi and the department thought assessing interest was appropriate,and klein disagreed.noting that prejudgment interest in erisa cases is an element of complete compensation,the court imposed interest on the restorative payments.klein filed a motion to reconsider,taking issue with the interest rate imposed,which the judge denied.
with all the dust settled,the judge turned to computing the payments due to the participants.pursuant to the judge order,cfi calculated the final distribution figures,taking into account the restorative payments and fees that klein had been ordered to pay.klein objected to the figures,claiming that cfi calculations took an extra from his accounts.unpersuaded,the court adopted cfi proposed distribution figures.ten days later,klein repeated this same argument,to no avail,in a motion to reconsider.
the first controversy we must address is what a controversy it is.our involvement began with klein notice of appeal challenging the judge denial of his motion to reconsider the prejudgment interest rate.the department filed a motion to dismiss the appeal,arguing that the judge decision was not a final,appealable order,which we ordered taken with the case.meanwhile,the judge determined the final payments to be made to the plan participants.following an unsuccessful motion to reconsider,klein filed a second notice of appeal,challenging the court distribution figures.we consolidated both of klein appeals.with all these fits and starts,it not surprising that the parties have very different takes on the scope of our jurisdiction.
title,of course,empowers us to review a district court final decisions.the consent decree,which wrapped up the department initial suit,was a final order.see berge,cir.that means that the judge enforcement orders are postjudgment orders.we treat each postjudgment proceeding like a freestanding lawsuit and look for the final decision in that proceeding to determine the scope of our review.bogard wright,cir.this inquiry takes us into rocky terrain,at,since determining what constitutes a final decision can be tricky.but the impetus of the postjudgment proceedings is a good place to order that addresses all the issues raised in the motion that sparked the postjudgment proceedings is treated as final for purposes of section.jms dev.bulk petroleum,cir.
these postjudgment proceedings began when the department filed a motion seeking klein removal as trustee and the redistribution of any of his gains,and thus would not end until both issues were addressed.klein claims that both issues were resolved by the time the judge ordered that he pay prejudgment interest,making his first notice of appeal timely.up to that point,the judge had removed klein as the trustee,replaced him with cfi,approved the sale of the property,and ordered klein to restore to the plan.klein describes what was left to final calculation of the amount of money each former participant would nothing more than a ministerial detail that would not affect the finality of the court order.see dzikunoo mcgaw ymca,cir.that a stretch.the payments were one of the twin purposes of the suit and involved millions of dollars,to be divvied up amongst nearly beneficiaries.determining the payments was a matter of simply plugging numbers into a equation,as klein would have us believe.the parties had,and indeed continue to have,substantial disagreements regarding the figures.therefore,we conclude that the postjudgment proceedings were not final until the court determined the distribution figures.since klein filed a timely notice of appeal following that decision,we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.
the department agrees that the order regarding the distribution figures is final and appealable but argues that the court earlier its decision to remove klein as the trustee,impose a constructive trust on the property,and appoint cfi as the independent final and appealable when issued.because klein did file notices of appeal following these decisions,the department argues that we lack jurisdiction to address challenges to these issues.we disagree.klein was entitled to wait until the proceedings were over and then appeal,bringing before us all the nonmoot interlocutory rulings adverse to him,including those that the department now claims are outside of our jurisdiction.pearson ramos,cir.to hold otherwise would invite litigants to appeal every procedural order that follows the entry of a consent decree,resulting in an unmanageable proliferations of appeals.alliance to end repression city of chicago,cir.
our jurisdiction is secure,but before we can turn to the merits we must tackle one more standard of proof required in this case.klein characterizes the proceeding as one for civil contempt and therefore reasons that the department must prove that he violated the consent decree by clear and convincing evidence.see prima tek ii,klerk plastic,cir.by failing to hold the department to this heightened standard,klein contends that the court committed reversible error.this argument is a nonstarter.the department never sought a finding that klein was in civil contempt,nor did the judge make such a finding.nor,for that matter,did klein ever assert before the judge that this heightened standard should apply.klein can run afoul of the consent decree without subjecting himself to a contempt all violations of a consent decree amount to civil contempt.see id.and in any event there is ample evidence to meet even this heightened burden of proof.most of the court conclusions were based on undisputed material facts,and to the extent there were disputes,the department provided overwhelming support for its position in the face of klein anemic evidence more on this later.see ridge chrysler jeep,llc daimlerchrysler fin.servs.ams.llc,cir declining to weigh in on a dispute regarding the burden of proof because the court findings would suffice on any standard.
finally,then,to the merits.klein first wages a series of attacks on the court finding that he breached his duty of loyalty to the plans.he begins by asserting that the court violated his right to due process when it reached this conclusion without holding an evidentiary hearing.one slight problem klein never asked for an evidentiary hearing.during oral argument,counsel for klein explained that he assumed such a request was unnecessary.the right to an evidentiary hearing can be forfeited if the litigant fails to timely raise the issue,united states downs,cir,and klein makes no attempt to identify a plain error that would justify our intervention.moore tuleja,cir.what more,even for the most important decisions,an evidentiary hearing is required only if there are material factual disputes,wozniak conry,cir,and while klein identifies some factual ambiguities in the record,none of those potential disputes are material.
klein also maintains that the consent decree put him in an untenable dilemma,with conflicting duties of loyalty.if he valued the property too high,then those who elected to take their share in property would be shortchanged if the property eventually sold for less.if he valued the property too low,than the participants who elected to receive cash would get less than their fair share,since the property could be sold for more.this argument,however,misses the point.all the plan participants would have benefitted from a distribution based on an accurate valuation of the property,which klein failed to do.during the negotiations,klein rejected one of the village early offers for million because it fell so far below the market value of the property that he feared accepting it might constitute a breach of his fiduciary duties.klein may have been grandstanding,but that rejection invites an obvious question if klein really thought that million was a fair price for the property,why did he jump at the village offer for million the court settled this conundrum by concluding that klein purposefully undervalued the property by using the million appraisal to ensure that he and his wife,who pretty much owned the whole thing,would receive a windfall profit.we agree with this accurate valuation of the property would have taken into account the village offers.as a fiduciary of the plan,klein was required to discharge his duties solely in the interest of the participants,a,and seeking benefit for himself at the expense of the participants falls short of this duty.
but even if we bought klein argument,the court conclusion would still stand.as a fiduciary,klein was required to communicate material facts affecting the interests of beneficiaries.anweiler am.power serv,cir see also bowerman stores,cir.the duty to communicate exists when a participant asks fiduciaries for information,and even when he or she does not.anweiler,at.the ongoing negotiations with the village had a profound impact on the value of the plan assets.they provided concrete evidence suggesting that the market value of the property was well above the value listed in the last appraisal and that the property,though not as liquid as cash,could be quickly sold.this information was vital,particularly when the plan was being terminated and participants needed to chose how they would receive their take.but instead of sharing this information,klein kept it under wraps.there is no excuse for this concealment.
klein tries to get around these facts by arguing that his breach caused no harm to the plan participants,noting that there is no evidence that his failure to disclose the details of the negotiations with the village would have affected the participants decisions to forgo receiving a stake in the property.see kannapien quaker oats,cir requiring a showing that a breach of an erisa fiduciary duties caused harm.this argument,too,misses the mark.the participants who elected to receive their share in cash were shortchanged by klein decision to calculate the payments based on the million appraisal.if klein had been forthcoming about the negotiations and made an honest valuation of the property,the plan participants would have had reliable information upon which to make their it all cash or a combination of cash and a property interest.
klein next challenges the court order requiring him to restore to the used to pay legal expenses accumulated in his defense of the department administrative action and an irs audit,to subsidize the salaries of cdc employees,and to defray overhead costs that overlapped with cdc.before getting into the,klein levels two general arguments against this order.first,he argues that cfi exceeded the scope of its duties by investigating the propriety of klein prior withdrawals from the plans.this argument is both odd and unsuccessful.for starters,the court explicitly authorized cfi to conduct this investigation.to the extent that klein is suggesting that the judge lacked the authority to order such an investigation,he is also off base.the consent decree required klein to terminate the plans,in accordance with the fiduciary duties he owed its participants,and the judge retained jurisdiction to make sure this was done.plundering the plans for his own purposes would shortchange the participants,in contravention to klein fiduciary duties,and the court was entitled to authorize an investigation to make sure that the participants received their fair share.
secondly,klein argues that the court
