plaintiff donna scharff worked for the raytheon company.the raytheon company employees contributions,which are held in the raytheon employees disability trust trust,and the company jointly fund defendant raytheon company short term disability plan short term plan.only the trust funds defendant raytheon company long term disability plan long term plan.metropolitan life insurance company metlife administers,but does not insure,the plans.the employee retirement income security act of,erisa,governs both plans.
the plans contained a contractual statute of limitations.after metlife denied her claim for short term plan benefits,plaintiff brought suit in federal court seeking benefits under both plans,but she filed the action twenty days after the contractual statute of limitations had lapsed.the district court dismissed the action as untimely.we hold that even if the doctrine of reasonable expectations applied here,the statute of limitations met its requirements and also met the statutory and regulatory standards for disclosure.we decline to import into federal common law a california regulation requiring insurers to inform claimants expressly of statutes of limitations that may bar their claims.accordingly,we affirm the judgment dismissing the action.
factual and procedural history 
when plaintiff applied for disability benefits,she was an employee of the raytheon company and a participant in the raytheon company employee benefit plans.as noted above,both the short term and long term plans were.metlife administers the plans and has sole discretionary authority to determine a participant eligibility for benefits.
raytheon provided plaintiff and other plan participants with a summary plan description spd called your benefits handbook.the spd is divided into chapters that address the different benefits available to raytheon employees.the final chapter of the document is entitled administrative and provides participants with information relating to their rights and obligations under all of the benefit plans discussed in earlier chapters.the administrative chapter contains a section titled your right to appeal a denied claim,which explains the procedure for appealing a denied claim to metlife.on the same page,a,bolded heading,special rules for disability and health claims,introduces a paragraph that cautions with respect to disability and health plans time limits for deciding and appealing claims are significantly different from those for other claims later in the administrative chapter is a section titled your rights under erisa.a subsection,titled enforce your rights,states if you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored in whole or in part,you may file suit in a state or federal court.
the disability chapter,which contains information about the plan under which plaintiff sought benefits,sets forth the deadline for bringing a lawsuit regarding a denied claim.the last page of this chapter contains a paragraph with the largetypeface,bolded,and italicized heading,claims appeal procedure.that paragraph states 
the procedure to be followed to appeal a denied claim is explained in the administrative section.it is important to note that under the applicable plan documents,any action at law or in equity must be commenced within one year of the denial of the appeal from an initial claim denial,regardless of any state or federal statutes establishing provisions relating to limitations of actions.
on april,metlife received a claim from plaintiff for short term plan benefits.the claim was denied in a letter dated july,on the ground that the clinical reports did not show that plaintiff had a condition that would render her totally disabled and unable to work.the letter described the metlife process for appealing the denial.plaintiff submitted additional medical information without formally appealing the denial.metlife reviewed the information and issued a second denial letter on september.plaintiff formally appealed that denial on october.
on january,metlife issued a decision upholding its previous determination.that letter provided,in relevant part,that t his determination is the final decision on review and constitutes completion of the full and fair review required by the short term plan and federal law.the letter informed plaintiff that if she wished to pursue the matter further,she should consult the information provided concerning her rights,as set forth in the spd.the letter went on to explain that no further administrative appeals were available concerning plaintiff claim for disability benefits,but that she had a right to bring a civil action under section a of erisa.metlife also promised to provide plaintiff with copies of the documents relevant to her claim upon her request.none of the letters mentioned the contractual statute of limitations.
following receipt of the final denial letter,plaintiff daughter and personal representative,jessica leighty,filed a complaint with the california department of insurance on plaintiff behalf.on june,metlife responded to the department,informing it that,because the plan is not funded through an insurance policy,it is not subject to state laws governing insurers.metlife also wrote to leighty to explain how it had administered plaintiff claim.that letter reminded her that denial of the claim was upheld on january.
under the statute of limitations contained in the spd,the deadline to file suit was january.plaintiff filed suit on february,twenty days after expiration of the limitations period.in her complaint,plaintiff alleged that metlife upheld its prior determination denying benefits in its june,letter to her daughter,rather than in its january,letter.defendants moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,on the ground that the complaint was untimely.in her response,plaintiff conceded that the statute of limitations ran on january,and that her complaint was untimely.she later conceded that the limitation was reasonable,and she did not assert that the wording of the limitations period was unclear.she argued,however,that her late filing should be excused because the limitations provision was placed neither in what she believed was the appropriate section of the spd nor in the correspondence that she received from metlife.
the district court first addressed whether an insurer may shorten the limitations period for bringing an erisa suit and whether the contractual limitations period is enforceable,issues that plaintiff does not raise on appeal and that we therefore do not consider.the court then declined to use the reasonable expectations doctrine to find that the limitations period was not displayed conspicuously enough,holding that the reasonable expectations rule has not been extended to benefits plans.the court also declined to apply section a of title of the california code of regulations,which provides that an insurer must disclose to a claimant any time limits that may apply to the claim.the court noted that state insurance regulation of plans,like the plan at issue here,is preempted,and the california regulation has not been incorporated into federal common law.plaintiff timely appeals.
standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo an order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.madison graham,cir.we must take all allegations of material fact in the complaint as true and must construe the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff.id.
discussion 
disclosure of the deadline 
plaintiff first argues that we should adopt the reasonable expectations doctrine to analyze the spd and that we should hold that the placement and display of the deadline in this case violated participants reasonable expectations.defendants argue,in response,that the doctrine of reasonable expectations does not apply to welfare benefit plans.for the reasons explained below,we need not decide whether the reasonable expectations doctrine applies to welfare benefit plans.
erisa central policy goal is to protect benefit plan participants by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information and by providing for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.b chuck hewlett packard,cir.to further that goal,employee benefit plans must provide plan participants with an spd,which is the statutorily established means of informing participants of the terms of the plan and its benefits,and which serves as the employee primary source of information regarding employment benefits.bergt ret.plan for pilots employed by markair,cir internal quotation marks omitted a.
section a provides in pertinent part 
the spd shall include the information described in subsection b of this section,shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,and shall be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.
section b lists the specific information that the spd is required to contain.one of the required pieces of information is any circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial or loss of benefits.b.accordingly,the spd must explain the circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial or loss of benefits in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,and that information must be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise plan participants of their rights and obligations under the plan.id.a b.
the federal regulations further provide 
any description of exception,limitations,reductions,and other restrictions of plan benefits shall not be minimized,rendered obscure or otherwise made to appear unimportant.such exceptions,limitations,reductions,or restrictions of plan benefits shall be described or summarized in a manner not less prominent than the style,captions,printing type,and prominence used to describe or summarize plan benefits.
b.the spd must also disclose limitations in close conjunction to benefits provisions,or refer the participant to the page numbers on which the relevant restrictions appear.id.
those are the relevant statutory and regulatory disclosure provisions relating to the spd.in addition to those requirements,the federal courts have developed a body of erisa federal common law.see menhorn firestone tire rubber,cir the courts are directed to formulate a nationally uniform federal common law to supplement the explicit provisions and general policies set out in erisa,referring to and guided by principles of state law when appropriate,but governed by the federal policies at issue.
it is one of those common law principles,the doctrine of reasonable expectations,that plaintiff asks us to use to analyze the display and placement of the deadline in this case.the doctrine can be summarized as follows 
under the doctrine of reasonable expectations,which is often applied in interpreting or construing policies of insurance,the meaning of an insurance policy is determined in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured.in other words,the meaning of the terms in an insurance policy is to be determined by considering it in light of whether a reasonable person in the position of the insured would expect coverage.the term insured reasonable expectations refers to what a hypothetical reasonable insured would glean from the wording of the particular policy and kind of insurance at issue,rather than how a particular insured who happened to buy the policy might understand it.
samuel williston richard lord,a treatise on the law of contracts,at ed footnotes omitted.plaintiff argues that the placement and display of the deadline failed to meet plan participants reasonable expectations because the deadline should have been placed in the administrative chapter rather than the disability chapter,and the deadline should have been displayed more conspicuously in the text of the spd.
plaintiff is correct in asserting that we have incorporated the reasonable expectations doctrine into erisa federal common law when we have interpreted insured plans.in saltarelli bob baker group medical trust,cir,we adopt ed the doctrine of reasonable expectations as a principle of the uniform federal common law informing interpretation of insurance contracts.at issue in saltarelli was a conditions exclusion that appeared in the spd.id.at.we noted that the plan administrator chose to bury one of the plan most significant provisions amidst definitions,rather than forthrightly stating the conditions exclusion in the operative clauses of the plan description.id.we therefore held that the exclusion for conditions was not clear,plain,and conspicuous enough to negate layman saltarelli objectively reasonable expectations of coverage.id.at.
we noted that the application of the reasonable expectations doctrine to erisa insurance contract law was,at the time,an issue of first impression for our circuit.id.at.we gave two reasons for adopting the doctrine into the federal common law protecting the reasonable expectations of insureds appropriately serves the federal policies underlying erisa,and at least thirty states ha d explicitly incorporated the reasonable expectations doctrine into their own law,demonstrat ing its widespread acceptance and vitality.id.at.
after saltarelli,we assumed,in dictum,that the reasonable expectations doctrine applied to a benefit plan.in winters costco wholesale,cir,the plaintiff sought reimbursement from a benefit plan for a procedure similar to in vitro fertilization.the district court held that the plan administrator should not have denied benefits.id.at.the administrator argued that the district court applied the wrong standard of review to its decision and improperly applied the doctrine of contra proferentem,under which ambiguities in a contract are construed against the contract drafter.id.at.after addressing those two issues,we discussed the holding of saltarelli.id.at.we then though the plaintiff had not argued that the reasonable expectations doctrine applied to her she had no objectively reasonable expectation of coverage for her procedure because the spd conspicuously exempted those types of procedures.id.at.
we hemmed in the doctrine just two years after winters.in estate of shockley alyeska pipeline service,cir,we declined to extend saltarelli rule to an erisa pension plan.we held that the doctrine of reasonable expectations applies only to insurance contracts,including erisa insurance contracts.id.we noted that the doctrine grew out of the law of adhesion contracts and construction of ambiguities in insurance policies,id.quoting saltarelli,at,so it made sense to apply the body of law dealing generally with insurance policy interpretation to insurance policies that happened to be erisa insurance policies.id.in our view,there was no reason to extend the doctrine beyond insurance contracts because the doctrine was developed for and applies directly to insurance policies.id.
benefit plans like raytheon are not insurance policies.as a result,estate of shockley would appear to bar application of the doctrine of reasonable expectations to the plan at issue here.but,at the same time,winters could be read to have extended the doctrine implicitly to apply to erisa welfare benefit plans.estate of shockley mistakenly cites winters as an example of an erisa insurance contract.estate of shockley,at citing winters,at.
what we have,then,are two opinions that are seemingly in tension with one another winters,which applied the reasonable expectations doctrine to a plan,at least in dictum,and estate of shockley,which prohibits us from expanding the doctrine beyond insured plans.as a panel,we can not overrule either decision.ross island sand gravel matson in re complaint of ross island sand gravel,cir per curiam.
but we need not call for en banc consideration,nor try to harmonize the apparent conflict in our precedents.assuming,without deciding,that the reasonable expectations doctrine applies,the spd here met plan participants reasonable expectations,in addition to fulfilling the statutory and regulatory requirements.see estate of shockley,at treating the statutory disclosure requirements a
