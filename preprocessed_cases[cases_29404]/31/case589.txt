this is another employee retirement income security act of erisa case,de buono med.clinical servs.fund,d,one that asks whether erisa preempts two provisions of a michigan law governing the training of apprentice electricians.because the substantive standards to be applied to apprenticeship training programs are quite remote from the areas with which erisa is expressly concerned,and because of the paucity of indication in erisa and its legislative history of any intent on the part of congress to state apprenticeship training standards,cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d,we hold that erisa does not preempt the provisions.
in,the michigan legislature imposed two requirements on the training and supervision of apprentice electricians.it required there to be a ratio between trained electricians and apprentice electricians at all work sites.see.comp.laws e.and it established an equivalency requirement for the michigan electrical administrative board,which meant that individuals could be certified in an apprenticeship training program only if the program met the requirements imposed by the department of labor bureau of apprenticeship and training.see id.e.
in,associated builders contractors,a trade organization,together with three of its members collectively,associated builders filed this action against a state agency and its director collectively,the state,claiming that erisa preempted the ratio and equivalency requirements.the district court agreed and ordered the state to refrain from enforcing the requirements.associated builders contractors perry.the state did not appeal the decision.when an intervening trade association appealed the decision,we dismissed the appeal for lack of standing.see associated builders contractors perry,cir.
fourteen years later,in,michigan filed a motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure to dissolve the injunction,claiming that intervening supreme court decisions had swept away the legal premises of the order.associated builders responded that the motion was untimely and lacked merit to boot.the district court concluded that the state had filed the motion within a reasonable time and revisited the merits of the decision.but it ultimately denied the state request for relief,concluding that,even though the relevant case law had changed in the intervening years,erisa continues to preempt each of the two requirements.
associated builders,as an initial point of dispute,argues that the state rule b motion was untimely and thus should never have been considered on the merits in the first place.this aspect of the district court decision receives review.see days inns worldwide,patel,cir.
under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,a court may dissolve an injunction if it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated or if applying the injunction prospectively is no longer equitable.one predicate for altering an injunction or consent decree under the rule is a change in court decisions or statutes that make legal what once had been illegal.see rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d.fed,ry.employes,wright,d sweeton brown,cir en banc.
a party bringing a rule b motion must do so within a reasonable time.c,a requirement that turns on the length of the delay,the explanations for the delay,the prejudice to the opposing party caused by the delay and the circumstances warranting relief.see in re,cir.also relevant is the nature of the dispute and whether it involves a purely private disagreement or a matter of public interest.t he public interest is a particularly significant reason for applying a flexible modification standard because injunctions often reach beyond the parties involved directly in the suit and impact the public right to the sound and efficient operation of its government.rufo,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the state filed its motion within a reasonable time.one,there has been a change in law.ignoring for a moment the potential significance of when law in,as associated builders urges,see fourth br.at,or as late as,as the state urges,see third br.at fact remains that the law has changed so that the enjoined behavior,which once might have been preempted by federal law,may no longer be preempted at all,sweeton,at emphasis omitted.in de buono,at,the supreme court itself acknowledged differences between the court earlier erisa cases and its cases since new york state conference of blue cross blue shield travelers insurance,d,and so have the lower courts,see,cal.trust funds standard indus,cir willmar,cooke,cir.
two,this case plainly implicates a matter of public state interest in regulating the safety and training of new apprentice simply a dispute between two private citizens.a court should not lightly deny a state request to regulate a matter of public safety,particularly when the obstacle to the regulation rests on a legal foundation that may no longer be sound.
three,while one could imagine a state responding more quickly to these changes in the law than michigan did,there are practical reasons for excusing the delay.the district court issued the underlying injunction in,and the first supreme court decisions suggesting a new way of viewing erisa preemption cases came in when the court decided travelers,de buono and dillingham.but even the most sophisticated reader of erisa case law could not claim with a straight face that a red light on regulating apprentice training before suddenly became green after.in construing the relate to scope of preemption,the cases are as and as short on guidance as the cases.far from announcing a brave new line for ascertaining erisa preemption,the cases show only a willingness to place more emphasis on the presumption against preemption and on the underlying purposes of the erisa of which give the states wider,but hardly unreviewable,berth in regulating the area.the last thing,indeed,that a approach to statutory construction guarantees is clarity.the key effect of permitting judges to generalize from the purposes of a statute,as opposed to just its text,is to give them more rather than less discretion in construing a law scope.
even today,the question whether erisa preempts these laws is not an easy one.when congress passes a law that is as plausibly and implausibly preemptive of a wide range of state laws as erisa relate to clause and when the courts understandably struggle to place state laws on one side or the other of the line,there is little reason to construe the reasonable time limitation in rule as a rigid statute of limitations.an unduly strict reading of the requirement,moreover,would tend to force premature rule b motions due to a state fear of losing forever the opportunity to correct an injunction or consent decree.in the aftermath of the decisions,at any rate,state lawyers may well have questioned whether the cases ushered in a materially different view of erisa preemption,or elected leaders in the legislative or executive branches in office in may not have agreed with the regulatory objectives of the laws preempted by the decision and therefore would have had no reason to ask the court to revisit the validity of its decision.
four,associated builders has not pointed to any prejudice that the alleged delay caused it to suffer.the lapse in time gave the association and its members more time to be free of these allegedly burdensome regulations and more time for all concerned to see how other courts construed the supreme court erisa decisions.all things considered,the district court did not abuse its discretion in accepting this rule b motion and in reaching the merits of the state erisa arguments.
does erisa,as construed by the supreme court,require us to dissolve the injunction prohibiting enforcement of these two michigan laws yes,and accordingly the state may now enforce them.
erisa by its terms preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.the statute defines an employee benefit plan as 
any plan,fund,or program established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that such plan,fund,or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries,through the purchase of insurance or otherwise,a medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment,or vacation benefits,apprenticeship or other training programs,or day care centers,scholarship funds,or prepaid legal services 
id.emphasis added see also id.while the relate to clause might at first glance seem to have an horizonless reach,travelers counsels that infinite relations can not be the measure of.at.in ascertaining what state laws relate to plans,travelers tells us to look to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive.id.
of particular relevance to today dispute,dillingham applied this text and travelers construction of it to a state law regulating apprentices.at stake was the validity of a california statute that required contractors who were awarded state projects to pay their apprentices the local prevailing wage,unless the state had approved the apprenticeship program,in which case the contractors could pay a lower rate.at.a law relates to an erisa plan,the court explained,if it has a reference to or a connection with a plan.id.at.the law did not refer to an erisa plan because it applied equally to training programs funded by a separate erisa fund and those funded out of an employer general assets.id.at.because the california law affected erisa and plans alike,it did not refer to a plan.id.
in holding that the law did not have a connection with an erisa plan,the court began with the presumption that erisa did not intend to supplant it,id.at,because apprenticeship standards and the wages to be paid on public works have long been regulated by the states,id.at.it then reasoned that the california statute merely alter ed the incentives,but d id not dictate the choices,facing erisa plans.id.at.because contractors with apprenticeship programs could escape the statute requirements by opting not to work on state projects or by paying their apprentices the local prevailing wage,the statute did not mandate employee benefit structures or their administration.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the law merely provide d economic incentive s to comply with the state law,which does not suffice to preempt it.id.at.
in holding that erisa did not preempt california law because it was optional,however,dillingham did not draw the dispositive preemption line between laws that mandate something that potentially affects an erisa plan and those that mandate nothing.the key distinction is between a statute that mandates or effectively mandates an aspect of law with which erisa is,a statute that mandates employee benefit structures or their administration and a statute that does not.see id.at.see also air transp.ass of am.city and county of san francisco,cir.illustrating the point,de buono held that erisa did not preempt a state gross receipts tax imposed on all hospitals in a state,including hospitals operated by erisa plans,because the statute was one of myriad state laws of general applicability that impose some burdens on the administration of erisa plans but nevertheless do not relate to them within the meaning of the governing statute.at.internal quotation marks omitted.what is true of a general state tax is true of many other general state mandates that affect erisa plans they may increase the cost of providing benefits to covered employees and they may have some effect on the administration of erisa plans,but that simply can not mean that every state law with such an effect is by the federal statute.id.at.
other cases,including dillingham itself,support this distinction.see at.a statute that mandate s employee benefit structures or their administration satisfies the connection with test internal quotation marks omitted egelhoff egelhoff,d erisa preempts a statute that binds erisa plan administrators to a particular choice of rules for determining beneficiary status de buono,at.t here might be a state law whose economic effects were so acute as to force an erisa plan to adopt a certain scheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of insurers and such a state law might indeed be by erisa.internal quotation marks omitted travelers,at.in each of these cases,erisa state laws that mandated employee benefit structures or their administration.retail indus.leaders fielder,cir a state law has an impermissible connection with an erisa plan if it directly regulates or effectively mandates some element of the structure or administration of employers erisa plans.
the connection with inquiry thus requires two showings to preempt a state law the law at issue must mandate or effectively mandate something,and that mandate must fall within the area that congress intended erisa to control exclusively.dillingham,at.looking both to the objectives of the erisa statute and to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted.compulsion in other words is a necessary,but not a sufficient,condition for erisa preemption.with these principles in mind,we turn to whether erisa preempts michigan ratio and equivalency requirements.
the parties share some common ground in applying these lessons to michigan law.they agree that erisa applies to associated builders apprenticeship programs because the programs are funded through separate funds,not out of the employers general assets.see dillingham,at.and they agree that the ratio and equivalency requirements do not have a reference to erisa plans the rules do not act immediately and exclusively upon erisa plans and thus do not depend on the existence of erisa plans for their operation.id.at.what separates the parties is whether the requirements have a connection with an erisa whether the state laws impose mandates on the training programs and whether those mandates affect concerns.
the ratio and equivalency rules plainly contain mandates.the ratio requirement provides that all apprentice electricians working in michigan must register with the state electrical administrative board and that the ratio of electrical journeymen or master electricians to electricians at a job site must be.the equivalency requirement provides that all apprentice electricians working in the state must participate in a training program approved by the,a program with requirements equivalent to those imposed by the department of labor bureau of apprenticeship and training.the department of labor,through the fitzgerald act regulations,in turn requires a written apprenticeship agreement a term of apprenticeship of not less than hours an outline of tasks in which the apprentice will receive supervised work experience a numeric ratio of apprentices to journeymen consistent with proper supervision,training and safety a schedule of wages adequate and safe equipment and facilities for training and supervision and the assurance of qualified training personnel.see.
unlike the statute in dillingham,which merely offered an incentive to some apprenticeship programs,michigan statute imposes requirements on all apprenticeship programs.and nothing short of discharging all of its apprentices will release an employer or a program from the reach of the michigan statute.
because the michigan rules plainly mandate something,the question is whether that something falls within the scope of issues that erisa prohibits the states from regulating.we think not for several reasons.
first,no one disputes that the states have long regulated apprenticeship standards and training or that this topic of regulation falls well within their traditional police powers.see dillingham,at.we therefore start with the presumption that michigan requirements fall outside of erisa preemptive reach.id.
second,the policies underlying the ratio and equivalency safety of electrical apprentices and appropriate standards of electrical quite remote from the areas with which erisa is expressly concerned.id.at.erisa ha
