after a car bombing left him disabled,lucien senese sought disability retirement benefits from the chicago area of pension fund the fund.the fund awarded him some,but not all,of the benefits that senese claims are due,so he sued the fund under section a b of erisa.senese now appeals the district court decision granting judgment to the fund on his claim for benefits,which we affirm.the fund appeals the court decision denying its motion for rule sanctions and for attorneys fees under the fee shifting provision of erisa,which we affirm in part and reverse in part.
senese injuries occurred in,while he was employed as of teamsters local the local and as the fund plan manager and trustee.despite his injuries,he continued on the payroll of the local and the fund until december.according to senese,he then began the application process for his disability pension in march with the first of many written requests to the fund for a pension application form,requests that senese says were ignored.
in the meantime,in order to maintain his health and pension benefits,senese secured employment with the austin merkel company,working eight hours a month from june through february.the fund trustees initially determined that the merkel job did not qualify as covered employment under the collective bargaining agreement,and returned the contributions that merkel had made on senese behalf.but after senese presented evidence that his job with merkel qualified as covered employment,the fund reversed its position and accepted merkel contributions.
senese eventually received a pension application from the fund in may,which senese claims he promptly completed and returned to the fund.however,the fund says it had no record of receiving senese application until sixteen months awarded him benefits beginning the following month.senese requested a review of this decision,insisting that he was entitled to benefits beginning january,the month after he left his job with the local.senese also asserted that,because the fund delayed sending him an application,his application date should be considered to be march,when he first requested the form.
after conducting a review,the fund trustees determined that senese did not actually retire for purposes of his pension until the merkel job ended in february.however,because senese could have submitted a completed application form in may when the fund first sent him the form,the trustees adjusted his effective date from october to june and awarded him benefits for an additional sixteen months.
not satisfied with this adjustment,senese filed suit,claiming an improper denial of benefits under a b of erisa,a b.in his second amended complaint,senese claimed that he was owed retirement benefits and interest for the five months in after he retired from the local and before he began the merkel job january through may of.he also claimed interest on the additional sixteen months of benefits that the fund awarded him after it adjusted his application date to may.
the fund responded with a draft rule motion for sanctions,asserting that the second amended complaint was unsupported by the facts or a reasonable investigation of the facts and law,in part because senese employment with merkel precluded his claim for earlier benefits.senese declined to withdraw the complaint,but after discovery,and two weeks before trial,senese abandoned any claim for benefits before his retirement from merkel.instead,in his proposed pretrial order,he claimed benefits for march,april,and may period between the time that he left the merkel job and the adjusted eligibility date determined by the trustees.this claim was based on his theory that his delayed application should not foreclose earlier benefits because his letters requesting application forms should have been counted for determining his application date,or alternately,that when an application is delayed,both the plan and the summary plan description provide automatic retroactive benefits.
at trial,however,senese added a twist to his theory about retroactive benefits,arguing for the first time that there was a direct conflict between the plan and summary plan descriptions on this issue.according to senese,when an application is delayed,the summary plan description provides for automatic retroactive benefits.and although the underlying plan document had been amended years earlier to add a good cause requirement for the payment of retroactive benefits,the summary plan description was not updated to reflect that amendment.thus,senese argued that because of this direct conflict,the summary controlled,and he was entitled to retroactive benefits for march,april,and may without any showing of good cause for his delay in submitting an application.
at the close of senese evidence,the fund moved for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court granted.the court held that the trustees were not arbitrary or capricious in determining that,because senese did not actually file an application until may,he was eligible for benefits no earlier than june.as to senese claim that the summary plan provision overrode the pension plan provision on the issue of retroactive benefits,the court held that this theory was not properly before the court because it was not raised in any pleadings or approved pretrial order before the court,and because it had not been raised before the fund trustees.the court also held that,even had the issue properly been before it,it would not have found a direct conflict between the plan and summary plan descriptions.finally,the court held that,because the plan did not provide for interest,senese was not entitled to interest on the sixteen additional months of benefits that were paid after the fund adjusted his application date.the court then denied the fund motions for sanctions against senese and his attorney under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and for attorneys fees and costs under the fee shifting provision of erisa,g.both parties appealed.
senese appeal 
senese principal argument on appeal is that the district court erred in determining that there was no conflict between the plan and summary plan descriptions regarding a beneficiary entitlement to retroactive benefits when an application is delayed.senese also asserts that his failure to present this theory to the fund trustees is not fatal because,he argues,erisa requires only claim exhaustion,not issue exhaustion.
however,senese ignores the district court alternate ground for rejecting senese argument about the summary plan this theory was not properly before the court because it was not contained in his pleadings or any approved pretrial order.senese failure to advance on appeal any arguments with respect to this alternate ground means that any challenge to that ground is waived,see williams leach,cir,and because affirmance of the district court alternate ground is dispositive of his appeal,see kauthar sdn bhd sternberg,cir cook navistar int l transp,cir,we decline to explore the merits of senese arguments regarding erisa exhaustion requirements or the purported conflict between the plan and summary plan descriptions accordingly,we affirm the district court decision granting judgment to the fund on senese claim for benefits.
b.the fund appeal 
the fund argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying its motions for rule sanctions and for attorneys fees under erisa,asserting that senese had no legal or factual basis for his claim for benefits or for interest on unpaid and delayed benefits,and that the lawsuit was filed for an improper,to obtain an advantage in the local elections in favor of candidates supported by senese.
