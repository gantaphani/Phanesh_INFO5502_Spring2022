cherilyn kellogg attempt to administratively appeal 
on january,kellogg counsel sent a letter to metlife stating 
please be advised that this law firm represent s cherilyn kellogg in connection with claims for payment of accidental death and dismemberment policy proceeds from metlife as referenced above.we received metropolitan life metlife november,letter and are appealing the decision to deny payment of benefits to kellogg.
having reviewed metlife november,letter,it appears that metlife is basing its denial on an exclusion to coverage in the insurance policy.the letter references a police report in metlife possession which contains a witness statement to the effect that kellogg appeared to be having a seizure.however,kellogg had no history of seizure activity and there is no reason,other than the witness statement,to believe that a seizure was the cause of the accident.it is our position that there is simply insufficient factual and legal basis for metlife to invoke the exclusion it refers to in the november,letter.
however,beyond making this statement,we are not in a position to intelligently appeal metlife denial.this is because the cause for kellogg accident are sic less than obvious.in addition,we do not know what information metlife relied on in coming to its conclusion that kellogg claim is not valid.finally,we sic are in need of additional documents and other information from metlife.for these reasons,we ask for an extension of time in which to submit a complete appeal package for kellogg.
in regards to the additional information we need,please send me a copy of metlife entire claim file in connection with kellogg claim.if metlife obtained or relied on any reviews from individuals with medical training or other expertise as part of its investigation of kellogg claim,please provide a copy of that review or report,together with identification of the expert and information about his or her qualifications.in addition,we need a complete copy of the accidental death and dismemberment policy in place for kellogg at the time of his death,a copy of the ad d certificate of coverage,summary plan description,plan documents and any and all other documents under which the erisa plan established by kellogg employer,pfizer,was established or operated.we make the request for these documents based on b and.
because some of these documents may be in the possession of pfizer and because,in all likelihood,pfizer is the plan administrator for kellogg erisa plan,we are sending a copy of this letter to pfizer and asking for its response and cooperation in providing documents it has in its possession and in ensuring that metlife provides this information to us.
we also request that we have sixty days following receipt of these documents and information to evaluate them and present additional information to metlife regarding kellogg claim.
we appreciate your prompt production of the materials we have requested in this letter.
on may,kellogg counsel,having received no response from metlife,telephoned metlife to ascertain the status of the request that he sent to met life on january.id.at.during the conversation,a metlife representative acknowledged that metlife had received a copy of th e january,letter.id.after finishing the telephone conversation,kellogg counsel drafted and sent to metlife a letter stating,in pertinent part,as follows 
we remain in need of additional documents and other information from metlife.we do not know what information metlife relied on in coming to its conclusion that kellogg claim is not valid.
i again request that you send my law firm a copy of metlife entire claim file in connection with kellogg claim.if metlife obtained or relied on any reviews from individuals with medical training or expertise as part of its investigation of kellogg claim,please provide a copy of that review or report,together with identification of the expert and information about his or her qualifications.
in addition,we need a complete copy of the accidental death and dismemberment policy in place for kellogg at the time of his death,a copy of the ad d certificate of coverage,summary plan description,plan documents and any and all other documents under which the erisa plan established by kellogg employer,pfizer sic.we make the request for these documents based on b and.
that same day may,kellogg counsel also telephoned pfizer.following that telephone call,kellogg counsel faxed pfizer copies of the january and may,letters he had sent to metlife.on may,pfizer sent kellogg counsel copies of the ad d summary plan description and certificate of coverage.id.at.
metlife never provided kellogg counsel with any documents,nor did it ever issue a decision regarding her appeal.
district court proceedings 
on july,kellogg filed this action against metlife and the plan.kellogg complaint alleged,in pertinent part,that defendants were responsible,pursuant to a b,to pay her the ad d benefits due under the plan together with attorney fees and costs incurred and pre and interest to the date of payment of the unpaid benefits.id.at.
on april,defendants moved for summary judgment based on the administrative record.on that same date,kellogg filed a motion for partial summary judgment.on september,the district court issued a memorandum decision and order granting defendants motion and denying kellogg motion.kellogg has since filed a timely notice of appeal.
standard of court grant of summary judgment 
we review de novo the district court summary judgment decision,applying the same standard as the district court.butler compton,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we examine the record and all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the party.antonio sygma network,cir.finally,we may affirm on any basis supported by the record,even though not relied on by the district court.felix lucent,cir.
standard of review to be applied in reviewing metlife decision 
in her first issue on appeal,kellogg contends that the district court erred in applying a modified abuse of discretion standard,rather than a de novo standard,in reviewing metlife denial of benefits.a denial of benefits under an erisa plan is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.if the benefit plan gives the administrator such discretion,then,absent procedural irregularities,the denial of benefits is reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.fought unum life ins,cir.such review is limited to determining whether the interpretation of the plan was reasonable and made in good faith.id.
the plan at issue here named pfizer as the plan administrator and metlife as the claims administrator.app.at.further,the plan afforded discretion to both pfizer and metlife 
benefits under these plans will be paid only if the plan administrator or the claims administrator,as applicable,decides in its discretion that you are entitled to them.the plan administrator or the claims administrator,as applicable,shall make,in its sole discretion,all determinations arising in the administration,construction,or interpretation of these plans,including the right to construe disputed or doubtful plan terms and provisions,and any such determination shall be conclusive and binding on all persons,to the maximum extent permitted by law.
kellogg acknowledges that these plan provisions afforded metlife discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the insurance policy and to determine eligibility for benefits.aplt.br.at.she argues,however,that metlife failure to comply with the claims procedures set forth in the regulations implementing erisa triggers de novo review.more specifically,she argues that metlife failure to ever issue a decision on her appeal results in there being no timely discretionary act to which this court can defer.id.at.
defendants,in response,contend that kellogg arguments are based on an inaccurate assumption that there was an appeal on which metlife could render a decision.aplee.br.at.in fact,they contend,kellogg never submitted her final appeal.id.in support of this contention,defendants note that i n their letters,kellogg counsel state that they would submit kellogg appeal days after they received the requested claim file documents,yet kellogg counsel submitted neither the final appeal document nor any new evidence to support the appeal id.thus,defendants argue,there was no appeal or new evidence before metlife that required any action.id.at.
we readily reject defendants arguments.the january,letter that kellogg counsel sent to metlife very clearly stated,in its opening paragraph we received metropolitan life november,letter and are appealing the decision to deny payment of benefits to kellogg.app.at italics added.the letter then proceeded to outline the general basis for kellogg appeal 
having reviewed metlife november,letter,it appears that metlife is basing its denial on an exclusion to coverage in the insurance policy.the letter references a police report in metlife possession which contains a witness statement to the effect that kellogg appeared to be having a seizure.however,kellogg had no history of seizure activity and there is no reason,other than the witness statement,to believe that a seizure was the cause of the accident.it is our position that there is simply insufficient factual and legal basis for metlife to invoke the exclusion it refers to in the november,letter.
to be sure,the letter also stated that kellogg counsel were not in a position to intelligently appeal metlife denial because the cause for kellogg accident was less than obvious,and because they d id not know what information metlife relied on in coming to its conclusion that kellogg claim wa s not valid.id.at.on those points,however,kellogg counsel specifically requested that metlife send them a copy of metlife entire claim file,including a complete copy of the accidental death and dismemberment policy in place for kellogg at the time of his death,a copy of the ad d certificate of coverage,summary plan description,plan documents,and any reviews or reports prepared for metlife from individuals with medical training or other expertise.id.at.in addition,kellogg counsel requested that they be given sixty days following receipt of these documents and information to evaluate them and present additional information to metlife regarding kellogg claim.id.italics added.
considered as a whole,there can be no doubt that the january,letter provided metlife with notice that kellogg disagreed with and was appealing metlife decision to deny her ad d benefits,and was also requesting from metlife relevant documentation,including the spd,certificate of insurance,and relevant medical and reports,in order to support her appeal.thus,metlife clearly had a responsibility under erisa to provide kellogg counsel with a copy of the latest spd and plan documentation,see b,and,ultimately,to issue a decision on kellogg appeal,see i i requiring a plan administrator to issue a decision on an appeal within sixty days after receipt of the claimant request for review,and i for purposes of paragraph i of this section,the period of time within which a benefit determination on review is required to be made shall begin at the time an appeal is filed in accordance with the reasonable procedures of a plan,without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a benefit determination on review accompanies the filing.according to the record on appeal,metlife did neither.nor did metlife make any attempt to contact kellogg or her attorneys to determine if they were going to submit any additional evidence or arguments.
although defendants do not acknowledge,much less attempt to justify,metlife failure to respond in any manner to kellogg january,letter,they suggest that metlife failure effectively prevented kellogg appeal from ripening.that suggestion,however,clearly ignores the substance of kellogg january,letter,and is inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of erisa and its implementing regulations.to conclude otherwise would provide plan administrators with an incentive to violate the provisions of erisa by ignoring requests by plan participants and beneficiaries for plan documentation and other relevant information.
the question,then,is what impact,if any,metlife failure to respond has on the standard of review to be applied by this court.when a plan administrator fails to exercise its discretion and render a decision within the requisite administrative review period set forth in erisa implementing regulations,we have,to date,applied a substantial compliance rule.finley.employee benefits org.income protection plan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.pursuant to this rule,a plan administrator is in substantial compliance with th e deadline if the delay is inconsequential and in the context of an,exchange of information between the administrator and the claimant.id.at quoting gilbertson allied signal,cir.if the plan administrator is not in substantial compliance with the deadline,we have applied a de novo standard of review.id.
we note,however,that our substantial compliance rule was issued in light of the federal regulations implementing erisa.see id.at discussing history of substantial compliance rule.in january,amendments to the regulations took effect that have called into question the continuing validity of the substantial compliance rule.id.at least one district court in this circuit has since held that the substantial compliance doctrine is not applicable under the revised regulations,reeves unum life ins,d,and that a decision made in the absence of the mandated procedural protections should not be entitled to any judicial deference.id.at quoting.
we find it unnecessary to conclusively decide the continuing validity of the substantial compliance rule because,even assuming its continued existence,there can be little doubt that metlife was not in substantial compliance with the erisa deadlines.indeed,there was no compliance at all on metlife part as noted,metlife wholly ignored kellogg counsel request for documentation and review of metlife decision to deny ad d benefits.thus,we shall proceed to apply a de novo standard in reviewing metlife initial decision.
is metlife precluded from arguing brad kellogg death was not accidental 
in its motion for summary judgment,metlife argued,in part,that kellogg was not entitled to ad d benefits under the plan because brad kellogg death was not accidental.app.at.the district court agreed with metlife.id.at.
kellogg argues on appeal,as she did below,that metlife is precluded from argu ing for the first time in this litigation that her claim fails because brad kellogg death did not result from an accident,independent of other causes.aplt.br.at see app.at.in support of this contention,kellogg argues that metlife denial letter of november,set forth only one specific reason for the denial of her claim the exclusion of losses due to a physical illness.aplt.br.at.further,kellogg argues that the independent of other causes language does not even appear in the plan spd,the only document metlife referred her to in its november,denial letter id.at.
in support of her position,kellogg points to our decision in flinders workforce stabilization plan of phillips petroleum,cir.in flinders,we held that i n reviewing a plan administrator decision,we may only consider the evidence and arguments that appear in the administrative record.at.this means,we held,that we must consider only the rationale asserted by the plan administrator in the administrative record id.
defendants do not dispute the flinders holding,but instead take issue with kellogg interpretation of metlife november,denial letter as relying solely upon the physical illness exclusion.according to defendants,that letter first stated that accidental death benefits are payable only if a plan participant dies as a result of an accident.aplee.br.at quoting app.at.defendants contend that the letter then noted that the plan excludes accidental death coverage for losses due to physical illness.id.in addition,defendants assert,metlife consistently referred to the event leading to the decedent death as a crash rather than an accident in accordance with its view of the decedent death as not being accidental.id.at.lastly,defendants note that metlife also stated that based on the evidence in the record,there was no other cause for the crash than the decedent seizure,which,once again,indicated that there had not been an accident under the terms of the plan.id.at.in sum,defendants argue that metlife based its claim determination on both the lack of an accident within the terms of the plan and the physical illness exclusion.id.
to resolve this issue,we return to the language of metlife november,denial letter.the key portion of that letter stated as follows 
the plan states that accidental death and dismemberment ad d benefits are payable if a plan participant dies as a result of an accident.summary plan description at page.it goes on to state that,the pfizer ad d insurance plan does not cover losses due to physical illness.summary plan description at page.
the police report submitted to us states that,according to a witness to the crash,after taking off from a stop sign,the decedent vehicle veered into a tree.the witness stated that it appeared the decedent was having a seizure.she saw no attempt by the decedent to brake or avoid the tree.the police could find no other cause for the crash.
under the terms of the plan,ad d benefits are not payable if a loss is due to physical illness.the decedent physical illness,the seizure,was the cause of the crash.accordingly,we must deny your claim.
although it is true,as noted by defendants,that the letter makes reference to the plan providing ad d benefits in the event a plan participant dies as a result of an accident,the remainder of the letter focuses exclusively on the physical illness exclusion.in particular,the letter first quotes the language of that exclusion,and then proceeds to conclude that,based on the available information,brad kellogg physical illness,the seizure,was the cause of the crash.id.on that basis alone does metlife deny kellogg claim for ad d benefits.in other words,contrary to defendants assertion,the letter can not reasonably be interpreted as denying ad d coverage on the basis that brad kellogg was not involved in,or injured as a result of,an accident.thus,it was error for the district court to have granted summary judgment in favor of metlife on the grounds that brad kellogg did not die as a result of an accident.
was brad kellogg death caused by his purported seizure 
the sole basis relied on by metlife for denying kellogg claim for ad d benefits was its conclusion that brad kellogg physical illness,the seizure,was the cause of the crash.app.at.applying a de novo standard of review,however,we conclude that the car the the loss at issue,brad kellogg death,and therefore the exclusionary clause of the policy does not apply 
we have long held that insurance policies are interpreted according to their plain meaning.see,webb allstate life ins,cir terms of an insurance policy must be considered not in a technical but in a popular sense,and must be construed according to their plain,ordinary and accepted sense in the common speech of men furthermore,i nsurance contracts,because of the inequality of the bargaining position of the parties,are construed strictly against the insurer.mutual of omaha ins.russell,cir.
these rules of construction apply equally to erisa cases governed by federal common law.see miller monumental life ins,cir a pplying federal common law,we determine that the proper inquiry is not what the insurer intended a term to signify rather,we consider the common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person in the position of the plan participant would have understood the words to mean.internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted third alteration in original see also jones metro.life ins,cir f ederal common diversity cases to present day erisa upon the expectations and intentions of the insured.likewise,the doctrine of contra proferentem,which requires us to construe all ambiguities against the drafter,applies here.see miller,at adopting rule that contra proferentum applies to de novo review of erisa plans 
the first circuit dealt with facts very similar to the instant case in vickers boston mutual life insurance,applying erisa.the insured suffered a heart attack while dr
