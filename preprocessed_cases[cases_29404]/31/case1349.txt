family code section provides that the family law court shall consider the earning capacity of each party in ordering spousal support,but the decision whether to order support based on a party earning capacity rather than actual earnings is a matter within the court discretion.see,in re marriage of rosen th.in the case before us today,the family law court entered a spousal support order based in part upon a finding that a spouse with a employment history with the california state university could earn more income by taking his retirement from the california public employees retirement system calpers,and returning to work with the university under its faculty early retirement program ferp.in other words,the family law court ruled that the spouse support obligation would take into account his earning capacity imputed from a retirement scenario,rather than on his actual income from employment.we reverse.
background 
roman and janice kochan married in july in november,janice left the family residence,and moved into her mother home.roman was years old when the parties separated janice was years old.in february,janice filed a petition to dissolve the parties marriage 
roman started working at california state university long beach csulb in,and continued working at csulb throughout the parties marriage.at the time of trial and judgment,he remained employed at csulb.his current position is dean of library services at csulb.janice earned a bachelor degree shortly after she married roman,but primarily worked in the family home during the marriage.she began working in one of csulb academic advising departments after the parties youngest child started elementary school.
the family law proceedings 
in june,the family law court issued pendent lite support orders.the court found that roman had a gross monthly income of,while janice anticipated a gross monthly income of.the court ordered roman to pay spousal support to janice in the amount of,retroactive to march.the court deferred to a later date the issue of attorneys fees.
in august,janice filed an order to show cause osc to modify the support orders.the evidence at the hearing on janice osc showed that she was not working roman income remained the same at per month,but he was then also receiving social security benefits in the amount of per month.in october,the family law court issued modified support orders.the court increased roman spousal support obligation to per month,and ordered roman to pay for janice attorneys fees at a rate of per month.the court appointed a pension expert to examine and report on the value of roman calpers pension,and reserved the issue of the expert fees.
in november,roman filed a chapter liquidation bankruptcy petition.roman bankruptcy petition listed secured debts including mortgage loans with a first and second trust deed on the family residence,and a lease on janice car,and a loan on another vehicle.he listed another rounded in unsecured community debts,including the in attorneys fees that the family law court had ordered him to pay in the dissolution action in february,roman served and filed written notice advising the family law court and janice of the automatic stay in his bankruptcy action.
over several trial days from march through october,the family law court tried issues exempt from the bankruptcy stay,including spousal support,attorneys fees,and division of roman calpers pension.janice testified on her own behalf and called the following witnesses henry dubois a former of roman at csulb,now retired,mark tubbiola a forensic economist,barbara difranza a certified family law attorney specializing in pension plans,and gail,janice mental health counselor.for his part,roman testified on his own behalf and called denise torres janice sister.
by the end of trial,the evidence established the following facts.roman current earnings from csulb were and that his social security benefit was,for a gross monthly income of.secured debts included the mortgage on the family residence and a car loan payment,both of which roman had affirmed in his bankruptcy case.roman,however,had stopped paying the mortgage in february.janice had no income other than spousal support her disability benefits had expired.
the actuarial value of roman calpers retirement benefits as of october was,and the community percent interest in those benefits was.the value of the community interest in the pension plan peaked as of the date of the parties separation,and was decreasing so long as roman continued to work,because roman had reached the maximum multiplier used to determine plan payments due to his more than years of service.by continuing to work,roman was causing the actuarial value of his pension and its value to the community to decrease each year.this issue is discussed more fully below.although the loss would be offset against annual increases resulting from added service years and any increase in salary,those increases would accrue to roman separate property interest in the plan.
roman decision not to retire reduced the overall value of his calpers pension because,in the words of the forensic economist,if you give up your retirement for three or four years,you going to give up all payments during those years,and then the rest of the future years are going to be not as valuable because you going to be older when you start your benefits.a gillmore order see in re marriage of gillmore cal d gillmore would cut off losses to the community interest in the retirement from roman continued employment,but not without other factors coming into play by affecting an immediate gillmore order,janice would forego the benefit of roman future salary increases,if any.in the event roman died before retiring,janice share of the pension would be limited to a return of roman contributions roughly,six months of salary,and a death benefit,all of which would be less than the present value of janice interest in roman pension.
a number of different retirement options were available to roman from calpers,but he could not elect an option until he actually took his retirement.if roman retired immediately,his monthly benefit would be,and the community interest in that benefit would be,and janice share would be.calpers would not set up a separate account for janice because she was not of retirement age 
under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between csulb and certain of its employees,ferp benefits were available to roman.under the ferp,an employee may begin a service retirement and be rehired concurrently at the same pay scale,working.if roman elected to participate in the ferp,he would receive full retirement benefits from calpers,plus ferp income for employment,and thereby increase his current income by percent.roman would also proportionally increase his net disposable income because his current income is subject to social security taxes and calpers contributions,but ferp income is not.
the ferp process in practice was explained through henry dubois testimony.if roman took ferp,he would have worked at csulb for years when he exercised his rights.although he would no longer be recognized as an administrator in that he would become a faculty member senior librarian,he would continue to earn the same salary scale and continue to perform the same job duties.the only material difference would be that he would work two and days a week,and he would not hold his former title.he would receive his full calpers retirement,and would be paid at his same salary scale.he would receive pay raises,and accrue sick days and vacation,and health and other benefits as he did before ferp,but at rates.he would no longer contribute to calpers.when the court asked whether the university may reject a person request to participate in the ferp,dubois answered that it was a contract guaranteed benefit.a formal application must be made,but the university would approve it.dubois was not aware of the ferp being denied to any person who had applied to participate in the program.however,he recalled that some had been asked to leave the program in the due to financial conditions facing the university.
janice remained on disability leave,and was taking medication for depression,anxiety and insomnia,and receiving therapy from.it was opinion that janice suffered a major depressive episode in july,and that,while she was improving through therapy,she needed continued therapy for an unknown length of time.janice prognosis for returning to gainful employment,even,was unknown,but she was not malingering.given janice fear of roman,it would be unreasonable for her to resume her former employment at the csulb campus.
janice intended to obtain a master degree,which she estimated would take three to four years.she had looked for an apartment,but was still living with her mother she had no significant savings.she paid per month for a lease on her lexus.she and roman had filed separate tax returns,but she still owed taxes because roman had claimed head of household on his tax return,and taken all of the allowable dependency deductions.
roman did not want to use the ferp benefit.he enjoyed his work and did not want to retire.once he retired,he was not going to work.when he filed bankruptcy,the community obligations were current.after filing for bankruptcy,he stopped paying their debts,except for a car payment and the house payments.in february,he stopped the house payments because,he said,there was no value in the house.although his testimony regarding the family residence asset was somewhat defensive and evasive,he acknowledged that janice had requested that the family residence be listed for sale,and that he had not gotten around to addressing a sale.he did not want to use the ferp benefit,even if it would increase his income enough to save the house.
the statement of decision,order for attorneys fees and judgment 
on july,the family law court orally issued its intended decision on the litigated issues,and directed janice counsel to prepare a written statement of decision and judgment.the court took the matter of attorneys fees under submission.
on october,janice counsel submitted a declaration and supporting documentation requesting attorneys fees and costs totaling.roman filed an opposition.on november,the court issued a written tentative decision on attorneys fees which then became the court statement of decision.the court found that janice reasonable attorneys fees totaled.
on february,the court signed and filed a stipulated amended statement of decision,along with its final judgment.the judgment and statement of decision together include findings that the actuarial value of the community interest in roman calpers retirement as of the date of trial was,and that janice share was.the court acknowledged that it could not compel roman to retire.however,it found his decision not to retire constituted a failure to maximize the value of the community interest in his calpers pension in violation of his fiduciary duties to the community the court determined that janice was entitled to compensation for the loss caused by the breach of fiduciary duty.
the court also found that roman had breached his fiduciary duties regarding the family residence by not paying the mortgage when able to do so,and by not cooperating in listing it for sale so as to minimize losses to the community.the court reserved jurisdiction over the residence,and ruled that the measure of damages would be determined by proof upon final disposition of the property.
the court ruled that it could not assign any community debts to roman because of the discharge entered in his bankruptcy proceeding,and,on that basis,allocated all of the community debts to janice,subject to consideration of that allocation in determining the spousal support to be ordered.
the court ordered roman to pay spousal support of per month until either party death,janice remarriage,or further order of court.janice was ordered to notify counsel within hours of becoming employed.the judgment incorporated the court order to award attorneys fees in the amount of rounded to janice counsel.
the court statement of decision includes this paragraph the court can not require roman to retire or to exercise the ferp option.however,this court can compensate janice for roman failure to maximize the return to the community the evidence shows that if roman were to retire at this time and exercise the ferp option,he would receive per month in retirement payments.from that,he would deduct the per month which he would pay to janice under gillmore.in addition,he would receive per month in social security benefits and a salary of,giving him a total income of per month,after janice portion of the retirement was deducted.
discussion 
spousal support 
roman contends the family law court spousal support order must be reversed because the court abused its discretion by basing support on his earning capacity,rather than his actual current income.we reframe the issue should the family law court have fixed roman spousal support obligation based on his actual earnings of per month or on his earning capacity of per month in a retirement we agree with roman that court abused its discretion by basing support on the greater income figure.
at one time,our courts followed the philbin rule see philbin philbin d when it came to considering a spouse earning capacity,as distinguished from his or her actual income,in fixing a support order.under the philbin rule,a court in fixing spousal support could consider a party earning capacity only when it appeared from the record that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to avoid his or her support obligation by refusing to seek or accept gainful employment id.at,italics added.in other words,a court could fix support based on earning capacity only when the evidence indicated that a party was intentionally depressing his or her income to an artificial low,italics added.under today family law statutes and jurisprudence,a deliberate attempt to depress income remains the usual factual circumstance in which the family law court will base support on earning capacity,but bad faith is not a required factor.see,in re marriage of ilas th,ilas.instead,support must be based on an assessment and balancing of the enumerated statutory criteria regardless of evidence showing a deliberate attempt to avoid a support obligation.in re marriage of stephenson th,in re marriage of simpson cal th.the final decision on a spousal support order is a matter to be determined in the court discretion.in re marriage of rosen,supra,th at.
none of the authorities cited in the parties briefs on appeal directly addresses the issue presented in this case.that is,may the family law trial court,in fixing the level of spousal support,consider the added income a party would earn by taking retirement and then returning to work.roman cites in re marriage of reynolds th reynolds in support of an argument that no one may be compelled to work after the usual retirement age of in order to pay spousal support.id.at.he contends that by implication that means that no party may be required to retire at the usual age of in order to pay support.for her part,janice cites in re marriage of padilla th padilla,and ilas,supra,th in support of her argument that the published cases reject the proposition that a spouse employment decisions for reasons personal to him or her may trump the spouse support obligation when those decisions are harmful to those to whom he or she owed a duty of support.
as we have noted,these case do not directly address the issue of the propriety of a spousal support order which may effectively require a party to elect between taking a retirement to pay a spousal support order,or risking a failure to pay the support order.in reynolds,a physician spouse suffered a leg injury,lost his job,realized it was finally time to retire,and sought a reduction in his spousal support obligation.the family law court partially reduced support,but largely refused to recognize the effect of the retirement in making its order,imputing income based on the physician spouse ability to work.the court of appeal reversed,concluding that the family law court order effectively required the physician spouse to continue working.reynolds,supra,th at.the court of appeal determined just as a married couple may expect a reduction in income due to retirement,a divorced spouse can not expect to receive the same high level of support after the supporting spouse retires.id.at.
in padillia,a father left his job in good faith to start a new business,and sought modification of child support payments.the family law court imputed income of nearly per month,notwithstanding that the evidence showed his actual earnings were in the range of per month.the court of appeal affirmed,finding there had been no abuse of discretion.padilla,supra,th at.as the court of appeal explained,the predominant guiding factor in the child support context is the best interests of the child.in ilas,a pharmacist sought to obtain a reduction in child and spousal support because he had decided to resign his job and attend medical school.the family law court said no,even if he was acting in good faith.again,the court of appeal affirmed.ilas,supra,th at.
we believe that reynolds offers the more analogous reasoning in considering how to evaluate the retirement factor on a spousal support order and where child support is not a concern.we hold that the family law court abuses its discretion when it bases an order for spousal support on a finding that a spouse present earnings from employment can be increased by taking a retirement,and returning to work in an available,but different,position.in our view,the family law court should no more enter an order that will effectively require a spouse to take a retirement than it should enter a support order that effectively requires a spouse to forego retirement.reynolds,supra,th at.we are also concerned that a rule allowing consideration of increased income from a scenario may be troublesome in other situations.for example,in the event a judicial officer were to divorce,may the family law court consider the likelihood that he or she would earn significantly greater income in private practice or by becoming a private judge if a physician at a public health clinic divorces,may the family law court consider the likelihood that he or she would earn significantly greater income by taking employment with an hmo or private hospital should a science or math teacher support obligation to be measured by the income earnable in a corporate position we decline to accept the proposition that consideration of increased income from an alternative to employment is similar to consideration of the income a party foregoes by walking away from his or her current employment.
we recognize that the family law court decision in the current case is a bit more nuanced than simply imputing greater income from a retirement.specifically,the court found that roman decision not to retire caused a loss to the community.we find this nuance does not compel a different result inasmuch as the same end point is reached whether the retirement element is viewed as a act,or as a straightforward imputing of income based on earning capacity rather than actual income.we are careful to note that we do not see any facts or findings in the current case suggesting there may have been an attempted manipulation of the retirement factor to the detriment of the former spouse.the evidence did not establish that roman had planned on retiring,but then altered those plans to prevent an anticipated increase in income.in the final analysis,we are satisfied that a spouse who continues working in a position should not have his or her support obligation based on his or her earnings capacity measured by some alternative employment scenario.
ii.attorneys fees 
roman contends the family court order awarding in attorneys fees to janice counsel must be reversed because it countermands the orders of the bankruptcy court.more specifically,roman argues the family law court predicated its decision to award attorneys fees on the fact that roman had filed a bankruptcy petition.according to roman,he has been sanctioned in the order of fees for his exercise of his right to file bankruptcy.roman also argues the family law court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys fees without consideration of his ability to pay.see,subd.a.we decline to reverse the judgment on the ground argued by roman,but agree that the issue of attorneys fees should be revisited because the existing orders appear to be based,at least in part,on roman earning capacity,rather than his actual income.
these are roman calculations and his analysis he had only left after payment of taxes and his support and gillmore payments to janice he could not afford to pay the for the residence he had his own attorney fees to pay and,although they paled in comparison to the fees charged by janice attorney,they were substantial given his own resources.while the court made mention of these burdens,there is no evidence that it actually considered them.the court swept them aside saying that roman had an earning capacity of per month and could therefore afford the fee order.
we see nothing in the record to support roman claim that the family law court did not consider the parties respective burdens when it determined the issue of attorneys fees.the court determination was based on an earnings capacity,rather than roman actual earnings,and it is those predicate figures that have affected the attorneys fee award,not any omission of the part of the court to consider any relevant factor under the codes.because we have determined that the family law court should revisit the issue of spousal support based on roman actual current income,and because the attorneys fee issue is also related to the parties respective financial circumstances,we agree with roman that the court should reconsider the award of attorneys fees on remand,taking into consideration his actual earnings.
to the extent roman appears to argue that all of the attorneys fees incurred by janice up to the date he filed his bankruptcy petition were discharged in his bankruptcy case,we do not agree.the only debt actually owed by roman on the date he filed his bankruptcy petition in november was the order issued by the family law court in october directing roman to pay to janice counsel.to the extent roman appears to argue that the trial court could not order any attorneys fees payable by roman,we do not agree.the bankruptcy statutes provide that a petitioner domestic support obligations are not dischargeable in bankruptcy,and attorneys fees orders in dissolution actions are encompassed in this rule.a jones tyson cir.
iii.the family residence the possession and use issue 
roman contends there is no substantial evidence to support the family law court finding that janice could come to the family house.the legal significance of this attack on the court finding is difficult to discern from roman opening brief.even so,there is evidence in the record to support the court finding that janice did not and could not live in the family residence.
in orally pronouncing its decision,the family law court addressed the issue of the family residence by expressly finding that roman had exclusive use and occupancy of the community asset after janice moved out in november.the court further found that roman had failed and refused to make the mortgage payments,which put the loan on the property into default,and placed the home in jeopardy of foreclosure.the court found he had income of per month and that his debts had been discharged in bankruptcy.further,that after the bankruptcy,the only debt he needed to pay was the mortgage of per month,which would have saved the home.the court found that roman was able to pay this debt and preserve this asset,but he chose not to do it.the court then found that roman had expressly admitted,i do care about the house.it also found that although he had exclusive use and possession of the house,he had deliberately chosen not to put the house on the market.in that same vein,the court found that,when janice attorney requested that the house be put on the market for sale,roman put the onus on janice to sell the house.this,notwithstanding that she could not go to the home if roman was present because a restraining order had been issued requiring roman to stay yards away
