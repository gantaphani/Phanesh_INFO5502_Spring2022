a lifetime can be a slippery concept in the context of retiree benefits litigation under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.this case asks us to consider,on the heels of vallone cna financial corporation,cir,whether designating retiree benefits as lifetime really means for life.unlike previous cases,where the interpretation of explicit lifetime language was constrained by reservation of rights clauses allowing an employer to modify or terminate retiree welfare benefits,the plan documents at issue here contain no such limiting language.accordingly,we find that the lifetime language,as used here,is ambiguous as to vesting,and so we reverse the grant of summary judgment to the defendant and remand this case for further proceedings.
the plaintiffs in the present case are former retired salaried and hourly employees of fiatallis north america,fana,who retired in the late through and their surviving spouses.most are at least eighty years of age and are presumably on fixed incomes.before or upon their retirement,each of the plaintiffs received documents known as summary plan descriptions spds that described the medical and dental benefits that they would receive and that allegedly contained explicit promises that retirees and their spouses would continue to receive these benefits at little or no cost until their death.
of the five spds at issue in this case,three refer to salaried employees,and two address hourly employees.we will discuss the spds in the chronological order of their issuance.an spd related to a benefit for retired salaried employees plan,which covers retired salaried employees who retired after,provides that health insurance and dental coverage remains in effect as long as your or your surviving spouse are living.the spd related to a group health plan for salaried active employees,dated january of and distributed to active salaried employees,states in pertinent part that upon retirement benefits continue to be paid for by the company,and that employees who wish to continue major medical coverage must continue to pay their share of the cost.with respect to retirees spouses,the plan document states that the spouse and any eligible dependents can continue the protection until the spouse dies,remarries,or is covered by another employee group plan spouses are required to make monthly payments for both basic and major medical coverage.the two plan documents applicable to hourly employees are essentially identical.the health benefits plan and benefits for retired hourly employees plan documents,created in january of and distributed to hourly employees at fana carol stream and deerfield plants,both state that b enefits are provided to help you meet the expense of illness,injury,and other similar emergencies within your family and that i f a retired employee dies,the surviving spouse will have basic coverage continued for his or her lifetime at no cost.finally,plan documents dated march and april of,titled benefit fact sheets,that were provided to salaried employees affected by the shutdown of fana springfield plant,state that s alaried employees for retirement will have the retired employee benefits in effect prior to march.none of these documents contain express reservation of rights clauses.
in the,fana and its italian parent corporation sought advice from three outside law firms as to whether these retiree plan benefits were vested.the employer had in mind an onion solution to deal with rising insurance costs,under which retiree benefits would be gradually peeled away.lou bland,a named retiree plaintiff,who served as a former and member of the employee benefits committee,received copies of documents discussing the onion solution in the course of his employment,and retained these documents upon retirement.
in,fana published another spd for active employees that altered the description of plan benefits and expressly reserved the right to amend benefits this document did not state that these changes were effective with respect to retirees,and no plaintiff received it.late in,however,the plaintiffs received plan documents containing new benefit descriptions,which stated that costs for medical and dental coverage would dramatically increase as of february,and warned that benefits could be modified even after retirement 
angered by these modifications,plaintiffs filed suit in illinois state court,contending that fana had unilaterally reduced vested benefits by greatly increasing the cost to retirees.the case was then removed by fana to federal district court.after discovery began,the plaintiffs uncovered documents discussing the onion solution,and turned the documents over to defense counsel on the grounds that the documents might be privileged.fana then requested a protective order claiming that the documents were privileged as communications or work product and moved for the appointment of a magistrate judge to determine privilege issues.after conducting an in camera review,the magistrate judge entered a recommendation that most of the documents,including portions discussing the onion solution,were protected and inadmissible since they contained communications including attorney advice and relating exclusively to amendment or termination of the plan.the magistrate also rejected the plaintiffs claims that numerous exceptions to the privilege applied.
after the district court accepted the magistrate recommendations,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that fana had established a new health plan less favorable to plaintiffs in february of in breach of erisa contract obligations and that fana had made oral and written promises vesting health benefits that had been breached,thus violating erisa fiduciary duties and the principles of estoppel.the plaintiffs never sought to certify any class under.the parties then filed for judgment on the pleadings as to the alleged breach of the erisa contract obligations claim.the district court awarded judgment on the pleadings to fana,and the plaintiffs then voluntarily dismissed their other claims without prejudice in order to pursue an appeal of the ruling relating to the alleged breach of erisa contract obligations.after the district court questioned whether these matters were in fact ripe for appeal,the plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their breach of fiduciary duty and estoppel claims with prejudice.thus,the only issues before us are whether the plan documents contain language that unambiguously vested erisa contract rights or that is so ambiguous as to require a trial on the issue of vesting.there is a further question whether the district court erred in not admitting certain documents into evidence under exceptions to the privilege doctrine.
we review the decision to grant fana motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo.forseth village of sussex,cir.
today employment market is heavily impacted by the abruptly rising cost of health care,and the ensuing increases in health insurance premiums.the plan documents in the present case,created in the and,likely were the product of a social reality different from that now prevailing.before,employers in many cases,in granting health benefits,did not consider a possible need to modify them in the future.only later with spiraling medical costs,heightened foreign competition,epidemic corporate and the declining bargaining power of labor was thought given to modifying benefits granted to retirees.see bidlack wheelabrator,cir cudahy,concurring.thus,at the time the relevant plan documents were created,there may not have been much thought given to any language affecting possible future changes in benefits.this expectation has now changed,and many courts have rejected retirees attempts to show that their benefits have vested under the language of plan documents.meanwhile,retirees living on limited fixed incomes can be squeezed by unanticipated increases in medical costs.it is with this historical context in mind that we turn to the question whether the fana plan documents vested retiree health benefits here.
under erisa,employee benefit plans are classified either as welfare benefit plans or as pension plans.see,a.pension plans provide retirement income to employees or allow employees to defer the receipt of income until or beyond the termination of the covered employment.a.welfare benefits,on the other hand,provide medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment.while pension benefits are subject to strict vesting requirements,welfare benefits such as health and life insurance are vested only if the plan contract so provides.see also schoonejongen,d nor does erisa establish any minimum participation,vesting,or funding requirements for welfare plans as it does for pension plans.citation omitted bidlack wheelabrator,cir erisa does not require the vesting of health or other welfare benefits as it does pension benefits.citations omitted.thus,employers are generally free for any reason at any time,to adopt,modify or terminate welfare plans,at.
welfare benefits may vest,however,when employers elect to enter into a private contract with employees as set forth in benefit plan documents.see rail employees ass atchison,topeka,santa fe ry,d noting that an employer may contractually cede its freedom not to vest benefits.if welfare benefits vest at all,they do so under the terms of a particular contract.vallone cna financial,cir citing pabst brewing corrao,cir.an erisa plan is a contract.herzberger standard ins,cir quoting anstett industries,cir.therefore,t he question before us is essentially one of contract interpretation,and so federal principles of contract construction apply.diehl twin disc,cir.under these rules,a document should be read as a whole with all its parts given effect,and related documents must be read together.murphy keystone steel wire,cir citations omitted.in addition,we will give contract terms their ordinary and popular sense and avoid resort to extrinsic evidence when faced with unambiguous language.diehl,at.contract language is unambiguous if it is susceptible to only one reasonable interpretation.murphy,at citations omitted.only if the language of the plan document is ambiguous and these ambiguities are not clarified elsewhere in the document may we consider evidence of the parties intent that is extrinsic to the writing.vallone,at.
upon vesting,benefits become forever unalterable,and because employers are not legally required to vest benefits,the intention to vest must be found in clear and express language in plan documents.rail employees ass n,at.see also vallone,at stating that a modification that purports to vest welfare benefits must be contained in the plan documents and must be stated in clear and express language.sengpiel goodrich,cir stating that the intent to vest must be found in the plan documents and must be stated in clear and express language uaw skinner engine,cir stating that an employer commitment to vest such benefits is not to be inferred lightly and must be stated in clear and express language.plan language should be read in an ordinary and popular sense,construed as if by a person of average intelligence and experience.grun pneumo abex,cir.
we have rejected the position that documents must use the word vest or some variant of it,or that the relevant writings must state unequivocally that the employer is creating rights that will not expire,since a court should not refuse to enforce a contract simply because the parties fail to use the prescribed formula.bidlack,at.in addition,the same principles apply to a vesting analysis whether the retiree benefits are provided under a collective bargaining agreement or under summary plan documents,since the same underlying considerations are present irrespective of the particular type of document at issue.skinner engine,at.see also rossetto pabst brewing,cir stating that the issue in rossetto was when a right to health benefits that is granted to retired workers by a collective bargaining agreement or an erisa plan,but that is not this case survives the termination of the agreement.emphasis added.
this circuit has held that there is a presumption against vesting when there is silence that indicates that welfare benefits are not vested.vallone,at.see also rossetto,at our presumption against vesting kicks in only if all the court has to go on is silence.significantly,this presumption is not an evidentiary presumption,but an exploding presumption that disappears in the face of evidence.rossetto,at citing bidlack,at.
as judge posner remarked in rossetto,the presumption against vesting is defeated by any positive indication of ambiguity,something to make you scratch your head.at.the language contained in the plan documents before us certainly makes us scratch our heads.
lifetime language is found in three plan documents.thus,the benefit for retired salaried employees plan document covering retired salaried employees who retired after,provides that health insurance and dental coverage remains in effect as long as you or your surviving spouse are living.in addition,the health benefits plan and benefits for retired hourly employees plan documents distributed to hourly employees at fana carol stream and deerfield plants state that i f a retired employee dies,the surviving spouse will have basic coverage continued for his or her lifetime at no cost.finally,the benefit fact sheets provided to salaried employees affected by shutdown of fana springfield plant state that employees would have the retired employee benefits in effect prior to march,which plaintiffs contend were those established in the benefit for retired salaried employees plan,noted above.
but other language in the plan documents is comparatively weak.the january group health plan for active salaried employees document simply assures active salaried employees that benefits continue to be paid for by the company,and that spouses and dependents can continue the protection.and the two plan documents directed to hourly employees merely state that benefits are provided for retirees.significantly,there is no express reservation of rights clause in any of the plan documents.
to further complicate the matter,the question arises whether the benefits for retired salaried employees plan document may be applied to employees who retired after the group health plan for active salaried employees was established.the district court found that the benefits for retired salaried employees plan governed only the claims of salaried employees who retired in and later stated that this plan was replaced in january of by the group health plan for active salaried employees.the district court also concluded with respect to the benefit fact sheets that they referenced only the january group health plan for active salaried employees,and not the benefits for retired salaried employees plan of vintage.we are doubtful,however,that such conclusions can be reached on summary judgment.
whatever plans were in effect at any given time,the language in the plan documents leads us to conclude that they are not silent as to vesting,but merely somewhat vague however,they are clear enough to vitiate the presumption against vesting.the absence of a reservation of rights clause distinguishes this case from vallone,and the lifetime language used in the plan documents is stronger and more explicit than language in comparable cases.see senn united dominion,cir holding that language stating welfare benefits will continue did not create ambiguity as to vesting.see also skinner engine,at,holding that plan language stating that health benefits will continue and life insurance shall remain at the same level did not unambiguously express an intent to vest benefits for life because there was no durational language,and the language was not ambiguous because it merely indicated a continuation of prior practice and policies.and the language before us is either similar to or more explicit than language that we and other courts have found to be at least ambiguous with respect to vesting.see rossetto,at finding latent ambiguity in collective bargaining agreements conferring benefits upon retirees consisting either of medigap insurance or in line with the coverage given to active employees and stating that benefits w
