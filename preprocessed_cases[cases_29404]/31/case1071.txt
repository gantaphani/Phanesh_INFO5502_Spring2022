we must decide whether a decedent succeeded in his attempt to ensure that his son and not his received the benefits to which his employer retirement plans entitled him.
when he retired in october,asa williams,asa,senior had worked for the xerox corporation for over thirty years.he participated in various benefit programs that xerox maintained for its employees,including the xerox retirement income guarantee plan the rigp and the xerox savings plan the savings plan,and,together with the rigp,collectively,the xerox plans,both of which are subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.
asa,senior,married carmen mays williams carmen in january.in,he formally designated carmen as his beneficiary under the xerox plans.following his divorce from carmen in,he attempted to change his designated beneficiary under the xerox plans from his now carmen to his son from an earlier marriage,asa williams,asa,junior.specifically,in july,asa,senior,telephonically undesignated carmen as his beneficiary under the rigp,and indicated that he wanted his son as beneficiary instead.asa,senior,gave similar telephonic instructions with respect to the rigp in february and with respect to both xerox plans in january.in each instance,following the telephone conversation with xerox,asa,senior,received,but did not sign and return,beneficiary designation forms requesting that he confirm his selection of his son as beneficiary.
on may,asa,senior,died.
a month later,carmen wrote to xerox claiming to be her beneficiary under the xerox plans.asa,junior,likewise asserted a right to the plan proceeds.rather than resolve the competing claims,the fiduciary of the xerox plans interpleaded the two parties in federal district court seeking its determination as to the proper beneficiary.carmen moved for summary judgment,asserting that because asa,senior,failed to fill out and to return the beneficiary designation forms,he did not properly designate asa,junior,as beneficiary in her place.
the district court granted carmen motion for summary judgment,and declined,on the subsequent motion of asa,junior,to reconsider its judgment.asa,junior,filed a timely notice of appeal.
the xerox retirement income guarantee plan agreement the rigp agreement provides the terms and procedures under which xerox extends retirement benefits to qualified employees,including the procedure for designating a beneficiary.by its terms,unmarried participants shall designate a beneficiary,and may change the designation of beneficiary from time to time.a married participant,in contrast,before designat ing one other than his spouse as beneficiary,must first obtain the requisite spousal consent complying in every respect with regulations promulgated by the secretary of the treasury.the agreement also bestows upon the plan administrator the discretion to construe and interpret the provisions of the plan,determine all questions of fact,and make rules and regulations under the plan to the extent deemed advisable or helpful.
the xerox retirement income guarantee plan summary plan description the rigp spd,or spd similarly notes that,while unmarried participants can name anyone they want to be the beneficiary of any death benefit that may become payable,erisa restricts married participants from freely designating beneficiaries.c.specifically,the spd explains that if a married participant age or older wishes to designate a beneficiary other than his wife,he must submit his spouse written and notarized consent to do so on forms available the spd does not outline any further requirements for designating a beneficiary.rather,it explains that a participant may visit the your benefits resources web site or call the xerox benefits center to complete or change his beneficiary designation at any time.elsewhere,the spd explains that,upon the death of an unmarried participant,a valid beneficiary designation must be on file with the xerox benefits center prior to death,or xerox will disburse benefits to the participant estate.
the xerox savings plan agreement together with the rigp agreement,collectively,the plan agreements was not in the record before the district court at the time of carmen motion for summary judgment.rather,carmen attached five pages of excerpts from the agreement as an exhibit to her response to a subsequent motion for reconsideration.these excerpts which do not include a signature page,a date of adoption,or any authentication besides the affidavit of carmen attorney outline a similar procedure for beneficiary designations to the one described in the rigp agreement.they also delegate to the plan administrator the authority to prescribe such schedules or forms which he deems necessary or helpful to carry out the purposes of the plan 
the xerox savings plan summary plan description the savings plan spd,and,together with the rigp spd,collectively,the spds contains similar language to the rigp spd regarding beneficiary designations,except that the savings plan spd omits any reference to any required form,even when describing the restrictions on a married participant freedom to designate beneficiaries.
an erisa fiduciary must distribute benefits in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.a d.in granting summary judgment in favor of carmen,the district court determined that the beneficiary designation forms themselves constituted plan documents which asa,senior,needed to sign and to return in order to change his beneficiary designation.asa,junior,disputes this determination,and argues that the beneficiary forms do not constitute plan documents.
in kennedy plan administrator for dupont savings investment plan,the supreme court declined to decide whether the category of documents and instruments governing the plan described in a d included beneficiary designation forms such as those at issue in this case.id.at.nor have we yet addressed the question thus,whether such beneficiary forms constitute plan documents presents this court with a question of first impression.
we draw guidance from our previous interpretation of a similar erisa provision,b.see hughes salaried retirees action comm.adm r of the hughes non bargaining ret.plan,cir en banc.under b,plan administrators are required,upon the request of a participant or beneficiary,to provide the requesting party with a copy of various plan documents,including spds,annual reports,terminal reports,bargaining agreements,trust agreements,contracts,and other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.b.in hughes salaried retirees action committee administrator of the hughes non bargaining retirement plan,we interpreted that category to include only those documents that provide individual participants with information about the plan and benefits.id.at.citing legislative history,the en banc panel explained that b includes only those documents that elucidate exactly where the participant stands with respect to the plan what benefits he may be entitled to,what circumstances may preclude him from obtaining benefits,what procedures he must follow to obtain benefits id.quoting,at internal quotation marks omitted.notably,the en banc panel specifically rejected an interpretation of b to include all documents that are critical to the operation of the plan.id.internal quotation marks omitted.rather,the en banc panel limited the other instruments category to those similar in nature to the documents specifically listed in b.id.at 
in kennedy,the supreme court suggested that the other instruments category described in b overlaps with the documents and instruments governing the plan category in a d.at.indeed,the category described in a d may be even narrower than that described in b thus,only those that provide information as to where the participant stands with respect to the plan,such as an spd or trust agreement might,could qualify as governing documents with which a plan administrator must comply in awarding benefits under a d.because the beneficiary designation forms in this case provide no such information rather,they simply confirm the participant attempt to change his designated beneficiary the forms are not plan documents
