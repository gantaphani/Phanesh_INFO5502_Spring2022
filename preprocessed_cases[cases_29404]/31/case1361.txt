material facts and proceedings below 
petitioner rolando villazon,personal representative of the estate of his deceased wife,susan villazon,seeks review of the decision of the third district court of appeal affirming the trial court summary judgment in favor of prudential health care plan,prucare in petitioner action against prucare for the wrongful death of his wife.through her employer,susan villazon became a member of prucare,a health maintenance organization.after having a mouth ailment allegedly misdiagnosed or mistreated,villazon died as a result of an untreated cancerous tongue condition.
villazon filed an action for wrongful death based on negligence against villazon primary care physician,melvyn sarnow and against her health care provider,respondent prucare.in count vi of his amended complaint,villazon alleged the basis for prucare vicarious liability and breach of a nondelegable duty to be 
the defendant,prudential health care plan,is a health maintenance organization doing business in dade county florida as defined by and governed by section et,florida statutes chapter,florida administrative code section e and part.
susan cohen villazon was a prudential health care plan,subscriber under a health maintenance contract by which prudential health care plan,agreed to provide susan cohen villazon with comprehensive health care services.
by statute,rule,and contract,the defendant,prudential health care plan,had the duty to provide susan cohen villazon with quality health care including without limitation,hospital services,and medical,surgical,diagnostic,laboratory,nursing,physical therapy,and pharmaceutical services.
the defendant,prudential health care plan,contracted with melvyn sarnow,basilio,and harvey satz,to provide susan cohen villazon with health care services,and prudential health care plan,is responsible for any and all negligence of melvyn sarnow,basilio,and harvey satz,in the rendering or failure to render health care to susan cohen villazon,as more specifically set forth herein.
the defendant,prudential health care plan,as set forth herein breached its duty to provide quality health care to susan cohen villazon,resulting in her death.
as a result of the acts and conduct of the defendant,prudential health care plan,by and through its agents,apparent agents,employees,susan cohen villazon sustained injury and ultimately died on february.
emphasis supplied.as set forth in the third district opinion 
villazon argues that prudential health care controlled the referral process and required that authorization be obtained prior to the performance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.prudential health also required that the contracted physicians adhere to rules and seek approval for diagnostic tests.physicians had to provide and arrange health care services through prudential health and refer subscribers to contracted providers.villazon,however,does not allege that his wife was denied proper medical testing and referrals to specialists.
villazon,so d at.
prucare filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that the claims filed against it were preempted by section a of the employee retirement income security act erisa and that villazon could not prevail on those claims as a matter of state law.the trial court entered summary final judgment in favor of prucare,holding that erisa governed the claims filed against prucare because they related to the manner in which prucare administered its health care plans,and further,that there were no issues of fact as to the theory of vicarious liability or any recognizable cause of action for breach of a duty against prucare under state law.villazon,so d at.on appeal,the district court agreed.id.at.
in addressing the state law issues,the third district rejected villazon position and reasoned that the medical providers were independent contractors because as an independent practice associated health maintenance organization ipa hmo,prucare entered into contracts with physicians who had their own independent practices and who agreed to provide covered services for a contracted rate.the district court highlighted that sarnow was an independent contractor who had his own private practice and agreed to render services to prucare subscribers pursuant to a primary care physician agreement,continuing his own independent practice after he entered into this agreement.
in rejecting villazon argument that prucare had assumed a nondelegable duty to render medical care to his wife in a nonnegligent manner when she purchased health care coverage from prucare,the court noted that villazon had not cited any support for this proposition.the court looked only to the contract between prucare and the physicians and reasoned that it was the best evidence of the intent of the parties,and its meaning and legal effect were questions of law for determination by the court.it was important to the court below that the contractual provisions designated physicians as independent contractors,and the court found no evidence of control upon which to justify imposing responsibility on prucare.villazon,so d at.in focusing solely on the one contract that attempted to designate physicians as independent contractors and also limiting its vision to the issue of actual control,the third district decision is also in conflict with nazworth swire florida,so d dca,which demonstrates that it is the right to control,not the actual control,that may be determinative.
erisa preemption 
as did the district courts in villazon and frappier,we begin our legal analysis by determining the threshold issue of erisa preemption.villazon correctly cites frappier for the proposition that i f a claim relates to the manner in which the erisa plan is administered,erisa preempts the claim.villazon,so d at see also frappier,so d at concerning the direct negligence,corporate liability and implied contract claims,we concur with the lower court decision that these allegations would be completely preempted because they present issues unequivocally related to the administration of the plan and are within the scope of section a b.emphasis supplied.
however,villazon directly conflicts with frappier in its determination of whether a state law wrongful death claim by a deceased patient member estate against a health maintenance organization hmo based upon vicarious liability for asserted medical malpractice of its member physicians relates to administration of the erisa plan and is therefore preempted in villazon,the district court below incorrectly concluded that it did.see villazon,so d at determining that villazon claims directly relate to the health plan as they arise from the denial of medical care and treatment benefits.in frappier,in contrast,the district court correctly determined that erisa does not preempt such vicarious liability claims 
in frappier,the decedent estate filed an action against health options,an hmo,and the two health options physicians who had provided medical care to frappier,asserting that medical malpractice had occurred.the trial court had dismissed frappier complaint with prejudice.frappier,so d at.
the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether an erisa plan ever existed,agreeing that this threshold question must be resolved prior to addressing the issue of whether the dismissed counts are preemptable.id.nevertheless,the district court was compelled to address the merits of the trial court determination that the estate claims against health options are preempted by the federal erisa statute.id.at.nor was this exercise simply gratuitous,as reflected in the district court directive to the trial court,in remanding the case upon an appropriate finding,the trial court may dismiss the estate direct negligence,corporate liability and implied contract claims for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.however,in no event may the vicarious liability count be dismissed as the same does not relate to an employee benefit plan.id.at emphasis supplied.
because no florida case had yet addressed whether direct negligence or vicarious liability claims against an entity involved in an erisa plan are preempted,the fourth district found guidance from decisions rendered by federal courts.it first framed the inquiry pursuant to section a of erisa 
the erisa regulatory scheme was promulgated to entrench as exclusively a federal matter pension plan legislation.pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.the governing provision of erisa relevant to this discussion is section a which provides that this chapter shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.
properly phrased,the issue becomes whether frappier claims against health options as delineated in counts of the complaint are to recover plan benefits due,or to enforce rights,or to clarify rights to benefits under the terms of the plan,as those concepts are detailed in section a b of erisa,a b.although pilot life suggested an expansive interpretation of the triggering jurisdictional clause of the erisa federal regulatory scheme,the united states supreme court in new york blue cross travelers,d,and several more recent lower federal court decisions caution against a literal reading of section a in determining whether preemption is appropriate.new york blue cross directs that in construing the relate to phrase of section a,trial courts must analyze the objectives of the erisa statute to resolve which state laws congress contemplated would continue to survive the ambit of federal regulation.id.at.at.in other words,statutory or common law claims actionable in state court that are periphery or remotely related to competing laws affecting erisa should not be preempted to federal court.shaw delta air lines,d.
frappier,so d at.in deciding that erisa did not preempt frappier vicarious liability claim,the district court made a key distinction between causes of action based upon an hmo having administratively withheld benefits from its member patient and those based upon the quality of hmo benefits actually provided 
in its appellate decision,the court drew the distinction between a lawsuit against an erisa claiming the withholding of benefits and a claim initiated by dukes which attacked the quality of benefits provided by the hmo.id.at.as the court explained 
t he plaintiff claims,even when construed as healthcare suggests,merely attack the quality of the benefits they received the plaintiffs here simply do not claim that the plans erroneously withheld benefits due.nor do they ask the state courts to enforce their rights under the terms of their respective plans or to clarify their rights to future benefits.as a result,the plaintiffs claims fall outside of the scope of a b and these cases must be remanded to the state courts from which they were removed.
id.at.accordingly,dukes considered and rejected the line of cases cited and relied upon by the lower court in determining that erisa preempts the instant vicarious liability claim.we agree with the factual dichotomy expressed in dukes that is critical for this analysis 
t here is no allegation here that the hmos denied anyone any benefits that were due under the plan.instead the plaintiffs here are attempting to hold the hmos liable for their role as the arrangers of their decedents medical treatment.
thus where,as here,an erisa is implicated by a complaint for failing to provide,arrange for,or supervise qualified doctors to provide the actual medical treatment for plan participants,federal preemption is inappropriate.see independence hmo,smith,elsesser hospital of the philadelphia college of osteopathic medicine,kearney healthcare,dearmas.paterno albuerne.burke smithkline.rice panchal,cir pacificare of oklahoma burrage,cir.therefore,even if health options is an erisa subject to federal preemption,we must conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing the vicarious liability count of the instant complaint.
frappier,so d at.we conclude that this erisa preemption discussion is a correct interpretation as applied to state law causes of action against hmos based upon allegations of direct and vicarious liability for negligence in the provision of medical services to member patients.see also in re healthcare,cir claims against hmos for vicarious liability based upon medical negligence of its physicians are not preempted by erisa dukes,at same rice panchal,cir same pacificare of oklahoma,burrage,cir same paterno albuerne,same hinterlong.at,at same pappas asbel,same,cert.denied,d pappas ii.
a similar analysis was employed by the pennsylvania supreme court in pappas ii upon remand from the united states supreme court.in pappas asbel,pappas i,the pennsylvania supreme court had originally held that the plaintiff claim for vicarious liability against the hmo was not preempted by erisa.see id.at.upon appeal to the united states supreme court,the case was remanded to the pennsylvania supreme court for reconsideration in light of pegram herdrich,d in applying the reasoning in pegram,the pappas ii court again determined that the plaintiff claim was not subject to conflict preemption under erisa 
we now turn,as instructed by the supreme court,to a reconsideration of our decision in pappas i in light of pegram.
the court in pegram held that congress did not intend that any hmo be treated as an erisa fiduciary to the extent that it makes mixed eligibility and treatment decisions acting through its physicians.id.at.note observing that under the common law of trusts,which is the source of erisa fiduciary duties,fiduciary responsibility characteristically attaches to financial decisions about managing assets and property,the court doubted that congress would have ever thought of a mixed decision as fiduciary in nature.id.at.because the defense of any hmo of a mixed decision would be that its physician acted for good medical reasons,the plausibility of which would require reference to traditional standards of reasonable medical practice in like circumstances,the court was concerned that a decision to view a mixed decision as an act of erisa fiduciary duty would federalize malpractice litigation.id.at.lastly,the court touched upon but declined to resolve the puzzling issue of preemption that would be raised by the imposition of erisa fiduciary requirements upon an hmo physician making a pure treatment or mixed decision,in view of its holding in travelers 
on its face,federal fiduciary law applying a malpractice standard would seem to be a prescription for preemption of state malpractice law,since the new erisa cause of action would cover the same subject of a malpractice claim to be sure,travelers throws some cold water in the preemption theory there,we held that,in the field of health care,a subject of traditional state regulation,there is no erisa preemption without clear manifestation of congressional purpose.but in that case the convergence of state and federal law was not so clear as in the situation we are positing the standard had not been subsumed by the standard to be applied under erisa.we could struggle with this problem,but first it is well to ask,again,what would be gained by opening the federal courthouse doors to a fiduciary malpractice claim 
pegram,at citations omitted.
note the hmo in pegram was owned by its physicians.healthcare contracts with independent physicians to provide services.pegram result was based on the nature of the hmo decision,not on the structure of the hmo making it.pegram,at.at.further,the supreme court holding was as to hmos.id.thus,the difference in organization between the hmo in pegram and healthcare is not relevant to this analysis.
while travelers and pegram deal with different aspects of erisa,for our present purposes,they share common ground.travelers instructs that erisa does not preempt state law that regulates the provision of adequate medical treatment.pegram instructs that an hmo mixed eligibility and treatment decision implicates a state law claim for medical malpractice,not an erisa cause of action for fiduciary breach.thus,if haverford third party claim against healthcare arose out of a mixed decision,it is,according to pegram,subject to state medical malpractice law,which is what haverford asserted.moreover,under travelers,it is not preempted by erisa.
not surprisingly,healthcare argues that its decision about pappas referral constituted a quintessential coverage determination.we,however,disagree.in our view,the undisputed facts in this case,and the inferences drawn from them,establish the sort of mixed eligibility and treatment decision that pegram discussed.leibowitz,healthcare physician,reviewed pappas case,and rejected another medical doctor opinion based on his clinical judgment that pappas needed to be referred to jefferson for treatment of a medical emergency.instead of referring pappas to jefferson,a hospital,as dickter recommended,leibowitz referred pappas to one of three other facilities for medical care.he did not,in the supreme court words,only make a simple yes or no decision as to whether pappas condition was covered it clearly was.rather,leibowitz also determined where and,under the circumstances,when pappas epidermal abscess would be treated.his was a mixed eligibility and treatment decision,the adverse consequences of which,if any,are properly redressed,as pegram teaches,through state medical malpractice law.this law as travelers teaches,is not preempted by erisa.
pappas ii,at some footnotes omitted.
the second circuit recent interpretation of the united states supreme court decision in pegram also has application here.in cicio does,cir,the circuit court held that a state law malpractice action,if based on a mixed eligibility and treatment decision,is not subject to erisa preemption when that state law cause of action challenges an allegedly flawed medical judgment as applied to a specific patient symptoms.id.at.the court decision correctly recognizes that hmo plan administration is often inextricably intertwined with treatment decisions,and that erisa does not preempt viable state law causes of action arising from such decisions.the cicio decision is consistent with and reflective of the current state of the law in florida.
here,villazon bases his vicarious liability claim against prucare on allegations that agents or apparent agents of prucare made negligent treatment decisions in caring for villazon as the pappas ii court correctly observed,travelers instructs that erisa does not preempt state law that regulates the provision of adequate medical treatment.pappas ii,at see also frappier,so d at recognizing that the united states supreme court in travelers and several more recent lower federal court decisions caution against a literal reading of section a in determining whether preemption is appropriate.
therefore,applying the analysis employed in frappier and pappas ii,we conclude that villazon complaint for vicarious was clearly based upon allegations of negligent failure to provide adequate medical treatment for his wife not subject to erisa conflict preemption.see also lancaster kaiser found.health plan of states,citing pacificare,at we agree with the district court that reference to the plan to resolve the agency issue does not implicate the concerns of erisa preemption.jackson roseman,as for a determination of an hmo vicarious liability,the court correctly opined that reference to the plan,if any,will be necessary only for proving matters of agency,not for wrongful plan administration or of the withholding of promised benefits.haas group health plan,the mere fact that a claim requires examination of a plan to resolve a contractual issue does not alone justify preemption.kearney healthcare,that one may refer to the contents of a plan to adduce evidence that it held out a particular person as its employee or agent to help sustain a cause of action does not implicate the concerns underlying the erisa preemption provision.accordingly,we approve the preemption analysis in frappier,and quash the decision in villazon to the extent of inconsistency with our opinion here.
vicarious liability 
turning now to the state law issue,there are multiple different theories upon which vicarious liability was sought to be imposed a nondelegable duty under the hmo act common law actual agency and common law apparent agency.we agree with the district court rejection of villazon argument that prucare assumed a duty to render medical care to his wife in a manner when she purchased health care coverage from prudential health.villazon,so d at.villazon argues that such nondelegable duty arises under the health maintenance organization act,sections,florida statutes the act the act does not specifically provide a private right of action for damages based upon an alleged violation of its requirements.greene well care hmo,so d,dca holding that the act,which provides for attorney fees i n any civil action brought to enforce the terms and conditions of a health maintenance organization contract does not provide for attorney fees in a civil action based upon a bad faith breach of contract claim.there are other regulatory statutes in which the legislature has specifically created a private right of action.in the nursing home statute,for example,the legislature created a nursing home resident right to receive adequate and appropriate health care,see l.stat,and a concomitant private right of action for deprivation of a resident statutory rights.see.stat.somberg florida convalescent,so d,dca,approved,so d.absent such expression of intent,a private right of action is not implied.murthy sinha,so d,in general,a statute that does not purport to establish civil liability but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare of the public as an entity,will not be construed as establishing a civil liability.quoting moyant beattie,so d,dca.
this does not,however,preclude the right to bring a common law negligence claim based upon the same allegations.see greene,so d at holding that the plaintiffs should be given the opportunity to amend the complaint and try to state a cause of action on these common law claims based upon well care alleged negligent failure to authorize medically necessary services before the court rules that no such cause of action exists in relation to well care.further,contrary to the district court decision below,we conclude that here,at the summary judgment level,it has not been conclusively established that there are no genuine issues of material fact with regard to the motion for summary judgment concerning villazon common law negligence claim based upon allegations that villazon treating physicians were agents or apparent agents of prucare.lewis central.med.group,holding that the disputed agency issue must be determined by the trier of fact where the plaintiff had produced sufficient evidence of agency to defeat the defendant hmo summary judgment motion,even though the hmo certificate of group health coverage expressly provided that the decedent physicians were independent contractors.
the existence of an agency relationship is normally one for the trier of fact to decide.see orlando executive park,robbins,so d.in reviewing a judgment entered pursuant to a motion for summary judgment,reasonable inferences should be resolved against the movant.see moore morris,so d,wills sears,roebuck,so d.a judgment should not be rendered in such proceedings unless the facts are so crystallized that nothing remains but questions of law.shaffran holness,so d.
here,in affirming the trial court summary final judgment in favor of prucare on the issue of agency,the district court concluded that all medical providers were independent contractors simply because as an ipa hmo,prucare entered into contracts with physicians who had their own independent practices and who agreed to provide covered services for a contracted rate.the district court concluded that because the contractual provisions designated the physicians as independent contractors and that there was no evidence that prucare exercised actual control over the medical judgments and decisions made in the care and treatment of villazon wife,summary judgment was appropriate.villazon,so d at.although the district court view was that there was no evidence that prucare exercised ac
