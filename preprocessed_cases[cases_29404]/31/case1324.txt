this is an erisa case involving the denial of benefits allegedly due a patient under the terms of a group health insurance policy issued and administered by an insurance company.the patient underwent covered outpatient surgery at a medical center.at the time of surgery,the patient assigned to the medical center his right to recover of the costs of the surgery from the insurance company accordingly,the medical center billed the insurance company for the costs of the surgery.although the amount of the bill was consonant with the usual and customary fee charged for such services,the insurance company reduced the bill by and paid the medical center of the reduced bill.the insurance company claims it was entitled to reduce the medical center bill by virtue of the following series of contracts the medical center promised a third party that it would charge a discounted fee upon rendering specified medical services the third party,in turn,leased the right to the discounted fee to a fourth party then,unbeknownst to the patient and the medical center,the fourth party leased the right to the discounted fee to the insurance company.
the medical center demanded full payment of its bill and the insurance company refused.the medical center then brought this lawsuit on behalf of its assignee,the patient,seeking recovery of benefits due the patient under the terms of his health insurance policy on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court granted the medical center the relief it sought,entering judgment for of the full amount of the medical center bill for services the insurance company now appeals that judgment.we affirm.
the complex relationships among the multiple actors in this case necessitates a brief who who.software builders,software builders is the employer of the patient,steven denton denton and sponsor of the welfare benefit plan it purchased for its employees from the insurance company,employers health,ehi.ehi is the insurance company whose interpretation of the welfare benefit plan purchased by software builders is at issue in this case.denton a plan participant in the welfare benefit plan sponsored by software builders and administered by ehi,is the patient who underwent outpatient surgery performed by the medical center,hca health services of atlanta,parkway medical center parkway.parkway is the medical center that performed the surgery at issue in this case,the assignee of denton claim against ehi,and party to a preferred provider network contract with medview services,medview.medview is an entity that contracts with providers such as parkway to form a preferred provider network which medview then markets to third party payors,usually insurance companies.in its contract with medview,parkway agreed to accept percent of its usual and customary fee when providing specified medical services to medview subscribers medview leased its preferred provider network to health strategies,hsi hsi is both a manager of provider networks like medview and a vendor of provider discounts.as a vendor,it leases its networks both the networks it forms on its own and the networks it leases from entities such as medview to insurance companies so that they may access the discounts that providers promised to accept as payment in full when they joined the network.hsi leased to ehi the right to access the discounts in hsi provider networks,including the network leased from medview which included parkway as a provider,in return for a percentage of the savings ehi gained from availing itself of the discounted fees promised by providers who were members of the networks.
on march,software builders applied to ehi for a group health insurance policy providing medical,surgical,and hospital care for software builders employees.coverage under the policy became effective april,and a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of was established.in its contract with ehi,software builders elected to provide its employees with the preferred provider organization ppo form of managed care.typically,the ppo form of managed care operates as follows health care providers,such as doctors and hospitals,form a network of providers either on their own or by contracting with a entity created for the purpose of forming provider networks.this entity acts as a middleman between the providers in the network and third party payors such as insurance companies.in this case,parkway,a provider,contracted with medview,a middleman,to become part of medview preferred provider network.
in essence,a ppo is a network of health care providers organized to offer medical services at discounted rates.the ppo providers furnish their services at discounted rates because they expect to receive a higher volume of patients,participants in the welfare benefit plan offered by the insurance company.the increase in the volume of patients is a result of third party payors,who pay the bills for medical services plan participants receive,directing plan participants to providers in the ppo network through marketing materials and financial incentives.because third party payors,such as insurance companies,are financially responsible for the costs of a plan participant covered medical care,it is in the third party payor best interest for the plan participant to receive medical care from a provider who has promised to accept a discounted fee.the use of financial incentives and other measures to direct plan participants to providers in the ppo is known in the health care industry as steerage.
another component of the ppo form of managed care rests on the difference between and providers.under the ppo form of managed care,providers in the network of health care providers who offer a payor discounted rates are often referred to as providers.conversely,providers who do not agree to offer the payor discounted rates are referred to as providers.
in this case,ehi agreed to treat the providers in private health care systems phcs as its providers also known as preferred providers in return for phcs members promises to discount their fees when providing medical services to ehi plan participants.thus,when ehi contracted with software builders to offer a ppo form of managed care to software builders employees,the providers in phcs became the providers for software builders employees.
what makes ppos attractive relative to some other forms of managed care is that a percentage of the bill for the plan participant health care is still covered by the insurance company if the plan participant chooses to receive medical services from an provider given providers promise to discount their fees,however,it is in the best interest of the third party payor to steer plan participants to providers.because software builders opted for the ppo form of managed care,ehi financial obligations differ depending on whether software builders employees such as denton use the services of phcs providers.therefore,ehi steers plan participants to its providers,members of phcs,through financial incentives.
for instance,ehi states that if a plan participant receives medical care from an provider a member of phcs,then ehi will pay of the cost of service and the participant will pay.if the plan participant receives medical care from an provider,then ehi will pay of the cost of medical service and the participant will pay.in addition to the incentives created by the differential,ehi fulfills its obligation to steer participants to phcs by marketing the services of phcs providers by supplying plan participants with a directory of the providers in the phcs network.similarly,ehi identifies phcs as the network of preferred providers on the plan participants insurance cards and provides a phone number for participants to confirm the identity of phcs providers finally,in the participant certificate of insurance coi,ehi explains the 
reasons to use a ppo provider.we ehi negotiate fees for medical services.the negotiated fees lower costs to you participants when you use providers in the ppo.in addition,you may receive a better benefit and your expenses will be minimized.you will have a wide variety of selected providers in the ppo to help you with your medical care needs.in order to avoid reduced benefit payments,obtain your medical care from preferred providers whenever possible.however,the choice is yours.
as explained above,providers may either form their own network and then sell their services to insurance companies,or they can work through middlemen,such as medview or hsi.in this case,parkway agreed to become part of medview network of providers so that medview could act as middleman between parkway and third party payors like insurance companies to establish the insurance provider type of relationship described above.hsi formed its networks of providers either on its own or by leasing existing provider networks.instead of marketing its networks to insurance companies to be treated as providers,hsi acts as a vendor,leasing provider discounts to insurance companies as part of providing third party payors with access to provider discounts,hsi performs the administrative task of repricing provider invoices to reflect the discounted rate in this case,medview leased its network of providers including parkway to hsi.hsi leased to ehi the use of the provider discounts in its networks,including that network leased from medview.
given this brief explanation of the pertinent participants and the ppo form of managed care,we turn to the events giving rise to this lawsuit.on december,denton elected to undergo outpatient surgery at parkway since parkway was not a member of ehi preferred provider network,phcs,parkway was considered an provider under the terms of plan issued by ehi to software builders.as such,ehi covered of the cost of medical service and denton was responsible for the remaining.denton executed an assignment of insurance benefits in favor of parkway authorizing ehi to pay his insurance benefits directly to parkway.seeking payment for denton surgery,parkway invoiced ehi in the amount of for services rendered.on december,ehi claims department received the parkway invoice.ehi referred the invoice to hsi for repricing.hsi recalculated the invoice to reflect the discounted fee parkway had promised to medview.on january,ehi processed the claim and sent parkway an explanation of remittance along with payment in the amount of.
the explanation of remittance reflected an amount charged,an amount allowed,and an amount paid.the explanation of remittance indicated that ehi applied a discount to the amount charged to arrive at the amount allowed ehi paid the percentage of the amount allowed to arrive at the amount paid.in a footnote on the back of the explanation of remittance,ehi stated that p ayment is based on a ppo contract with the hsi network,medview services,or their affiliates.according to ehi,denton obligation was of the adjusted bill.
ehi interprets its plan to mean that due to a series of contracts,it only has to pay denton assignee of a discounted fee rather than of the amount charged.ehi plan interpretation involves two distinct but related components.first,ehi claims it is entitled to a discount of parkway bill of based on a series of contracts that indirectly create contractual obligations between ehi and parkway.the contracts in this series,the contract,the contract,and the contract,are discussed below.the second component of ehi plan interpretation relates to the contract between ehi and denton in which ehi promised to pay of an provider fee for covered medical services.ehi claims that because its participants have the right to be charged the discounted fee by parkway,it only owes parkway of the discounted fee rather than of the amount charged.in short,ehi uses its interpretation of its rights and obligations under the series of contracts to interpret its rights and obligations under the terms of its contract with denton.according to ehi,the result of its interpretation is that ehi and denton pay and respectively of parkway discounted fee.the following is a brief explanation of each contract in the series of contracts.
the contract was formed on march,when parkway entered into a preferred hospital agreement with medview.by virtue of this agreement,parkway became a preferred provider in the medview ppo network.in return for this preferred status,parkway agreed to accept of its usual and customary fee for specified outpatient services as payment in full.
the contract was formed on april,when medview entered into a letter of agreement with hsi.the contract stated that medview may enter into contractual arrangements with health care providers for the purpose of arranging for the delivery of health care services at a reduced fee,and will provide other services for hsi.the contract makes clear that hsi desires to obtain the advantage of the reduced fees available through the preferred provider network by leasing medview network of providers.leasing means the company hsi will perform all repricing functions to adjust fees from charges to contracted rates.among other duties,hsi agreed to expeditiously reprice fees for provider services to amounts contracted by medview.according to ehi,the contract allowed hsi to pass on to hsi clients the provider discounts that medview obtained from its own network of providers.
the contract is the final link in the series of contracts that allegedly entitles ehi to base the percentage it owes parkway on the discounted fee referenced in the contract rather than on the fee charged by parkway in its invoice.the contract was formed on july,when ehi and hsi entered into the ppo network customary participation agreement.according to ehi,hsi is a company which develops networks of participating health care providers,such as hospitals which agree to accept discounted payments from insurance companies and other payors.hsi then enters into contracts with network providers and with payors,including ehi.under the terms of the contract,hsi agreed to reprice bills that ehi received from hsi network of providers including medview providers for services rendered to participants in ehi health insurance plan.ehi refers to the discounts it received by virtue of its contract with hsi as its shared savings agreement.under the shared savings agreement,providers receive expedited payment for their services in return for the discounted fees.
ehi explains that when it received parkway invoice for the services performed on denton,it sent the invoice to hsi.hsi,by virtue of its contract with medview,repriced the bill to reflect the discount parkway promised to medview.meanwhile,parkway hired network analysis,network analysis to detect and eliminate the practice of unauthorized discounts.ehi contends that months after the january,explanation of remittance,network analysis noticed that parkway received less from ehi than the amount charged.parkway sent letters to ehi dated august,and,contesting the discount.in each of the three letters,parkway stated that it found ehi use of the discount inappropriate and requested that ehi remit.each letter identified denton as the insured and referenced the claim number,the patient number,the date of service,the amount of the allegedly improper discount,and the treating facility.in its response of august,ehi asserted it was entitled to the discount and explained that it had forwarded the cases in question and your letters to hsi for eligibility confirmation.parkway received no further correspondence from ehi.on november,parkway,as assignee of denton,brought this suit for recovery of benefits allegedly due under the group health insurance policy between software builders and ehi.
the district court grant of summary judgment is subject to plenary review.paramore delta air lines,cir.summary judgment shall be granted where the moving party has shown that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we construe the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.wideman stores,cir.
according to ehi,parkway lacks standing to bring this suit.ehi contends that denton was not harmed by its plan interpretation because parkway never balance billed denton for the remaining,of the amount charged.instead,ehi plan interpretation benefitted denton because it lowered his.because he was not harmed,denton lacks standing to bring this action himself thus,his assignee,parkway,also lacks standing 
under a b,a participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan may initiate civil proceedings to recover benefits under the terms of the plan.parkway is denton assignee,and in cagle bruner,cir,we explained that neither a nor any other erisa provision prevents derivative standing based upon an assignment of rights from an entity listed in that subsection.in cagle,we rejected the same argument ehi is making in this case in favor of allowing standing in suits for the recovery of benefits under erisa.we explained 
i f can not sue the erisa plan for payment,they will bill the participant or beneficiary directly for the insured medical bills,and the participant or beneficiary will be required to bring suit against the benefit plan when claims go unpaid.on the other hand,if can sue for payment of benefits,an assignment will transfer the burden of bringing suit from plan participants and beneficiaries to providers,who are better situated and financed to pursue an action for benefits owed for their services.
id.at alteration in original internal citation omitted.given our reasoning in cagle,we conclude that parkway,as a,has standing to sue for the recovery of benefits under the group insurance plan at issue in this case.
ehi also claims that it was entitled to summary judgment because parkway failed to exhaust its administrative remedies prior to bringing this suit.it is law in this circuit that plaintiffs in erisa cases must normally exhaust available administrative remedies under their plans before they may bring suit in federal court.springer associates group health plan,cir.ehi cites the following provision of the coi to demonstrate that parkway claim is not timely 
if we partially or fully deny a claim for benefits submitted by you,and you disagree or do not understand the reasons for this denial,you may appeal this decision.your appeal must be submitted in writing within days of receiving written notice of denial.we will review all information and send written notification within days of your request.
according to ehi,parkway did not appeal the alleged denial of benefits within days of receiving the explanation of remittance from ehi.parkway contends that the explanation of remittance did not constitute a written notice of denial.we agree.the above quoted language makes clear that the participant must appeal within days of receiving written notice of denial emphasis added.although ehi explanation of remittance indicated that the claim was discounted,it failed to explain the manner by which ehi adjusted the claim.the footnote on the back of the explanation of remittance stating p ayment is based on a ppo contract with the hsi network,medview services,or their affiliates does not contain sufficient information to constitute a written notice of denial.
further,we accept the finding of the district court that parkway letters dated august,and,initiated the administrative review process.see springer,at stating that the decision whether to apply the exhaustion requirement is committed to the district court sound discretion quoting curry contract fabricators.profit sharing plan,cir.parkway argues that ehi august,letter stating that it believed the discount was correct but that it had forwarded the letters to hsi for eligibility confirmation demonstrates that ehi understood it was taking part in the appeals process.again,we agree that ehi failure to respond further within the required time frame was an implicit denial of the appeal.as such,the entry of summary judgment against parkway on its erisa claim would have been inappropriate on the ground that parkway failed to exhaust its administrative remedies before filing suit.
in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the supreme court stated that,generally,courts should review claims challenging an erisa claims administrator denial of benefits under a de novo standard.the court adopted the de novo standard because the arbitrary and capricious,or abuse of discretion,standard is too lenient.the court explained that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review is appropriate,however,when the plan documents at issue explicitly grant the claims administrator discretion to determine eligibility or construe terms of the plan.see id.at.at see also florence nightingale nursing,blue shield,cir.the arbitrary and capricious deference is diminished,though,if the claims administrator was acting under a conflict of interest.florence nightingale,at.if the claims administrator was acting under a conflict of interest,the burden shifts to the administrator to prove that its interpretation of the plan provisions committed to its discretion was not tainted by self interest.brown blue cross blue shield,cir.accordingly,this court has adopted the following standards for reviewing administrators plan interpretations de novo where the plan does not grant the administrator discretion arbitrary and capricious where the plan grants the administrator discretion and heightened arbitrary and capricious where there is a conflict of interest.buckley metropolitan life,cir.we hold that heightened arbitrary and capricious review is the appropriate standard because ehi suffers from a conflict of interest 
in reviewing a claims administrator benefits determination,the court follows a series of steps.the applicability of heightened arbitrary and capricious review is a result of the court making a specific determination at each step in the analysis.at each step,the court makes a determination that results in either the progression to the next step or the end of the inquiry.for ease of application,we lay out these steps below and then apply them in part vii to the instant case.
first,a court looks to the plan documents to determine whether the plan documents grant the claims administrator discretion to interpret disputed terms.if the court finds that the documents grant the claims administrator discretion,then at a minimum,the court applies arbitrary and capricious review and possibly heightened arbitrary and capricious review.
regardless of whether arbitrary and capricious or heightened arbitrary and capricious review applies,the court evaluates the claims administrator interpretation of the plan to determine whether it is wrong.see godfrey bellsouth telecommunications,cir we first conduct a de novo review to decide if the claims administrator determination was wrong.brown,at i t is fundamental that the fiduciary interpretation first must be wrong from the perspective of de novo review before a reviewing court is concerned with the of the fiduciary.see also marecek bellsouth telecommunications,cir explaining that when the district court agrees with the ultimate decision of the administrator,it will not decide whether a conflict exists.only when the court disagrees with the decision does it look for a conflict and,when it finds such a conflict,it reconsiders the decision in light of this conflict.
if the court determines that the claims administrator interpretation is wrong,the court then proceeds to decide whether the claimant has proposed a reasonable interpretation of the plan.lee blue shield,cir.even if the court determines that the claimant interpretation is reasonable the claimant does not necessarily prevail.at first glance it seems odd that a reasonable interpretation would not automatically defeat a wrong interpretation.the reason the claimant reasonable interpretation does not trump the claims administrator wrong interpretation is because the plan documents explicitly grant the claims administrator discretion to interpret the plan.see brown,at stressing the importance of allowing an insurance company the benefit of the bargain it made in the insurance contract.we can not over emphasize the importance of the discretion afforded a claims administrator the underlying premise of arbitrary and capricious,rather than de novo,review is that a court defers to the discretion afforded the claims administrator under the terms of the plan.see firestone,at.at quoting restatement second of trusts w here discretion is conferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a power,its exercise is not subject to control by the court except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discretion.
to find a claims administrator interpretation arbitrary and capricious,the court must overcome the principle of trust law which states that a trustee interpretation will not be disturbed if it is reasonable.see firestone,at.at explaining that when a trustee is granted discretion his interpretation will not be disturbed if it is reasonable.thus,the next step requires the court to determine whether the claims administrator wrong interpretation is nonetheless reasonable.if the court determines that the claims administrator wrong interpretation is reasonable,then this wrong but reasonable interpretation is entitled to deference even though the claimant interpretation is also reasonable.
the claims administrator interpretation is not necessarily entitled to deference,however,if the claims administrator suffers from a conflict of interest.therefore,the next step in the analysis requires the court to gauge the self interest of the claims administrator.if no conflict of interest exists,then only arbitrary and capricious review applies and the claims administrator wrong but reasonable decision will not be found arbitrary and capricious.lee,at.the steps discussed thus far constitute arbitrary and capricious review and if there is no conflict of interest,the inquiry stops.if a conflict of interest does exist,however,then heightened arbitrary and capricious review applies.in applying heightened arbitrary and capricious review,the court follows the same steps that constitute arbitrary and capricious review,but given the claims administrator self interest,it continues the inquiry.
under the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review,the burden shifts to the claims administrator to prove that its interpretation of the plan is not tainted by.id.the claims administrator satisfies this burden by showing that its wrong but reasonable interpretation of the plan benefits the class of participants and beneficiaries.see brown,at.even when the administrator satisfies this burden,the claimant may still be successful if he can show by other measures that the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.see id.at.if the court finds that the claims administrator fails to show that its plan interpretation benefits the class of participants and beneficiaries,the claims administrator plan interpretation is not entitled to deference.
the crux of ehi appeal is.first,ehi contends that the district court improperly used the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review.second,ehi asserts that even if heightened arbitrary and capricious review was appropriate,the district court erred in holding that ehi failed to purge the taint of.we address these concerns in turn.
to determine the standard by which to review a claims administrator plan interpretation,a court follows the steps outlined in part vi.our application of these steps reveals that heightened arbitrary and capricious review is the correct standard.
first,the plan documents grant ehi discretion to interpret disputed terms.the coi states 
with respect to paying claims for benefits under this policy,we ehi as administrator for claims determinations and as erisa claims review fiduciary shall have discretionary authority to interpret policy provisions,make decisions regarding eligibility for coverage and benefits,and resolve factual questions relating to coverage benefits.
given this contractual grant of discretion,de novo review is inapplicable and at a minimum,arbitrary and capricious review applies.
next,we determine whether ehi plan interpretation is wrong.ehi points out that under the schedule of benefits in the coi,it is required to pay a specified percentage of the expense of covered medical services and the participant is required to pay the balance of the expense.crucial to determining whether ehi interpretation is wrong is the meaning of the term expense.ehi emphasizes the common meaning of the term found in webster dictionary,and argues that expense is the amount necessary to obtain covered medical services.according to ehi interpretation of the plan,the term expense,as it is used in the coi,includes the discounted fees in the contract.
ehi supports its plan interpretation by relying on a d,which states that a plan is to be administered by the fiduciary in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.ehi asserts that the contract between hsi and itself which is based on the and the contracts is a document and instrument governing the plan.ehi calls the provider discounts this contract allows ehi to access its shared savings program.as such,the scope of a d and this series of contracts entitle ehi to interpret expense to include the discounted fee parkway promised in the contract.
we find that ehi interpretation of the plan documents is wrong for two reasons.first,ehi wrongly interprets its contract with denton.second,ehi wrongly interprets its rights under the series of contracts linking it to parkway.we discuss each of these reasons in turn.
first,ehi plan interpretation is not consonant with the terms of the,ehi stance on the meaning of the term expense.in the schedule of benefits of the coi,ehi specifically states 
b enefits are payable only if services are considered to be covered expenses and are medically necessary.all covered services are payable on a maximum allowable fee basis and are subject to specific conditions,durational limitations and all applicable maximums of this policy.
to understand ehi duties under the coi,one must ascertain the meaning of covered expense.the coi defines covered expense as 
a medically necessary expense for the benefits stated in this certificate and an expense incurred when you are insured for that benefit under this policy on the date that the service is rendered.
the definition of covered expense leads us to inquire into the meaning of the term expense incurred.
expense incurred means the maximum allowable fee charged for services which are medically necessary to treat the condition.the date service is rendered is the expense incurred date.
this definition in turn necessitates a definition of maximum allowable fee.
maximum allowable fee is the lesser of the fee most often charged in the geographical area where the service was performed the fee most often charged by the provider the fee which is recognized by a prudent person the fee determined by comparing charges for similar services to a national data base adjusted to the geographical area where the services or procedures were performed or the fee determined by using a national relative value scale relative value scale means the methodology that values medical procedures and services relative to each other that includes,but is not limited to,a scale in terms of difficulty,work,risk,as well as the material and outside costs of providing the service,as adjusted to the geographic area where the service or procedures were performed.
the district court found that,given these definitions in ehi contract with denton employer and plan sponsor software builders,the phrase expense incurred could not validly be interpreted to mean a charge reduced or discounted through ehi contract with hsi.hca health services,employers health ins,d.the district court reasoned that,
such a discounted charge does not meet any of the definitions of maximum allowable fee included in the contract.second,the only terms of the contract which speak to negotiated fees are contained within the ppo provisions,and the shared savings discount is in conflict with those provisions additionally,whereas ehi provides the insured with a list of ppo providers so that the insured can make a reasoned choice,the insured never knows who the shared savings providers are and is unable to make a reasoned choice to use a shared savings provider rather than a provider with whom there are no negotiated savings 
we agree with this reasoning regarding the plain language of the plan.to support its position that the district court erred in finding that expense can not include the discounted fee at issue in this case,ehi points to the third definition of maximum allowable fee,namely the fee which is recognized by a prudent person.ehi amicus curiae explain that if ehi paid parkway an amount higher than parkway was contractually obligated to accept,then this payment would not be a fee recognized by a prudent person.not only does this argument erroneously assume that parkway is obligated to charge denton the discounted fee,but we disagree that the discounted fee is the fee recognized by a prudent person.common sense dictates that the fee recognized by a prudent person is the usual and customary fee in the industry instead of supporting ehi interpretation,the language in the coi stating that the maximum allowable fee is the fee recognized by a prudent person further bolsters parkway interpretation of expense.a prudent person would assume that the fee for a service is the reasonable,usual and customary fee.he would not even consider the discounted fee because it only arises out of a specified contractual relationship.the usual and customary fee is the reasonable fee and,as such,is the fee recognized by a prudent person.
second,we find that ehi plan interpretation is wrong because it erroneously construes the series of contracts linking it to parkway.recall that ehi plan interpretation is first,the series of contracts entitles ehi plan participants to be charged parkway discounted fee and,second,the discounted fee explains the meaning of the term expense in ehi contract with denton.for the reasons explained above,the term expense in the coi can not be construed to include the discounted fee at issue in this case.because ehi can not retroactively modify the meaning of the term expense in its contract with denton,its plan interpretation is wrong.even if,as a general matter,ehi could use undisclosed,outside agreements not in existence at the time ehi issued its policy to denton,to explain the meaning of the term expense,the outside agreements in this case,the series of contracts linking ehi to parkway do not entitle ehi to the discounted fee because parkway does not receive the benefit of its bargain.because ehi is not entitled to the discounted fee,it follows that it can not base the percentage it owes parkway on the discounted fee.in short,consideration of either component of ehi plan interpretation reveals that it is wrong.
the terms of the contract do not support the proposition that ehi is entitled to base the percentage it owes parkway on the discounted fee ehi argues that each contract in the series of contracts at issue in this case evidences its entitlement to the discounted fee.ehi interprets the first contract in this series,the contract,as follows according to ehi,parkway contract with medview defined third party payor to include any business entity having a contract with medview.as a business entity having a contract with medview,hsi qualified as a payor.because parkway knew that medview could contract with any business entity at the time of contract formation,parkway can not renege on its promise to discount its fees.
the terms of the contract are not the primary issue in the case before us therefore,we decline to decide whether medview leasing contract with hsi is valid.nonetheless,for the limited purpose of explaining why ehi plan interpretation is wrong,we note that one of the express purposes of the march,agreement between parkway and medview was to coordinate and arrange for the delivery of hospital and physician services to medview subscribers.integral to the contract and to ehi argument are the definitions of the terms third party payor and subscriber.
the contract defines third party payor as an insurance company,employer,or other business entity which has contracted with medview to pay for medical services surgical services rendered by participating physicians to medview subscribers and hospital services rendered by preferred hospitals to medview subscribers.instead of citing this complete definition,ehi definition of third party payor,quoted above,refers only to the phrase business entity which has contracted with medview.ehi claims that this excerpt from the definition of third party payor evidences medview right to lease its provider list to hsi,which in turn validates hsi right to lease the list to ehi,which then entitles ehi to be charged the discounted fee.the omissions in ehi definition of third party payor are not insignificant.rather,they reveal the true nature of the contract,to wit to pay for medical services rendered to medview subscribers.as such,the definition of third party payor,and whether ehi qualifies as a third party payor under the contract,necessarily depends on the definition of subscriber.
consider that subscriber means a person who,by virtue of a binding contract between medview and any business entity,may obtain medical surgical services of preferred hospitals.denton is not a medview subscriber he did not obtain medical care from parkway by virtue of a binding contract between medview and hsi similarly,neither hsi nor ehi is a business entity contracting with medview to pay for medical services rendered by participating physicians to medview subscribers.ehi and hsi may be business entities that contracted with medview but the purpose of this contract was not to pay for medical services rendered by physicians to medview subscribers.importantly,ehi and medview never entered into a relationship that would result in ehi plan participants becoming medview subscribers,and this relationship does not arise by virtue of a leasing contract like that peddled by hsi thus,insofar as ehi plan interpretation rests on the contract between medview and parkway,it is wrong.
we note in passing that while ehi may interpret the plan in accordance with governing instruments and documents a d,we take issue with the notion that the contract and the contract contracts to which ehi is not even a party govern the contract between ehi and software builders.ehi fails to provide parkway with the benefit of its bargain.we also dismiss ehi contention that it is entitled to the benefits of a promise in a contract to which it is not a party and from which it is three times removed basically ehi is saying that parkway promise to discount its fee travels from the contract through the contract through the contract to the builders contract to modify the term expense.we can not accept such logic 
next,we consider whether parkway interpretation is reasonable.parkway argues that no provision in ehi erisa plan allows ehi to base the percentage it owes parkway on a discounted fee.the ppo provisions of the coi mention discounted fees in the context of explaining that if a participant uses an provider then his percentage will be less than if he uses an provider.since the coi discusses discounted fees only in the context of providers and parkway is not an provider,parkway contention that the plan documents do not permit ehi to discount its charges is sound.because the only terms in the coi even suggesting discounted fees are in the ppo provisions and because parkway is not in ehi network of preferred providers,ehi may not apply a discount to parkway charges.
we concur with the district court that parkway interpretation of the plan is reasonable.in the coi,ehi informs participants that it has negotiated discounted fees with providers and that the participant will be less if he uses the services of an provider.discounted fees are not mentioned anywhere else in the coi.as such,it can reasonably be inferred from the contractual language that at the time of contract formation ehi was not contemplating discounts with providers 
having decided that ehi plan interpretation is wrong and parkway interpretation is reasonable,we next determine whether ehi interpretation is reasonable.given the complex interrelation of the series of contracts at issue in this case,we assume for the sake of argument that ehi interpretation is reasonable.even if ehi wrong interpretation is reasonable,we can not afford it the deference attributable to arbitrary and capricious review because ehi suffers from a conflict of interest 
we find that ehi acted under a conflict of interest because ehi pays claims out of its own assets in brown blue cross blue shield,at,we explained that because an insurance company pays out to beneficiaries from its own assets rather than the assets of a trust,its fiduciary role lies in perpetual conflict with its role as a business a strong conflict of interest exists when the fiduciary making a discretionary decision is also the insurance company responsible for paying the claims the inherent conflict between the fiduciary role and the objective of an insurance company make a highly deferential standard of review inappropriate.therefore,we can not stop our inquiry at mere arbitrary and capricious review.contrary to ehi assertion,the district court did not err in applying the heightened arbitrary and capricious standards of review.because we hold that heightened arbitrary and capricious review is the appropriate standard,we turn to ehi other contention,namely when applying heightened arbitrary and capricious review,the district court erred in finding that ehi failed to purge the taint of.in addressing ehi argument,we continue our application of the steps that constitute heightened arbitrary and capricious review.
under the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard,the burden shifts to ehi to demonstrate that its interpretation of the plan was not tainted by self interest.a conflicted fiduciary can purge the taint of by proving that its wrong but reasonable interpretation of the plan was calculated to maximize benefits to participants in a manner.lee blue shield,cir.although ehi plan interpretation is wrong for either of the reasons discussed part,we could still hold ehi interpretation is not arbitrary and capricious if it results in a benefit to denton and other beneficiaries.according to ehi,its interpretation benefits denton because his was limited to of the discounted fee rather than of the usual and customary fee in order to determine whether this benefit to denton and other participants purges the taint of self interest,we consider the consequences that follow from parkway and ehi plan interpretations when applied to the following hypothetical scenario.the facts in this hypothetical scenario are based on a simplified version of the facts of this case.
assume there are only three health insurance carriers in a metropolitan area insurance company a,insurance company b,and insurance company each of these insurance companies has contracted with a different ppo to serve as the providers under each company respective health plan for instance,insurance company a entered a contract with ppo a by which insurance company a promises to steer its plan participants to ppo a providers and ppo a providers agree to discount the fees they will charge insurance company a participants.insurance companies b and c have identical agreements with ppos b and c,respectively,exchanging steerage of plan participants for discounted medical services 
the insurance companies steer plan participants to providers in their respective ppos through economic incentives a typical arrangement might operate as follows.if a participant participant a in insurance company a plan utilizes the services of a provider in ppo a,an provider,then insurance company a will pay of the provider fee for medical service and participant a will pay of the fee.if participant a utilizes the services of a provider not in ppo a,an provider,then insurance company a will pay of the provider fee for medical services and participant a will pay of the fee.by requiring participant a to pay a larger percentage of the fee for medical services obtained from an provider than participant a would have to pay if he utilized the services of an provider,insurance company a steers participants to providers in ppo a by making those providers more financially attractive in return for this steerage,the providers in ppo a discount their usual and customary fees for medical services.providers in ppo a are willing to charge insurance company a a discounted rate because the money they lose in discounting their fees is offset by the increased volume of patients they will serve as a result of insurance company a steering efforts.for purposes of this hypothetical,assume that the insurance company b contract and the insurance company c contract use similar economic incentives to steer participants to providers in ppos b and c,respectively.thus,in return for this steerage,the providers in ppo b promise insurance company b they will discount their usual and customary fee for medical services.ppo c and insurance company c have the same arrangement.there are no other insurance companies or ppos in this hypothetical metropolitan area.
given this background,suppose participant a breaks his arm.it is undisputed that in this metropolitan area,the usual and customary fee for setting a broken arm is.providers in ppo a agree that because insurance company a steers participants to them,they will only charge for setting a broken arm rather than the customary.as such,if participant a arm is set by a provider in ppo a,then insurance company a will pay of the fee and participant a will pay of the fee.
however,if participant a chooses to have his broken arm set by an provider,a provider in ppo b or ppo c participant a expects that he will pay of the fee for medical service and that insurance company a will pay of the fee.although the percentages are not disputed,at issue in this hypothetical and in this case is what is the correct fee for medical service 
under parkway interpretation of the plan as applied to this hypothetical scenario,the fee for setting the broken arm is.as previously noted,it is undisputed that is the usual and customary fee for setting a broken arm.while the provider in ppo b promised insurance company b that it would charge insurance company b for setting a broken arm,it did so only because its loss from receiving this discounted amount would be offset by the increased volume of patients ppo b providers would service given insurance company b steerage efforts and it can subsidize these discounted fees by continuing to charge its usual and customary fee when treating patients who are not participants in insurance company b plan.
parkway points out that the ppo b provider never contracted with insurance company further,the ppo b provider made the promise to discount its fees in reliance on insurance company b promise to steer plan participants to ppo b providers.according to parkway,by claiming that it is entitled to the discounted fee of,insurance company a is availing itself of the ppo b provider promise to insurance company b without giving the ppo b provider the benefit it expected in return for its by claiming it is entitled to ppo b discounted fee,insurance company a ignores the basic tenet of contract law that contracts are premised on a bargained for exchange.this basic tenet of contract law is violated when,by virtue of a brokering agreement,insurance company a uses the ppo b provider discounted fee but does not give the ppo b provider the benefit it expected in return,namely,steerage.
assuming parkway interpretation of the plan is correct,the fee remains,the usual and customary fee for setting a broken arm.participant a pays of the fee,or and insurance company a pays of the fee,or.furthermore,participant a receives the level of service he expects from a provider to whom he is paying full price.in essence,this interpretation maintains both of participant a contractual expectations he expected to pay of an provider usual and customary fee and he expected to receive the level of service consonant with this fee 
under ehi plan interpretation,participant a fee for medical service obtained from the provider in ppo b should not be but the discounted fee ppo b providers agreed to charge insurance company b in exchange for insurance company b steering its participants to ppo b providers.if the fee is,and insurance company a only has to pay of an provider fee for medical service,then insurance company a pays.by choosing to obtain medical service from an provider,participant a is responsible for of the fee for medical service.if,despite that ehi interpretation is wrong,it nonetheless benefits denton and other participants,then ehi has purged the taint of.we previously determined that ehi plan interpretation is wrong for two reasons,see supra part.we thus reevaluate each of the proffered reasons for its wrong interpretation and gauge whether,despite either reason,the plan interpretation results in a benefit to denton and other like plan participants.
we first analyze ehi interpretation from the view that its interpretation is wrong because the series of contracts does not entitle ehi to the discounted fee.we then analyze the interpretation from the view that it is wrong because ehi can not modify the meaning of the term expense in its contract with denton.if we find a benefit to denton and other participants,then ehi wrong but reasonable plan interpretation is entitled to deference.if we find ehi interpretation does not inure a benefit to denton and other plan participants,we may conclude that the interpretation is arbitrary and capricious.
assuming ehi interpretation is wrong because insurance company a is not entitled to the discounted fee ppo b providers promised to insurance company b,we consider whether ehi wrong but reasonable interpretation is entitled to deference because it benefits denton and other participants.if insurance company a is not entitled to the discounted fee ppo b providers promised to insurance company b,then the cost of medical services is just the usual and customary fee for setting a broken arm.by only paying of the ppo b provider bill,insurance company a leaves participant a on the hook for the remainder of the bill,while participant a expects to pay more for medical service,he only expected to pay of an provider fee.given that the usual and customary fee is,participant a expects he will pay and that insurance company a will pay.however,if insurance company a only pays of the discounted fee,participant a is responsible for a of of the discounted fee plus the remainder of the bill when he is balance billed by the ppo b provider.thus,insurance company a interpretation of the plan results in participant a paying rather than for medical care.
this unexpected increase in cost will deter participant a from seeking medical care.the primary reason managed care plan participants choose ppos over less expensive forms of managed care is that ppos allow a participant the flexibility to seek treatment for a small increase in the percentage of his hmos,in contrast,typically provide no coverage for care.because insurance company a interpretation of the plan deters participant a from utilizing the care option,participant a loses some of the benefit he expected to receive when he paid his premium.if care was not going to be a financially viable option,participant a might have chosen health care coverage from an hmo rather than a ppo.
indeed,the ability to receive care is the sine qua non of a ppo.although the option of having medical care covered by insurance will cost the participant more money,participants who choose ppos over hmos deem this burden outweighed by the benefit of the flexibility to choose one health care provider.by making this option more financially onerous than the participant originally and rightfully expected when he entered the ppo arrangement,ehi deters the fact,all plan seeking care.in so doing,ehi effectively limits participants to providers.therefore,at best,ehi is depriving participants of their bona fide contractual expectations.at worst,ehi is siphoning money from participants and splitting the proceeds of this gain between itself and hsi 
it is plain that ehi wrong interpretation,wrong because ehi is not entitled to parkway discounted fee is not entitled to deference because it deprives participants of their contractual expectation.as such,ehi has not purged the taint of.we find,therefore,that its plan interpretation is arbitrary and capricious.ehi success on appeal,however,depends on whether,in light of the other reason its plan interpretation is wrong,we find that the interpretation benefits denton and other participants.consequently,we now consider whether ehi interpretation continues to be arbitrary and capricious even if ehi is correct that insurance company a is entitled to the discounted fee,but incorrect about how this discount impacts insurance company a contract with participant 
according to ehi,when participant a received medical service from provider b,provider b should have charged participant a based on a contract that insurance company a made through a series of middlemen.ehi deems it irrelevant that provider b never knew its promise to discount its usual and customary fee was leased to insurance company a and that provider b does not get steerage in return for this promise.because both participant a and provider b are unaware that provider b is obligated to charge a discounted fee,they agree that participant a will pay and provider b will set participant a broken arm with a level of service consonant with this fee.provider b bills insurance company a on participant a behalf demanding of from insurance company a and from participant assuming ehi plan interpretation as the series of contracts entitles insurance company a to the discounted correct total fee for setting participant a broken arm is and not.therefore,insurance company a owes provider b of and participant a owes provider b of.at first glance it seems that participant a benefits from this arrangement because he received the level of service he expected from an provider yet only had to pay of a reduced fee rather than of the usual and customary fee.
however,our analysis reveals that participant a does not benefit in the long run.consider that after struggling with the hassle of determining and collecting its fee,provider b is now aware that he is only going to receive when setting the broken arms of participants in insurance company a plan financially,provider b is in no different a position than provider a,insurance company a provider.like provider a,provider b is now obligated to charge insurance company a plan participants a discounted fee.unlike provider a,however,provider b does not get the benefit of steerage from insurance company also unlike provider a,provider b collects of from insurance company a while provider a collects of.in comparison to provider a,then,provider b is burdened with collecting a higher percentage of his fee from an individual participant,who is invariably a payor less financially secure and able than an insurance company.
consideration of these effects of ehi interpretation on provider b reveals that the interpretation deleteriously impacts participant a and others like him.when participant a breaks his other arm and returns to provider b because he was pleased with the level of service he previously received,provider b is unable to provide participant a with the same level of service because he receives less compensation.the entire purpose of a ppo rather than an hmo is to afford participants the choice to receive medical care.ppo participants know their medical care will be less expensive if they receive such care from an provider.they choose,nonetheless,to pay a higher premium for the freedom to have their medical expenses covered when they receive medical care elsewhere.a participant presumably believes the level of service he receives outside the network will be different from the level of service he receives inside the network this is why he pays for the option of going outside the network implicit in the belief that the level of medical service differs outside the network is the participant understanding that this level of service will cost more than medical care.the participant act of paying for this choice is evidence that participants value the ability to receive medical care outside the network.presumably,this value is a different,if not better,level of medical service.we have no doubt this is a participant contractual expectation when he opts for a ppo health insurance policy.
the results of ehi plan interpretation crash head on into a participant rightful and understandable expectation.when provider b knows that he will be paid less for setting participant a arm,he will be unable to provide the same level of service participant a chose to receive medical care from provider b because he thought he would receive a level of service consonant with the higher fee he expects the provider to be paid.if participant a wanted a level of service consonant with a discounted fee,he would get his broken arm set by an provider.the ultimate result of ehi plan interpretation is that participants receive a level of service consonant with a discounted fee regardless of whether they receive their medical care from an or provider.but for the differential,there is little difference between in and providers.because such an interpretation works to deprive participants of their contractual expectation upon entering a ppo,ehi has not purged the taint of.accordingly,we hold that ehi plan interpretation is arbitrary and capricious 
not only does ehi plan interpretation deleteriously impact current participant a contractual expectations if followed through to its natural conclusion,ehi plan interpretation could alter the rights and obligations of future participants and providers.whether the,series of contracts entitles ehi to the discount or not,participant a has,in effect,lost the benefit of seeking and receiving care.under either of the reasons we determined that ehi plan interpretation is wrong,participant a is likely to demand lower premiums to compensate for the loss of this justified and bargained for contractual expectation.if participant a and other similarly situated participants succeed in securing lower premiums,then insurance company a will have less income.because insurance company a has less income,it will demand larger discounts from providers in ppo a,thereby driving down the fees of providers.because the level of service participants receive remains consonant with the amount of money providers receive,this reduction in fees will impact the level of service enjoyed by participant a and others like him.if insurance companies b and c interpret their plans to allow undisclosed discounts with providers,they too may suffer a participant backlash which in turn may provoke insurance companies b and c to demand lower fees from providers in ppos b and c,respectively.the downward spiraling of the level of service would repeat itself as the providers in ppos b and c adjust the level of service they provide to reflect their reduced compensation.
ironically,when a participant in a traditional ppo arrangement is not satisfied with his care,he may seek medical care from an provider.for instance,in our hypothetical scenario,insurance company a continues to cover the costs of participant a medical care when he obtains services from an provider.given the closed universe of our hypothetical scenario,the providers available to participant a would be those providers in ppo b or ppo by virtue of undisclosed contracts with a series of middlemen,insurance company a can base the percentage it owes the ppo b or c provider on the discounted fee the ppo b or c provider promised insurance company b or c rather than on the usual and customary fee.the fee the ppo b or c provider promised to insurance company b or c reflects the downward spiraling of provider fees spurred by participants demand for lower premiums.not only are the ppo b and c providers having to further discount their fees to remain providers for insurance companies b and c,respectively,but due to the effect of agreements like the contract and the contract,ppo b and c providers no longer offset this loss by the usual and customary fees they receive when they treat patients who are not participants in insurance companies b and c plans 
importantly,it follows that this effect on providers will negatively impact participants.consider that the level of service participant a receives from an provider reflects the further discounting of fees demanded by insurance company a to offset its lower premiums.worse still,the level of service participant a receives is also diminished as providers in ppos b and c adjust for the failure to receive their usual and customary fee when treating insurance company a participants.when followed to its natural conclusion,ehi plan interpretation in effect turns a discounted fee negotiated between a specific provider and specific insurance company into the usual and customary fee for the entire medical services industry.because the level of service participants receive is directly related to this reduction in fees,participants expectations continue to be unfulfilled.
as the above hypothetical scenario demonstrates,participants contractual expectations are not satisfied as a result of ehi plan interpretation.because ehi interpretation deprives plan participants of their contractual expectations,we find that ehi plan interpretation is arbitrary and capricious.the judgment of the district court is,therefore,affirmed.
this cases arises under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.
while the patient is ultimately responsible for the bill,under his health insurance policy,the insurance company agreed to pay a percentage of a provider bill.the terms of the insurance policy dictated that the insurance company would pay of a provider fee for covered medical service,such as the medical center fee,and the patient would pay of the fee.aware of this arrangement between the insurance company and the patient,the medical center in this case billed the insurance company for the entire amount.as patient assignee,the medical center is entitled to demand that the insurance company fulfill its contractual obligation to the patient.upon receiving a percentage of the bill from the insurance company,the medical center would then balance bill the patient for the remainder of the bill.
the medical center brought the suit in georgia superior court,seeking recovery under four state law theories breach of contract,quantum meruit,open account,and stated account.the insurance company removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia on the ground that the medical center claims related to an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa.subsequent to the removal,the medical center amended its complaint to seek alternative relief pursuant to a b.
the district court granted the insurance company motion for summary judgment as to the medical center state law claims.after granting the medical center motion for summary judgment as to the medical center erisa claim,the insurance company moved the district court to alter or amend the judgment.the district court denied this motion.
software builders,a software company located in duluth,georgia,is an employer within the meaning of.
the group health insurance policy software builders purchased from ehi constitutes an employee benefit plan within the meaning of erisa.under erisa,the term employee benefit plan includes an employee welfare benefit plan an employee pension benefit plan.an employee welfare benefit plan is a plan,fund or program established or maintained by an employer for the purposes of providing certain benefits,such as medical benefits to participants and beneficiaries.because the group health insurance policy issued by ehi and sponsored by software builders relates to medical benefits,it is considered a welfare benefit plan under erisa.
ehi,a wholly owned subsidiary of humana,is a plan administrator as defined by a i.in the group insurance policy it issued to software builders,ehi is listed as both the administrator and insurer of the plan.

in this context,leasing means the lessor will provide the lessee with access to the provider discounts the lessor has procured.in return for access,the lessor will receive a percentage of the gain or savings the lessee earns by virtue of using the provider discounts.for example,medview leased to hsi parkway promise to accept of its usual and customary fee.when hsi avails itself of parkway discounted fee,it saves an amount equal to of the usual and customary fee.hsi then pays medview of this savings.

like health maintenance organizations hmos,ppos are comprised of networks of physicians and hospitals that have agreed to discount their rates for plan participants.unlike hmos,ppos typically do not use a primary care physician to oversee the patient medical care.as such,plan participants may consult specialists or providers whenever they feel it is necessary.plan participants are strongly encouraged to seek the services of providers.if they do not,they will pay more in that their insurance company pays a lower percentage of the provider bill.

although at oral argument we learned that parkway has not sought redress against medview,we note that the agreement does not require hsi to secure payors who will steer patients to medview providers.we note also that the contract contains an provision.
we reject ehi contention that jones new york life ins,civ.lls july,applies to this case because jones does not address standing under erisa.furthermore,the language from our opinion in cagle bruner,cir,quoted infra,implies that a provider does not have to balance bill a patient in order to have derivative standing.consider the use of the future tense in our statement that i f can not sue the erisa plan for payment,they will bill the participant or beneficiary directly.cagle,at emphasis added.ehi argument is inconsistent with our rationale in cagle.one of our reasons for allowing derivative standing is so that providers will not balance bill participants,thereby requiring participants to bring suit against their insurance company for unpaid benefits.given our reasoning in cagle,we reject ehi argument that parkway needed to balance bill denton in order to have standing.

unlike the fee common in the industry,a discounted fee is the product of a unique contractual relationship between provider and insurance company.
we note that,apart from performing fee collection services and utilization and quality assurance reviews,the consideration in the contract that supports parkway promise to discount its fees is unclear.we could find that,due to the lack of clear adequate consideration,the contract is not valid.this would necessarily mean that ehi is not entitled to parkway discounted fee because the root contract that allegedly entitled medview to lease the discount to hsi,which hsi in turn leased to ehi,is unenforceable.we decline to find a contract that has been continually performed since void for lack of consideration.instead,we note that while the contract does not specifically refer to steerage,given the typical workings of the ppo form of managed care,it is clear to us that parkway entered the preferred hospital agreement to become a provider in medview network.medview was then to negotiate with third party payors,such as insurance companies,so that parkway and the other providers in the network would be the providers in the insurance company ppo.consider exhibit c to the contract.although there appears to be some discrepancy about when and if exhibit c was signed,we note that exhibit c to the contract is entitled payors.parkway represents that the subscribers affiliated with these payors are entitled to the discounted fees parkway promised when joining medview preferred provider network.although not referenced in the primary contract,exhibit c evidences that the purpose of the contract was that medview would form contracts with third party payors that called for the payors to treat medview network as preferred providers in return for the providers discounted fees.it seems that exhibit c evidences some of the entities with which medview had established the provider relationship.we will not let the lack of clarity in the contract obscure our understanding of the manner in which the managed care industry,specifically ppos,operates.when read as a whole,it is clear that the contract contemplates that medview would act as a middleman between parkway and a third party payor such as an insurance company and that the third party payor would steer its participants to parkway in return for parkway promise to discount its fees.without the benefit of steerage there is no reason for parkway to agree to discount its fees.
given the reasons for these contracts in the managed care industry,we note that a subscriber is a participant in an employee benefit plan administered by an insurance company.when medview and an insurance company contract for the insurance company to use medview network as its preferred providers,the participant may obtain medical services from the preferred providers.
of course,only hsi and medview entered into a contractual arrangement.however,because ehi claims that through its contract with hsi it is entitled to a provision of the contract,we analyze whether either entity,hsi or ehi,is a third party payor under the contract.
the express purpose of the contract is that medview will enter into contr
