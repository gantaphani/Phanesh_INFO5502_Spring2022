asserted claims under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,against their current or former employer,xerox corporation xerox the pension plan administered for the benefit of its employees,and various individuals associated with the administration of that plan.on remand from our first decision in this litigation,see frommert conkright,cir,the district court crafted a remedy to address the erisa violations we had identified and concluded that the release forms signed by several did not bar their erisa claims,see frommert conkright,d.challenge both aspects of the district court decision.for the reasons set forth below,we reject first challenge and agree with the second.accordingly,we vacate a portion of the district court order and remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
we presume familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case as set forth in our prior decision,see frommert,at,and we repeat them here only as relevant to the issues presented in this appeal.in that decision,we concluded that had impermissibly amended the erisa plan at issue through their method of determining retirement benefits for those beneficiaries who had previously left the company only to be rehired later.id.at.when these beneficiaries left xerox,they all received distributions of their pension benefits.id.at.
the pension benefits of those who were subsequently rehired by xerox were governed by a set of ambiguous provisions in the pension plan documents.the xerox retirement income guarantee plan rigp or plan provided that,i n the event any part or all of a member accrued benefit is distributed to him prior to his normal retirement date,and such member at any time thereafter recommences active participation in the plan,the accrued benefit of such member based on all years of participation shall be offset by the accrued benefit attributable to such distribution.rigp.the version of the plan provided both that n o credit shall be given to a participating employee for any period with respect to which a lump sum payment has been made and that credit for years of participation preceding such a payout will be reinstated in the event that such an employee returns to xerox.frommert,at.thus,in determining these employees benefits,the plan administrator was required to account,in a manner unspecified to employees,for both an employee total years of service at xerox and the fact that the final benefits must be offset by an amount attributable to a prior lump sum distribution.
the plan administrator resolved this difficulty by utilizing a phantom account offset mechanism.the phrase phantom account refers to the calculation of the current value of the employee prior,distribution by adjusting that amount for hypothetical investment gains losses attributable to the prior distribution,as if the money had been left in the employee account instead of being distributed to the employee upon first leaving xerox.id.at quoting benefits update.in estimating the pension benefit to which that employee would be entitled upon his or her future retirement and thus second separation from xerox employment,the plan administrator would both account for the employee total years of service and deduct an amount based on the prior,distribution,as augmented by the phantom account offset method.see id.at.
in our first decision,we concluded that the phantom account offset mechanism constituted a retroactive of anticipated pension benefits in violation of g,and that had impermissibly amended the erisa plan to include that mechanism in violation of h.see id.at.we remanded to the district court to fashion a remedy for these violations.see id.at.specifically,we instructed the district court as follows 
on remand,the remedy crafted by the district court for those employees rehired prior to should utilize an appropriate calculation to determine their benefits.we recognize the difficulty that this task poses because of the ambiguous manner in which the terms of the plan described how prior distributions were to be treated.as guidance for the district court,we suggest that it may wish to employ equitable principles when determining the appropriate calculation and fashioning the appropriate remedy.
id.in addition,we recognized that the district court could apply the phantom account offset mechanism to employees hired after the amendment to the plan because those individuals were on notice as to the mechanism existence.id.at.but see miller xerox.retirement income guarantee plan,cir holding that plan phantom account methodology itself violates erisa,cert.denied,d.
acknowledging our guidance to employ equitable principles and reviewing the language of the plan materials,the district court concluded that the appropriate remedy for employees hired before the amendment was to direct the plan administrator to pay each of these individuals a lump sum in the amount of the difference between the amount of benefits that an employee has received,and the amount of the recalculated benefit,without any consideration of a phantom account.frommert,d at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court also stated that it would not be unreasonable for the administrator to subtract out the amount of the prior distribution in order to prevent such employees from receiving windfalls.id.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in addition,the district court concluded that the release forms signed by several in exchange for their receiving severance pay from xerox did not release from the claims asserted in this litigation.see id.at.other matters addressed by the district court on remand are not relevant to this appeal,which timely followed.
discussion 
on appeal,raise two challenges to the district court decision.first,argue that the district court fashioned an improper remedy for the erisa violation associated with the implementation of the phantom account offset mechanism.second,argue that the district court erroneously decided that the release forms signed by certain did not bar their claims.for the reasons that follow,we agree with that the release forms at issue bar the signatories erisa claims,but we will not disturb the district court chosen remedy.
on appeal,challenge the district court remedy for the erisa violations we identified in our prior decision,the impermissible amendment of the erisa plan at issue to calculate pension benefits according to a phantom account offset method.as discussed above,we instructed the district court as follows 
on remand,the remedy crafted by the district court for those employees rehired prior to should utilize an appropriate calculation to determine their benefits.we recognize the difficulty that this task poses because of the ambiguous manner in which the terms of the plan described how prior distributions were to be treated.as guidance for the district court,we suggest that it may wish to employ equitable principles when determining the appropriate calculation and fashioning the appropriate remedy.
frommert,at.we review a district court chosen remedy of an identified erisa violation for an excess of allowable discretion.see chao merino,cir.
here,the plan accounts for a retiring employee total years of working at xerox,but it also provides that an employee benefits must be offset by the accrued benefit attributable to a prior distribution.rigp.all received earlier,distributions of their pension benefits when they first left their employment at xerox,and the basic question presented to the district court was how to ensure that these individuals received their due benefits in light of the ambiguous of benefits provision.see frommert,d at construing and applying of plan.on remand,the district court decided that the appropriate remedy was to order the plan administrator to recalculate the relevant benefits to deduct only the nominal value of their prior,distributions,without a phantom account adjustment reflecting hypothetical investment gains or,apparently,any other adjustment to reflect the values of the prior distributions.see id.at.
fail to establish that the district court approach violated either the plan terms or any law.although contend that the district court failed to utilize plan terms,the district court explicitly did so but simply applied those terms to differently than proposed.in advocating their proposed new hire approach instead of the remedy crafted by the district court,argue that f of the plan requires that a rehired employee who then retires is entitled only to a pension benefit that accounts for his or her years of service since being rehired the prior years of service are relevant only for the purpose of vesting.however,in advocating this new hire method,ignore the terms of the plan,which is silent as to prior distributions pursuant to.to the extent that the plan applies to certain,ignore the language of f.see frommert,at discussing such provisions in the various versions of the plan.have failed to demonstrate that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in crafting its chosen remedy instead of adopting proposed approach 
alternatively,contend that the district court erred by failing to adopt the remedy proposed by the plan administrator or,at least,by failing to remand to the administrator the task of fashioning a remedy.regarding the failure of the district court to remand to the plan administrator,it does not appear from the record that actually requested such relief from the district court.as such,they have waived the issue for appeal.see allianz ins.lerner,cir it is a general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
even if had not waived the remand issue,we would review the district court decision to fashion a remedy itself instead of remanding to the plan administrator for an excess of allowable discretion.see zervos verizon,cir kinek paramount commc ns,cir.the district court here did not exceed its allowable discretion in this regard.although we did not prohibit the district court from remanding the case to the plan administrator,the language in our prior opinion presumed that the district court would craft the remedy itself.see frommert,at.
moreover,had ample opportunity to explain fully the approach proposed by the plan administrator before the district court,and did so,in their briefs and at oral argument,in a sworn affidavit from the plan administrator,and in a written report and accompanying testimony from an independent actuary who analyzed the plan administrator approach.indeed,identify nothing that might have been gained by the district court remanding the matter to the plan administrator.see krauss oxford health plans,cir stating that plaintiffs were not entitled to administrative remand where doing so would have been futile miller united welfare fund,cir stating that remand to a plan administrator is not required where such additional proceedings would be a useless formality internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,we suggested,as guidance for the district court,that it may wish to employ equitable principles.see frommert,at.identify no equitable principles that a district court might be employing,immediately upon remand from a circuit court,in merely performing the ministerial function of then remanding a case to an erisa plan administrator.
rely on miller united welfare fund to argue that remand is appropriate when reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome of the case.however,we directed the district court in miller to remand the case to the plan administrator to permit the plan administrator to gather additional evidence relevant to the nursing care sought by the claimant.see id.here,we did not anticipate any comparable,extensive fact finding,and none occurred on remand before the district court.indeed,the only evidence considered by the district court consisted of expert testimony regarding which of various proposed remedies was the most fair and equitable.given the apparent lack of any benefit to remanding the case to the plan administrator and the language in our prior decision implying that the district court should fashion its own remedy,see id.at,we can not conclude that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in actually doing so.
in the alternative,argue that the district court erred in failing to adopt the plan administrator proposed approach,or at least consider it under a deferential standard of review.we have held that where the erisa plan confers upon the plan administrator discretionary authority to construe the terms of the plan,the district court should review a decision by the plan administrator under an excess of allowable discretion standard.see nichols prudential ins.of,cir citing firestone tire rubber bruch,d.however,the district court here had no decision to review because the plan administrator never rendered any decision other than the original benefit determinations,all of which were premised on the phantom account offset mechanism.see id.w e may give deferential review only to actual exercises of discretion.have identified no authority in support of the proposition that a district court must afford deference to the mere opinion of the plan administrator in a case,such as this,where the administrator had previously construed the same terms and we found such a construction to have violated erisa.
to the extent that argue that the district court erred by instructing the plan administrator to calculate benefits by deducting the nominal value of prior distributions denominated in dollars from accrued benefits denominated in current dollars,see appellants br.at,we reject their argument for reasons similar to those applicable to their arguments on behalf of their own preferred new hire remedy.the district court had discretion to design a remedy to provide with the proper level of pension benefits in light of the erisa violations we identified in our prior decision.as wrote a pension plan that addresses the situation of a employee with what can only be described as ambiguity,contradiction or silence,we see no problem with the district court selection of one reasonable approach among several reasonable alternatives.lifson ina life ins.of,cir per curiam instructing that a court should construe ambiguities in plan terms against the drafter of the erisa plan.
ii.releases of certain plaintiffs erisa claims 
the final issue raised in this appeal is argument that the district court erred in ruling that the release forms signed by several did not apply to the erisa claims asserted in this litigation the releases at issue provided that the signing employee release s xerox from any and all claims based on anything that has occurred prior to the date he or she sign s this release in exchange for up to weeks of salary continuance.in addition,the form specifies several potential federal claims,including those based in erisa,that the release covers.
as a threshold matter,argue,for the first time in this appeal,that may not rely upon the release forms signed by several because federal rule of civil procedure a requires that an action in federal court be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.although are the pension plan at issue in this litigation and its administrators,argue that only xerox corporation has a sufficient stake in reversing the trial court ruling that the xerox general release form constitutes a waiver of erisa claims by the releasee.appellees br.at.as noted above,the district court dismissed xerox early in this litigation,and did not appeal this ruling.see frommert,at.moreover,did not challenge the authority of to rely upon the releases below and thus have waived this argument for purposes of this appeal.see rogers samedan oil,cir affirming district court ruling that defendant had waived defense by failing to assert it until the day before trial richardson edwards,deeming defense waived when not raised until appellate proceedings.
even if had not waived this argument,their argument is meritless because the release form itself defines its reference to xerox to include the xerox employee benefit plans in which the employee had participated or was then participating.see frommert,d at quoting release f
