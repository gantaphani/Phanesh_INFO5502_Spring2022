nezmije demirovic demirovic appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york alvin hellerstein,judge,dismissing her claim for disability benefits.demirovic argues that the denial of her disability benefits by building service pension fund the fund violates erisa.we agree with the district court that the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard applies to our review of the fund decision.however,because we conclude that the fund failed to conduct a full and fair review of all of the circumstances relevant to plaintiff claim of disability,we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
i.the facts 
demirovic filed her claim for disability pension benefits in september.at that time,she was years old,and had worked as a night cleaner for some thirty years.she was a member of local,and fully vested for benefits available through the fund.the benefits provided by the fund include a monthly pension payment to participants who suffer from a t otal and permanent disability.the fund summary plan description spd explains that 
total and permanent disability is the inability to work in any capacity,as determined in the discretion of the trustees or persons they designate.you will not satisfy this definition of total and permanent disability just because you are unable to continue working at your usual occupation you must be unable to perform any gainful employment to be considered totally and permanently disabled under this plan 
on her application for benefits,demirovic indicated pain and swelling on right knee due to osteo arthritis.she also submitted a form completed by her attending physician,victor sasson,which stated that demirovic had had a total knee replacement,and was totally disabled.her application was also accompanied by a notice of award from the social security administration granting her social security disability payments.
the fund referred demirovic to an outside specialist,edward toriello,for disability evaluation.the fund informed toriello that his services had been retained to determined whether the participant is totally and permanently disabled as a result of his sic condition.the fund further explained that 
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the fund,a person is totally disabled if as a result of illness or injury,is unable to work in any capacity.the following criteria should be considered when determining whether this patient is disabled as defined by our standards 
is this individual totally disabled 
can the individual perform any gainful employment

toriello found that demirovic had a limited range of motion in her right knee,amounting to a temporary moderate partial disability.on the form provided by the fund,he indicated that she was able to sit for a bout hours in a day,though she was able to stand or walk for l ess than hours,and was able to walk no more than one city block without rest or severe pain.he felt that she was presently able to work in a sedentary capacity.
on february,the fund denied demirovic claim on the basis of toriello conclusion that she was able to work in a sedentary capacity.demirovic appealed the denial.the fund referred her to another physician,andrew brown,who examined her on september.brown noted that,in addition to her knee pain,demirovic complained of numbness in her hands and pain in her shoulders his report concentrated,however,only on her knee impairments,because her other complaints were present prior to her stopping working,and were not the reason for her inability to perform her work duty as per the documentation provided.he found that she had impaired mobility,and was able to perform sedentary work only,and even then only limited to six hours per day.brown further noted that t he ability to perform sedentary work is based on her physical examination only.it does not take into account her education nor work skills or any other diagnoses that would preclude her from performing work duties.
on october,demirovic counsel received her file,containing brown findings.demirovic promptly submitted new medical evidence from her doctor,sasson,and four other doctors.sasson stated that demirovic,due to her knee impairments,would be unable to perform a sedentary job on a prolonged sustained basis.albert benchabbat stated that demirovic suffered from diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy,which,inter alia,would prevent her from standing for more than two hours in a typical work day,or sitting for more than four.he advise d her against resuming any kind of work.jorge rinsky,a psychiatrist,stated that demirovic suffered from low mood,anhedonia,insomnia,tenseness,tiredness,lack of energy and lack of drive and present ed poor concentration and slow mentation.
the fund appeals committee heard demirovic appeal on december.no record was made of the proceedings.by letter dated december,the fund informed demirovic that her appeal had been denied,on the basis of toriello and brown reports,and following review of her entire file,including the letters from sasson,benchabbat,rinsky,and her other doctors.
on march,demirovic filed a complaint against the fund in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that the fund decision to deny her disability benefits violated erisa.the district court,finding that the fund had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously in determining that demirovic was not disabled,granted defendant motion for summary judgment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of the fund motion for summary judgment under a de novo standard.jordan retirement comm.of rensselaer polytechnic,cir.
the first question before us is whether,as demirovic argues,the district court erred in applying a deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review to the fund denial of benefits.the plan and the spd contain language expressly conferring discretionary authority upon the fund trustees.demirovic concedes that,ordinarily,this language would be sufficient to secure deferential review in favor of the fund.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d.however,demirovic argues that,because the fund failed to make its initial determination on her claim within days of receipt,as required by f,promulgated pursuant to erisa,we must review her claim de novo.
demirovic relies on nichols prudential ins.of,cir.in nichols,the plaintiff insurer had delayed a final decision on her appeal from her initial denial of benefits past the deadline for deciding appeals imposed by i i.rather than wait for her insurer to decide the appeal,nichols went directly to federal court.we held that her claim was deemed denied as a result of the insurer inaction,and that her administrative remedies had therefore been exhausted.nichols,at.we instructed the district court to apply de novo review to her claim,on the ground that we may give deferential review only to actual exercises of discretion a deemed denied claim is not denied by any exercise of discretion,but by operation of law id.at.
in nichols,the insurer inaction le ft the court without any decision or application of expertise to which to defer.id.here,by contrast,rather than go directly to court when the fund failed to issue a timely initial determination,demirovic chose to appeal.she then waited for and received a timely decision on her appeal this eventual decision constitutes a final decision and exercise of the fund discretion,to which we must defer.accordingly,we will apply arbitrary and capricious review to the fund determination.
under that standard,we may overturn a denial of benefits only if it was without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.pulvers first unum life ins,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.where both the trustees of a pension fund and a rejected applicant offer rational,though conflicting,interpretations of plan provisions,the trustees interpretation must be allowed to control.miles new york state teamsters conference pension ret.fund employee pension ben.plan,cir.
