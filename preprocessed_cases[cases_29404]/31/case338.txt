a group of plaintiffs seeking to represent different classes of current and retired insurance agents of the allstate insurance company brought this action alleging four counts under the employee retirement income security act of erisa against the allstate corporation,the allstate insurance company,the agents pension plan pension plan and the administrative committee in its capacity as administrator of the agents pension plan plan administrator collectively herein allstate.the three erisa duty claims,alleged under g and h,were dismissed by the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania as on the face of the complaint.the erisa breach of fiduciary duty claim,alleged under a,was also dismissed on the ground that it was duplicative of claims in two related actions then pending before the district court.we will reverse and remand for further proceedings and in so doing make explicit that the federal discovery rule should be used to determine the date of accrual of the duty claims alleged here.
for many years allstate typically hired,as employees,the agents who sold its policies and handled its claims.these employee agents operated under one of two types of employment contracts known as and.at some point,allstate determined it would be better served by agents operating as independent contractors,and thereafter,all newly hired agents were independent contractors providing services to allstate under a contract known as.beginning in the early,allstate also set out to persuade current employee agents to convert to independent contractor status.
allstate maintained a pension plan subject to erisa.prior to,employee agents became participants in the pension plan after one year of service and were fully vested after five years.the version of the pension plan contained an attractive early retirement feature under which agents with at least years of continuous credited service could opt to retire at age and receive an enhanced early retirement benefit which assumed the retiree had continued to work until age.that version of the pension plan provided that a ll service with allstate shall count as credited service for purposes of accruing retirement benefits,including the enhanced early retirement benefit.
in november,allstate amended the pension plan retroactive to january,to phase out the enhanced early retirement benefit over a period of eight years amendment the amendment was in december.plaintiffs contend that at this time,however,they could not have been affected by the amendment because they had not yet reached years of age and completed years of credited service.
also in december,the pension plan was amended to alter the definition of credited service.the new definition provided that only an agent employment by allstate as an employee shall count as credited service credited service amendment.a new appendix added to the written pension plan explained that agents who entered into an agreement to provide substantially similar services to allstate as independent contractors under an contract would be denied early retirement.thus,newly hired agents and former employee agents who had converted to the contract would no longer have their service to allstate count for purposes of early retirement.in january,allstate amended the pension plan again,this time adding a new provision to make employee a defined term,and to exclude therefrom any person providing services to allstate under an contract employee definition amendment.
as the decade advanced,allstate stepped up it efforts to persuade remaining employee agents to convert to independent contractor status.in,allstate announced it would terminate the contracts of some employee agents in california unless they converted or retired.in november,allstate embarked on a nationwide conversion effort,in the wake of which most remaining employee agents either converted and signed a comprehensive release of all claims against allstate in conjunction therewith,or retired.plaintiffs contend that it was only at this time that they could have known how the credited service amendment would affect them because it was only then that they converted from employee to independent contractor status and only then that they were denied credited service under the plan.allstate and its plan administrator consistently represented to the employee agents considering conversion during this time period that any service to allstate provided after conversion would not count towards early retirement under the pension plan.
ii.procedural history 
on december,named plaintiffs,seeking to represent three different classes,instituted the present action.plaintiffs in the first group,who had converted to the contract at a time when they had accrued less than years of credited service,sought to represent a class of converted agents.plaintiffs in the second group,who had retired rather than convert to the contract at a time when they had accrued less than years of credited service,sought to represent a class of retired agents.plaintiffs in the third group which included all of the named plaintiffs sought to represent a class of employee agents who were hired by allstate as employee agents before january,remained in allstate service as employee agents after december,and had not yet attained age by december,the enhanced early retirement benefit class.
the complaint contained four counts under erisa.in count i,plaintiffs seeking to represent the class of converted agents alleged that the credited service amendment to the pension plan and the employee definition amendment to the pension plan violated erisa g,g,because the amendments had the effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit.in count ii,plaintiffs seeking to represent the class of retired agents alleged that allstate and its plan administrator violated the fiduciary duty provision of erisa a,a,during the conversion efforts in representing to employee agents choosing between conversion or retirement that any service provided under an contract would not count towards the pension plan.in count iii,plaintiffs seeking to represent the enhanced early retirement benefit class alleged that the amendment violated erisa g because it too had the effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit.in count iv,the same plaintiffs as in count iii,the enhanced early retirement benefit class alleged that allstate and its plan administrator violated erisa h,h by failing to provide notice to plan participants when it added the amendment,which was alleged to have the effect of significantly reducing the rate of future benefit accrual.see compl.the november amendments,under which allstate purported to phase out and ultimately eliminate the enhanced early retirement benefits,caused a significant reduction in early retirement benefits or subsidies that agents accrued under the pension plan see also erisa h,h.allstate moved to dismiss each of the four counts under.b on numerous grounds,including that the duty claims alleged in counts i,iii and iv were.
pending before the district court at the same time as the present action were two other actions challenging the legality of allstate conduct over the course of the conversion process.in the first romero i plaintiffs including almost all of the same plaintiffs in the present action,also seeking to represent various classes,alleged seven counts against allstate and its executive officer.the romero i plaintiffs sought to invalidate the comprehensive release signed by agents who had converted on the grounds that it violated erisa,the age discrimination in employment act adea,and the common law.they also alleged interference with employment and retaliation in violation of erisa,discriminatory treatment in violation of the adea,breach of the and contracts,and breach of a fiduciary duty described in the romero i complaint as one of good faith and fair dealing said to have arisen from the special confidence reposed in allstate by class members.in the second pending the eeoc action the equal employment opportunity commission brought suit against the allstate insurance company,alleging violations related to the conversion process of title vii of the civil rights act of,title i of the civil rights act of,the adea,and the americans with disabilities act.
the district court dismissed the present action in a single paragraph of a larger memorandum opinion addressing motions then pending in all three actions,reasoning 
to the extent that the plaintiffs in the present action complain about the amendments to the pension plan made in,and,their complaint,filed december,is,on its face.to the extent that they lost pension entitlements when they became independent contractors or former employees,that consequence would be an element of damages if they establish that their change of status was a breach of contract or otherwise which are being asserted in romero i and the eeoc action.i conclude that the present action should be dismissed in its entirety.
emphasis added.this appeal followed.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over the present action pursuant to and erisa e and f,e f.this court has appellate jurisdiction to review the final order of the district court pursuant to and.we exercise plenary review of the district court dismissal of counts i,iii and iv of the complaint on statute of limitations grounds under.b.lake arnold,cir.for purposes of conducting this review,we take all facts alleged in the complaint as true and afford plaintiffs,as the,the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.see id.we also exercise plenary review over the district court determination that count ii was duplicative of the claims then pending in romero i and the eeoc action,as that conclusion was based on a legal characterization of the complaint.
iv.accrual 
applicable limitations periods 
erisa contains a statute of limitations for claims,like count ii here,alleging breach of fiduciary duty under erisa a erisa does not,however,contain a statute of limitations for duty claims,such as those alleged in counts i,iii,and iv.in gluck unisys,cir,this court instructed that the limitations period applicable to the forum state claim most analogous to the erisa claim at hand is to be borrowed and applied to an erisa duty claim.in gluck,this court held that an erisa g claim,said to involve complex issues of statutory interpretation,had no counterpart in pennsylvania law,and therefore the applicable statute of limitations was pennsylvania general period.see at applying.purdons supp.gluck thus dictates that counts i and iii of the complaint in the present action,which allege violations of erisa g,are subject to a limitations period.
this court has never addressed the limitations period applicable to an erisa h claim indeed it does not appear that any court has done so.the parties in the present action appear to assume that pennsylvania limitations period applicable to count iii applies also to the erisa h claim alleged in count iv,as both challenges involve the same plan amendment.the first step in borrowing a local time limitation is to determine the state claim most analogous to the erisa claim pursued.gluck,at.the parties have not identified an analogous state law claim and we have not found one.we do note,however,that as pleaded,and as characterized by plaintiffs before this court,the claims in count iii and iv appear to be intrinsically tied together in that it is the effect of the amendment challenged in count iii that plaintiffs say triggered the notice requirement alleged to have been violated in count iv.in this situation,we deem it appropriate to apply pennsylvania limitations period.see.any civil action or proceeding which is neither subject to another limitation specified in this subchapter nor excluded from the application of a period of limitation by section relating to no limitation must be commenced within six years see also gluck,at 
date of accrual 
the principal issue before us is when the causes of action alleged in counts i,iii,and iv accrued for limitations other words,when the clock on the applicable statute of limitations began to tick.the date of accrual of the erisa duty claims asserted is determined as a matter of federal common law.see painewebber faragalli,cir stating,in context of a claim to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act,w hile a state statute of limitations may be borrowed for a federal claim,federal,not state,law governs as to when the cause of action accrues see also admin.comm.of the stores,soles,cir stating in erisa action,f ederal law also determines when the cause of action accrues union pacific beckham,cir.stating in erisa action,despite determining the limitations period by analyzing state law,this court looks to federal common law to determine the time at which a plaintiff federal claim accrues,cert.denied,d.
the district court did not explicate its reasoning for dismissing counts i,iii and iv of the complaint as.we assume,as do the parties before us,that the decision was based at least in part on this court decision in gluck.to the extent,however,that the district court interpreted gluck to dictate that counts i,iii and iv accrued on the date the challenged amendments were made to the pension plan,we reject this reading.gluck held only that the erisa g claim alleged in that case accrued,at the earliest,on the date of the plan amendment.see at the employees claims asserting failure to vest the residual,failure to distribute the surplus,and improper reduction of early retirement benefits are claims founded on complex issues of statutory interpretation.they are subject to pennsylvania statute of limitations.because they accrued at the earliest on july,effective date of the have been timely interposed.emphasis added.there was no need to determine in gluck exactly when the claim accrued because,even assuming the earliest date,the date the plan was amended,the claim was timely interposed having clarified that gluck does not dictate the dismissal of counts i,iii,and iv,we turn now to identifying the proper standard for determining when those claims accrued for limitations purposes.
typically in a federal question case,and in the absence of any contrary directive from congress,courts employ the federal discovery rule to determine when the federal claim accrues for limitations purposes.see keystone ins.houghton,cir citing,sandutch muroski,cir,abrogated on other grounds by klehr smith,d see also union pacific,at citing,inter alia,connors hallmark son coal,listing cases including houghton in which eight federal courts of appeals had held that the discovery rule is the general accrual rule in federal courts and is to be applied in all federal question cases and cada baxter healthcare,cir holding that the discovery rule is read into statutes of limitations in cases even when those statutes of limitations are borrowed from state law see also admin.comm.of the stores,at citing union pacific and applying the discovery rule.under the general formulation of the discovery rule,a claim will accrue when the plaintiff discovers,or with due diligence should have discovered,the injury that forms the basis for the claim.see,union pacific,at.the rule that has developed in the more specific erisa context is that an erisa duty claim will accrue after a claim for benefits due under an erisa plan has been made and formally denied.see id.at citing cotter eastern conf.of teamsters retirement plan,cir see also daill sheet metal workers local pension fund,cir tanzillo local union,int l broth.of teamsters,cir.occasionally,however,an erisa claim will accrue before a formal application is made before benefits are formally denied,such as when there has been a repudiation of the benefits by the fiduciary which is clear and made known to the beneficiar y.miles state teamsters conf.pension and retirement fund,cir.internal citations omitted,emphasis in the original,cert.denied,d.see also daill,at a cause of action accrues upon a clear and unequivocal repudiation of rights under the pension plan which has been made known to the beneficiary union pacific,at citing miles carey int l broth.of workers local pension plan,cir listing cases using the clear repudiation standard in the absence of a formal application for benefits.this clear repudiation concept is consistent with the federal discovery rule and,in the specific context of erisa,avoids a myriad of ills that would accompany any rule that required the denial of a formal application for benefits before a claim accrues.see,daill,at carey,at.we too have applied the clear repudiation concept in numerous cases involving erisa,see henglein colt industries operating,cir in the circumstances here,where there was an outright repudiation at the time the employees services were terminated,it is reasonable to expect that the statute of limitations on plaintiffs claim that they were entitled to benefits under an plan began to run at that point,cert.denied,d see also in re unisys.med.ben.erisa litigation,cir.applying the federal common law discovery rule in the context of erisa fiduciary duty claim,cert.denied,and find it appropriate to do so here.accordingly,we hold that when an erisa is amended but the fact that the amendment actually affects a particular employee or group of employees can not be known until some later event,the cause of action of the employee will not accrue until such time as the employee knew or should have known that the amendment has brought about a clear repudiation of certain rights that the employee believed he or she had under the plan.
we have not had a prior opportunity to consider whether the discovery rule should govern in the specific context of an erisa g claim or whether such a claim should be deemed to have accrued as of the date of adoption or effective date of the challenged plan amendment.the basic policies undergirding limitations periods generally,such as rapid resolution of disputes,repose for defendants,and avoidance of litigation involving lost or distorted evidence,may be said to favor a rule that would tie the date of accrual to the date of the plan amendment,and such concerns are magnified in the context of an erisa pension plan funded on a,prospective basis.additionally,there is intrinsic appeal to adopting such a rule for an erisa g claim because a claim pursuant to that provision challenges the amendment itself as having the effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit.other courts,however,have rejected a rule that would tie the date of accrual to the date of amendment,both in the context of claims alleged under erisa g and other erisa duty claims.see,meagher int l of machinists and aerospace workers pension plan,cir reversing dismissal of erisa g claim as from the date of amendment and reasoning that plaintiffs were harmed by the wrongful application of the challenged amendment,not by its enactment,cert.denied,d laurenzano blue cross and blue shield of.retirement income trust,d refusing to find erisa challenge to lump sum distribution paid in lieu of an annuity that did not include a cost of living adjustment component commenced in even though the lump sum option had been in place since devito pension plan of local pension fund.refusing to find erisa challenge to pension benefit calculation formula commenced in even though formula had been in place since,abrogated on other grounds by strom goldman,sachs,cir.we find the reasoning of these cases to be persuasive.a rule that unwaveringly ties the date of accrual to the date of amendment would have the undesirable effect of requiring plan participants and beneficiaries likely unfamiliar with the intricacies of pension plan formulas and the technical requirements of erisa,to become watchdogs over potential p lan errors and abuses.devito.at.it would also tend to preclude claims by those who commenced employment after the limitations period applicable to the particular erisa claim has elapsed.see id.at.additionally,it would impose an unfair duty of clairvoyance on employees,such as those in this case,who allege that an amendment detrimental effect on them was triggered not at the time of its adoption,but rather at some later time by a subsequent event.we eschew such a rule in light of the underlying purposes of erisa and its disclosure requirements,see in re unisys.retiree med.ben.erisa litigation,cir erisa is a comprehensive statute enacted to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans,and to protect contractually defined benefits internal citations omitted see also hunger ab,cir congress enacted erisa to ensure that an employee would not lose fully vested,accrued benefits in the event the employer terminated or amended its pension plan,and accordingly hold that the federal discovery rule,which includes the clear repudiation concept,applies in the specific context of the erisa g claims alleged here.
use of the federal discovery rule to discern the date of accrual does not necessarily prevent the date of amendment from serving as the accrual date for an erisa g claim,as there may be circumstances under which benefits are clearly repudiated as of that date.on the face of this complaint,however,one can not determine when such clear repudiation occurred.as to that portion of count i which challenges the credited service amendment,the complaint does not allege when or if the plaintiffs were notified that such amendment had been adopted and does not allege,or allege other facts from which it might be inferred,that plaintiffs knew or should have known that they would someday be forced to convert to independent contractor status prior to the conversion drive of,such that they might understand that the amendment would apply to them while facts may be developed from which one could conclude that clear repudiation did occur before the actual act of conversion,it is premature at this point to dismiss count i on limitations grounds.as to count iii,which challenges the amendment,the complaint specifically alleges that notice was not given to participants and further did not allege facts from which it might be inferred that plaintiffs knew or should have known the effect such amendment would have on their benefits at some point before roughly december,six years before the complaint was filed in december.again,while facts may be developed from which one could conclude that clear repudiation did occur at a time which renders the subsequent assertion of the claim untimely,it is premature at this point to dismiss count iii on limitations grounds.
the erisa h claim in count iv is certainly of a different character than the erisa g claims raised in counts i and iii,and for that reason,allstate urges this court to recognize an accrual date tied to the procedural requirement of the statute as opposed to one discerned using the federal discovery rule.specifically,relying on the language of erisa h,allstate contends that the date of accrual should be the date on which notice should have been,days before the effective date of the amendment.see erisa h a plan may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual,unless after adoption of the plan amendment and not less than days before the effective date of the plan amendment,the plan administrator provides a written notice setting forth the plan amendment and its effective date emphasis added.plaintiffs,however,urge that the federal discovery rule be used also to discern the date of accrual for count iv,arguing that a participant can not have knowledge that he has not been given the notice required under erisa h without first learning of the existence of the benefit reducing amendment itself.we agree with the plaintiffs.it would make no sense,and indeed do a remarkable disservice to the underlying purposes of erisa and its disclosure requirements,to deem a notice claim to have accrued before a plaintiff knows or should have known that an amendment has the effect which triggers the notice requirement.thus,it is appropriate to use the federal discovery rule to discern the date of accrual of the erisa h claim made here.
again,as with the claim alleged in count iii,it may be that facts exist to demonstrate that plaintiffs knew or should have known that the amendment had the effect which triggered the notice requirement at a time which would render the subsequent assertion of count iv unti
