the district court also denied the fee petition on the alternative ground that martin had not offered evidence concerning the number of hours reasonably spent on the litigation,or the reasonable hourly rate for such services,holding that a contingent fee award was inappropriate in an erisa case.martin filed a motion for reconsideration,setting forth an hourly fee request in the amount of.martin brought this appeal after the district court denied the motion for reconsideration 
ii.discussion 
erisa provision unambiguously gives the district court discretion to award attorney fees to either party.g.in making this determination,a district court abuses its discretion when there is a lack of factual support for its decision,or when it fails to follow applicable law.richards aramark,cir.
this case involves the conundrum of what,exactly,is the applicable law for erisa attorney fee applications in this circuit.on one hand,our circuit was one of the first to apply the presumption in favor of prevailing erisa plaintiffs.in landro,we held that the prevailing plaintiff was entitled to a presumption in favor of a fee by the losing defendant ability to show special circumstances in support of denying an award.at.we noted that the losing defendant had the burden of proving those special circumstances.id.at.then,in westerhaus,at,we identified a test designed to aid the district court in making its discretionary determination regarding fees,but failed to mention the presumption.see also jacobs pickands mather,cir stating that court should consider the enumerated westerhaus factors in exercising its discretion concerning whether to award attorney fees.
lutheran medical center contractors,laborers,teamsters and engineers health and welfare plan,cir appears to be the first case in which we referred to the test and the presumption in the same analysis.in lutheran medical we affirmed the district court decision to award fees to the plaintiff,and noted that the plan has not shown any special circumstances.moreover,the district court exhaustively considered all five factors set forth in jacobs.id.at.also,in affirming the district court award of attorney fees in stanton larry fowler trucking,cir,we noted that the defendant bore the burden of showing special circumstances to preclude an attorney fees award,and credited the district court consideration of the test in its decision to award fees to the plaintiff.id.at.see also milone exclusive healthcare,cir referring to both the presumption and test.
a review of our sister circuits indicates that the first,third,fourth,fifth,sixth,eleventh and circuits have all considered the presumption and expressly rejected its application,cottrill sparrow,johnson ursillo,cir eddy colonial life ins.of,quesinberry life ins.of,cir ellison shenango.pension,cir armistead vernitron,cir iron workers local bowen,cir.
the second and tenth circuits do not use the presumption,but have not considered and expressly rejected it,chambless masters,mates pilots pension plan,cir gordon united states steel,cir in fact,the tenth circuit is the genesis of the test,as first enunciated in eaves penn,cir.
finally,the seventh and ninth circuits appear to utilize some version of both the test and a presumption in conducting the discretionary attorney fee analysis.see mcelwaine west,cir spelling out the test and stating that court should also apply the special circumstances rule little cox supermarkets,cir noting that courts can use either the test or a modest presumption and that under either formulation,the question is the same was the losing party position substantially justified and taken in good faith,or was that party simply out to harass its opponent.
in the cases that expressly rejected the presumption,the proponent of the presumption generally analogized the erisa structure to the similar statute in civil rights cases,citing particularly to hensley eckerhart,d.hensley clarified the standards for attorney fees in civil rights cases,and the court noted that prevailing plaintiffs may ordinarily recover attorney fees unless special circumstances make an award unjust.id.at citing newman piggie park,d per curiam.the cases rejecting the newman and hensley approach in erisa cases reason that despite similar language in the civil rights statutes and erisa provision the overall aims of the civil rights statutes are quite different from erisa purpose,eddy,at.erisa protects economic interests,while the civil rights statutes protect dignitary and individual economic interests,which are uniquely important to our nation as a whole.id.the eddy court also reasoned that it would belittle the stature accorded civil rights cases to apply the presumption in other types of cases.id.at.and,while the legislative history of the civil rights statutes indicated a presumption is warranted in those case,erisa lacks similar legislative history.id.
we agree with the reasoning in eddy and find that erisa does not closely correspond with the scheme in the civil rights statutes.instead,erisa language is neutral in its reference to fees,similar to the statute construed by the supreme court in fogerty fantasy,d.in fogerty,the court considered whether the copyright act provision,was analogous to the civil rights statutes.at.the plaintiff in fogerty asserted there should be a dual standard treating prevailing plaintiffs more favorably for copyright act fee determinations as established in christiansburg garment eeoc,d,for title vii cases.the court rejected this analogy,despite similar language in the statutes.at.the court credited the important policy objectives of the civil rights statutes,and noted that these objectives were absent in a case involving the copyright act.id.at.
like the copyright act as construed in fogerty,erisa involves vindication of statutory,economic rights.also like the copyright act,and as admitted by counsel at argument,there is a dearth of legislative history on erisa,and certainly none which suggests that it was enacted to further important societal goals or polic ies that congress considered of the highest priority.id.quoting christiansburg,at,quoting piggie park,at.instead,both the copyright act and erisa have neutral,discretionary attorney fee language,and equally neutral or sparse legislative history concerning attorney fees.
finally,the american rule that each party normally bears the cost of the litigation unless congress provides otherwise,fogerty,at,pervades our analysis.while congress did provide for fee shifting at the district court discretion in erisa cases,the operation of a presumption in favor of fees undermines the american rule and should be employed only in extraordinary cases,such as civil rights litigation.in fogerty,the court noted that congress legislates against the strong background of the american rule and pointed out that the statute use of the word may clearly connotes discretion.the automatic awarding of attorney fees
