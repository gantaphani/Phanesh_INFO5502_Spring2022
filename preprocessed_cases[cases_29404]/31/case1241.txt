background 
the appellants initially were employed by western electric company,an at t subsidiary,beginning in the and.each of them participated in the western electric pension plan.in december,arthur schricker retired with that plan in effect.he continued to receive retirement benefits as the plan denomination changed,first to the bell system management pension plan,and then to the at t management pension plan at t plan.the other three chastain,larry patterson,and in december under the at t plan.
in,at t spun off lucent as a separate corporation.at t and its spinoff then entered into an employee benefits agreement,under which at t transferred certain participants in the at t plan,including the appellants,to the lucent retirement income plan lucent plan.the appellants were aware of the transfer.for several years,the appellants received the same benefits from the lucent plan as they had received under the at t plan.in,however,lucent eliminated the three benefits that are the subject of this action.the first eliminated benefit was the pensioner death benefit,through which the survivors of a deceased retiree could receive a benefit equal to one year of the retiree pay.the second eliminated benefit reimbursed retirees and their spouses for premiums paid under medicare part b.the third eliminated benefit was dental coverage it was replaced by an option to purchase coverage at group rates.
in march,the appellants filed this putative class action in federal district court,asserting claims for breach of express agreement,breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing,breach of fiduciary duty,and conversion.federal jurisdiction was invoked pursuant to article iii,section,clause of the united states constitution,as annotated,title,ch,united states code and.at t moved for judgment on the pleadings,contending that the claims were either preempted by erisa or barred by the statute of limitations.in its ruling on the motion,the district court highlighted the imprecise nature of the complaint,noting that it did not indicate whether any particular claim was based in federal or state law but adding that the reference to title,ch.was a citation to erisa chastain v.at t,no.march,order denying judgment on the pleadings.accordingly,the district court explained that this lack of specificity in the complaint has required the defendant to construe the complaint as alleging erisa claims.id.the court ultimately denied the motion but accepted the appellants invitation to dismiss their claims for breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.id.
in december,the appellants sought class certification,specifically arguing in their motion that t he claims arise under the same federal law,et and setting forth the legal framework under erisa.during the class certification hearing,the appellants attorney reiterated that t he basis of our claim is that they made a plan with uniform enforceable promises of benefits for certain periods t hose benefits are based on erisa a b not on some sort of reliance argument.
at t moved for summary judgment.it posited that the p laintiffs clearly and unequivocally frame and confine their claims as ones proceeding under erisa section b,and they can not file suit against at t because they are not participants in any at erisa plan.see a limiting suits to recover benefits to a participant in or beneficiary of an erisa plan.at t also argued that even if the appellants were participants,their claims would fail on the merits.the appellants did not dispute at t characterization of their claims.to the contrary,in their summary judgment briefs the appellants repeatedly designated their claims as claims for recovery of plan benefits under erisa a b.they never described the claims in terms of misrepresentation,reliance,or breach of fiduciary duty.thus,in its summary judgment order,the district court recognized that the plaintiffs have considerably narrowed and refined their claims since the filing of the complaint.chastain v.at t,no,wl,at.specifically,the court found that all claims other than plaintiffs a b erisa a b claims to recover plan benefits have been abandoned,or confessed for lack of developed argument,and such claims are dismissed on that basis.id.thus,the court explained that this action now stands as one seeking to recover plan benefits due under erisa,a b a b.id.at.the court went on to grant summary judgment to at t based on lack of erisa standing,or,in the alternative,because the appellants claims would fail on the merits.id.at.having determined that the appellants could not prevail,the district court dismissed their motion to certify the class as moot.id.at.the appellants now appeal the district court entry of summary judgment against them.
ii.discussion 
as an initial matter,we clarify that the appellants pursue claims only under erisa.although their complaint could be construed as asserting state claims,the district court explained that the appellants have since refined their theories of liability and limited themselves to claims under erisa,and on appeal the appellants do not contest that determination thus,our analysis is likewise limited to whether summary judgment was warranted on the appellants claims for relief under erisa.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.quik payday,stork,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
standing under erisa a b 
erisa a allows civil suits by a participant or a beneficiary of an erisa plan to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a.thus,only plaintiffs who are properly considered participants or beneficiaries have standing to sue under erisa a.see raymond mobil oil,cir.we have explained that a is both a standing and a subject matter jurisdictional requirement.felix lucent,cir.
in this case,the appellants contend they are participants in,not beneficiaries of,an erisa plan.erisa defines a participant as 
any employee or former employee of an employer,or any member or former member of an employee organization,who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization,or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.
the supreme court has further clarified the definition of participant.under erisa,participants are employees in,or reasonably expected to be in,currently covered employment,or former employees who have a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment or who have a colorable claim to vested benefits.firestone tire rubber bruch,d alterations,citations,and quotations omitted.because the appellants are retired,they are not employees currently in covered employment.nor do the appellants claim that they expect to return to covered employment.the issue,then,is whether they have a colorable claim to vested benefits.
