after kenneth fortier became medically disabled,he closed his practice,fortier obstetrics gynecology,pllc,and applied for disability benefits from principal life insurance company,which had issued and group disability policies to the practice.the policies provide that an insured who is disabled is entitled to receive of his predisability earnings,capped at per week for benefits and per month for benefits.those benefits,however,are reduced by the amount that all disability benefits from both individual and group policies exceed his predisability earnings.principal life determined that fortier was disabled,as defined in the policies,but that,in view of the fact that he was receiving per month in disability benefits on his individual disability policies issued by another company,he was not entitled to any further benefits under principal life group disability policies.
fortier commenced this action under erisa,claiming that the administrator of the principal life policies had misconstrued the policies in calculating his predisability earnings at and that,with a proper calculation,his predisability earnings were far greater,entitling him to the maximum benefits from principal life,despite the fact that he was receiving on his individual disability policies.more particularly,he contends that principal life,when calculating his predisability earnings,erroneously deducted from his gross predisability earnings extraordinary and business expenses incurred by him in in starting up his practice and in pursuing litigation with partners in his former medical practice.without the reductions resulting from these extraordinary,business expenses,fortier predisability earnings were sufficiently large to entitle him to the maximum disability benefits from the group policies.
the district court,ruling on for summary judgment,entered judgment in favor of principal life,concluding that the administrator interpretation was a reasonable one.the administrator,who was given complete discretion to interpret the policies,had concluded that because fortier claimed his extraordinary expenses as deductions on his federal income tax returns,he thereby represented that they were ordinary and necessary business expenses.thus,those same expenses were also,in the language of the policies,usual and customary,incurred on a regular basis,and essential to the established business operation.the district court held that the administrator,in adopting this interpretation,did not abuse her discretion.
we affirm.even though we recognize that the policy language,defining those expenses that may be subtracted from gross income to arrive at predisability earnings,is somewhat confusing and,to be sure,needlessly verbose,we conclude that the administrator interpretation was a reasonable one.
fortier formed a medical practice in,which,by,had grown to include four physicians and a nurse.as a result of a dispute with his,however,he left that practice and formed a new one,beginning it on october.in doing so,fortier incurred substantial expenses,as well as attorneys fees in prosecuting litigation with his former partners.

in early,fortier became medically disabled,and on february,he closed his practice.he applied for and disability benefits from principal life under the group policies issued to his practice,which covered him and his employees.he also applied for disability benefits under two individual disability policies issued to him by unum life insurance company.principal life immediately began to provide fortier with disability benefits.two months later,however,when fortier began receiving in benefits from unum,principal life ceased making any more payments under its group policies because fortier predisability income was not sufficiently large to exceed the limits stated in the policies.
fortier pursued administrative review as provided by the group policies,claiming that principal life had improperly calculated his predisability income because the administrator reduced his gross income by the unusual and reorganizational business expenses.if these extraordinary expenses were taken out of the calculus,fortier income would have been,as he claimed,per month.with this level of predisability income,he would have been entitled to the maximum benefits under the principal life policies of per week for benefits and per month for benefits,even while receiving in benefits from unum.
in a letter dated may,principal life denied fortier claim for benefits,explaining 
the calculation of fortier predisability earnings was based on the income and expenses included in his and income tax returns.according to the internal revenue service,to be deductible,a business expense must be both ordinary and necessary.an ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in trade or business.a necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for trade or business.an expense does not have to be indispensible to be considered necessary.
based on the description above,by including the expenses noted on fortier and federal income tax returns as deductible business expenses,he is representing that these expenses are both ordinary and necessary.we consider the expenses as usual and customary business expenses for the purpose of the determination of pre disability earnings for long term disability benefits offered under the group policy.
in your letter of january,you dispute principal life insurance company application of the meaning of ordinary and necessary as per the internal revenue service definitions.additionally,you requested p rincipal life insurance company evaluate fortier expenses without regard to whether or not they were deductible for tax purposes.principal life insurance company disagrees with your position.the policy text describing weekly and monthly earnings is clear and refers to the deductibility for federal income tax purposes.there is clear nexus in the policy between the policy definitions and internal revenue service terminology.moreover,the internal revenue service definition of ordinary and necessary encompasses usual,customary,and regular.
fortier commenced this action under erisa,a b,claiming benefits of per week and benefits of per month.he alleged that in calculating his predisability income for the purpose of determining benefits,principal life failed to conduct a reasoned and principled review of his claim for disability benefits.
on for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment on march,in favor of principal life.the court applied the factors relevant to judicial review of an administrator exercise of discretion,as set forth in booth wal mart stores.assocs.health welfare plan,cir,weigh ed them together,and concluded that principal life did not abuse its discretion.from the district court judgment,fortier filed this appeal.
on appeal,fortier contends that the administrator abused her discretion in construing the group policies definition of predisability earnings to mean that principal life should simply use the amount of net income from his federal tax returns for the two years prior to his disability and thereby ignore other language included in the definition.this approach,he argues,allowed the administrator to deduct unusual and reorganization expenses and litigation expenses from his predisability gross earnings,resulting in the denial of benefits.although fortier was able to reduce his taxable income significantly by deducting on his and tax returns extraordinary,expenses for the of his medical practice and litigation expenses,he argues that those expenses should not,in calculating his predisability income,have been deducted as business expenses as that term is used in the group disability policies.he maintains that the unambiguous language of principal life policies includes specific criteria for the deduction of business expenses,which include not only the criterion that an expense be deductible for federal income tax purposes but also other explicitly stated criteria that the administrator did not take into account.
had the administrator considered all relevant criteria,fortier claims,she could not have concluded that his extraordinary,expenses and litigation expenses were,as required by the policies,incurred on a regular basis and essential to the established business operation of his medical practice.he argues that expenses incurred on a regular basis means that they must be incurred frequently and repetitively and that expenses essential to an established business exclude expenses for a business.thus,he concludes,not all tax deductible expenses must be included in the calculation of the business expenses,as the administrator determined.
the parties agree that the administrator of the principal life disability policies is given discretion to construe the policies and to determine eligibility for benefits.the policies provide 
principal life has complete discretion to construe or interpret the provisions of this group insurance policy,to determine eligibility for benefits,and to determine the type and extent of benefits,if any,to be provided.the decisions of principal life in such matters shall be controlling,binding,and final as between principal life and persons covered by this group policy 
thus,a court reviewing the administrator decision must review only for abuse of discretion and therefore must not disturb the decision if it is reasonable,even if the court itself would have reached a different conclusion.haley paul revere life ins,cir.judicial review for abuse of discretion is guided by consideration of the eight nonexhaustive booth factors 
the language of the plan the purposes and goals of the plan the adequacy of the materials considered to make the decision and the degree to which they support it whether the fiduciary interpretation was consistent with other provisions in the plan and with earlier interpretations of the plan whether the decisionmaking process was reasoned and principled whether the decision was consistent with the procedural and substantive requirements of erisa any external standard relevant to the exercise of discretion and the fiduciary motives and any conflict of interest it may have.
in reviewing the administrator decision in this case,the district court concluded that booth factors the language of the plan the purposes and goals of the plan the adequacy of the materials considered to make the decision and the degree to which they support it and whether the fiduciary interpretation was consistent with other provisions in the plan strongly evidence d the reasonableness of the administrator interpretation.the court found further that booth factor conflict of interest did not render the administrator decision unreasonable.
we review the district court decision de novo,employing the same standard that governed the district court review of the plan administrator decision.champion black decker,cir.
the parties dispute centers on the group policies definition of predisability earnings.the administrator applied the policies definition to conclude that fortier predisability earnings were per month,which was insufficient to entitle him to benefits in light of the per month he was receiving from unum fortier,applying the same definition,argues that his predisability earnings were,which,the parties acknowledge,would afford him maximum benefits under principal life group disability policies.
principal life group disability policies provide for a disability benefit,not exceeding per week on the policy and per month on the policy,based on of the member predisability earnings.earnings are those earnings in effect prior to the date disability begins.the policies define those earnings for purposes of the issues here as follows 
monthly earnings on any date are based on an average of the following earnings as reported for federal income tax purposes for the last two calendar year s,assuming the owner meets all eligibility requirements 
the member share based on ownership or contractual agreement of the gross revenue or income earned by the policyholder,including income earned by the member and others under the member supervision or direction less 
the member share based on ownership or contractual agreement of the usual and customary unreimbursed business expenses of the policyholder which are incurred on a regular basis,are essential to the established business operation of the policyholder,are deductible for federal income tax purposes,and do not exceed the expenses before disability began.
this language,for purposes of our discussion,provides essentially that fortier predisability monthly earnings are determined by subtracting from his gross earnings as reported for federal income tax purposes his business expenses as defined in subsection b of the policies definition of predisability earnings.the business expenses are there defined in part as the usual and customary unreimbursed business expenses,which are incurred on a regular basis,are essential to the established operation of the policyholder,and are deductible for federal income tax purposes.the additional criterion that the expense not exceed the expenses before disability began is inapplicable to this discussion,as we explain in part iv,below.
in calculating fortier predisability earnings,the administrator used predisability business expenses that fortier deducted on his federal income tax returns for the tax years and.she concluded that all the attributes described in the policies definition of predisability business expenses,even though stated distinctly,are in substance no more than relevant restatements of the attributes that make the expenses deductible for tax purposes.therefore,she used the business expenses claimed by fortier on his tax returns in her calculations.the attributes given in the policy to predisability business expenses that they be usual and customary,incurred on a regular basis,and essential to the established business operation merely expressed,as the administrator concluded,attributes of expenses that have traditionally been considered in determining deductibility under a.section a allows taxpayers to deduct all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.the administrator thus noted that there is a clear nexus between the ordinary and necessary language contained in a and the various phrases contained in subsection b of the policies definition of monthly earnings.
fortier argues reasonably that because business expenses for purposes of the policies calculations must meet both the criterion of being deductible under the internal revenue code and the other criteria stated separately in subsection b,the other separately stated criteria must be further limitations,distinguishing expenses deductible for tax purposes from business expenses defined in the policies for determining monthly earnings.
it is not clear why the policies chose to add the first three criteria usual and customary,incurred on a regular basis,and essential to the established business operation when the phrase deductible for federal income tax purposes could arguably be the only one needed to accomplish the policies purposes under the administrator interpretation.the overall policy language,however,taken in context,would seem to permit the administrator reasonably to conclude that the policies definition of business expenses should be read in light of a.this conclusion is indicated by two significant references in the policies language to the internal revenue code.
first,monthly earnings as used in the policies must be based on data reported by fortier on his federal income tax returns.this overarching requirement in the policies would seem to be vital to any disability plan interested in using accurate data because a taxpayer incentives are to reduce his income by deducting all legitimate business expenses from gross income.thus,by defining predisability expenses in terms of tax reported data,the policies can expect greater accuracy when determining predisability income.this prefatory restriction in the definition of predisability earnings accordingly supports the administrator conclusion that there is a clear nexus between the criteria for reporting income and expenses on tax returns and the criteria for defining income and expenses under the group policies.
the second reference to federal income tax criteria in the policies is provided in subsection b,which includes,as part of the definition of business expenses,those expenses that are deductible for federal income tax purposes.neither party has conducted an analysis of the internal revenue code to determine whether there are deductible business expenses that would not meet the other criteria set forth in subsection b of the policies.principal life nonetheless contends that the other criteria in subsection b are merely reiterations of the relevant criteria for federal tax deductibility,providing example restrictions or clarifications of what was intended in the policies.
this is not an irrational position.for example,the internal revenue code provides that to be deductible,a business expense must be ordinary and necessary.the supreme court has construed ordinary to be synonymous with normal,usual,or customary terms that the disability policies also use.see deputy du pont.see also danville plywood united states.
in the same vein,the administrator could conclude that the word essential,as contained in the policies,is a synonym of the tax term necessary.see merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed defining essential in relevant part,as of the utmost importance basic,indispensible,necessary noland comm r,cir t hat expense which is essential to the continuance of an individual employment is deductible.
while fortier does not take real issue with the comparison of necessary and essential,he does note that the policy requires that an expense be essential to the established business operation of the policyholder.because the expenses incurred by him in and were in large part expenses for his new medical practice,he argues that the term established restricts the expenses that may be used in determining predisability earnings.while this argument is not at all unreasonable,it was nonetheless also reasonable for the administrator to have concluded that the entire phrase reiterates the requirement of a that business expenses be necessary in carrying on any trade or business and that the word established merely functions to underscore that not every and endeavor constitutes a trade or business t o be engaged in a trade or business,the taxpayer must be involved in the activity with continuity and regularity.comm r groetzinger,d.
finally,the policies requirement that expenses be incurred on a regular basis can be construed to restate the requirements of a inasmuch as the term regular,even though having several possible meanings,does include the meaning ordinary.while the phrase on a regular basis might,at first blush,be thought to mean at regular intervals and repeatedly,as fortier claims,it can also mean regularly incurred,which more readily could be taken to mean ordinarily incurred.see garner dictionary of legal usage ed noting that updated on a regular basis is grammatically identical to regularly updated see also the random house dictionary of the english language ed defining regular and regularly to include both at regular times or intervals or simply usually or ordinarily.it is significant to observe that were fortier interpretation of on a regular basis to be adopted by the administrator,it could become virtually impossible to distinguish includable and excludable expenses.for instance,if fortier were to use a light bulb in his business that had a life,would the expense for that light bulb be incurred on a regular basis as he uses the term,repeatedly or if fortier purchased a permanent piece of equipment that he was amortizing over the period of,say,seven years,would the purchase be excludable as not incurred on a regular basis,even though he claimed a deduction for a portion of the equipment cost each year 
even though the administrator interpretation probably renders much of subsection b definition of business expenses repetitive and superfluous,it is nonetheless,if not the best,at least a reasonable solution to an interpretive dilemma.for example,it is unavoidable to conclude that the phrase usual and customary does not have a distinct meaning from a ordinary and necessary,or that essential does not have a distinct meaning from necessary.and if that is true,then the other phrases,while not tied as closely to the internal revenue code,would have to be subjected to some test to determine whether they are to be given independent meaning while usual and customary and essential would not be given an independent meaning.with the various phrases thus being subject to amorphous tests to resolve their multiple meanings,we can not conclude that principal life take on the policy was an unreasonable one.
because the policy entrusts principal life with complete discretion to resolve ambiguities and to determine benefits,we will respect its reasonable interpretation of the language when calculating fortier predisability earnings.
fortier contends additionally that principal life interpretation is erroneous based on the last clause in subsection b of the policies definition of business expenses,which provides that business expenses deducted from predisability income must not exceed the expenses before disability began.
this argument,however,provides fortier with no assistance because it is readily apparent that both the meaning and context of the clause make it inapplicable to the circumstances of this case.first,it makes no sense to ask whether predisability expenses exceed the expenses before disability began.such a statement is meaningless and contributes nothing to the discussion.read in context,it is apparent that the clause is a part of the definition of monthly earnings used for other purposes in the policies.the monthly earnings definition is textually applied to define both current earnings and predisability earnings.but current earnings are relevant only to the determination of benefits for a member who is working during a period of disability,which is not fortier circumstance.in such a case the member monthly earnings are determined by looking at his gross revenue and deducting those expenses that satisfy the other criteria of business expenses as well as the criterion that those expenses,while the member is working,do not exceed the expenses before disability began.thus,the limitation imposed by the last clause of subsection b obviously applies only when determining current earnings,an issue not relevant to the case before us.
because we conclude that principal life denial of fortier claims for and disability benefits was based on a reasonable reading of principal life disability policies,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
