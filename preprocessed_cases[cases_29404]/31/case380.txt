opinion of the court 
this is an appeal by orrin skretvedt,a former employee of defendant du pont de nemours company dupont,from the order of the district court granting summary judgment for dupont on skretvedt suit alleging that dupont had denied his claim for disability benefits under its pension and benefits plans in violation of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse.
the appeal first presents several questions about our scope of review,which we resolve in favor of applying the arbitrary and capricious standard prevalent in erisa cases.we do not find the exceptions to that standard applicable here.most significantly,we do not think the fact that dupont associate medical director was involved in evaluating skretvedt claim both during the initial determination and on appeal creates a procedural impropriety that heightens the standard of review.
despite the demanding arbitrary and capricious test,we conclude that the medical evidence of stress that skretvedt presented clearly demonstrates that he is eligible for disability benefits under dupont incapability retirement pension plan,one of the forms of disability benefits that he claims.although we take the evidence in the light most favorable to dupont,we are not convinced by dupont arguments that the medical evidence was inconclusive or equivocal with respect to the severity or permanence of skretvedt incapability to perform successfully the duties of his position.indeed,dupont can point to no truly conflicting medical evidence.dupont decision was without reason,and it was unsupported by substantial evidence.pinto reliance standard life ins,cir quoting abnathya roche,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it was therefore arbitrary and capricious,requiring us to reverse the grant of summary judgment and to direct that summary judgment be entered on the incapability retirement claim in favor of skretvedt.
facts and procedural history 
skretvedt worked as an environmental engineer for dupont from june,until february,when he was discharged.at that time,skretvedt held the position of senior research environmental engineer at dupont spruance plant in richmond,virginia.among other things,he was responsible for ensuring that the plant complied with federal environmental regulations.skretvedt job responsibilities and the pressures associated with them increased significantly in when certain regulations under the clean air act went into effect and the department where he worked was simultaneously downsized.
in early,skretvedt began receiving treatments for anxiety from his family physician,harold binhammer,who periodically prescribed to him the drug lorazepam.skretvedt took a leave of absence from his job at the spruance plant beginning on november,and did not return to work at dupont thereafter in november,binhammer diagnosed skretvedt with depression,prescribed the antidepressant paxil and referred him to a psychiatrist,graenum schiff,schiff saw skretvedt periodically beginning in november.schiff put skretvedt on a regular daily dose of twenty milligrams of paxil and referred him for therapy with teresa buczek,a clinical psychologist who specializes in stress disorders.
on december,james layton,the medical supervisor at the spruance plant,wrote to binhammer,schiff and buczek,requesting that they complete medical report forms to help him prepare a written opinion on whether skretvedt condition qualified him for disability benefits under dupont pension plan.all three doctors responded to layton request,giving their diagnoses and medical opinions of the severity and likely duration of skretvedt condition.we describe these opinions in greater detail below.
dupont fired skretvedt on february,citing the incident in which he was accused of taking home a company fax machine without permission as the reason for the discharge.see supra note.skretvedt filed a claim with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that dupont violated the americans with disabilities act ada by discriminating against him based on his anxiety disorder.the eeoc found no violation of the ada based on the information that skretvedt submitted,and issued him a letter.by september,skretvedt had contacted an attorney regarding his ada and disability benefits claims.on september,skretvedt,acting on the advice of counsel,signed a settlement agreement and release of all claims with dupont.under this agreement,skretvedt released all of his claims against dupont except for his application for disability benefits,which dupont agreed to review in a neutral manner.
dupont pension plan provides two different disability benefits the incapability retirement pension incapability benefits and the total and permanent disability income plan t p benefits.an employee is eligible for incapability benefits if he is permanently incapable of performing the duties of his position with the degree of efficiency required by the company,and he has at least years of service.under its separate t p benefits plan,dupont provides additional benefits to individuals who are disabled by injuries or disease and presumably will be totally and permanently prevented from pursuing any gainful occupation.at all times relevant to this litigation,it was the practice of dupont board of benefits and pensions board,which was responsible for administering both disability benefits plans,to first determine whether an employee qualified for incapability benefits if so,the board would determine whether the employee also qualified for t p benefits.
following the september,settlement agreement,the board reviewed skretvedt claims for disability benefits.the board considered the medical evidence that dupont layton had collected from skretvedt treating physicians and psychologist as well as a medical opinion from layton himself,and determined that skretvedt was not eligible for either type of disability benefits.on may,the board denied skretvedt application for both incapability and t p benefits and issued a form letter denying his benefits claims.the letter stated that skretvedt had failed to show that he was permanently incapable of performing the duties of his job with the degree of efficiency required by the company,at the time of his termination.it also advised him that in order to succeed on his appeal he would need to submit additional objective evidence that will indicate a total impairment of function.the letter provided examples of such objective evidence,including tests such as mri,reports and complete medical evaluations,but warned that o pinions of healthcare providers are not sufficient without objective medical evidence to support such opinions.
skretvedt contends that he and binhammer sent three letters to the board designated contact for appeals,requesting clarification of the types of objective medical evidence needed to perfect his application on appeal in light of the fact that his claimed disability is psychological after receiving no response for almost a year,skretvedt formally submitted his appeal to the board on may.he included with his application updated letters from the doctors who had examined him prior to his initial application,as well as letters and evaluation forms from other doctors.after hearing nothing from the board for more than three more months,skretvedt wrote to dupont inquiring about the status of his appeal.he received no immediate response.
having received no response from the board,skretvedt initiated the present lawsuit by filing a complaint on february,invoking a b,which allows a beneficiary of an benefits plan to sue for benefits due to him under the terms of the plan.skretvedt alleged that dupont pension and benefits review board had violated erisa by arbitrarily and capriciously denying him disability benefits,by acting in bad faith,and by operating under a conflict of interest.the parties entered into a stipulation agreeing to stay the proceedings until october,pending a final decision by the board on skretvedt appeal for disability benefits.the parties also stipulated that the board decision on skretvedt appeal would be the only decision for the purpose of judicial review of the denial of benefits.
following the october,stipulation,skretvedt resubmitted the materials that he had included in his initial appeal application as well as additional materials.these included updated opinion letters from binhammer and schiff,and a psychological evaluation report and opinion letter from richard zonderman,a licensed clinical psychologist who had performed some standardized psychological tests on skretvedt.all of these physicians and psychologists concluded that skretvedt was unable to return to his previous job at dupont.skretvedt also submitted the explanation of determination that he received from the social security administration following the denial of an application that he had filed for social security disability benefits.the explanation concluded that skretvedt condition prevents him from doing the type of work that he has done in the past,but that he did not qualify for social security disability benefits because his disability does not prevent him from doing less demanding work that does not require extensive public contact.
skretvedt held two different jobs during the period following his termination from dupont.in the spring of,he established his own furniture repair and refinishing business.the business earned a modest profit in,but lost money in,and skretvedt was forced to seek other employment.beginning in may,skretvedt took a job with the virginia department of labor as a compliance inspector.the position involved a training period,during which his job responsibilities gradually increased.skretvedt anxiety and depression increased in as his training period ended.as a result,schiff recommended that skretvedt take a medical leave of absence beginning on august.skretvedt has since resigned from his position at the virginia department of labor.
the board finally denied skretvedt appeal for disability benefits on october.following the board final decision,discovery in the present suit proceeded,after which the parties filed for summary judgment.acting pursuant to,a magistrate judge reviewed the motions and recommended that the district court grant dupont motion for summary judgment and deny skretvedt.the district court approved the report and issued the recommended orders.skretvedt now appeals.the district court had jurisdiction based on and,and we have jurisdiction under.
we exercise plenary review over a district court grant of summary judgment.see pi lambda phi fraternity,of pittsburgh,cir.the familiar standards that we apply when reviewing motions for summary judgment are set forth in the margin 
ii.standard of judicial review of the board decision 
skretvedt argues that the district court erred by reviewing the board denial of his disability benefits under the arbitrary and capricious standard,and that it should have applied a heightened standard of review due to the structural conflicts of interest and procedural irregularities in dupont pension benefits review system.in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the supreme court addressed the appropriate standard of review for courts to apply when reviewing an employer denial of a benefit under an plan.drawing on principles of trust law,the court held that where,as here,an employer pension plan gives discretion to a plan administrator or fiduciary to interpret the plan and make benefits determinations,a deferential standard of judicial review is appropriate.id.at.when reviewing the denial of pension benefits under erisa where the pension plan commits discretion to the fiduciary,we have employed,as bruch directs,the arbitrary and capricious standard.see,keating whitmore,cir.a court reviewing a benefits denial under the arbitrary and capricious standard must defer to the plan administrator unless the administrator decision was without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence,or erroneous as a matter of law.pinto reliance standard life ins,quoting abnathya roche,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in bruch,the court also went on to state that if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.at.quotation marks and citation omitted.interpreting this language,we have held that even when a pension plan commits discretion to a fiduciary or plan administrator,a reviewing court should apply a heightened standard of review either when the plan,by its very design,creates a special danger of a conflict of interest,or when the beneficiary can point to evidence of specific facts calling the impartiality of the administrator into question.goldstein johnson johnson,cir citing pinto,at.
in pinto,we specifically identified two conditions that indicate a special danger of a conflict of interest that would warrant applying a heightened standard of review.these are when a pension plan is unfunded,not actuarially grounded,with the company making fixed contributions to the pension fund,at,but rather funded by the employer on a basis and when a plan is administered by an administrator outside of the employer company,such as an insurance company,that does not have strong incentives to keep employees satisfied by granting meritorious claims.id.in circumstances that warrant a heightened level of review,we have held that a court should use a approach,examining each case on its facts to determine what level of review to apply the greater the danger of a conflict of interest,the less deference the reviewing court should apply.id.
the parties do not dispute that dupont pension plan gives substantial discretion to the board to interpret the terms of the plan and to administer benefits based on these interpretations.usually,this would counsel a court to review the board decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard.skretvedt argues,however,that pinto requires us to apply a heightened standard in this case because the t p benefits at issue in this case are part of an unfunded plan and there are procedural defects in dupont pension and benefits review system 
as noted above,the board first considered skretvedt incapability claim,and finding that he did not qualify,denied his claims for both incapability benefits and for t p benefits.dupont does not make a regular actuarially determined contribution to a fund that supports the payment of benefits to employees who are totally and permanently disabled,hence the t p benefits that skretvedt applied for would be paid out of an unfunded plan.dupont incapability benefits,however,which skretvedt also applied for,are part of a funded plan.as we explain in the margin,the mere fact that the t p benefits plan is unfunded does not require applying a heightened standard of review to the denial of funded incapability benefits however,a heightened standard of review might be applicable to the board denial of skretvedt claim for the unfunded t p benefits,because of the potential conflict under pinto.because we conclude that the board reason for denying incapability benefits was arbitrary and capricious,see infra part,and because the board relied on the same reason to deny t p benefits,that denial was also arbitrary and capricious.we therefore need not decide whether a stricter standard of review is applicable to the board denial of skretvedt claim for t p benefits.
skretvedt also contends that there are defects in the structure and procedure of dupont pension and benefits review system that require us to apply a heightened level of review.these arguments focus mainly on the role that benjamin ramirez,dupont associate medical director,played in the board review of claims for disability benefits.while he was not a member of the board,ramirez was involved in evaluating applications for disability benefits at both the initial stage and at the appeal level.during the period relevant to this case,the initial determination to deny an application for disability benefits was not made by the board,but rather by two board delegates ramirez,and herbert watson,a dupont benefits administrator.if the delegates decided that the employee did not qualify for the benefits that he claimed,the employee was notified of the decision and informed that he could appeal.at the appeal level,the board which did not include ramirez or watson,would vote on whether to change the initial determination,relying in part on ramirez recommendation,which he based on his review of all of the medical evidence presented.
skretvedt argues that two features of ramirez participation in the evaluation process call into question the board impartiality in a way that counsels increasing the standard of review above arbitrary and capricious.
first,skretvedt submits that it was improper for ramirez to be involved in the evaluation process during both the initial benefits determination and the appeal.in skretvedt view,ramirez could not impartially advise the board regarding appeals from benefits denials if he made the initial determination.but under the erisa regulations in effect during the times relevant to this case,there was no requirement that the appellate even be someone different from the initial.see brown retirement comm.of briggs stratton retirement plan,cir g.therefore,ramirez roles as a in the initial proceeding and as an advisor in the appellate proceeding are not evidence of a conflict of interest that would require heightened review 
second,skretvedt contends that,as dupont associate medical director,ramirez necessarily acted as an advocate for dupont,and sought to convince the board to deny skretvedt claim on appeal.skretvedt submits that because dupont had an advocate present at the board meetings,he also should have been permitted to have a representative present.
in grossmuller international union,united automobile,aerospace agricultural implement workers of america,cir,we held that in order to give an benefits claim full and fair review as is required by erisa,a decisionmaker must allow a claimant to make his case in person or through a representative if the receives testimony from a third party in opposition to granting the claim.see id.at.subsequent cases have made it clear,however,that grossmuller extends only to the situation wherein a third party is permitted to appear at a meeting and provide factual information which the absent claimant can not refute.hlinka bethlehem steel,cir.in this case,there is no evidence that ramirez presented any factual testimony that skretvedt did not have a chance to review.ramirez gave an opinion based on his review of the medical reports from skretvedt own doctors and from dupont layton,all of which skretvedt had seen.nor is ramirez a third party as contemplated by grossmuller.
in short,there is no reason to doubt the board contention that ramirez was acting merely as an advisor to the board rather than as an advocate for dupont.therefore,the district court was correct to apply an arbitrary and capricious standard when reviewing the board denial of skretvedt claim for incapability benefits.we decline to reach the question whether a stricter standard of review is applicable to the board denial of skretvedt claim for t p benefits.
iii.the board decision to deny skretvedt claim for incapability benefits 
introduction 
the language from dupont benefits plan that governs a claimant eligibility for incapability benefits is as follows 
an employee may be retired by the company if the board of benefits and pensions finds that he has become,for any reason,permanently incapable of performing the duties of his position with the degree of efficiency required by the company,and he has at least years of service.
dupont board interprets this language to require that the claimant show that his or her incapability was permanent at the time of his or her termination.dupont presented the following interpretation to the district court t o receive an award of benefits the applicant must present evidence that he was permanently as opposed to temporarily disabled at the time of the termination and the severity of the disability at termination permanently precluded the applicant from performing the duties of his position.mem,at.the board interpretation of dupont pension and benefits plan is entitled to deference under the arbitrary and capricious standard,unless it is contrary to the plain language of the plan.see epright envt l res,cir.because dupont interpretation is consistent with the plan language,we apply it here when reviewing the board denial of skretvedt claim for incapability benefits.
the reasons that dupont now offers for denying skretvedt disability claims are that the medical evidence that he presented was not sufficient to show that his disability was permanent at the time of his termination,and that the evidence was not sufficient to show that his disability was severe enough to prevent him from performing his previous job at dupont.we find these justifications to be post hoc because they were never offered to skretvedt following the denial of his initial claim or his appeal however,we will assume arguendo that it is proper for us to consider these post hoc justifications.for the reasons that follow we nonetheless conclude that the board proffered justifications are unconvincing in light of its own interpretation of the eligibility requirements for incapability benefits and the medical evidence before it.
b.the medical evidence presented 
skretvedt submitted two sets of medical evidence to the board,one set with his initial application,and another set with his appeal.together,these two sets of medical opinions make up the entirety of the medical evidence that the board had before it when it made its decision to deny skretvedt benefits.our disposition of the case turns on whether this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that skretvedt was permanently disabled at the time of his termination and that his disability was and continues to be severe enough to prevent him from performing the duties of his position with the degree of efficiency required by dupont.
items submitted in skretvedt initial application 
the items that skretvedt submitted with his initial application included several letters from his treating physicians,graenum schiff and harold binhammer,a letter from his treating clinical psychologist,theresa buczek,and an evaluation form that james layton,the spruance plant medical director,completed in october.
skretvedt submitted an evaluation report from schiff dated november,which diagnosed him with an a djustment disorder with anxious mood and stated that he suffered from severe work stress.at the bottom there were handwritten notes explaining that,since he had been taking the antidepressant drug paxil,skretvedt was much improved.on january,however,schiff wrote to layton that although the antidepressant drug paxil was helping,skretvedt is no longer temperamentally suited to do the job he was doing at his previous level of efficiency and for this reason i would recommend early retirement.
in a letter dated january,binhammer,skretvedt family physician,explained that in november,skretvedt was in an acute state of depressive anxiety,which was ameliorated with medication and with his leave from work.binhammer concluded that skretvedt should not go back to his position as an environmental engineer because of the anxiety precipatated sic to him by this type of work and then the resultant breakdown in his psyche.at this time while not clearly definable as to the length of time,i suspect it may be permanent.
buczek,a clinical psychologist who treated skretvedt,wrote two letters to the board regarding his condition.the first,dated january,stated that skretvedt was suffering from emotional problems due to job pressure,and that i n regard to the question of whether these impairments are temporary i am still unclear.i recommend that he be considered unfit for work activity for the next days.during that time in therapy,we can better determine if he will be able to work at some other job in dupont.i do not believe that he will be able to return to his former position,and that this is a very unlikely possibility for now or the future.buczek second letter,dated january,described skretvedt symptoms in greater detail,but did not mention his fitness for work or the permanence of his condition.
finally,skretvedt submitted an evaluation that layton completed in october.the evaluation diagnosed skretvedt with an adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features,and stated prognosis guarded,to be able to return to present job assignment because of his inability to concentrate and think coherently because of stress.on the basis of the foregoing evidence,the board denied his benefits claims,stating that the medical evidence submitted does not support a conclusion that you are permanently incapable of performing the duties of an environmental engineer with the degree of efficiency required by the company in order for your appeal to be successful,you must provide additional objective evidence 
new documents submitted on skretvedt appeal 
skretvedt relates that,at this point,he and binhammer sent a total of three letters requesting clarification as to what kind of evidence they should submit on appeal.dupont denies receiving the letters.after he did not hear anything further from dupont,skretvedt attempted to get a complete set of psychological tests performed.he then submitted several new sources of medical evidence in his appeal application in addition to resubmitting the documents that he had included in his initial application 
the new documents that skretvedt submitted with his appeal application included two letters from richard zonderman,a clinical psychologist who in march performed a clinical interview and two types of standard psychological tests for skretvedt updated letters from schiff and binhammer and a letter from the social security administration denying skretvedt claim for disability insurance benefits.
the first zonderman letter describes the clinical interview and two standardized psychological tests minnesota multiphasic personality inventory,and millon clinical multiaxial inventory.based on his examination of skretvedt,zonderman concluded that skretvedt was at that time experiencing many of the same symptoms that he had complained of in and,and was suffering from a prominent anxiety disorder.zonderman went on to conclude that w hat began as a work related situation has spread and now affects all aspects of skretvedt life and that r eturn to a job resembling the environmental engineering position which caused skretvedt problems would most likely precipitate post traumatic stress like symptoms.zonderman also stated that w hatever the etiology,underlying personality features will make change difficult and protracted.in his second letter,dated july,zonderman opined that skretvedt emotional problems had been caused by his job,that some of the symptoms had been treated by doctors before skretvedt left his employment with dupont,that skretvedt was still in therapy in july with two different doctors,and that h e can not return to a similar work environment 
the first letter from schiff,dated may,explained that he was writing to supply the evidence required by the board regarding the permanence of skretvedt condition.the letter noted that schiff,buczek,and binhammer had all examined skretvedt before his termination and concurred that skretvedt would never be able to return to his position at dupont.the letter questioned the board requirement of objective evidence,such as and mris,representing that such evidence is impossible to obtain for psychiatric disabilities.schiff concluded by citing two pieces of objective proof of the permanence of skretvedt psychiatric disabilities.first,he related that when skretvedt attempted to return to a job in his old field of industrial hygiene,his job as a compliance inspector at the virginia department of labor his symptoms returned and his condition deteriorated.second,he pointed out that several specialists had examined skretvedt and had all agreed that his condition is permanent.
schiff second letter,dated july,updated the previous letter,stating that skretvedt anxiety disorder had intensified as the training program for his industrial hygiene position was drawing to a close,and that as a result,his medication had to be increased.schiff concluded that skretvedt should not be working at all.moreover,on august,soon after writing his second letter,schiff recommended that skretvedt go on a medical leave of absence.
an updated letter from binhammer,dated may,stated that,as of that date,skretvedt would respond to stress with post traumatic episodes,and that these symptoms were the same as those skretvedt was experiencing back in.the letter noted that during the time that skretvedt worked as a furniture refinisher,these episodes were less frequent because of the change of job environment,but that when skretvedt attempted to return to his old field,the symptoms returned and escalated.the letter concluded my prognosis today is the same as in,with firmer conviction.more than two years have passed and the problems have continued i think time and circumstance have proven our original prognosis for skretvedt.i continue to believe his condition is total and permanent.
finally,skretvedt submitted the letter from the social security administration denying his claim for disability insurance benefits.as discussed above,the ssa concluded that skretvedt was permanently unable to perform his previous job at dupont,but was ineligible for disability insurance benefits because he was still able to perform other work.
dupont contentions evaluated 
dupont contends that skretvedt medical evidence was inconclusive with respect to showing that his disability was severe enough to render him incapable of performing his former job at dupont and that skretvedt disability was permanent as of the time of his termination.the district court agreed.however,we find neither of these arguments convincing in the face of the persuasive and essentially unrebutted medical evidence that skretvedt presented to the board.
dupont challenges several of the pieces of medical evidence that skretvedt submitted,arguing that internal contradictions or insufficiency in certain pieces of medical evidence demonstrate that the medical documents are as a whole equivocal or inconclusive with respect to either the severity or the permanence of skretvedt disability,or both.we take these up seriatim.
documents submitted with the initial application 
dupont first challenges two evaluations that diagnosed skretvedt with an adjustment disorder,one from schiff in and one from buczek in.according to the fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders,cited by dupont,adjustment disorders are generally triggered by a stressor,and last no longer than months after the stressor or its consequences have ceased.ed.dupont argues that this treatise demonstrates that the psychiatric disorder that schiff and buczek diagnosed is not permanent.this argument overlooks the fact,however,that the dsm also states that i f the stressor or its consequences persist,the adjustment disorder may also persist.id.schiff and buczek made it clear in the documents in which they diagnosed skretvedt with an adjustment disorder that the stressor that triggered the adjustment disorder was skretvedt job at dupont.
more particularly,the narrative section of schiff medical evaluation form focused on skretvedt complaints about the stresses of his job at dupont.furthermore,buczek january,letter concluded that t his diagnosis and these symptoms appear to be related to increased job pressures and responsibilities.the relevant question with respect to skretvedt eligibility for incapability benefits is whether his disability renders him permanently incapable of doing his previous job.therefore,the dsm statement that an adjustment disorder will usually last no longer than six months after the removal of the triggering stressor does not diminish the force of the diagnosis when the stressor that the diagnosing doctors identified is skretvedt previous job.
dupont next submits that notes from schiff and a medical report from binhammer show that skretvedt medical condition improved quickly once he started treatment with the antidepressant drug paxil,and that therefore the condition is not permanent.handwritten notes at the end of schiff november,medical report indicate that skretvedt was much improved on paxil.a january,letter from binhammer also notes that skretvedt depressive medical illness had improved.but the fact that schiff notes and binhammer letter indicate that skretvedt depression improved with medication does not mean that his condition no longer rose to the level of severity that would prevent him from doing his previous job at the required degree of efficiency.
reading these statements in the context of the totality of the reports and letters in which they appear,it is clear that schiff and binhammer meant that skretvedt condition had improved,not that it had improved to a point where he was capable of performing his previous job at dupont.for example,in the same letter in which binhammer wrote that medication and therapy had improved skretvedt depression,he also wrote that skretvedt should not go back to his position as an environmental engineer because of the anxiety precipatated sic to him by this type of work and then the resultant breakdown in his psyche.
dupont also points to the statements that buczek made about the permanence of skretvedt condition in the materials that skretvedt submitted with his initial application for disability benefits.specifically,dupont cites a recommendation that buczek made in her january,skretvedt should be considered unfit for work activity for the next days and that he should be reevaluated at that time.however,the next sentence in buczek letter makes it clear that while she held out hopes that skretvedt might at that time be able to work at some other job at dupont,she did not believe that he w ould be able to return to his former position.
b.the period from to 
dupont submits that two different aspects of the evidence presented regarding skretvedt condition during the period from to show that the evidence is equivocal and that therefore the board denial of disability benefits was reasonable.
dupont first contends that skretvedt failure to present evidence that he received treatment from february through march shows that his condition was either insufficiently severe or that it was temporary.but skretvedt failure to present evidence that he was treated during this period does not mean,as dupont suggests,that treatments were suspended because the disability no longer existed.such an inference is unreasonable in light of the statement of layton,the spruance plant medical director,that as of october,skretvedt told him that he had stopped receiving treatment from schiff and buczek because of the expense.skretvedt attorney confirmed at argument that skretvedt had no health insurance during much of the period from to and was unable to pay for treatments.
dupont next argues that the fact that skretvedt held a job at the virginia department of labor during the period from to that was generally in the same field as his job at dupont shows either that his condition was not so severe that it would have prevented him from doing his old job at dupont,or that the condition was not permanent,it had improved enough for him to take a position similar to the one he held at dupont.the circumstances surrounding skretvedt job at the virginia department of labor,however,demonstrate otherwise.
motivated by financial necessity,skretvedt abandoned his furniture refinishing business,and took what was,according to a letter from binhammer,an position as a compliance inspector with the virginia department of labor.both schiff and binhammer opined that skretvedt job as a compliance inspector had made his psychological condition as bad or worse than it was during the last year of his employment at dupont.schiff wrote that a s the end of the training approached and full responsibilities were assumed,he experienced a serious escalation in symptoms.similarly,describing skretvedt job at the department of labor,binhammer concluded that when skretvedt returned to even a similar work situation to his job at dupont,the condition returned with even more severity.given these descriptions of the return of skretvedt symptoms,the fact that skretvedt worked for a time in an position at the virginia department of labor that was generally in the same field as his previous job at dupont does not rebut or render inconclusive the medical evidence of his permanent inability to do his previous job at dupont.
documents submitted to the board for the first time in the appeal application 
dupont argues that the report from zonderman contains only general,conclusory statements,and could be interpreted as stating only that current stressors in skretvedt life in were causing his illness.in addition,dupont contends that zonderman diagnosis that skretvedt suffered from an axis i disorder of major depression,single episode,moderate chronic,indicates that the condition is not permanent.zonderman report,however,also diagnosed skretvedt with a psychological syndrome that it described as a longstanding behavioral pattern,and recommended that skretvedt receive immediate treatment with both drugs and psychotherapy.in a letter dated july,zonderman indicated that he had been treating skretvedt since his initial evaluation,and that he continued to show symptoms of stress disorder.
dupont also challenges the sufficiency of schiff and zonderman letters from and,asserting that they are conclusory and that they do not provide conclusions as to whether skretvedt condition is treatable or permanent,or whether it existed at the time of his termination.we are unpersuaded.these brief letters were merely introduced to update letters written earlier,which do state case dispositive conclusions.schiff earlier letter specified his opinion that skretvedt condition was permanent.zonderman,in his letter,specifically stated that all of the problems began during skretvedt dupont employment.
dupont standard for eligibility to the medical evidence 
the question that the board faced when reviewing skretvedt appeal application was whether in light of all the medical evidence presented,he demonstrated that he was permanently disabled at the time of the termination and that the severity of the disability at termination permanently precluded him from performing the duties of his position.mem,at.the dispositive question is whether,applying the board interpretation of dupont benefits plan and taking the evidence in the light most favorable to dupont,the board denial of skretvedt claim for incapability benefits was arbitrary or capricious,whether it was without reason or unsupported by substantial evidence.pinto,at quoting abnathya roche,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in light of the foregoing medical evidence,we conclude that even under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,dupont denial of skretvedt incapability benefits claim must be rejected because it was unsupported by substantial evidence.the medical evidence provides clear support for all three of the elements of the eligibility requirements for incapability benefits as dupont defines them.it shows that skretvedt had a psychological disability that is severe enough to prevent him from performing his previous job at the required level of efficiency is permanent and existed as of the date of his termination.indeed,the medical experts who examined skretvedt concluded unanimously that his psychological condition was severe enough to prevent him from performing the duties of his position with the degree of efficiency required by dupont.while in and some of the doctors expressed uncertainty about the duration for which skretvedt would be required to forego all work,all concluded that he could not return to his old job.
moreover,the statements of skretvedt examining physicians and the supplemental medical report and letter from zonderman confirm their initial opinions that skretvedt psychological disability is permanent.in these documents,all of the doctors who submitted evaluations for skretvedt initial application reaffirmed their conclusion that he is not capable of performing his old job at dupont,lending support to their previous conclusions that the condition is permanent.zonderman evaluation reached the same conclusion,and linked skretvedt psychological condition to the stresses that he faced at work at d
