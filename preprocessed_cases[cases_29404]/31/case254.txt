in this case brought pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et seq,appellants challenge empire blue cross and blue shield empire reduction in life insurance benefits to former employees who retired after january.our decision in kunkel empire blue cross and blue shield,cir,also issued today,concerned a similar challenge to this same reduction.in kunkel,we vacated the district court grant of summary judgment to empire,principally concluding that the district court had applied the wrong standard to the retirees claim that their life insurance benefits had vested pursuant to an alleged promise by empire,and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.we issue a separate opinion in this case because these appellants base their claims for life insurance benefits on different documents.
for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the summary judgment and remand appellants claims in part,and affirm the grant of summary judgment in part.
background 
the sixteen appellants are former empire employees who retired between and.six of the retirees retired from empire pursuant to an early incentive program offered in,known as the voluntary separation opportunity program vsop two of the appellants retired from empire pursuant to a similar program offered in,known as the voluntary incentive program vip some of the remaining appellants retired in the normal course,not pursuant to any early retirement incentive program.others retired pursuant to a separation agreement and general release.
as in kunkel,we set forth in some detail the language of the documents issued by empire which describe the life insurance benefits.
in,empire created and distributed an employee handbook,entitled your handbook,which included a summary plan description the spd of empire group life insurance benefits.for retirees,this plan provided life insurance coverage at an amount equal to one annual salary at retirement,provided at no cost to the retiree.specifically,the plan stated that 
if you retire at age or older with or more years of service or at age or older with or more years of service or at any age,with or more years of service,your basic life insurance will be reduced by as of your retirement date,and by an equal amount on each of the next four anniversaries of your retirement date so that of your life insurance coverage remains in force for the rest of your life,at no cost to you.
at emphasis added.the last sentence on the last page of this document informs employees that o ther important information about their group life insurance plan and its administration can be found in the section entitled benefit administration.at.contained in the benefit administration section is the following statement 
empire blue cross and blue shield maintains the plans for the exclusive benefits sic of its employees.the company expects and intends to continue the plans in your benefits program indefinitely,but reserves its right to end each of the plans,if necessary.the company also reserves its right to amend each of the plans at any time.
at the reservation of rights clause.
in,empire introduced the vsop,a voluntary workforce reduction program.in connection with this program,empire distributed materials outlining eligibility and program benefits.participation in this program required eligible employees to voluntarily resign from empire in exchange for certain benefits.at.these certain benefits included life insurance coverage,on substantially the same terms as provided in empire earlier plans.while the vsop description of health insurance benefits included an explicit reservation of empire right to adjust coverage,the description of life insurance benefits did not.in the administration section of these materials,however,empire reserve d the right to amend terminate the vso program at any time for any purpose.at.this section also warned that empire may or may not adopt new or modified programs or benefits or take other actions in the future that,depending on your individual circumstances,may be more or less advantageous to you than the current program.id.
in,empire offered the vip,another early retirement incentive program similar to the vsop.vip documents informed employees that y our insurance benefits may be extended to you for your lifetime,depending on your age and years of service.you will be eligible for retiree insurance benefits if you normally qualify or if you would qualify by adding five years to your age and five years to your service under the vip.at.the vip provided for life insurance benefits virtually identical to those described in earlier plans that is,benefits reduced by on retirement and for four subsequent years,until reaching one annual salary.like the vsop materials,the vip healthcare insurance description contained a reservation of rights,but the description of life insurance benefits did not.the vip administration section included the following language 
empire reserves the right to amend withdraw the vip at any time for any purpose with respect to any employee,up to the date on which that employee resignation and general release and covenant not to sue becomes effective.empire also reserves the right to announce new and different plans and programs as business needs require.
the separation agreement and general release entered into by certain appellants provided that empire reserves the right to change or eliminate,at any time,these retiree medical and life insurance benefits.at.it further provided that t his separation agreement and release constitutes the sole and complete understanding between the parties.at.
three of the normal retirees received a letter upon retirement which described the retirement life insurance benefits 
the life insurance that you have under our group program will also be continued.you are presently insured for two times your annual salary at retirement.this amount will be reduced by on your retirement date,and will continue to be reduced by of the original face value during the next four anniversaries of your retirement,until it reaches your annual salary where it will remain constant subject to the disclaimer below.
at.the disclaimer stated that empire retains sole discretion to modify or terminate each of the benefits described above at anytime.at.
on june,empire distributed a letter which informed retirees that the board of directors voted to adopt a number of new benefit provisions for current employees,retirees and disabled,that will go into effect january.at.these new provisions were necessary,the letter explained,for empire to distinguish itself in the complex world of health care and to bring empire into line with its business competitors.at.the letter attached a summary of benefits changes,which announced that l ife insurance will be provided at a flat for those retirees who retired between january,and prior to june.at.
several appellants wrote to empire,expressing their discontent with these changes and demanding an explanation.in response,empire explained that the costs of maintaining retiree benefits at their previous levels had become prohibitive.at.additionally,in response to some of the other retirees letters,empire cited to the reservation of rights clause included in your handbook.at.
plaintiffs filed their complaint in april in the southern district of new york.their amended complaint alleged seven claims challenging empire reduction in life insurance benefits for these retirees.the first two claims sought to enforce the terms of the life insurance plan and to recover benefits due under the plan terms under erisa a,a.the third,fourth,and seventh claims contended that empire breached its fiduciary duties under erisa a,a.appellants fifth claim contended that empire was barred from reducing their life insurance benefits by the doctrine of promissory estoppel.finally,appellants asserted a claim for penalties under erisa c,c,due to empire alleged failure to provide timely plan information upon request.
the parties filed for summary judgment.on october,the district court issued its opinion and order denying plaintiffs motion and granting summary judgment to empire.abbruscato empire blue cross and blue shield,civ.bsj,wl,at.the district court rejected plaintiffs reliance on informal communications as evidence of their contractual vesting claim,and concluded that the relevant plan documents,including the spd as well as the vsop and vip documents,clearly informed plaintiffs that empire could modify or terminate the benefits.id.at.the district court rejected plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty and penalty claims by reference to its discussion in byrnes empire blue cross and blue shield,civ.bsj,wl,at.abbruscato,wl,at.with respect to plaintiffs promissory estoppel claim,the district court concluded that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate either the basic elements of promissory estoppel or that there were extraordinary circumstances,as required in erisa cases.id.at.
we review the grant of a summary judgment motion de novo,and reversal is required if there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.schonholz long island jewish med,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
this appeal followed,and oral argument was heard in tandem with kunkel.
ii.discussion 
appellants contend that empire contractually promised to vest life insurance benefits through the relevant plan documents,retirement letters,empire position in an unemployment administrative proceeding,and informal communications.appellants also assert a claim under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.finally,appellants contend,as an alternative to their contractual vesting claim,empire breached its fiduciary duties under erisa by making misleading statements concerning the retirees life insurance benefits 
contractual vesting 
because the essence of the appellants contractual vesting claim is identical to that asserted in kunkel,we repeat below the standards set forth in that case 
plaintiffs claim under erisa a b,a b,which permits a civil action by a plan participant to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.essentially,plaintiffs assert under this section a contractual right under a benefit plan.strom goldman,sachs,cir.
erisa does not create any substantive entitlement to health benefits or any other kind of welfare benefits.employers or other plan sponsors are generally free under erisa,for any reason at any time,to adopt,modify,or terminate welfare plans.schoonejongen,d see also joyce,cir stating the general rule that under erisa an employer welfare plan is not vested and that an employer has the right to terminate or unilaterally amend the plan at any time i f a plan document unambiguously indicates whether retiree benefits are vested,the unambiguous language should be enforced.am.fed of grain millers,int l multifoods,cir multifoods.thus,even though empire is generally free to modify its life insurance plan,if empire promised vested benefits,those benefits will be enforced.
kunkel,at.in this circuit,to avoid summary judgment on an erisa contractual vesting claim,plaintiffs need only identify specific written language that is reasonably susceptible to interpretation as a promise.joyce,cir.
these appellants,unlike those in kunkel,do not urge us to review the spds issued by empire in search of this language.instead,these appellants contend that the spd contained in your handbook,the vsop and vip documents,retirement letters,and empire representations in the context of unemployment benefits proceedings in new york state courts all demonstrate that empire promised to vest life insurance benefits at the level stated upon retirement.
the vsop and vip retirees 
appellants quote the vsop and vip language at length in support of their contractual vesting claim,emphasizing that both programs materials include a reservation of rights clause within its health insurance description but not within its life insurance description.additionally,both documents describe life insurance benefits as a lifetime benefit.the vsop description states if you have at least years of vested service in the pension plan and your age plus completed years of service equal or more,you are eligible for lifetime health insurance and life insurance coverage at.the vip description states your insurance benefits may be extended to you for your lifetime or may be provided for an additional six months,depending on your age and years of service.you will be eligible for retiree insurance benefits if you normally qualify or if you would qualify by adding five years to your age and five years to your service under the vip.at.we believe that both statements are reasonably capable of being interpreted to provide a vested lifetime life insurance benefit at the level described in the materials,so long as the vsop or vip retiree met the age and years of service qualifications.
the district court concluded that both the vsop and the vip materials contained a reservation of rights clause which effectively prevented any life insurance coverage from vesting.abbruscato,wl,at.we disagree.the vsop provides that empire reserves the right to amend terminate the vso program at any time for any purpose.the corporation also reserves the right to announce new and different plans and programs as business needs require,although there are no plans to do so at this time.at emphasis added.we do not believe that this statement unambiguously reserves empire right to reduce the life insurance benefits provided by the vsop.instead,this language is capable of being interpreted to mean that empire merely reserved the right to change the program for those individuals who have not already retired under the terms described,not the right to alter the described benefits for those individuals who had retired under those terms.
the vip document purported reservation of rights is even less compelling.that document states empire reserves the right to amend withdraw the vip at any time for any purpose with respect to any employee,up to the date on which that employee resignation and general release and covenant not to sue becomes effective.empire also reserves the right to announce new and different plans and programs as business needs require.at emphasis added.by its own terms,empire purported right to amend the vip expired for these retirees.further,empire ability to announce new and different plans in the future does not affect the terms under which these appellants retired.
because the statements in the vsop and vip describing the lifetime benefits are susceptible to interpretation as a promise of vested benefits,and because neither the vsop nor the vip contain unambiguous reservation of rights clauses,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to empire and remand for further proceedings.additionally,because we conclude that the vsop and vip documents are ambiguous,we instruct the district court to allow the parties to present extrinsic evidence concerning the meaning of these ambiguous provisions.see kunkel,at citing bidlack wheelabrator,cir en banc posner.
the normal retirees 
in contrast to the vip and vsop documents,we conclude that the spd does not contain any ambiguity.those appellants who retired in normal course claim that their life insurance vested pursuant to language included in the spd,which provided that their life insurance in the amount of their annual salary at retirement remains in force for the rest of their li ves,at no cost to them.at.as noted above,however,the same spd albeit in a different section of the spd included a reservation of rights clause,which stated the company expects and intends to continue the plans in your benefits program indefinitely,but reserves its right to end each of the plans,if necessary.the company also reserves its right to amend each of the plans at any time.at emphasis added.additionally,the introduction to the handbook containing the life insurance plan provided that empire expect s to continue the policies and benefits described here but,it might someday have to change some of them or introduce new ones.at.
the district court concluded that,bec
