bruce barton appeals from the district court judgment concluding that the adt security services pension plan administrator did not abuse its discretion in denying barton request for pension benefits.because the district court did not have the benefit of our analysis regarding the burden of proof in a case such as this,we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
barton employment history 
the parties dispute bruce barton employment history with the american district telegraph company adt its affiliates entities.barton asserts that he worked for adt from november until he resigned in september.the parties agree that he also worked for a moving company for a short period in and served in the marine reserves from 
the three named defendants in this case adt security services pension plan pension plan,tyco international management company plan sponsor,and tyco international management company,llc administrative committee plan administrator maintain that they have access to the pension records passed on by adt,which tyco acquired in.
relevant pension plans 
because barton employment spanned eighteen years,two different plans govern his eligibility for a pension benefit the plan in effect january,plan and the plan in effect january,plan.under the terms of the plan,the plan governs barton service through december,and the plan governs his service as of january.barton maintains that his right to a pension vested because,although he stopped working before normal retirement age,he completed at least ten years of continuous service with the company.
the plan defines company as american district telegraph company and such of its affiliated companies as have adopted the plan and have been admitted to participation therein by the board or any one or more of them,and any corporation succeeding to the rights and assuming the obligations of any such company.an affiliated company is a company which is a member of a controlled group of corporations of which the american district telegraph company is also a member.the plan defines company as the american district telegraph company and those controlled companies authorized by the board of directors to participate in the plan.
the plan defines continuous service as follows.for employment through december,continuous service shall be that service determined under the terms of the plan as it was constituted on december.after january,o ne year of continuous service shall be recorded for any plan year during which an employee has or more hours of service.a plan year in which an employee works hours or less is considered a break in service.additionally,to the extent required by erisa or determined by the board of directors,if an employee transfers to a participating company from an affiliated company after january,he will receive credit for his continuous service to that affiliate prior to,even if the affiliate had not adopted the plan.
the plan does not define continuous employment,save for the following provision regarding absence without pay 
any absence from the service without pay shall be considered as a break in the continuity of service,and persons after such a break shall be considered as new employees and the term of employment reckoned from the date of such except that any such person reemployed for at least ten continuous years after such a break shall have his term of employment reckoned from the date of his initial employment less the entire period of such break.
barton request for pension benefits 
in,barton reached age and contacted the pension record keeper about benefits.a december,letter from a pension benefit administrator in response stated that the administrator could not find any information on barton employment with adt security services,and enclosed instructions for navigating the pension claim procedure.barton then provided documentation regarding his employment with entities.in a june,letter,the pension record keeper said the documents barton had sent failed to establish that he had a vested pension,and that if barton had additional documentation for example,a letter of vested benefits he could file a claim with the employee benefits committee.in response to a telephone inquiry,barton was again informed that he was ineligible for a pension benefit.
barton filed a claim with the committee on october.he stated that two former colleagues from the adt office in portland,maine had provided similar documentation and received adt pensions.he included copies of correspondence from the pension record keeper and the following documents 
november,letter from carey,president of adt,on adt letterhead listing an address of one world trade center,suite,ny,ny,addressed to barton,american district telegraph company at the same world trade center address and suite.the letter congratulates barton on his completion,on november,of ten years of service as a member of the adt organization.

w statements from and,listing employer as american district telegraph at world trade center,ny,and showing an x marking the pension plan box.
pay stubs from and listing american district telegraph at the bottom.
personnel data maintenance forms from,and listing barton current annual salary,raise,and new annual salary.

committee denial of barton claim 
the committee denied barton claim on january.it reported that it had reviewed the documents listed above as well as the following documents that barton had provided earlier 
barton september,resignation letter on adt letterhead.
september,memorandum on adt letterhead confirming receipt of a credit card,tools,and company truck.
barton september,exit interview questionnaire that listed a november,date of employment.
handwritten telephone conversation record describing barton july,call to the pension record keeper.
the committee detailed the relevant plan provisions and wrote 
t here are no plan records indicating your eligibility for participation in the plan,your actual participation in the plan,or your eligibility for benefits under the plan.in addition,it was unclear from the information you provided whether you had a continuous term of employment or earned the required service to earn at least years of continuous service so as to be vested in a plan benefit.
the committee further explained that it was not clear based on the information that barton provided that he met the terms of continuous employment.in particular,the committee noted that the fica records and w did not cover each year of claimed employment,and that some documents lacked identifying information.such information did not override or contradict the plan records.the letter detailed the appeals procedure and suggested barton could supply copies of any further evidence that would indicate that he is entitled to a plan benefit,such as certified social security records for the entire period of time from through or a pension benefit statement or written evidence that he was eligible to receive a plan benefit.
on january,barton responded and requested copies of all plan documents,records and other information affecting the claim per your document concerning applying for benefits and claim and appeal procedures.he specifically requested a tyco international summary plan description booklet,the committee copy of the social security records,an example of a pension benefit statement and written evidence statement,and application forms that should have been provided by the service center.the committee responded by letter and enclosed a memorandum prepared by outside counsel summarizing key provisions of the and plans,and the full text of the plans.nothing in the record indicates that the committee included the full summary plan description spd referenced in the memorandum drafted by outside counsel or exemplars of a pension benefit statement or written evidence statement as barton requested.
barton appeal of the committee denial 
barton appealed the committee denial on april.he presented additional fica records,broken down quarterly from when he was an hourly employee and annually from when he was a salaried employee.
the committee denied barton appeal on june.the committee again noted there was no official record of barton participation in the plan and that the documentation he submitted was insufficient to override the plan records.as with the initial denial,the appeal notice stated that i t is not clear based on the information you provided that you were continuously employed with american district telegraph company.the committee also noted that the fica records revealed that barton had worked for companies in addition to adt,which could indicate that he did not have a continuous term of employment.emphasis added.in other words,because barton could not document that he worked hours or more for each of the nearly twenty years he was employed by adt and its affiliates,or that his employers participated in the plans,he could not prove he was entitled to a pension.
procedural history 
on august,barton filed suit in the central district of california pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa.he sought declaratory relief that he was entitled to a pension pension benefits based on his employment with adt and recovery of statutory penalties under c based on the pension administrator failure to comply with erisa disclosure obligations.
after a bench trial,the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law on july.it held that the applicable standard of review was abuse of discretion and that the committee did not abuse its discretion in denying barton pension benefits.it declined to award barton statutory penalties,holding that he lacked standing to assert a violation of erisa disclosure requirements because he did not have a colorable claim to pension benefits.barton timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court choice and application of the standard of review to decisions by fiduciaries in erisa cases.we review for clear error the underlying findings of fact.abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc citation omitted.we also review de novo a district court allocation of the burden of proof.see molski foley estates vineyard winery,llc,cir citing ferrari,alvarez,olsen ottoboni home ins,cir.
burden of proof 
the district court faithfully applied our precedent in reviewing the committee denial of benefits for abuse of discretion.see abatie,at citing firestone tire rubber bruch,d.but because the district court incorrectly placed the burden of proof on barton for matters within defendants control,we remand to the district court in light of this opinion.we express no view on barton eligibility for pension benefits 
a claimant may bear the burden of proving entitlement to erisa benefits.see,muniz amec constr,cir holding that where a court reviews a plan administrator decision de novo,the claimant has the burden of proof.this rule makes sense in cases where the claimant has better or at least equal access to the evidence needed to prove entitlement.for example,where an employee must establish an illness to qualify for disability benefits,the burden lies most sensibly with the claimant,who can provide test results,physician reports,and other evidence about her condition.see,id.at holding that the claimant failed to establish he was totally disabled within the meaning of a disability insurance plan.but in other contexts,the defending entity solely controls the information that determines entitlement,leaving the claimant with no meaningful way to meet his burden of proof.this is one of those cases.
the district court placed the burden of proof on barton to establish that his various employers participated in defendants plan,and that he worked the requisite hours per year.there are two problems with this approach.first,defendants are in a far better position to ascertain whether an entity was a participating employer.after all,they determine which employers participate in the plan.indeed,both plans state that affiliates or controlled companies may only participate if the company board of directors authorizes them to do so.yet defendants asserted in the district court that they have no records indicating whether the entities identified as barton employers in the social security records were participating subsidiaries in the plan at any time.if barton has made a prima facie case that he is eligible for a pension,his claim does not fail simply because he can not initially prove whether defendants board of directors authorized his employers to participate in the plans.defendants never explain how the barton could possibly answer this question if even they have no relevant records,particularly when,during his many years of employment,the corporate were not evident from the company materials provided to barton it is illogical and unfair for us to require barton to close this gap,and the dissent points to nothing in erisa that supports such a kafkaesque regime where corporate restructuring can license a plan administrator to throw up his hands and say not my problem.
it should not greatly burden an entity to determine what companies were authorized as participating employers,so the entity,not the claimant,should bear the risk of insufficient records.see,anderson clemens pottery.when the employer has kept proper and accurate records the employee may easily discharge his burden by securing the production of those records.but where the employer records are inaccurate or inadequate and the employee can not offer convincing substitutes a more difficult problem arises.as we explained in brick masons pension trust industrial fence supply,
the records that employers are required to keep by the flsa fair labor standards act and by erisa may be the only evidence available to employees to prove that their employers have failed to compensate them in accordance with the statute.an employer can not escape liability for his failure to pay his employees the wages and benefits due to them under the law by hiding behind his failure to keep records as statutorily required.
this shift also follows naturally from erisa disclosure requirements.section c provides for the imposition of penalties on a plan administrator who has not complied with disclosure requirements.c.one such requirement,section b,mandates supplying participants with certain plan information,such as the summary plan description,annual report,or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.b.these disclosure requirements and the corresponding penalties function to ensure that an individual is duly informed of basic information relating to his pension plan 
as the legislative history bears out,the documents contemplated by b are those that allow the individual participant to know exactly where he stands with respect to the plan what benefits he may be entitled to,what circumstances may preclude him from obtaining benefits,what procedures he must follow to obtain benefits,and who are the persons to whom the management and investment of his plan funds have been entrusted.

it follows that if barton has made a prima facie case that he is entitled to pension benefits,it is properly defendants burden to clarify what entities are covered under the plans in the first instance.employers,plans,and plan administrators must know the terms and conditions of the benefits they offer and be able to identify covered employers and participating employees cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund cent,d erisa reporting and disclosure standards require benefit plans to furnish all participants with various documents informing them of their rights and obligations under the plan a task that would certainly include the duty of determining who is in fact a plan participant.citation omitted.
additionally,the district court faulted barton for not proving that he worked over hours a year for the twenty years he was employed by adt or its affiliates.but requiring barton to prove his hours over the course of two decades is unreasonable and inconsistent with the goals of erisa.that is especially so where,as here,nothing indicates that barton was warned at the start of his career that he needed to retain a log of his hours to obtain pension benefits a generation or two later.we have previously shifted the burden of proving the number of hours an employee works where the calculation of damages is uncertain due to defendants failure to keep statutorily required records.brick masons,at.
we find the reasoning of brick masons persuasive in this context.brick masons involved two wholly owned subsidiaries of one parent company.id.at.one,industrial,had a collective bargaining agreement requiring it to contribute to the union fringe benefit trust funds trust based on hours that union employees worked.id.the other,harris,was.id.the trust sued to recover contributions for hours that harris masons had worked on industrial jobs.id.it was undisputed that masons had performed work for industrial,but the trust could not prove the exact number of hours because industrial had failed to maintain certain records required under erisa.id.at.this court held that once the trust funds proved the fact of damage and industrial failure to keep adequate records,the burden shifted to industrial to come forward with evidence of the extent of covered work performed by the harris employees.id.at.industrial could not do so,and consequently was required to pay contributions for all hours that masons worked during the time period where they were shown to have performed some covered work.id.at.
the brick masons court also found support in anderson clemens pottery.there,the supreme court held that where an employer fails to keep adequate records of hours worked as required by flsa,the employee carries his burden of establishing damages if he proves that he has in fact performed work for which he was improperly compensated and if he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.at.the court reasoned that,where it was the employer duty to keep the relevant records,the employer could not complain that the related damages were inexact.id.at.
accordingly,we hold that where a claimant has made a prima facie case that he is entitled to a pension benefit but lacks access to the key information about corporate structure or hours worked needed to substantiate his claim and the defendant controls such information,the burden shifts to the defendant to produce this information assuming that barton can establish a prima facie case on remand,defendants will then bear the burden of production as to whether he worked sufficient hours for a participating employer to collect a pension.
we recognize that fiduciaries of a defined benefit pension plan have a duty to protect the pooled funds and distribute benefits only to those who qualify.see,boyd bert rozelle nfl players ret.plan,cir an erisa fiduciary is obligated to guard the assets of the plan from improper claims,as well as to pay legitimate claims.alteration in original quoting brogan holland,cir.we do not suggest that anyone can force a company to produce this corporate information by merely asserting that he is owed a pension a plaintiff must put forth objective proof.see,nigro sears,roebuck,cir a declaration does not always create a genuine issue of fact for summary judgement the district court can disregard a declaration that states only conclusions and not facts that would be admissible evidence.
where a claimant,through documentary or other objective evidence,has made a prima facie case that he is entitled to a pension but has no means except for information in the defendant control to establish that his work was for a covered employer and of sufficient duration,the burden then shifts to the defendant to produce such information.a plaintiff claiming pension benefits will often have access to at least some objective documentation of prior employment such as social security records,w statements,income tax returns,and pay stubs to make his prima facie case.motion picture indus.pension health plans audio visual supply,cir holding that the burden does not shift under brick masons where the plaintiff did not produce sufficient evidence to meet the required threshold showing.
we leave it to the district court to determine in the first instance whether barton has established a prima facie case.in doing so,it can consider the evidence available at trial,such as barton social security records,w statements,pay stubs with the pension box marked,and letter thanking him for ten years of service.
statutory penalties 
the district court correctly held that to recover statutory penalties based on a plan administrator refusal to comply with erisa disclosure obligations,a plaintiff must qualify as a plan participant.see c.thus,if barton does not set forth a colorable pension claim,he can not assert a violation of erisa disclosure requirements.see johnson buckley,cir.as this issue turns on the ultimate merits of barton claim for pension benefits,we reverse the judgment for defendants.
iii.conclusion 
this case ultimately is about burdens to qualify for his pension,must a former employee who quit working for the company more than years ago decipher the corporate structure of his former employer from documents that were not disclosed to him should he have saved all of his pay stubs in the off chance that his employer would demand proof that he met the hours requirement for obtaining a pension or should the corporate defendant bear this load erisa,our precedent,and common sense dictate that the corporate defendant should not lay that arduous task at the feet of former employees.to hold otherwise would essentially reward lucy for pulling the football away from charlie brown,something that we do not believe congress intended when it enacted erisa.see it your first kiss,charlie brown cbs television broadcast.
accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand this matter to the district court so it can apply the burden of proof in this case.
today the majority goes off the rails.its rule,apparently specially designed to let barton win on one element of his claim for benefits under an erisa plan,is not only contrary to the supreme court direction that courts should not make ad hoc exceptions to the broad abuse of discretion standard applicable in this context,conkright frommert,d,but it also does damage to our precedent and basic principles of erisa law.under the abuse of discretion review applicable to barton claim,barton must show that the plan administrator decision was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.salomaa honda long term disability plan,cir.there is no other burden of proof.and even when de novo review is applicable,we have held that only the claimant not the plan administrator has the burden of proof.muniz amec constr,cir.i dissent.
under our precedent,when a claimant challenges the denial of benefits under a and the erisa plan at issue grants discretion to the plan administrator,the district court conducts a bench trial to determine if the plan administrator abused its discretion.abatie alta health life ins.the scope of evidence considered at such a trial is generally limited to the administrative record.id.at today,we continue to recognize that,in general,a district court may review only the administrative record when considering whether the plan administrator abused its discretion,but may admit additional evidence on de novo review.there are exceptions to the rule,as when the district court needs to consider extrinsic evidence to determine how much weight to give to a claimed conflict of interest on the part of a plan administrator,or when the administrator failed to follow procedural requirements,id.at,but the majority does not suggest that these exceptions are applicable here.
in reviewing the plan administrator decision in light of the administrative record,a court may not substitute its view for that of the factfinder.salomaa,at.rather,the scope of review is limited the court may consider only whether the plan administrator decision was illogical,implausible,or without su
