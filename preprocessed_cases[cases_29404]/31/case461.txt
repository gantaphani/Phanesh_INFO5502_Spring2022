to remain qualified for status under a and a,a pension plan regulated by the employee retirement income security act of erisa may not eliminate or reduce the accrued benefit of a participant by an amendment of the plan.d g the erisa counterpart to d.in this case,the tax court determined that the trustees of the relevant plan did not violate this rule when,in,they amended the plan terms to eliminate a adjustment cola for employees who had retired before the january,amendment that first included the cola.
contending that the cola added by the amendment became an accrued benefit even for employees who had retired before january,the internal revenue service irs argues in this appeal that the elimination of the cola for these employees violated the rule and that therefore the plan as amended in does not qualify for status.for the reasons that follow,we reject the irs argument and affirm the decision of the tax court.
the sheet metal workers national pension fund the plan was established in by the sheet metal workers international association and employers in the sheet metal industry.it is a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of employees in the sheet metal industry the terms of the plan before did not include a cola among the plan benefits.
in november,the trustees of the plan voted to amend the plan to provide a annual cola as part of the plan,advising the plan participants that t his financial arrangement will make certain that every qualified npf pensioner will get a cola payment each december.in december they paid the participants a cola.then,by formal amendments made in march and october,a new article was added to the plan and made retroactive to january,providing a cola benefit for all employees,current and former,as an annual supplement to the monthly pension benefits.thus,even retirees who separated from service before january,began receiving cola benefits under the plan for the first time.these benefits were paid each december in,and in the form of a check.
after adding the cola benefit to the plan,the trustees learned that the cost of the cola had been underestimated and that continuing to pay it would have an adverse financial impact on the plan.accordingly,in october,they amended the plan,effective january,to eliminate the cola for plan participants who retired before january,the date when the inclusion of the cola was originally made effective.
the trustees also submitted the cola amendment to the irs,seeking a determination that the plan remained qualified under a.the irs district office requested advice from the irs national office on whether the cola,which had been included in the plan effective by the addition of article,had become an accrued benefit within the meaning of a a i and,if so,whether the plan amendment discontinuing the cola for retirees violated the rule of d.the irs national office issued a technical advice memorandum concluding that the cola added by new article effective had become an accrued benefit and that its elimination in for retirees violated the rule.when the plan declined to modify its documents,the irs issued a final determination letter stating that the plan failed to qualify under a for and the years following and that the plan was not tax exempt under a.
the plan trustees commenced this declaratory judgment action in the tax court to determine that the plan remained qualified under a on the ground that the cola added by article did not create an accrued benefit for retirees and that its elimination therefore did not violate the rule.the tax court agreed with the trustees and held that the plan article cola was not an accrued benefit for retirees because the benefit did not accrue while the retirees were still employees,wl.emphasizing congress use of the word employee in defining accrued benefit in a,the tax court concluded that erisa was meant to protect only retirement benefits during an employe e tenure on the job.
from the tax court decision,the irs filed this appeal.
under erisa and the tax code,a qualified pension plan is exempt from taxation,and to remain qualified for status,a plan may not violate the rule which prohibits a plan elimination or reduction of an accrued benefit.the rule provides a plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this section if the accrued benefit of a participant is decreased by an amendment of the plan.d emphasis added.the question presented is whether the plan creation of a cola benefit in for employees already retired resulted in an accrued benefit for those plan participants and therefore could not later be eliminated.the resolution of this question turns on the tax code definition of accrued benefit and the terms of the plan.
section of title defines accrued benefit as follows 
a accrued benefit.
a in purposes of this section,the term accrued benefit means 
i in the case of a defined benefit plan,the employee accrued benefit determined under the plan and,except as provided in subsection c,expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age,or 
ii in the case of a plan which is not a defined benefit plan,the balance of the employee account.
a a.although this definition limits the common understanding of an accrued benefit,any benefit that accumulated over does not specifically describe how to determine whether a given benefit for a plan participant is an accrued benefit.we thus turn to a more extended consideration of the statutory definition text and immediate context.
because the plan in this case is a defined benefit plan,we focus our textual analysis on a a i defining accrued benefit for a defined benefit plan.according to this provision,accrued benefit means the employee accrued benefit determined under the plan and expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age emphasis added.it should be apparent that this definition does not purport to describe what counts as an accrued benefit for all participants in all qualifying plans.rather,the statutory definition is a signpost directing us to look to the terms of the plan at issue.the only apparent textual limit in a a i is that the accrued benefit must be expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.
a reading of the statutory definition immediate d,part i,which includes further insight into the meaning of accrued benefit.section begins by establishing that a pension trust,formed by an employer for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries with contributions made by the employer,the employees,or both,is qualified for status,subject to the conditions imposed by the statute.a see also a.one of the relevant conditions is that the accrual of benefits created by employer and employee contributions to the plan trust become nonforfeitable,as set forth in,which provides for minimum vesting standards.section ensures the eventual payout of a retirement benefit created by contributions made by the employer,by the employees,or by both in accordance with the plan in effect while the employee works in the service of the employer.see,a providing when the various contributions vest a addressing what service is included in determination of nonforfeitable percentage a defining year of service a addressing the effects of breaks in service.thus,when a i refers to accrued benefit,it refers to a benefit created by the accumulation of contributions and limited in its form of payment as determined under the plan and expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age emphasis added,but it does not describe what a given plan participant accrued benefit would be.the statute leaves this level of detail to plan drafters who,of course,remain bound by other provisions of erisa and the tax code.sections b and c reinforce this understanding of accrued benefit.section b recognizes an accumulation of benefits that grows during service,and section c recognizes an allocation of accrued benefits between contributions made by an employer and contributions made by employees.b,c.
in sum,while the statute gives a plan contractual latitude to define the nature and amount of benefits to be
