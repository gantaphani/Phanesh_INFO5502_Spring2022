background 
barbara scruggs worked as a secretary in the hennessey,oklahoma,office of exxonmobil for years until the office closed in.during the entire time she worked at the hennessey facility,scruggs never was on exxonmobil payroll.instead,she was paid for her services by a contractor or was paid directly by exxonmobil as an independent contractor in,scruggs attempted to get hired directly by exxon,but exxon decided not to put her on the payroll.
a.scruggs claim 
on august,scruggs sent a letter to exxonmobil claiming that she acted in the capacity of an employee of exxonmobil for years and therefore was entitled to compensation under exxon employee benefit plans.exxonmobil human resources office denied scruggs request for benefits,explaining that scruggs was not an eligible person as defined under any of the exxonmobil benefit plans,not a covered employee under the various exxonmobil benefit plans and therefore she was not entitled to any benefits.id.at.
scruggs appealed this decision to the plan administrator,douglas garrison,who denied scruggs appeal,determining that scruggs was excluded from participation under the plans because she was a person.id.at.a person was defined under the plan as,inter alia,a person working for exxonmobil pursuant to an agreement between exxonmobil and a organization that pays the person salary or wages,or a person employed by exxonmobil under a written agreement with the person that specifically excludes the person from coverage for benefits.id.at.the plan administrator determined that scruggs met this definition because during the entire time she performed services for exxon she either worked for exxonmobil pursuant to agreements between exxonmobil and two organizations that paid her wages or she worked for exxonmobil as an independent contractor,and u nder exxonmobil standard procurement process,all independent contractors enter into a written agreement that specifically excludes the person from coverage for benefits.id.at.thus,the plan administrator concluded that scruggs was a person and,therefore,excluded from the definition of a covered employee under the plans.
b.scruggs lawsuit 
on april,scruggs brought this action under section a of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a,to recover benefits allegedly owed to her under two employee benefits plans,exxonmobil pension plan and exxonmobil savings plan.the plans moved for summary judgment,but the district court denied the motion,concluding that the plan administrator decision was conclusory and did not adequately explain the grounds for its decision.
given that the plan administrator decision failed to make adequate findings and explain the grounds for determination,the district court subsequently ordered a remand for the limited purpose of the plan administrator de novo reconsideration of plaintiff claim for benefits,based on the existing administrative record.the court also allowed the parties to supplement the administrative record with the pertinent legally operative plan documents and any evidence that the parties specifically agreed to.
on remand,the plan administrator once again denied scruggs claim.in an letter,the administrator explained that scruggs was not a covered employee eligible to participate in the plans,because she was never on exxonmobil payroll.alternatively,the administrator explained that she was excluded from participation in the plans because she was a person as defined in the plan documents.and,even if she was eligible to participate in the plans,she had not accrued any benefits under the plans.in sum,the plan administrator concluded that f undamentally,scruggs complaint is not with the administration of the plans,but with the actions of the employer in not offering her a position on the payroll or establishing benefit plans to cover contractors.id.at.
scruggs returned to federal court,filing an amended complaint in the district court,and both parties moved for summary judgment.on june,the district court issued an order granting summary judgment in favor of the plans because scruggs claim was untimely.the court explained that because she knew or should have known that she was classified by exxonmobil as a contract employee as to whom exxonmobil repudiated any entitlement to erisa benefits more than five years before she filed this claim,scruggs claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.id.at.alternatively,the court concluded that plan administrator decision denying benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.this appeal by scruggs followed.
ii.discussion 
scruggs asserts that the district court erred because her action was timely and because the plan administrator denial was an abuse of discretion.we hold that the plan administrator denial of benefits on the ground that scruggs was not a covered employee was not arbitrary and capricious.therefore,we need not reach scruggs challenge to the district court ruling.
we recognize that scruggs asserts that on remand the plan administrator impermissibly provided additional reasons for the denial of her claim.specifically,scruggs argues that we should not rely on the administrator determination that scruggs was not eligible for benefits as a covered employee because she was not on exxonmobil payroll,since this argument was not advanced in the administrator initial denial of her appeal.however,scruggs argument is completely without merit.
the district court is vested with discretion to remand a case to the plan administrator for a renewed evaluation of the claimant case.see flinders workforce stabilization plan of phillips petroleum,cir where the administrator failed to make adequate factual findings or failed to adequately explain the grounds for the decision,then the proper remedy is to remand the case,abrogated on other grounds by holcomb unum life ins.of,see also tate long term disability plan for salaried employees of champion int l,cir remand is appropriate when the plan did not provide adequate reasoning for its conclusion.here,utilizing this discretion,the district court remanded to the plan administrator for de novo reconsideration based on the existing administrative record.therefore,the plan administrator was specifically authorized by the district court to present alternate reasons for denial in its of plaintiff claims.scruggs assertion that the purpose of the remand order was only to give the plan administrator the opportunity to make factual findings supported in detail aplt.br.at conflicts with the plain language of the remand order,and,importantly,the district court did not interpret its own order in such a limited fashion when the case returned to,it considered this new argument in its review of the administrator decision 
standard of review 
we review summary judgment orders de novo.weber ge group life assurance,cir.the supreme court has provided that the proper standard of review when a denial of benefits is challenged under a b depends largely upon whether the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.where a plan grants the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits,we employ a deferential standard of review,asking only whether the denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious.weber,at citation and quotation omitted.however,i f a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.metro.life ins.glenn,d internal quotation marks,emphasis omitted quoting firestone,at.to incorporate this factor,we have crafted a sliding scale approach where the reviewing court will always apply an arbitrary and capricious standard,but will decrease the level of deference given in proportion to the seriousness of the conflict.weber,at internal citations and quotations omitted.
here,the plan documents explicitly state that the plan administrator shall be vested with full and final discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits,and to construe and interpret the terms of the core benefit plans in their application to any participant or beneficiary.emphasis omitted.the plans thereby retained discretionary authority,which triggers the court standard of review.as the plan administrator is also an employee of exxonmobil,he operates under a conflict of interest in this case.see weber,at.accordingly,the court will still employ the standard,but it will weigh the plan administrator conflict of interest as a factor in determining the lawfulness of the benefits denial.id in reviewing the administrator decision we will only consider the administrative materials compiled by the administrator in the course of making his decision.weber,at quotation omitted.
b.the plan administrator interpretation of the plan 
when reviewing a plan administrator decision to deny benefits,we consider only the rationale asserted by the plan administrator in the administrative record and determine whether the decision,based on the asserted rationale,was arbitrary and capricious.id.internal quotation marks,alterations omitted quoting flinders,at.we make that determination based on the language of the plan.id.
where the plan administrator decision relies on an interpretation of the language in the plan,as it does here,we begin by considering whether the provision is ambiguous if the plan documents,examined as a whole,are unambiguous,we construe them as a matter of law.id.internal quotations omitted.ambiguity exists where a plan provision is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning,or where there is uncertainty as to the meaning of the term.miller monumental life ins,cir quoting admin.comm.of assocs.health welfare plan willard,cir.in order to determine whether the plan is ambiguous,we consider the common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person in the position of the plan participant would have understood the words to mean.weber,at quoting miller,at further quotation,emphasis omitted.
if a plan provision is ambiguous,under the arbitrary and capricious standard,then we take a hard look and determine whether the plan administrator interpretation of the ambiguous language was arbitrary in light of the administrator conflict of interest.id.internal quotation omitted.however,if the plan provision is unambiguous,and the plan administrator interpretation differs from the unambiguous meaning,then the plan administrator interpretation is unreasonable,and the decision to deny benefits based on that interpretation is arbitrary and capricious.flinders,at.
the plan is ambiguous 
the exxonmobil pension plan provides that generally a person acquires a matured right to a pension benefit at the time of termination if the person was a covered employee and the person has completed sufficient years of service.the common provisions applicable to the pension plan define a covered employee,in general,as a qualifying employee of a participating employer.id.at emphasis omitted.the definitions of qualifying employee and participating employer incorporate further definitions a qualifying employee is defined,in general,as any employee of a participating employer who is both a regular employee and a employee id.at and a participating employer is,in general,exxonmobil and any employer that has elected to participate in one or more of the benefit plans.therefore,ultimately,a covered employee is,generally,a employee of exxonmobil who is compensated in dollars and is regularly stationed in the united states or canada.
despite all of these definitions,the pivotal term employee is never specifically defined,and neither was the term defined in any previous version of the plans.the plan asserts that only a person who was on exxonmobil payroll meets the definition of an employee under the benefit plans aple.br.at to the contrary,scruggs argues that the term employee has a broader scope that reaches employees,as defined under nationwide mutual insurance darden,d,and possibly extends still more widely to be sure,each of the interpretations proposed by the parties is plausible,and the benefit plans neither specifically include nor exclude employees.
furthermore,a holistic reading of the plan documents is equivocal.on the one hand,the plan documents specific exclusion of certain individuals who would not be on exxonmobil payroll,such as leased employees and some person s,could imply that absent the exclusion they might fall under the definition of a qualifying employee even though they were not on exxonmobil payroll.on the other hand,the plan documents at least suggest that a person who is not paid through the established wage or salary system,the payroll system,could not accrue any benefits.it would make little sense to characterize as a covered employee a person who is not eligible to receive benefits because he or she was not on the payroll.because the term employee is ambiguous and the plan documents as a whole do not establish a definitive interpretation,it is appropriate to proceed to consider the reasonableness of the administrator exercise of his interpretive discretion.
plan administrator decision 
the plan administrator concluded that the word employee was never intended as a legal term of art,but simply as a reference to persons that ordinary businessmen consider to be is,those on the distinct from persons that ordinary businessmen would consider to be contractors,because that is how they are designated and treated in exxonmobil systems.id.at.
the administrator supported his decision with reference to several factors.first,the design of exxonmobil benefits administration processes as they have existed for many years supported the fact that the pension plan was only intended to cover employees on exxonmobil payroll.id.the administrator explained that c ontractors,including individual contractors,are paid through accounts payable on the basis of invoices submitted,not through the payroll system.however,only the payroll system has the interfaces and recordkeeping capabilities to track employee information essential to the administration of benefits.id.for instance,only the payroll system can track elections and collect medical premiums,and savings plan contributions.also,the payroll system tracks hours of service and hours of leave,which applies to the vesting rules and the amount of benefits accrued under the pension plan.accordingly,it is completely impractical to provide benefits to persons who receive payments through accounts payable,rather than through the payroll system.id.at.and this inability to track pay to determine the amount of the benefit would be even more complicated when a person claiming eligibility for benefits was in fact paid by an outside vendor.
additionally,the administrator explained that f urther evidence of the fact that only persons on the payroll are intended to be covered by the plans is the fact that benefits communications,such as periodic benefit statements and enrollment materials,are provided only to persons who are or were on the payroll.id.finally,the plan administrator explained that during his career in human resources at exxonmobil he was not aware of a case in which a person hired as an independent contractor or an employee of a third party providing services to ex
