appropriate equitable relief 
the supreme court addressed the meaning of appropriate equitable relief under a of erisa in mertens hewitt associates,d,and life annuity insurance knudson,d.in mertens,the court held that the term appropriate equitable relief in a allows only those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.at.
subsequently,in,the court elaborated on the distinction between legal and equitable relief,stating that a plaintiff could seek restitution in equity,ordinarily in the form of a constructive trust or an equitable lien,where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.at.on the other hand,reasoned the court,if the property sought to be recovered or its proceeds have been dissipated so that no product remains,the plaintiff claim is only that of a general creditor,and the plaintiff can not enforce a constructive trust of or an equitable lien upon other property of the defendant.id.at.alteration in original citation and internal quotation omitted.in such an instance,the plaintiff is seeking a legal imposition of personal liability on the defendant to pay a sum of money which the plaintiff is his claim falls outside a jurisdictional grant.id.at.
following,several other circuits have addressed whether a plan administrator may maintain an action for appropriate equitable relief to enforce a reimbursement provision after a plan beneficiary has received compensation from a third party.identifying the key facts discussed and relied upon in,courts have applied a test does the plan seek to recover funds that are specifically identifiable,that belong in good conscience to the plan,and that are within the possession and control of the defendant beneficiary bombardier aerospace employee welfare benefits plan ferrer,poirot wansbrough,cir see also admin.comm.of stores.assocs.health welfare plan varco,cir.
specific identifiability 
in the instant case,the funds are specifically identifiable.in varco,the court found that where the defendant established a reserve bank account from the settlement proceeds in the expected amount of the medical bills,the funds had not been dissipated and were specifically identifiable.at.similarly,the bombardier court found that the funds in question were specifically identifiable when the settlement proceeds were placed in a trust account by the beneficiary law firm.at.
in this case,as part of the settlement agreement,withheld the amount of medical expenses from the agreed tort settlement and deposited the funds in the court registry.later,by agreement of the parties,the funds were distributed to the plan administrators pending resolution of the case.thereafter,the court vacated the order distributing the funds to the plan administrators,and the res was returned to the court registry.thus,the proceeds of the settlement in contention in this case have not been dissipated and are specifically identifiable.
b.the plan rights to the funds 
in,bauhaus usa,copeland,cir,bombardier,and varco,the terms of the plans,like the plan before us,contained express,unambiguous reimbursement provisions,which resulted in the conclusion that the disputed funds belonged in good conscience to the plan.
