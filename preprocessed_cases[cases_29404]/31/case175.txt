deborah hobson hobson is a member of an health care plan the plan that is governed by the provisions of the employee retirement income security act,erisa,and for which claims for benefits are administered by metropolitan life insurance metlife.hobson brings this appeal from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york alvin hellerstein,judge dated december,granting summary judgment to metlife,denying hobson for summary judgment,and dismissing the complaint.hobson metro.life ins,cv,tr.at.
hobson alleges that metlife conflict of interest as both evaluator and payor of benefit claims influenced its decision to deny her claim for benefits,requiring this court to review metlife determination de novo.she contends that,in any event,metlife decision was arbitrary and capricious because it was not supported by substantial evidence.she also avers that metlife abused its discretion by not affording her a full and fair review of her claim,as required by sections a and of erisa.
finding that hobson failed to establish that metlife was influenced by its structural conflict of interest,we decline to accord this factor any weight in our review of metlife denial of hobson benefits claim for abuse of discretion.because we find that substantial evidence supported metlife denial of hobson benefits claim,and that metlife afforded her a full and fair review of her claim,we conclude that the district court properly determined that metlife acted within its discretion as plan administrator in denying the claim.we therefore affirm.
background 
hobson worked for kpmg,llp kpmg from to february,as a tax technician,a sedentary position which involved sitting at a and using a computer.she challenges metlife denial of her claim for disability ltd benefits.
hobson health insurance plan 
under kpmg group health insurance policy with metlife,metlife has the discretionary authority to interpret the plan terms and determine a claimant eligibility for,and entitlement to,plan benefits.an employee is eligible for ltd benefits under the plan beginning weeks after becoming disabled.the plan considers the employee disabled for the next months,if she can not perform the material and substantial duties of her o wn o ccupation,and after this period,if she can not perform any job for which she is qualified or may become reasonably qualified 
hobson claims history 
initial benefits claim 
after becoming disabled in february,hobson filed a claim for disability and ltd benefits under the plan,claiming that she was unable to work.hobson allegedly suffers from asthma,severe tremors,migraines,depression,ulcerative colitis colitis,ileostomy skin problems,seizures,thyroid cancer,fibromyalgia,sleep apnea,severe fatigue,heaviness in her arms and legs,herniated disks in her lower back and neck,arthritis,and dercum disease dercum.hobson initially submitted medical examination reports from three doctors.the first,rheumatologist sandra sessoms,diagnosed hobson with fibromyaglia a disease impairing cognitive opined that hobson was unable to work.the second,gastroenterologist keith fernandez,diagnosed hobson with colitis,which involves acute or chronic inflammation of the tissue lining the gastrointestinal system,but stated that hobson could return to work on august.the third,neurologist randolph evans,submitted a report indicating that hobson had mild lumbar spine abnormalities and no neurological abnormalities,and expressing no opinion as to her ability to work.
metlife consulted an independent rheumatologist and internal medicine specialist,jefrey lieberman,who opined that the evidence hobson submitted did not demonstrate that she suffered from fibromyalgia or that she could not return to work.lieberman contacted sessoms,who stated that she was no longer treating hobson and was not sure if hobson currently was being treated for fibromyalgia.metlife approved hobson claim for benefits,but on november,denied her claim for ltd benefits.
hobson appealed metlife denial of her ltd benefits claim.hobson clarified that she continued to be a patient of sessoms and was about to undergo treatment for fibromyalgia.hobson also submitted an evaluation from sessoms reiterating her diagnosis that hobson was unable to work,had limited mobility,and suffered from various medical conditions,including symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia,colitis,hypertension,insomnia,lung disease,anemia,and depression.hobson also submitted another report from fernandez,which indicated that hobson was being treated for colitis and that other medical conditions made her feel much worse.
metlife referred hobson file to joseph nesta,an independent physician specializing in internal medicine and gastroenterology,who concluded that hobson colitis appear ed to be stable,that her fibromyalgia was not disabling,and that the mris of her spine,which showed only mild abnormalities,did not indicate that she was unable to work.in march,metlife upheld its denial of hobson claim for ltd benefits.
ltd benefits for colitis,rectal bleeding,and anemia 
in august,after hobson submitted additional information regarding her colitis,rectal bleeding,and anemia,metlife approved her ltd benefits claim.in april,after consulting a physician trained in internal and occupational medicine,who reported that hobson colitis and anemia were under control,and that she could perform most jobs as long as there was ready access to a bathroom,metlife terminated hobson ltd benefits.
ltd benefits for surgery 
on june,after hobson underwent two surgical procedures relating to her colitis,metlife reinstated her ltd benefits.at the time,a metlife nurse consultant disagreed with the reinstatement and recommended that hobson benefits be discontinued because her colitis had been corrected by the surgery,and her medical records did not indicate that she was physically or psychologically impaired.
hobson submitted a physician report indicating that she had a yeast or fungal infection,and suffered from a major depressive disorder whereby she was unable to engage in stress ful situations or interpersonal interactions,and her emotional and adaptive functioning ma d e returning to work unfeasible.metlife nurse consultant concluded that the submitted medical findings do not document a significant severity of condition or provide evidence of a functional impairment that would preclude hobson from performing the duties of her sedentary job.
on july,nesta,the physician who reviewed hobson file upon her initial appeal,reevaluated her case and again concluded that her alleged impairments did not preclude her from working.on july,hobson treating internist responded to the reevaluation,stating that he disagree d with metlife r eview due to insufficient data,and expressing concern about hobson possible systemic yeast infection.in august,metlife terminated hobson ltd benefits for the second time.
ltd benefits for thyroid cancer surgery 
in september,after hobson underwent surgery to treat thyroid cancer,metlife reinstated her ltd benefits for a closed period of time,until november.the physician who performed the surgery recommended that hobson return to work in january.metlife informed hobson that by this time,over months had passed from her initial claim for benefits,meaning that in order to be disabled under the plan,she was required to show that she could not perform the duties of any job reasonably fitted by her education,training,and experience,and not only the duties of her actual occupation.
ltd benefits for dercum 
in appealing metlife termination of her ltd benefits in,hobson enclosed an updated report from sessoms,which explained that hobson had some difficulty standing,walking,and sitting.hobson also included a report from paul subrt,a dermatologist,who diagnosed her with dercum,which is a rare,chronic condition whose symptoms include painful adipose tissue,extreme weakness and fatigability,chronic generalized pain,fibromyalgia,epilepsy,cognitive dysfunction and depression,has no effective treatment,and can lead to lifelong debilitating disabilities.
metlife had two independent consultants review hobson file,both of whom concluded that none of hobson alleged impairments rendered her unable to work.the first,an internist,explained that the dercum diagnosis was not or supported,and that hobson had not been given a treatment plan.the second,a neurologist and psychiatrist,concluded that although hobson had a number of chronic medical problems which are severe,she appeared to be functional and was able to work without any difficulty at her sedentary job.in march,metlife upheld its denial of hobson claim for ltd benefits.
metlife granted hobson request for additional,discretionary review of the claim denial and referred her file to two more independent physicians.the first,a psychiatrist,explained that t here we re no complete psychiatric evaluations in the documentation or any complete mental status examinations.this consultant also determined that hobson herself had submitted numerous letters to metlife which we re very well written and contain ed no hints of any cognitive impairment.the second consultant,a dermatologist,opined that the dercum diagnosis actually was made by hobson,not by her doctor,and found that she made it according to information on the internet.subrt,the physician who authored the brief,letter diagnosing hobson with dercum,told metlife consultant that he d id not feel that hobson wa s disabled and d id not understand why she c ould not do her job,which is sedentary.the second consultant also concluded that,aside from hobson subjective reports of pain,no objective finding confirmed that she was unable to work.on may,metlife informed hobson that it upheld its denial of her benefits claim and would not consider any further appeals,because hobson had exhausted her administrative remedies under the p lan.
hobson then submitted two letters to supplement her claim.the first,authored by subrt,explained that although he did not discern any dermatologic disability,he was not qualified to opine on whether she otherwise suffered disabilities.the second,a letter from her treating psychologist,stated that hobson depression had since worsened to the point of severe despondent episodes of sufficient severity that she wa s unable to function consistently enough to sustain employment.in letters dated may and,metlife informed hobson that her additional submissions had not persuaded it to reconsider the denial of her benefits claim.
the erisa action 
on august,hobson responded to metlife denial of her administrative appeals by instituting this action.her complaint alleges that metlife was influenced by its conflict of interest as both the evaluator and payor of benefit claims,warranting de novo review,and that,in any event,it abused its discretion in denying her claim for ltd benefits.the parties then filed for summary judgment.
on december,the district court granted metlife motion and denied hobson,concluding that metlife did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in denying hobson claim for benefits,because,inter alia,metlife reasonably took up each and every aspect of the claim hobson,cv,tr.at.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
in an erisa action,we review the district court grant of summary judgment based on the administrative record de novo and apply the same legal standard as the district court.pagan nynex pension plan,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where the parties submissions show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fay oxford health plan,cir.
although generally an administrator decision to deny benefits is reviewed de novo,where,as here,written plan documents confer upon a plan administrator the discretionary authority to determine eligibility,we will not disturb the administrator ultimate conclusion unless it is arbitrary and capricious.pagan,at.after the supreme court rendered its decision in metropolitan life insurance glenn,d,this court explained that a plan under which an administrator both evaluates and pays benefits claims creates the kind of conflict of interest that courts must take into account and weigh as a factor in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion,but does not make de novo review appropriate.mccauley first unum life ins,cir.a plaintiff showing that the administrator conflict of interest affected the choice of a reasonable interpretation is only one of several different considerations that judges must take into account when review ing the lawfulness of benefit denials.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in light of this,we find unpersuasive hobson assertion that de novo review is warranted on the basis of metlife structural conflict of interest.we now turn to the question of whether the district court erred in weighing metlife conflict of interest.
hobson alleges that the district court failed to take into account two documents in the record which show that metlife was influenced by its conflict of interest.the district court properly explained that it must defer to the administrator decision unless the decision is arbitrary and capricious,and that the deference to be given to the administrator does change unless the plaintiff shows that the administrator was,in fact,influenced by the conflict of interest.hobson,cv,tr.at.the district court,however,failed to discuss the evidence allegedly showing that metlife conflict of interest influenced its,determine what role metlife conflict of interest may have played in its decision,and give that conflict any weight,as required by glenn.see.at see also mccauley,at.
the first document is a september,email from one kpmg employee to another stating that metlife is requesting a very detailed job description for hobson and is trying to cover all basis sic for denying the ltd claim.the email suggests that a,who was not employed by metlife,believed that metlife might be motivated by a desire to deny hobson claim.this suggestion,however,is belied by metlife decision to reinstate hobson benefits six days later,after hobson informed metlife that she had undergone surgery for thyroid cancer.
the second document is a november diary note in hobson file in which a metlife nurse recommended that the case manager procure updated medical information and a referral to other medical experts,because colitis is a wax and wane type of,and hobson would most likely not be found to be t otally d isabled from any occupation rather than indicating that metlife was influenced by its conflict of interest,this note simply reflects the reviewing nurse reasonable doubts as to whether hobson condition would continue to render her disabled,in light of a letter from the year in which hobson own reviewing physician indicated that hobson colitis was temporary and that she would be able to return to work.
we are not persuaded that these documents show that metlife conflict of interest as evaluator and payor of benefits influenced its reasonable interpretation of hobson claim for benefits.thus,we decline to afford metlife conflict of interest any weight in our review of metlife benefit denial.
ii.substantial evidence supporting metlife determination 
under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,we may overturn an administrator decision to deny erisa benefits only if it was without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.this scope of review is narrow thus,we are not free to substitute our own judgment for that of the insurer as if we were considering the issue of eligibility anew.pagan,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
hobson contends that metlife decision is not supported by substantial evidence because metlife relied on its paid medical reviewers speculative inferences,despite the reliable evidence of hobson doctors,and specifically relied upon nesta report,even though he failed to consider fibromyalgia in his review and only presented opinions that were at best generic.
after august,metlife took five actions,each of which had the effect of disallowing hobson claim for ltd benefits a the august termination of benefits after she recovered from surgery b the december termination after she recovered from thyroid cancer surgery c the march denial of hobson first appeal after the month period had passed d the may,denial of benefits after additional review and e the may,refusal to consider further appeals despite two letters hobson submitted from attending physicians we evaluate each of these actions in turn.
august termination of ltd benefits after recovery from surgery 
first,we conclude that metlife termination of hobson ltd benefits after she underwent surgery to address her colitis was not arbitrary and capricious.
the report prepared in by nesta,the independent physician consulted by metlife,concluded that hobson alleged impairments did not preclude her from working.specifically,nesta determined that hobson surgery should have cured her ulcerative colitis,the mri and her neurologist progress notes indicated that she did not have significant radiculopathy,and her neurologist decision to not take hobson out of work indicated that he could not find any neurologic basis for hobson seizures and migraines.as for hobson asthma,fungal infection,and fibromyalgia,nesta determined that these conditions were not disabling.
hobson own infectious disease specialist agreed that her fungal infection did not prevent her from working.although her treating internist d id not agree that most of her ailments do not preclude her from working because he was concerned about her yeast infection,he did not submit additional information to support hobson claim for benefits.in fact,he conceded that there was insufficient data to determine her ability to work.
hobson specifically challenges on appeal metlife reliance on nesta report because metlife failed to consider fibromyalgia in his review.upon evaluating hobson final diagnosis of fibromyalgia,nesta report again concluded that fibromyalgia does not usually preclude an individual from working.two years earlier,however,nesta explained why he concluded that hobson was not disabled due to her fibromyalgia hobson had no documented trigger point tenderness which is normally part of a fibromyalgia diagnosis,no hard evidence substantiate d her disability from a rheumatologic viewpoint,and her neurological examinations were normal.moreover,lieberman,another independent consultant who evaluated hobson record in,opined that there was any substantial global or objective evidence to support the opinion that hobson was unable to perform any occupation because of her fibromyalgia instead,lieberman stated that t here certainly are a wide range of treatments available for patients with fibromyalgia to allow them to be more productive,gainfully employed,and have a better quality of life.
as the supreme court has explained,courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant physician nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician evaluation.black decker disability plan nord,d.thus,metlife acted within its discretion in relying upon the conclusions of its independent consultants three reports.because the three reports provided detailed,substantive analysis of hobson fibromyalgia,we can not find that metlife unreasonably failed to consider hobson fibromyalgia.
as hobson own treating physician conceded,it is far from clear that hobson medical records demonstrated that she was disabled rather,we find ample evidence in hobson file to support metlife determination that she failed to make this showing.
december termination after thyroid cancer surgery 
in december,after reinstating hobson ltd benefits when she underwent surgery for thyroid cancer,metlife terminated her benefits.metlife reasonably concluded that hobson was not disabled,given that the same physician who operated on hobson thyroid cancer also recommended that she return to work in january.thus,the record substantially supports metlife termination of her ltd benefits,a decision we do not find arbitrary and capricious.
march denial of initial appeal after month period 
in appealing the denial of her benefits claim,hobson submitted a report from subrt diagnosing her with dercum and an updated evaluation from sessoms explaining that hobson symptoms included several chronic medical conditions.
substantial evidence in the record supports metlife determination that hobson was not disabled due to dercum.as the first consultant,internist blair truxal,explained,subrt letter consisted only of one brief paragraph,which hobson supplemented with fourteen pages of information on dercum disease researched from the internet.truxal concluded that no diagnostic criteria or physical findings supported the diagnosis.in fact,he pointed to four diagnostic criteria that hobson lacked.finally,truxal explained that hobson records did not specify which of the three types of dercum she allegedly had,or mention any treatment plan for the disease.
metlife additional determination that none of hobson other alleged ailments precluded her from work was not unreasonable.the second consultant,neurologist and psychiatrist john delaney,opined that,although hobson had a number of chronic medical conditions which are severe,she remained functional and was able to work without any difficulty at her sedentary job.because metlife was entitled to rely on these written reports,black decker,at,its denial of hobson claim was neither arbitrary nor capricious.
may denial after additional review of dercum diagnosis 
upon granting hobson request for additional review of the denial of her ltd benefits claim,metlife referred hobson file to two additional physicians.both reports support metlife decision to uphold its benefit denial.
the first report from a psychiatrist concluded that hobson was not cognitively impaired because she had not submitted any complete psychiatric or mental status examination supporting her claim,and seemed able to communicate cogently in writing with metlife.
the second report provided additional support for metlife determination that hobson was not disabled due to dercum.the consultant,a dermatologist,opined that hobson herself,rather than a doctor,had diagnosed herself with dercum,and that no objective evidence accompanied her subjective reports of pain to demonstrate that she was disabled.
hobson own physician,subrt,who wrote the letter stating his belief that she had dercum,conceded that he d id not feel that hobson wa s disabled and d id not understand why she can not do her job,which is sedentary.because hobson treating physician and two independent consultants all opined that hobson was not disabled from working,we find that metlife decision to uphold its denial of her claim for benefits fell squarely within its discretion.
may refusal to consider further appeals 
both of the letters hobson submitted after metlife informed her that it would not consider any further appeals failed to provide additional,objective evidence that she was disabled.
the first letter from subrt merely clarified that he was not qualified to opine on whether she suffered disabilities,and explained that he did not discern any dermatologic disability.the second letter from hobson psychologist stated that hobson was unable to function or work due to her depression,but did not include or append any evidence substantiating this conclusion.
in light of the substantial evidence in hobson file supporting metlife determination that she was not disabled from sedentary work,we find that metlife did not abuse its discretion in may by refusing to consider hobson request for a further appeal.
iii.metlife full and fair review of hobson claim 
section of erisa requires that claims for benefits be afforded a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.the district court concluded that metlife afforded hobson such a review by reasonably t aking up each and every aspect of the claim.hobson,cv,tr.at.
hobson alleges that metlife failed to fully and fairly review her benefits claim by a not notifying her of what additional information she needed to perfect her claim b requiring objective support for her medical conditions c failing to consider all the medical evidence she submitted d giving undue weight to the opinions of metlife consultants over those of hobson treating physicians e failing to request an independent medical examination,as provided for in its own policy and f not considering the social security administration ssa finding of disability for the same medical conditions for which she requested ltd benefits from metlife.we review each argument in turn and find each to be without merit.
erisa notice requirement 
section of erisa contains a general requirement whereby,upon denying a claim for benefits,a plan administrator must provide the claimant with adequate notice in writing setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.erisa regulations further require that the administrator furnish the claimant with a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary g iii.as we have explained,the purpose of erisa notice requirement is to provide claimants with enough information to prepare adequately for further administrative review or an appeal to the federal courts.juliano health maint.org.of nj,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in past the two cited by which courts found that plan administrators failed to substantially comply with the erisa notice requirement by not notifying claimants of information necessary to perfect their claims,the administrators also failed to explain the specific reasons for the benefit denial.see,schleibaum kmart,cir halpin grainger,cir dzidzovic.serv.health fund,cv,wl,at,dawes first unum life ins,civ,wl,at.
there is no question that metlife communicated to hobson its specific reasons for denying her ltd benefits.after hobson alleged that she suffered from several conditions including debilitating depression,seizures,and dercum,metlife march letter explained why it concluded that she seem s to be functional.in terms of her depression,the letter stated that what is lacking is whether the depression would be severe enough to actually have suicidal ideation or whether this depression requires inpatient hospitalization.as for her seizures,the letter stated that what was lacking from her file was whether she was having ongoing seizures that are not well controlled and prevent her from driving or getting around.as for her dercum diagnosis,metlife explained that hobson records lacked evidence that she exhibited four diagnostic criteria for dercum,and that there was no mention in the records of what type of dercum she allegedly ha s or a treatment plan for th e disease.the letter further stated that hobson colitis and thyroid cancer appeared to be cured by the surgical procedures she underwent,and that her medical records did not demonstrate that she was disabled due to spinal degenerative disease or debilitating migraines.
it is noteworthy that after hobson initial claim for benefits was denied in november and she submitted additional medical information,metlife granted hobson ltd benefits on three separate occasions,thereby reflecting that metlife reasonably took up each and every aspect of hobson claims.juliano,at.finally,hobson ability to perfect her claim three times supports our conclusion that she was fairly apprised of how she could prepare adequately for subsequent appeals of earlier benefit denials.id.therefore,we are persuaded that metlife substantially complied with erisa notice regulations.
requirement of objective medical evidence 
hobson alleges that metlife failed to afford her full and fair review of her ltd benefits claim by requiring objective support for her medical conditions,because metlife own policy does not require such proof,and because this court has clarified that subjective complaints alone may constitute sufficient evidence of disability.see connors.life ins,cir it has long been the law of this circuit that the subjective element of pain is an important factor to be considered in determining disability.internal quotation marks omitted.
this court has never directly addressed whether it is reasonable for a plan administrator,who retains the discretionary authority to interpret the terms of its plan,to require the plaintiff to produce objective medical evidence,where such a requirement is not expressly set out in the plan.however,several courts in this district have found that it is not unreasonable or arbitrary for a plan administrator to require the plaintiff to produce objective medical evidence of total disability in a claim for disability benefits.fitzpatrick bayer,civ,wl,at,see also suren metro.life ins,wl,at,collecting cases and concluding that metlife did not abuse its discretion when it based its opinion on objective tests and examinations,despite suren subjective complaints of fatigue and weakness.
we conclude that it is not unreasonable for erisa plan administrators to accord weight to objective evidence that a claimant medical ailments are debilitating in order to guard against fraudulent or unsupported claims of disability.as the eighth circuit has explained,even in a claim involving fibromyalgia,findings constitute objective evidence of the disease,and it is not unreasonable for a plan administrator to require such evidence so long as the claimant was so notified.johnson metro.life ins,cir.when metlife denied hobson initial appeal in march,it informed her that there has been no documentation that substantiates documented trigger point tenderness that falls within the major criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.in light of this notification,metlife acted within its discretion in requiring some objective evidence that hobson was disabled from performing in a sedentary capacity.
such a requirement is not contradicted by any provision of metlife own policy,which provides that an employee claim may be denied if she can not obtain sufficient medical evidence to support her disability claim.by the terms of the plan,metlife retains the discretion to interpret what constitutes sufficient medical evidence,and metlife determination that such evidence requires objective support,rather than merely subjective reports of pain,is reasonable.in this case,metlife conclusion that hobson subjective pain did not rise to the level of rendering her unable to work was supported by subrt,the very doctor who diagnosed hobson with dercum,and who reached the same conclusion.thus,we decline to hold that metlife decision to deny hobson claim for benefits,because she failed to provide objective evidence showing that she was disabled from sedentary work deprived her of full and fair review.
consideration of all medical evidence 
hobson also alleges that metlife did not properly consider all of her medical evidence,ignoring her ailments and conditions,the impact of her medications,and her subjective complaints of pain.we have already rejected hobson allegation that metlife ignored her subjective complaints in the prior section.we now turn to the remaining evidence which hobson alleges that metlife arbitrarily and capriciously ignored.
there is no merit to hobson contentions that metlife intentionally ignored evidence that she was disabled due to ailments and conditions,that is,conditions that pertain to two or more disorders,fatigue,inability to concentrate,cognitive functioning,and memory that metlife should have evaluated such evidence together,rather than in isolation.metlife had two independent psychiatrist consultants evaluate hobson file.the first concluded that hobson psychiatric and cognitive functioning wa s essentially within normal limits,that there were no objective findings of any cognitive impairment or problems with memory or cognition,and that her own correspondences indicated that her ailments did not impair her ability to function.the second explained that hobson depression did not render her unable to perform her duties,as metlife mentioned in its march letter to hobson.thus,metlife expressly considered hobson ailments and conditions,and the two consultant reports that metlife relied upon substantially supported metlife denial of hobson claim for ltd benefits.see suren,wl
