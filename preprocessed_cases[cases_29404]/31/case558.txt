this is an erisa benefits case.beneficiary mostafa appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of entergy operations,entergy,administrator employee benefits committee ebc,and the hartford life and accident insurance company hartford.we affirm.
between april and april,who has a masters degree in engineering,was employed by entergy as a technical or senior engineer.in,entergy corporation established the entergy corporation companies benefits plus long term disability plan the plan.the plan meets the requirements of an employee welfare benefit plan as that term is defined in erisa.see.entergy funded the plan with a group insurance policy issued by hartford.
any review of an erisa benefit determination must begin with the relevant plan language the plan provides that it pays disability benefits 
t o a member if,while covered hereunder,the member i becomes totally disabled ii remains totally disabled throughout the elimination period iii remains totally disabled beyond the elimination period and iv submits proof of loss satisfactory to the claims administrator.
the plan defines total disability as follows 
totally disabled means that during the elimination period and for the next months,the member is prevented by disability from doing all the material and substantial duties of this own occupation.after that,totally disabled means that the member is prevented by such disability from doing any occupation or work for which he is or could become qualified by training,education,or experience.
the plan defines the elimination period as follows 
elimination period means the first months of any one period of total disability before benefits are payable under this plan.notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the contrary,if a member ceases to be totally disabled and returns to work for a total of or fewer days during an elimination period,the elimination period shall not be interrupted or extended.except as otherwise set forth herein,the member must be totally disabled by the same condition for the entire elimination period.
generally,a participant must be disabled by the same condition for the entire elimination period.moreover,even a series of disabilities,each lasting less than six months alone,but adding up to an aggregate of six months when combined,will generally not suffice to establish total disability throughout the elimination period.there are,however,at least two exceptions.first,the elimination period will not be interrupted if the participant returns to work during the elimination period for a period of fourteen or fewer days.second,when the participant suffers from a second period of disability which is caused by the same or a related condition,and begins within three months after the first period of disability terminates,then the second period of disability will be tacked on to the first period of disability and the two periods will be considered a single period of continuous disability under the plan.the plan terms describing this feature provide 
period of disability means a continuous length of time during which a member is disabled under this plan.
successive periods of disability.if successive periods of disability are due to the same cause or due to a related cause and separated by months or less then such successive periods shall be considered one period of disability,provided the plan remains in effect.
when,as here,the participant becomes totally disabled before age,the plan potentially provides long term disability benefits for a period of continuous disability until age.benefits terminate earlier,however,upon the occurrence of any of the following circumstances 
i the date the member is no longer disabled 
ii the date on which the member fails to furnish proof that he is continuously disabled 
iii the date on which the member refuses to be examined,if the claims administrator requires an examination 
iv the date on which the member first receives retirement benefits from a plan provided or sponsored by his employer or 
v the date on which the member dies.
finally,the plan expressly limits the coverage for conditions caused,contributed to,or made disabling by most mental illnesses to a lifetime maximum of months.the relevant plan term provides 
additional plan limits.notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the contrary,if the member is disabled because of i psychosis or neurosis ii any condition caused,contributed to,or made disabling by a psychosis or neurosis then,subject to all other provisions of this plan,the plan shall pay benefits only for so long as the member is confined in a hospital or other place licensed to provide medical care for such disability for at least days or when the member is not so confined,for a total of months for all such disabilities during his lifetime.
having set forth the controlling plan terms,we turn to a consideration of the facts relating to claim for long term disability benefits.
was first disabled by a knee injury in august.filed a claim for disability benefits,which hartford approved.in march,treating physician,tiwari,reported that was no longer totally disabled and that he could return to work at the end of april.continued receiving benefits until he returned to work on may.
shortly thereafter,in july,became disabled by a bout of major depression.filed a second claim for long term disability benefits on july,which was accompanied by a statement from his psychiatrist,coleman.coleman stated that was totally disabled by depression,but that was expected to make a full recovery and to return to work on at least a basis in september.
earlier in july,was seen by tiwari and by another medical provider,nordal.tiwari recorded that was being seen for a separate problem,documenting that was complaining of crying spells,memory loss,depression,and anxiety.tiwari conducted clinical studies,including an mri and emg studies.the results of these studies were either within normal limits or reported only as minimally significant medical findings.nordal likewise concluded that had difficulty controlling his emotions and making decisions,and that was suffering from severe anxiety and depression.
hartford approved second claim,but informed that it was establishing a new elimination period beginning on july,the date of his second disability benefits claim,and ending six months later,on january.hartford also informed that it intended to rely upon plan and policy language limiting coverage to a maximum of months when the beneficiary is disabled by some form of mental disability.hartford subsequently paid disability benefits to for the period beginning january,and ending january,and for a short time period thereafter,ending in march.
in the period that was receiving disability benefits,he was receiving treatment from coleman for depression.during at least some of that period,he was also receiving medical treatment from tiwari for chronic pain in his neck,chest,and lower back.in january,also consulted a rheumatologist,who prescribed injections for pain.
when entitlement to disability benefits on the basis of his mental disability expired in january,claimed that he was entitled to continued benefits because he was totally disabled by chronic pain,a condition that would not be subject to the month limitation applicable to his claim for depression.hartford arranged for a functional capacity evaluation to determine whether was totally disabled by chronic pain.the functional capacity evaluation report stated that could perform sedentary to light work,as required by his engineering position.the evaluation specifically reported that was able to lift pounds and carry pounds.
after receiving the functional capacity evaluation,hartford forwarded the report,together with file,to a silver for an independent medical evaluation.silver was charged with deciding whether was totally disabled by a physical condition that would support the payment of benefits beyond the months paid for claim based upon depression and anxiety.silver concluded that depression was severe,but that he was physically capable of returning to the work required by his employment with entergy.hartf
