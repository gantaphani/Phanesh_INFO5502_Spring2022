william and debra trujillo brought this action against pacificorp claiming their employment with pacificorp was terminated in violation of the association clause of the americans with disabilities act ada,b,and the employee retirement security act of erisa,et.the district court granted pacificorp summary judgment on both claims.we reverse.
william and debra trujillo were employed by pacificorp at the jim bridger power plant in sweetwater county,wyoming trujillo tenure with pacificorp lasted over years while trujillo was employed by the company for eight years.as employees,the trujillos participated in the employer provided health insurance plan.the trujillos son,charlie,was also covered by the plan.charlie suffered from a brain tumor which later metastasized to his spine.the trujillos used their available health insurance benefits to cover the treatment of their son.it is unclear from the record when it was first discovered charlie had a brain tumor,but he suffered a relapse on may,and was deemed to be in the final stages of cancer.charlie medical care providers recommended aggressive experimental treatments to reverse the progression of the disease.treatment began immediately.in six weeks,charlie medical bills exceeded.charlie died in.
pacificorp employees at both the local and corporate level were aware of charlie condition,his relapse,and his need for experimental treatment.being a self insured company,insurance claims for charlie healthcare were paid directly by pacificorp.as with most modern businesses,healthcare costs were a concern at the local and corporate level.it was understood at the plant that a small percentage of employees with catastrophic injuries drive health care costs up.one executive commented that of all healthcare costs were incurred as result of only of the employees.charlie was one of only two people with a terminal illness during the relevant time period.
demonstrating the company keen eye on costs,healthcare costs for each employee were factored into the plant budget line item for labor costs.bob arambel,the plant manager,testified that employees were being asked to foot more of the bill for health insurance.as a result,the labor union and the company would meet annually to review the past year health care claims and claims experiences,and to discuss cost sharing by increasing employee premiums.in fact,healthcare costs were of such concern that,just before charlie relapse,the company asked the state of wyoming for a utility rate increase.in part,the company justified its request on significantly increased healthcare costs.
pacificorp designated claims of over as ones.charlie medical expenses during his relapse exceeded that figure by at least.on june,just eleven days after charlie relapse,the company began an investigation into suspected time theft by the trujillos.the investigation resulted in the termination of the couple.the plant manager,bob arambel,as well as two other managers from the labor relations group,participated in the decision to terminate them.
the investigation of the trujillos focused on time allegedly falsely reported during a planned outage.during an outage,one of the plant turbines would undergo regularly needed maintenance.when this additional activity occurred,the normal routine of the plant changed and the employees hours and supervisors changed.employees worked on specialized crews and often worked overtime to complete the turbine maintenance quickly.
to record their time at the plant,the trujillos kept time sheets,as did other employees.because there was not a time clock requiring employees to punch in and out during a shift,supervisors verified and approved time kept based on their observations of employees during the workday.although time sheets were supposed to be turned in and reviewed at the end of each day,supervisors did not always follow this procedure.sometimes,employees filled out time sheets well after the dates worked.similarly,so that time could be determined for a certain pay period,sometimes employees were asked to fill out time sheets in advance.in addition,supervisors and foremen sometimes permitted employees to leave early but record a full shift.each supervisor had his own method of managing time sheets and the time he permitted employees to record.
traffic and pedestrian gates are located at the perimeters of the plant.the gates were not intended as a method of keeping track of hours worked,but rather as a security measure.to access the gates,employees were required to use a personal identification card to open the gates or to sign in and out as they went through the gates.employees often entered and exited the security gates with another employee,however,in which case only one employee would swipe their card to open the gates.this practice was known as piggybacking.despite the gates security purpose,their use by every employee during each entry and exit was not strictly enforced.
the investigation of the trujillos was conducted by larry cundick,one of trujillo regular supervisors,paul fahlsing,cundick supervisor,and rick jones,a labor relations consultant at the plant.cundick began the investigation after he was asked to sign trujillo timesheets on behalf of one of his supervisors during the outage.although the security gates had not previously been used to verify time sheets,cundick decided to compare trujillo time sheets with the security gate log list of entries and exits.he found that for the period of may through june,the time cards and gate logs showed discrepancies.because and trujillo often carpooled to work,pacificorp assumed the couple would be at work at the same times.on that assumption,pacificorp also compared trujillo time sheets and gate records with her husband time sheets and gate records.time and gate records of spouses had not been previously used to verify individual employee work hours.the comparison revealed there were times when one spouse was there and the other was not.further discrepancies were found between trujillo individual time sheets and gate logs.thus began the investigation of both trujillos.
trujillo was contacted on june regarding the time discrepancies revealed by the comparison of his time sheets to the security gate logs and to his wife time sheets and gate logs.while trujillo could explain some of the problems with his time sheets,he generally could not recall whether he was working or not during times for which he was asked to account.he informed management employees that due to his son condition and his own mental health,he was under a severe amount of stress.three days after the initial meeting,pacificorp contacted him again.during this meeting,trujillo mental health was discussed trujillo disclosed that he was taking medications and was attempting to get additional mental healthcare but that his doctor was not available for another two weeks.no specific discussion of alleged time theft incidences is evidenced in the record.
on june,pacificorp sent trujillo a termination letter citing a total of ten incidents of time theft.as reason for trujillo termination,pacificorp alleged trujillo intentionally falsified time records to show that he worked hours of regular time and six hours of overtime for the time period of april through may.
bob arambel testified that the decision to terminate trujillo was made at approximately the same time as the decision to terminate trujillo.prior to the decision to terminate trujillo,the company had spoken with her only once regarding time sheet discrepancies.in that telephone call,while trujillo was attending to her son in a denver hospital,she was asked to explain time discrepancies as far back as april.she advised that she could not recall specifics,but that the gate logs did not necessarily reveal her presence or absence at the plant she explained that she often went to her vehicle during the work day to get groceries or other things,and while she used her identification card to exit the gates,she did not always use it to reenter because the gates were open or she piggybacked into the plant.on days when trujillo left early,she occasionally would exit the gates with him to obtain something from their vehicle and then return to the plant,sometimes piggybacking then as well.when trujillo left early,a would give her a ride home.
pacificorp made a call to trujillo on june.at that time,she gave the same explanation for the discrepancies the gate logs were not necessarily reflective of the times she worked.she also recalled that she had previously turned in revised time cards to one of her supervisors.a final discussion regarding trujillo time theft was held in august after she returned to work from caring for her son.to substantiate her previous claims,trujillo was asked to provide names of employees with whom she had ridden in or out of plant and employees who had given her a ride home.although the employees did not give specific dates and times that trujillo piggybacked,they were able to confirm that they had given her rides in and out of the plant and to home during the relevant time period.nonetheless,trujillo was terminated on august.in the termination letter,pacificorp alleged she intentionally falsified time records to show that she had worked hours of regular time and hours of overtime for the time period of april through may.
we review the district court decision de novo,applying the same legal standards applicable in the district court,including a view of the evidence in the light most favorable to the trujillos and drawing all inferences in their favor.bci bottling,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
the trujillos claim they were terminated because of the healthcare costs associated with their son illness.title i of the ada provides covered employers shall not discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.pacificorp is a covered employer subject to requirements of the ada.disability discrimination includes excluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or benefits to a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a relationship or association.id.at b.this prohibition is known as the association provision of the ada.see den hartog wasatch,cir.a family relationship is the paradigmatic example of a relationship under the association provision of the ada.id.citing.the trujillos relationship to their son is protected by the association provision.
to succeed on appeal,the trujillos must satisfy the four elements of the prima facie case of ada association discrimination,which we enumerated in den hartog as follows 
the plaintiff was qualified for the job at the time of the adverse employment action 
the plaintiff was subjected to adverse employment action 
the plaintiff was known by his employer at the time to have a relative or associate with a disability 
the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances raising a reasonable inference that the disability of the relative or associate was a determining factor in the employer decision.
id.at.under the familiar mcdonnell douglas burden shifting framework,the burden shifts to pacificorp to proffer a legitimate,reason for terminating the trujillos if the trujillos establish a prima facie case of an association discrimination claim.id.once pacificorp proffers a nondiscriminatory reason,the burden shifts back to the trujillos to provide evidence that the stated reason is pretextual.id.to show pretext,the trujillos must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by pacificorp were not its true reasons,but were a pretext for discrimination.texas of cmty.affairs burdine,d.at this stage,the trier of fact may consider evidence establishing the prima facie case and inferences properly drawn therefrom on the issue of whether the defendant explanation is pretextual.reeves sanderson plumbing,d quoting burdine,at.
prima facie case 
the district court determined the trujillos met the first three elements of the prima facie ada association discrimination test,and pacificorp does not contest that determination.as to the fourth prong,the court held the trujillos failed to raise a reasonable inference that the disability of charlie was a determining factor in pacificorp decision to terminate them.
in granting pacificorp summary judgment,the district court relied heavily on larimer int l bus.machs,cir.in larimer,the plaintiff claimed he was terminated because his twin daughters were born prematurely and thus had the potential to cost his employer greatly in medical benefits.id.at.the plaintiff asserted reason for the termination led the court to categorize three types of ada association discrimination cases.
the categories can be illustrated as follows an employee is fired or suffers some other adverse personnel action because expense his spouse has a disability that is costly to the employer because the spouse is covered by the company health plan disability by association the employee homosexual companion is infected with hiv and the employer fears that the employee may also have become infected,through sexual contact with the companion another example of disability by association one of the employee blood relatives has a disabling ailment that has a genetic component and the employee is likely to develop the disability as well maybe the relative is an identical twin distraction the employee is somewhat inattentive at work because his spouse or child has a disability that requires his attention,yet not so inattentive that to perform to his employer satisfaction he would need an accommodation,perhaps by being allowed to work shorter hours.
id.at.although it conceded that the case did not fit neatly into any of these categories,the court analyzed it as an expense case.id.at.because larimer could not show his supervisors had a financial stake in the company performance and thus a stake,however attenuated,in the firing of an expensive employee,the court held that he could not satisfy the final element of his association discrimination claim.id.at.
taking guidance from larimer,the district court here designated this as an expense case and focused on the evidence suggesting that the healthcare costs of charlie cancer motivated pacificorp to terminate his parents.the expense factor dominated the court decision.without evidence of corporate tracking of health benefits in the budget or a tie between compensation and healthcare savings or similar evidence,the court held the trujillos could not make a direct link between charlie illness and the asserted illegal motive to terminate them,vol.i at.the court then considered circumstantial evidence of the expense factor.here too,the court held the trujillos fell short.it characterized the trujillos circumstantial evidence as general corporate statements about health care a corporate understanding that a minority of individual employees are responsible for a majority of corporate health care expenditures and pacificorp use of rising health care costs to justify rate increases.id.at.the court concluded that if such a general concern were enough to raise the reasonable inference of disability discrimination it would almost always be possible because employee health care costs are a pervasive concern of business managers and owners.id.at.although the court referred to the matter as a close case,id.at,it found the evidence presented to be insufficient and concluded summary judgment was warranted.
considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the trujillos and our case law on establishing discriminatory motive,we disagree.under the totality of the circumstances approach,the trujillos raised the necessary reasonable inference of discriminatory motive to establish a prima facie case of association discrimination.see butler city of prairie,cir applying totality of circumstances approach in ada discrimination case.in so deciding,we consider the evidence presented regarding pacificorp concerns about the cost of charlie illness and the temporal proximity between charlie relapse and the terminations.
in larimer,the court noted that the plaintiff made no effort to pitch his case on the ground that the company had a stake,however attenuated,in firing an expensive employee.at.a thorough review of the record reveals the trujillos not only made the effort but also established the necessary connection.as enumerated in the background facts,the trujillos offered everything from evidence of general concerns about the rising cost of healthcare to the specific facts that charlie claims were considered high dollar,that there was only one other terminal illness during the relevant time period,and that pacificorp was keeping tabs on those claims while pacificorp seems to suggest the trujillos needed direct evidence that the company was monitoring the individual costs being incurred by the trujillos son for medical treatment,aple.br.at,they only needed to present enough evidence for a reasonable inference of that premise to arise.see butler,at holding plaintiff could establish prima facie elements of discrimination through circumstantial evidence.the facts in the record raise such an inference.
highlighting that evidence,we note that,contrary to the district court assertion otherwise,the trujillos presented evidence that insurance costs factored into the budget line item for labor costs of each employee.larimer indicates this evidence weighs heavily in favor of demonstrating motive to discriminate against an expensive employee,and we agree.a manager would care about the actual expense for health services to the relatives of an employee in his unit because that expense would be in his budget.larimer,at.evidencing that management knew about the cost of charlie healthcare,the trujillos offer an email regarding trujillo personal leave related to charlie illness in which the company stated it monitored both health and welfare benefits in conjunction with an employee personal leave.from the evidence the trujillos about rising healthcare costs,numerous efforts to cut those costs,corporate monitoring of general healthcare costs and of charlie claims jury could reasonably infer that pacificorp terminated the trujillos because they were expensive employees.
when we also consider the temporal proximity between charlie relapse and the investigation of the trujillos,we are persuaded the trujillos established the necessary inference that pacificorp wanted to rid itself of these employees because their son terminal illness made them too expensive.the trujillos strongest evidence of discriminatory motive is found in the temporal proximity between the time of charlie relapse and the investigation of the alleged time theft and their termination.yet the district court only made a passing reference to the timing and quality of the investigation,aplt,vol.at,concluding the evidence was insufficient to establish the necessary reasonable inference of discriminatory motive.our case law requires the opposite conclusion.
depending on the specific facts of the case,temporal proximity can contribute to an inference of discrimination.see butler,at temporal proximity between ada plaintiff request for accommodation and decline in his work evaluations and satisfaction with his work performance contributed to discriminatory inference.the closer in time a protected action the claims resulting from charlie relapse is followed by an adverse action the investigation and termination,the more likely temporal proximity will support an inference of discrimination.see anderson coors brewing,cir.here the time period between the adverse employment action and the protected activity is less than three weeks as to trujillo and approximately six weeks as to trujillo.
close temporal proximity is important in establishing a prima facie case of association discrimination case.den hartog specifically references consideration of the circumstances under which the adverse action arose as part of the fourth prong of the prima facie case.den hartog,at.this is appropriate given the difficulty in establishing an expense case.as is the case of discrimination claims in general,direct evidence of discrimination resulting from costs to the company will be rare.phelps field real estate,cir.where as here,the temporal proximity is close,it is a circumstance that should be given considerable weight 
against the backdrop of the concerns about rising healthcare costs and,more specifically,the awareness of the high cost of charlie healthcare,the temporal proximity between charlie relapse and the decision to terminate both trujillos powerfully demonstrates the necessary reasonable inference that pacificorp terminated the trujillos for an illegal reason.with this evidence,the trujillos have established a prima facie case of association discrimination in the expense category.
legitimate business reason and pretext 
once the prima facie case is established,we look at the proffered nondiscriminatory reason for the termination.pacificorp asserts that the trujillos intentionally falsified time records in order to earn compensation for time they had not worked.the trujillos do not argue that pacificorp proffered reason for their terminations is not a basis for firing them,only that it is a pretextual reason.to defeat pacificorp claim on summary judgment,the plaintiff burden is only to demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the proffered reasons were unworthy of belief.morgan hilti,cir.
pretext can be shown by such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted reasons.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.as with the prima facie case,there is no one specific mode of evidence required to establish the discriminatory inference.see healthcare,cir.rather,pretext can be shown in a variety of ways,including but not limited to differential treatment of similarly situated employees and procedural irregularities.the former is especially relevant where the defendant has proffered a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action.id.at.
the trujillos offered evidence regarding the differential treatment of similarly situated employees for example,approximately four weeks prior to trujillo termination,another long term employee,linda todd,was under investigation by the same management employees for two separate incidents in which she made threats of violence against other employees.during the course of the investigation,todd maintained that stress caused her behavior.she was initially put on short term disability leave until her situation improved,although she was ultimately terminated for working while on that leave,drug and alcohol abuse and workplace violence.the treatment of todd differs drastically from the treatment of both trujillos.rather than progressively discipline the trujillos,taking into consideration their past performance and their current situation,pacificorp immediately terminated them.the trujillos also presented evidence of a situation in which an employee was not terminated after committing serious misconduct by viewing pornography twice on company computers.finally,severely undermining the company claim that time theft resulted in immediate termination,the trujillos offered evidence that many other employees were punished with days without pay,rather than termination,for time sheet violations.this disparate treatment of similarly situated employees contributes to a reasonable inference of pretext,defeating pacificorp claimed legitimate business reason for terminating the trujillos.
we also note the inferences that can be drawn from the irregularity of pacificorp actions in the course of the time theft investigation.evidence presented to the district court indicates that comparing an employee time sheets to his gate log records was an unreliable method of dete
