background 
the demise of the soviet union in the early had a direct impact upon the defense industry in the united states.as the industry reshaped itself,the martin marietta corporation now lockheed martin or lockheed acquired the general electric company ge aerospace division in a bewilderingly complex transaction that closed in early april the deal.in the deal,lockheed agreed to hire all ge aerospace employees,and to give them employee benefits that were substantially similar to their ge benefits.to implement that promise,a portion of ge pension assets was to be transferred the pension asset transfer to lockheed to fund the pension obligations lockheed was to assume for those employees.
shortly before closing,plaintiffs who were then employees of ge and unhappy with the deal instituted this action,seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the pension asset transfer.the transfer,however,proceeded when the united states district court for the district of connecticut arterton,refused to block it.
while moving for the injunction,the plaintiffs also requested relief that would preserve their right to remain participants in the ge pension plan the ge plan,and alleged that ge and lockheed had violated a fiduciary duty to give them full information about their pension benefit rights that ge investment of pension funds in united states was imprudent and violations of the employee retirement income security act erisa.
in september flanigan i,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs claims that they had a right to remain in the ge plan and ge had violated erisa.in ruling on both ge and lockheed lockheed had been named as a knowing participant in the alleged to dismiss,the court found that the plaintiffs had no unconditional right to remain participants in the ge plan after they were no longer ge employees.the court also held that neither the pension asset transfer itself nor the amount of the transfer violated erisa.the district court,however,refused to dismiss plaintiffs attack on ge investment the investment claim,or their claim that defendants had failed to provide sufficient information concerning their pension rights the communications claim.the district court then requested an amended complaint.
plaintiffs complied with the court request,and a month later,filed an amended complaint reasserting the investment claim and formally adding lockheed as a defendant in the action.plaintiffs also reasserted the communications claim,and added two new claims against lockheed that at some unspecified time after closing,the new lockheed pension plan the lockheed plan experienced a partial termination,thereby entitling plaintiffs to a vesting of accrued benefits and an allocation of surplus assets the partial termination claim and that lockheed had impermissibly reduced accrued benefits by permitting two special benefit features carried over from the ge special early retirement option sero and the plant closing pension option pcpo to expire.
after another round of motions in september flanigan ii,the court rejected plaintiffs claim that benefits had been impermissibly reduced when lockheed eliminated the sero and pcpo options.however,the court let stand the investment claim,the communications claim and the partial termination claim.a year later,the court conditionally certified two of plaintiffs to pursue these remaining claims.
one included all former ge employees who had retired or resigned from ge between the announcement of the deal and its closing.they challenged the nature and timing of the information provided by ge and lockheed regarding the benefits that lockheed was to offer transferring employees after the closing the communications claim.
two comprised former ge employees who had actually transferred and had gone to work at lockheed.they challenged the procedure by which ge and lockheed arranged the transfer of an initial billion in pension assets from one plan to another the investment claim.two also made a claim against just lockheed,alleging that the sequence of consolidation and downsizing moves after the sale constituted a partial plan termination under erisa the partial termination claim.
following extensive discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.it was granted by the district court.see flanigan,d flanigan iii.in its decision,the court first addressed the investment claim,and concluded that no fiduciary breach had occurred as a result of the ge plan billion t bill investment.specifically,it held that in the transaction both lockheed and ge were acting as settlors,and not fiduciaries,and that even if ge could be considered a fiduciary,it had fulfilled its duties as such.
the district court next addressed the communications claim,and concluded that lockheed had no fiduciary duties of communication to one plaintiffs because erisa does not cover prospective employees ge breached no disclosure duties because it did not know the final details of the new lockheed plan and in any event,the plaintiffs had enough information to make informed decisions about their employment.finally,the district court addressed the partial termination claim and found that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their internal remedies.
plaintiffs now appeal on a host of issues,claiming that the district court erred in both of its earlier dismissals flanigan i ii,as well as in granting summary judgment to defendants flanigan iii.more particularly,plaintiffs claim that they had the right to stay in the ge plan rather than join the lockheed plan the defendants violated erisa fiduciary duty rules,erisa rules prohibiting certain transactions,and its rules barring unlawful inurement when ge converted pension assets during the pension asset transfer they suffered from an illegal cutback of their sero and pcpo benefits there are triable issues as to whether defendants failed to comply with their fiduciary duties to provide complete and accurate benefits information on a timely basis there are triable issues as to whether defendants violated their fiduciary duties by engaging in the investment and there are triable issues as to whether a partial termination of the lockheed plan occurred.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
discussion 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see adjustrite,gab bus,cir.
under federal rule of civil procedure c,a court shall grant a motion for summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also silver city,cir.the party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of establishing that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the undisputed facts establish her right to judgment as a matter of law.rodriguez.city of new york,cir.in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,a court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
i.there was no abdication of fiduciary duties 
plaintiffs contend that both ge and lockheed were their fiduciaries under erisa,and that both companies failed to live up to their fiduciary duties.specifically,plaintiffs argue that ge and lockheed failed to comply with their fiduciary duty to provide complete and accurate benefits information failed to comply with their fiduciary duty to invest plan assets productively and prudently when they engaged in the investment and breached their fiduciary duty by engaging in a prohibited transaction that violated erisa unlawful inurement rules by wrongly converting pension assets during the pension asset transfer.we address each claim in turn.
a.the communications claim 
plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred by rejecting their claim that ge breached its fiduciary duty by not disclosing quickly enough the exact employee benefits that plaintiffs would receive when they moved over to lockheed.specifically,they assert that ge fuzzy representations that the lockheed benefits would be substantially similar or essentially equal
