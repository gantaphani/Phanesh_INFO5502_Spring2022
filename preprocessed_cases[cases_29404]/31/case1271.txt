plaintiff douglas moffett appeals from the dismissal with prejudice of his complaint alleging various erisa and wyoming state law violations by defendants halliburton energy services,two halliburton entities,and hartford life accident insurance.we affirm.
background 
moffett was employed by halliburton as a cementer from to.during this time,halliburton maintained an income disability plan,which was subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.defendant trustees of the halliburton company employees trust trustees,was initially responsible for administering the plan.the trustees,in turn,created defendant energy services group human resources committee committee,and delegated to the committee the responsibility of functioning as plan administrator 
during his employment,which involved heavy labor,moffett suffered back injuries,as a result of which he qualified for long term disability payments of,initially,per month,effective june.moffett also applied for and ultimately was awarded a permanent partial disability award from the wyoming workers compensation fund totaling.moffett utilized the award for bills and other obligations and expenses,while continuing to receive monthly payments of from the halliburton plan.during the negotiation of moffett final wyoming workers compensation fund award,neither halliburton nor hartford ever alleged that they were entitled to offset that award against the disability payments they had been making to moffett.
at some point in or,defendant hartford life accident insurance agreed to provide administer insurance and other benefits neither the record nor the briefs assist us in the specifics of this agreement to halliburton employees,including moffett.hartford began providing some services to halliburton in connection with its plan,including the determination of benefit claims.in any event,on december,the halliburton defendants and hartford entered into an agreement,entitled the claim reserve agreement,pursuant to which halliburton reserves,totaling,were transferred to hartford as a premium for an insurance policy from hartford.hartford then insured benefit claims under the plan.it is unclear who the plan administrator was following the execution of the buy out agreement,although there is some evidence in the record that the halliburton company benefits committee was designated as the plan administrator.
hartford sent moffett a letter on may,terminating his monthly disability payments,asserting that hartford and halliburton were entitled to a setoff for the workers compensation permanent partial disability award he had previously received.on august,moffett received a disability determination from social security,and he began receiving monthly payments of in november.
during the subsequent months,moffett and hartford exchanged correspondence,during which moffett endeavored to determine why his benefits had been discontinued and hartford continued to refuse to provide moffett with any disability payments.in particular,moffett alleges he sent correspondence to defendants on june,july,and august,generally requesting review and rescission of the may,decision,plaintiff first amended complaint at b,appellant,app.app at,and informing defendants that the workers compensation award was not a tort settlement and that he had not received a total disability award from anyone.id.finally,on february,hartford sent moffett a letter explaining that it had incorrectly terminated his benefits,and it subsequently reimbursed moffett approximately for benefits wrongfully withheld.moffett does not dispute that he has received all benefits to which he is entitled.
this action followed,in which moffett alleged that halliburton,the trustees and the committee breached fiduciary duties under erisa,including the reporting and disclosure requirements,particularly,and,and subjecting them to the penalties and remedial provisions of and.he alleges that the belated award of erroneously failed to include statutory penalties,consequential damages,attorney fees and costs,and any other remedial or equitable remedies available under erisa.at b,app.at.he also asserted claims for waiver and estoppel 
moffett also brought a claim against hartford for the tort of insurance bad faith,id.at d,app.at,as well as a claim under.stat.ann.for failure to act in a timely manner and unreasonably denying an insurance payment.he alleged alternative claims against hartford,asserting the same erisa violations as against the other defendants,in the event hartford is deemed an administrator or fiduciary under erisa.in addition to the damages discussed above,moffett also sought punitive damages.
the halliburton defendants filed a motion to dismiss under.b for failure to state a claim or,alternatively,a motion for a more definite statement under rule e.they argued that moffett failed to adequately allege any erisa violation,and that he has identified no form of relief,equitable or otherwise,to which he would be entitled under erisa where he has already received,albeit belatedly,the full benefits owed him.defendant hartford also asserted that moffett state law claims against it were preempted by erisa.the district court agreed with all defendants and dismissed moffett complaint with prejudice.
moffett appeals,arguing the district court erred in dismissing his complaint without declaring moffett entitlement to benefits without set off by defendants,appellant br.at dismissing his complaint for the failure or refusal of the halliburton defendants to comply with the mandatory reporting requirements of erisa and the refusal to provide requested information,id.at,dismissing his complaint alleging that the halliburton defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the claim reserve buy out agreement dismissing his claims for statutory penalties and money damages under erisa and dismissing his state law claims against hartford as preempted.

focusing strictly on the allegations in moffett complaint,we agree with the district court and defendants that he has failed to state a claim for a violation of erisa.we consider moffett claims,as articulated in his complaint,against the halliburton defendants and against hartford in turn.
claims against halliburton defendants 
moffett complaint contains three primary groups of claims against the halliburton defendants.he also scatters throughout his complaint references to other erisa provisions.first,moffett alleges that defendants are in violation of erisa,and subject to statutory penalties,including but not limited to those referenced in,which provides for defendants to be personally liable to plaintiff in the amount of per day for enumerated violations.at,app.at.
section a a of erisa permits a participant or beneficiary to bring an action for the relief provided in subsection c which,in turn,provides a penalty for an administrator who fails to meet the requirements of section or section e or who fails or refuses to comply with a request for any information which such administrator is required by this subchapter to furnish.c a and b.section of erisa applies to group health plans,not disability income plans.section e of erisa references transfers by employee pension benefit plans to health benefits accounts.accordingly,neither section has any applicability to this case.except as discussed more fully below,moffett does not identify what information required by this subchapter he requested and did not receive.thus,he has failed to state a claim under section a a.
section a b of erisa permits a participant or beneficiary to bring an action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.erisa further permits an action by a participant or beneficiary to obtain other appropriate equitable relief.a b.
assuming moffett seeks relief under section a b,the conduct moffett alleges is redressable under section consisted of defendants 
fail ure to provide written notice 
fail ure to provide adequate notice in writing setting forth the specific reasons for the denial,written in a manner reasonably calculated to be understood by the participant as required by usc 
fail ure to provide opportunity for a full and fair review of the decision denying the claim,as required by usc and 
fail ure to provide plaintiff with information as required by erisa.
at,app.at.thus,the only acts moffett alleges violate section a b are purported violations of sections and.
we first note that moffett first and fourth claims,alleging failure to provide written notice and failure to provide information as required by erisa,are vague and conclusory.we have held that an erisa claim based upon an alleged failure to provide information is subject to dismissal under rule b where the plaintiff fails to identify what information he alleges was wrongfully withheld.see maez mountain states and,cir.
additionally,and more fundamentally,when moffett accuses the defendants of failing to provide him with information about the reasons for the denial of his benefits any avenues for review of that denial,he inadequately alleges a violation of section because that section requires every employee benefit plan to provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.similarly,the plan must afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claims for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.moffett makes no allegations about the plan failure to provide notice or other information.he alleges that the halliburton defendants failed in that regard.however,an alleged failure by the employer or the plan administrator to provide such notice opportunity is not a violation of section.see walter int l ass of machs.pension fund,cir.
in his second group of claims,moffett amended complaint charged that defendants were under and owed plaintiff a fiduciary duty pursuant to the provisions of erisa et,app.at.he further alleges that defendants breached the fiduciary duty owed pursuant to erisa and to plaintiff.id.at.those conclusory allegations fail to establish the basis for an alleged breach of fiduciary duties 
moffett third group of claims is entitled waiver,estoppel and attorney fees and costs.as indicated,he does not pursue these on appeal.
in addition to those three groups of claims,moffett alleges general violations of erisa as follows failure to provide written notice and information required pursuant to erisa at the time of commencement of coverage under the plan,id.at b,app.at,as well as breach of fiduciary obligations owed pursuant to erisa at the time of commencement of coverage under the plan.id.at.he further asserts that the halliburton defendants failed to inform him that they had entered into the agreement,but he does not articulate how that violated erisa.he also alleges that,following the execution of the agreement,the halliburton defendants did not provide the name and address of the plan administrator,other information required pursuant to erisa.id.at,app.at.these vague and general allegations fail to state a claim for a violation of erisa.
moffett also lists the following series of alleged statutory violations following the execution of the claim reserve buy out agreement,he claims the halliburton defendants failed to provide the protections afforded pursuant to erisa and the plan,including but not limited to the protections and guarantees afforded by,and.id.at,app.at.he further alleges that defendants failed to furnish plan beneficiaries and participants with a written plan or summary thereof with information regarding modifications of and to the plan or summary and required written notice.id.at a c,app.at.he repeats his allegations of failure to provide him with the reasons for the denial of his benefits and any review mechanism thereof.id.at d e.moffett also alleges that defendants committed some error violation in entering into the buy out agreement,but he alleges no provision of erisa allegedly violated thereby.id.at f.
sections of erisa set forth reporting and disclosure requirements for plan administrators,see,and include the obligation to provide participants with summary plan descriptions,including descriptions of any changes and modifications of the plan.moffett concedes that he did not notify defendants that he had never received any such information,nor did he allege that he ever asked for it prior to this lawsuit.at oral argument on appeal,moffett conceded that the only remedy he seeks for these violations is a declaratory judgment directing defendants to provide information to moffett and all other plan participants.since he failed to seek such a declaratory judgment before the district court,however,we will not consider his request on appeal.
sections,and provide for remedies for a breach of fiduciary duty,see and,and we have explained,supra,that moffett failed to state a claim for breach of any fiduciary duties.we have also explained,supra,that moffett failed to state a claim for a violation of section which would implicate the remedial provisions of section.
finally,moffett seeks a variety of remedies for all of the alleged erisa violations,but he pursues none which are actually available under erisa.his complaint requests any relief authorized pursuant to or,and specifically including equitable and remedial remedies.at,app.at.more specifically,he seeks 
a the maximum penalties allowed pursuant to erisa,b attorney fees,c costs and expenses,and,in the event that it is determined that erisa is inapplicable does not bar other claims,d loss of income,loss of property,loss of credit and credit reputation,mental and emotional distress,pain and suffering,loss of enjoyment of life and punitive damages,f remedies and relief afforded by et.for breach of duty by d efendants including remedial,equitable or other remedies provided for by and,and e such other damages and relief as may be allowed by law.
id.at b,app.at.
as indicated above,he failed to adequately allege a violation of section c,which provides for a statutory penalty of per day.with respect to the other,remedies he pursues,he did not identify in his complaint what specific equitable relief he desires to the extent we read his complaint as seeking remedies damages,in the form of monetary compensation for economic or other harm suffered because of the delay in his receipt of his benefits,we agree with the district court that those remedies are not available under erisa.see life ann.ins.knudson,d section a,by its terms,only allows for equitable relief.massachusetts mut.life ins.russell,d t he relevant text of erisa,the structure of the entire statute,and its legislative history all support the conclusion that in a congress did not provide,and did not intend the judiciary to imply,a cause of action for damages caused by improper or untimely processing of benefit claims.kerr charles vatterott,cir the supreme court confirmed that section a recovery is limited to classic equitable remedies such as injunctive,restitutionary,or mandamus relief,and does not extend to compensatory damages.
we accordingly affirm the district court grant of the halliburton defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.we turn now to moffett claims against hartford.
