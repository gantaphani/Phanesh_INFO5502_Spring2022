victor washington is a former player in the national football league.he was a participant in the bert bell nfl player retirement plan the old plan until it was amended and merged with the pete rozelle nfl player retirement plan on march,to become the bert rozelle nfl player retirement plan the new plan.he is now a participant in the plan.both plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,and administered by a retirement board board.
unfortunately,washington professional career was plagued by injuries.he was a running back and kick returner who began playing in the nfl in.he came over from the canadian football league having already suffered a knee injury that required surgery.while playing in the nfl,he hurt his ankle,cracked his knee cap,and underwent surgery on his left shoulder and elbow.washington left football in.
his claims history started in and is extensive.greatly simplifying it,a player must be totally and permanently disabled since leaving the nfl,washington has suffered stress disorder and depression.he has sometimes worked,sometimes not.medical opinions have differed as to whether he was totally disabled or could perform some type of work.
washington first claim was made in for total and permanent disability benefits under the old plan.the old plan classified temporary and permanent disability benefits as football or.football benefits were paid where the disability resulted from a football injury.benefits at the football level were greater than for disabilities the board three of whom are appointed by the national football league players association and three by the nfl management council deadlocked on washington claim,and referred the issues of total and permanent disability,as well as the cause of disability,to arbitration.on july,the arbitrator,sam kagel,awarded washington benefits as of august,but denied football benefits based on the arbitrator interpretation of the phrase,a football injury,as requiring that a player disability be linked to a single football injury.the arbitrator found that washington medical experts had not pointed to a injury that resulted in his having to leave football and the psychiatrists had not identified a injury as solely responsible for washington psychological problems.washington did not litigate the issue further.
in the same time frame,kagel decided a series of cases involving other former nfl players in which he applied essentially the same criteria that included,in particular,his view that a player would be eligible for football benefits under the old plan only if he incurred his disability from a single football injury.the board,in turn,relied on the kagel criterion of one identifiable football injury in denying donald brumm request for football benefits in may.brumm took his case to federal court.it ended up in the eighth circuit court of appeals,which,on june,rejected as unreasonable the same interpretation of the phrase,a football injury,in the old plan that the arbitrator had applied to washington claim.brumm bert bell nfl ret.plan,cir.the opinion recites the course of negotiations between the players and owners that produced the football system in the old plan.see id.at.the court agreed with brumm that this system was meant to be a football versus distinction rather than the single injury versus multiple or cumulative injury construction adopted by kagel and the board.thus,the court concluded 
to require that disability result from a single,identifiable football injury when the relevant plan language speaks of a football injury incurred while an active player is to place undue and inappropriate emphasis on the word a.injury can mean either an act or a result involving an impairment or destruction of health.therefore,the key phrase from section,a football injury,could refer to either a single injury act or a cumulative one result.
brumm,at internal citation omitted.
after brumm,the nfl management council and the nfl players association agreed on the new plan as part of a new collective bargaining agreement.the new plan,of which washington was notified december,and which became effective as of july,eliminated the football and categories of total and permanent disability benefits under the old plan,replacing them with four new categories active football,active nonfootball,football degenerative,and inactive football degenerative benefits are paid where the total and permanent disability arises out of league football activities and inactive benefits are paid where the disability arises from other than league football activities.washington benefits under the old plan were treated as inactive benefits under the new plan,and were increased from per month to per month as of the plan effective date in july 
if eligible for benefits at the football degenerative level,washington would have received no less than monthly.on february,he requested reclassification of his new plan benefits to football degenerative.the board denied his request on april,advising washington that it had determined that his disability did not arise out of league football activities.washington appealed,and retained an attorney with spence,moriarty schuster to represent him.new information was submitted,washington was referred to a neutral psychiatrist whose report was favorable to his position,and a copy of the supplemental plan and its summary plan description was sent to counsel protracted negotiations resulted in a settlement agreement,executed december,which acknowledges that washington asked the board to reclassify his benefit from inactive to football degenerative under section c of the new plan,that the request was rejected,and that the parties wish to resolve their dispute concerning classification of washington total and permanent disability benefit.the resolution was for the plan to pay washington a substantial amount in a lump sum,for the plan to continue to pay inactive benefits without requiring washington to undergo periodic examinations,and for washington to release the plan from any claim for disability benefits.
when washington turned on march,his inactive disability benefit converted to an equal retirement benefit under the new plan.on october,washington again requested that his disability benefits be reclassified at the football degenerative level.the board responded that the settlement agreement released all claims for disability benefits,and that washington had properly converted to retirement benefits at the inactive rate pursuant to of the plan 
sometime in,washington learned about brumm from another former nfl player.he then asked the board for meeting minutes and relevant documents concerning his claims.the plan furnished them in january,together with a cost bill of.
washington filed this action in against the plan and the board to undo the settlement under erisa a,a,on the ground that the plan and the board breached their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose that the ruling in brumm had overturned the criteria used to deny his disability benefits.the district court concluded that knowing about brumm would have made a difference to washington in deciding whether to settle his claim,and thus should have been disclosed.for this reason it granted summary judgment to washington,rescinded the settlement agreement,and reopened washington claim for reclassification.
the plan and board appeal.while a plan fiduciary must disclose information that would be material to a reasonable participant,we disagree with the district court that the holding in brumm would be material to a request for reclassification to football degenerative under the new plan.brumm concerned construction of the old plan whose causation requirement for football resulting from a football injury is different from the new plan requirement that football degenerative disability arise out of league football activities.nothing in the brumm opinion sheds light on what that phrase means.accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment.washington,but we see no error on the issues he raises and affirm as to them.
washington argues that a reasonable person would have wanted to know about the brumm decision overturning the criteria the board had previously used to deny him benefits before agreeing to forfeit significantly higher benefits.he posits that brumm holding would be important to deciding the likelihood of success on his appeal to the board and the relative risks involved,as well as the risks of filing a lawsuit seeking benefits under erisa.thus,he submits,the failure to disclose was material and a breach of fiduciary duty.
rooted in trust law,firestone tire and rubber bruch,d peralta hispanic,cir,erisa imposes fiduciary duties on plan administrators.the duty of loyalty is one of the common law trust principles that apply to erisa fiduciaries,see varity howe,d,and it encompasses a duty to disclose trustees must deal fairly and communicate to the beneficiary all material facts the trustee knows or should know in connection with the transaction.peralta,at quoting restatement second of trusts see also bins exxon,cir en banc violates its duty of loyalty to plan participants by failing to disclose material information barker am.mobil power,cir a fiduciary has an obligation to convey complete and accurate information material to the beneficiary circumstance,even when a beneficiary has not specifically asked for the information.the test is objective,as both parties recognize united states smith,cir noting that the test for materiality in a rule case is whether a reasonable man would attach importance to the fact misrepresented in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question internal quotations omitted see also krohn huron mem l,cir observing,in erisa context,that a misrepresentation is material if there is a substantial likelihood that it would mislead a reasonable employee in making an adequately informed decision in pursuing disability benefits to which she may be entitled fischer phila,cir same.
we can not see how the holding in brumm would inform the process of a reasonable participant in washington position,pursuing a request to upgrade benefits from inactive to football degenerative under the new plan,contemplating settlement of such a request,or assessing the costs and benefits of litigating denial of that request.washington reviewed the new plan documents prior to settling his claim.the new plan football degenerative category provides for benefits of no less than if disability arises out of league football activities,while brumm related entirely to the football category in the old plan,which provided for benefits at that level for a football injury.washington was notified in that his claim for football benefits under the old plan was rejected by the arbitrator because his medical experts had not identified a injury that resulted in his having to leave football and the psychiatrists had not identified a injury as solely responsible for washington psychological problems.by contrast,he was advised in that his request for reclassification under the new plan was rejected by the board because his disability did not arise out of league football activities.brumm bears directly on the former,but not at all on the latter.for this reason,knowing what brumm had to say about the meaning of the phrase,a football injury,would not be helpful to a participant,to a plan administrator,or to a court in arriving at a reasonable construction of league football activities.chappel lab.of,cir holding that a plan administrator who knows,or should know,that a claimant may not be aware of a mandatory arbitration clause and a time limit for seeking arbitration,breaches its fiduciary duty by failing to notify the participant of required procedures.
in these circumstances,we hold that the board and plan did not breach their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose brumm.
in his,washington argues that the district court should have held that the settlement is invalid on the alternative ground that his release of all future benefits claims was not knowing and voluntary.to the extent his argument depends upon his not knowing about brumm,we have already explained why brumm was not material to classification under the new plan.to the extent washington maintains that his release was not knowing and voluntary because he and his attorney believed the waiver only covered claims for disability benefits payable up to age and did not extend to claims for retirement benefits,it fails as washington expressly waived any and all claims for disability benefits of every kind and nature except for those amounts described in the agreement.under of the plan,retirement benefits are paid at the rate of whichever disability category previously applied.accordingly,as the district court pointed out,washington release of any and all claims for disability benefits also constituted a release of all claims for retirement benefits.that consequence is plain from the language of the settlement agreement and the plan.the agreement further acknowledges that e ach party has been represented by counsel of its own choosing and each party and the party representatives have read the agreement and are fully aware of its contents and legal effect.given this,no reasonable trier of fact could find that washington release was not knowing and voluntary.
washington also challenges dismissal of his request that the plan be enjoined from requiring washington to pay for the cost of photocopying his records.however,the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining injunctive relief on the basis that the relief sought was neither ripe nor otherwise warranted.
reversed in part affirmed in part.
i agree with the majority that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award injunctive relief with respect to the board attempted imposition of fees.i further agree that if the eighth circuit decision in brumm bert bell nfl retirement plan,cir,would have been material to a reasonable person decision to enter into the settlement agreement at issue here,the board had a fiduciary duty to disclose it.i disagree,however,with the majority conclusion that brumm was not material to a reasonable employee process in this circumstance,and i therefore dissent from part i of the majority opinion.
we have not yet articulated the test for materiality in the context of an erisa fiduciary failure to disclose.see cal.ironworkers field pension trust loomis sayles,cir agreeing with district courts that facts were not material without articulating standard for materiality.i agree with the majority suggestion,however,that the proper standard for materiality lies in analogous situations involving an erisa fiduciary misrepresentations.see fischer philadelphia,cir concluding that a fiduciary misrepresentation is material if there is a substantial likelihood that it would mislead a reasonable employee in making an adequately informed decision about if and when to retire krohn huron mem l,cir observing that a misrepresentation is material in the erisa context if there is a substantial likelihood that it would mislead a reasonable employee in making an adequately informed decision in pursuing disability benefits to which she may be entitled.
i disagree with the majority conclusion that ignorance of brumm was not substantially likely to have misled a reasonable employee in making an adequately informed decision whether to agree to the december settlement agreement.actually brumm invalidation of the criteria by which the board had previously denied washington claims for benefits would have been material to a reasonable employee in washington position in two ways.
first,knowledge of brumm would likely affect a reasonable employee decision on whether,and for how much,to relinquish his claims under the old plan.even if it were evident from the new plan language that the board could no longer deny washington disability benefits due to washington inability to trace his disability to a single injury,it would not have been evident to washington that the board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in doing so between and.the board notified washington of his increased benefits under the new plan,but did not disclose to him that the criteria it had used in its denial of his claim for benefits had been held unreasonable,and t
