in this case arising under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,plaintiff appellant robert niebauer alleges that the administrator of his former employer executive severance plan denied him severance benefits after erroneously determining that he had retired voluntarily from his position.see a b.niebauer further alleges that his former employer improperly interfered with his rights under the plan,in violation of.the district court granted defendants appellees summary judgment on both counts.see niebauer crane,d.
because we find that the plan administrator decision to deny niebauer claim for benefits was both supported by substantial evidence and procedurally proper,we affirm the district court judgment in that regard.however,we vacate the district court judgment as to the interference claim and remand for application of the correct standard of review.
at the time of the events in question,robert niebauer was the chief technology officer of crane,crane.headquartered in dalton,massachusetts,crane produces specialty paper products,including the banknote paper used for printing united states currency.
crane maintains an executive severance plan plan,under which severance benefits are available to designated employees who have been involuntarily terminated.because the plan is an employee welfare benefit plan,it is governed by erisa,et.employees who voluntarily leave crane are entitled to benefits only if they do so for good reason,which the plan defines as certain changes to an employee position,such as relocation,significant reduction in salary,or substantial changes to the employee job responsibilities the plan reserves to the administrator here,the compensation committee of crane board of directors full discretionary power and authority to construe,interpret and administer the plan and to make benefit eligibility determinations.as a crane executive,niebauer was covered by the plan.
in his capacity as chief technology officer,niebauer reported to the chief executive officer ceo of the company a position occupied,as of october,by stephen defalco,a recent hire.one of defalco priorities upon taking office was repairing a frayed relationship with a significant client of the company,the bureau of engraving and printing bep,a division of the united states department of the treasury.work on the latest bep project,called type v,had stalled as a result of technological difficulties encountered in printing the paper used for banknotes.to address the problems afflicting type v,defalco launched a task force within crane,referred to internally as project momentum,and designated an employee named rich rowe as the project leader.as part of project momentum,defalco decided to station a crane staff member at the bep printing facility in fort worth,texas,who would serve as the company representative and liaison to the massachusetts headquarters.
on november,defalco asked niebauer to serve as the project momentum deputy in texas.niebauer agreed,on the understanding that he was to be in texas only to the end of the calendar year.however,after their conversation,defalco noted in an email to the bep contact that niebauer would spend substantial time at bep facilities until at least march.niebauer began to have second thoughts about the length of the assignment,and also became concerned about personnel decisions that defalco had made in connection with project momentum,including his addition to the massachusetts team of certain individuals whom niebauer felt bep distrusted.
because of these concerns,niebauer and defalco scheduled a phone call for november to review the project personnel and the length of niebauer commitment.the two characterize this call differently.according to defalco,niebauer effectively attempted to extract severance benefits in exchange for agreeing to the texas assignment.according to niebauer,he communicated to defalco that he believed that his new project momentum role constituted a triggering event under the severance plan,entitling him to benefits.in response,niebauer says,defalco called this claim crazy talk,stating that severance was awarded only if an executive was fired,and niebauer was not being fired.niebauer admits to telling defalco that he was in a position of maximum leverage securing severance benefits.in any event,niebauer ultimately recommitted to the texas assignment.
thereafter,team members worked to get project momentum up and running,and scheduled meetings with bep representatives in fort worth for monday,december.niebauer,who had not yet relocated to texas,was slated to make the trip.in an exchange with rowe over the preceding weekend,however,niebauer began to express reluctance to travel and eventually decided not to go.in a december email to rowe,niebauer said that he had made some decisions that he must inform rowe of.niebauer also emailed defalco on december,asking to set up a meeting concern ing a decision he ha d reached.
the ensuing december phone call between niebauer and defalco is a focal point of this litigation the parties vehemently dispute the content and import of the conversation.niebauer account is that he called defalco on his cell phone and told him that his persistent concerns about the structure of project momentum left him no choice but to at least consider retirement if the project organization did not change at some point thereafter,the parties agree that the call was dropped.niebauer asserts that,when the connection was reestablished,defalco rebuffed his offer to repeat what he had said instead,defalco declared that he had heard enough,and that it was his policy not to try to talk an executive out of retirement.according to defalco,however,niebauer told him that he was retir ing now,effective immediately,since he was not going to receive severance at the conclusion of project momentum.defalco told niebauer that he was disappointed but understood his decision to retire and wished him well.
in the aftermath of the december phone call,both niebauer and defalco sent emails to various individuals explaining what had happened.that afternoon,defalco emailed charles kittredge,the former ceo of crane who had stayed on as chairman of the board,letting him know that niebauer had just told defalco that he would be retiring immediately.defalco also informed the project momentum team by email the next day that niebauer had decided to retire and that his last working day was likely to be december.
for his part,niebauer emailed his daughter the morning after his conversation with defalco,telling her that he had made the announcement to defalco that he did not want to go live in fort worth for the next six months and want ed to retire.on the afternoon of december,niebauer also forwarded to defalco an email from a bep contact who was trying to schedule a phone call.in forwarding the email,niebauer asked defalco for guidance in responding to the bep email,noting that he wanted this to be a smooth transition but under stood if defalco wanted to make it more abrupt.niebauer then forwarded the email chain to his wife,who replied,sounds like you told defalco that retirement is route.
following the december call,defalco instructed jay wickliff,the head of human resources at crane,to reach out to niebauer to discuss next steps.wickliff and niebauer met on the morning of december.the parties characterizations of this meeting diverge.niebauer claims that he told wickliff that he had not voluntarily retired but rather defalco had retired him but that if he were going to retire,he would need to learn more about his financial options.crane asserts that niebauer reiterated his decision to retire,and that he and wickliff discussed setting a retirement date that took into account niebauer remaining vacation time.wickliff emailed defalco after the meeting,stating,niebauer confirmed to me this morning his decision to retire.wickliff added,we discussed having some kind of event to honor his career.at first he thought he did not want to do anything,but decided that a low key event would be best.
later that day,defalco posted a message on crane internal communications system formally announcing the launch of project momentum.niebauer name was not included in the list of team members.shortly thereafter,a colleague wrote in an email to niebauer that he had just seen the announcement,which said it all.in the ensuing,niebauer wrote that he believed that his last day of work would be the next day,december,and that his r etirement day would most likely be february.niebauer explained to the colleague that his decision to leave was that in his opinion,the company had become dishonorable.niebauer also emailed rowe,the leader of project momentum,stating,i am assuming that you know about my pending retirement,and that,since the announcement of the project team had been posted without his name,he expected that he would not attend upcoming team meetings.
also on december,niebauer met with rick kendall,who handled retirement calculations for crane executives in conjunction with an outside firm,towers watson,which acted as crane actuarial consultant.niebauer and kendall discussed different options for retirement dates.kendall advised that obtaining a retirement calculation from towers watson did not commit him to retiring,but that if he did retire,he would not be eligible for severance.in email correspondence through december,niebauer asked kendall to use february,as a basis for a retirement calculation,and then later proposed march,as his retirement date.kendall then told niebauer via email on december that his last day of work would be january,followed by five weeks of vacation,for a retirement date of march.shortly thereafter,niebauer wrote in an email to his wife that they could kiss the severance option good bye.
beginning on december,niebauer began unambiguously portraying his retirement as involuntary.when a coworker,chris duquette,emailed him that day to congratulate him on his retirement,niebauer responded,all i have agreed to is to consider retirement and look at the numbers to see if it is possible.around that time,niebauer also approached wickliff the head of human resources to tell him that he had not decided to retire and was not in fact retiring.wickliff responded that niebauer had indeed resigned and the ceo defalco had already accepted his resignation if he wanted his job back,he would have to consult defalco.
defalco called niebauer on december to tell him that that day would be his last working day,but that he would be kept on the company payroll through the end of january.wickliff sent niebauer a letter to a similar effect,which niebauer received on december.following the phone call with defalco on december,niebauer memorialized his disagreement in a letter,sent to defalco by certified mail,writing,i have not resigned from crane and i have no present intention of resigning from crane co t he termination of my employment at this point would be considered involuntary under the executive severance plan.he claimed that this was all a misunderstanding arising out of the december dropped call and that he had never communicated an intent to retire.nonetheless,crane shut off niebauer email and telephone access on december.niebauer did not thereafter report to work.
niebauer filed a claim for severance benefits under the plan on february,on the ground of involuntary termination.the compensation committee the designated plan administrator,responsible for determining niebauer benefits eligibility was scheduled to meet on march.in advance of the meeting,james hackett,general counsel of crane,investigated niebauer claim.he reviewed niebauer email correspondence around the time of his departure and spoke with various crane employees about the circumstances leading up to the departure,including defalco,wickliff,rowe,kendall,and doug crane,a crane vice president.with the help of wickliff and outside counsel,hackett created a timeline of events from november to february to summarize the results of his investigation.
at the compensation committee meeting,hackett presented the timeline he had prepared other documents before the committee included a copy of the plan,certain emails that niebauer had sent in december of and niebauer application for benefits defalco,wickliff,and kittredge also provided relevant information to the committee orally 
the committee issued a written summary of its decision on may,outlining the substance of niebauer claim,relevant plan provisions,and the information presented to the committee.its conclusion was to deny niebauer claim for benefits,given that he had voluntarily elected to resign his employment and therefore was not eligible for a severance benefit pursuant to the plan.the written decision also noted that,pursuant to the terms of the plan,niebauer was entitled to file an appeal within sixty days.
although he had initially submitted his claim without supporting documentation,niebauer appeal of the adverse decision,filed on june,numbered almost seventy pages in length and contained a detailed rebuttal of hackett timeline and various appended emails and documents.niebauer position was that he had never announced an intent to retire,and that crane belief to the contrary was a misunderstanding even though he had attempted to clear up the confusion,crane did not allow him to maintain his employment.
in advance of the august,compensation committee meeting,members were provided with all of the documents that niebauer had submitted in support of his appeal,in addition to a memorandum written by hackett that included,among other things,an explanation of the legal authorities cited in niebauer appeal and copies of certain relevant emails,hackett timeline of events created for the first meeting,and the written summary of the initial decision to deny benefits.at the meeting,the committee unanimously voted to deny niebauer appeal,on the ground that he had resigned his employment without good reason to do so,as defined in the plan.the committee issued a written summary of its decision on september.
on october,niebauer filed suit in the district court against crane and the crane executive severance plan.his complaint sought to recover severance benefits allegedly due under the plan,a b,and also pleaded one count of interference with a protected right.specifically,niebauer alleged that crane terminated his employment against his will and then labeled it as a retirement in order to deprive him of severance pay and other benefits under the plan,thereby discriminating against him for the purpose of interfering with a protected right,in violation of.in total,niebauer sought in damages,plus attorney fees and costs.that amount included in severance benefits,for reimbursement of health insurance premiums,and in back pay.
after ordering additional discovery to fill in gaps in the administrative record,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.the court held that the committee decision to deny niebauer claim for benefits was neither arbitrary nor capricious and was supported by substantial evidence.the court further held that because niebauer could not establish that he had suffered an adverse employment action,he could not make out a prima facie case of interference with a protected right.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,niebauer argues that the compensation committee decision to deny his claim for severance benefits was tainted by a conflict of interest as well as procedural errors,and was not supported by substantial evidence.he also asserts that the district court improperly granted summary judgment to the defendants on the interference claim.we address these issues in turn,but first discuss the applicable standard of review,which the parties dispute.
standard of review 
in general,where an erisa plan delegates to the plan administrator the discretion to construe the plan and determine eligibility for benefits under its provisions,a decision made under the plan will be upheld unless it was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.cusson liberty life assurance of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under this standard,a reviewing court asks whether a plan administrator determination is plausible in light of the record as a whole,or,put another way,whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.colby union sec.ins.mgmt.for merrimack anesthesia assocs.long term disability plan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because we review the district court summary judgment decision de novo,we,too,apply a deferential standard to the plan administrator decision.leahy raytheon,cir.
niebauer argues against such deferential review by pointing out that the plan at issue is a top hat plan and urges us to follow the approach of the third and eighth circuits,which have held that de novo review applies to decisions made under top hat plans.see craig pillsbury non qualified pension plan,cir holding that t op hat plans should be treated as unilateral contracts and reviewed in accordance with ordinary contract principles internal quotation marks omitted goldstein johnson johnson,cir same see also mccarthy commerce,d,noting circuit split regarding whether de novo or arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies to top hat plans generally.
under erisa,a top hat plan is any plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.alexander brigham women physicians,cir quoting.the parties agree that the plan at issue is a top hat one.
we decline to decide whether top hat plans are categorically subject to de novo review because,as crane observes,e ven the circuit courts that have reviewed top hat decisions under ordinary contract principles have noted that it is a distinction without a difference where,as here,the plan grants the administrator discretion to interpret the plan.both the third and eighth circuit cases upon which niebauer relies ultimately reviewed decisions under top hat plans simply for reasonableness.see craig,at goldstein,at.those courts reasoned that a plan grant of discretion to an administrator must be given effect as contract principles would ordinarily require where one party is granted discretion under the terms of the contract,that discretion must be exercised in good faith a requirement that includes the duty to exercise the discretion reasonably.craig,at quoting goldstein,at.as reasonableness is the basic touchstone in all cases,denmark liberty life assurance of,cir internal quotation marks omitted,we apply our typical deferential standard of review here.
in reliance on hannington sun life health insurance,cir,niebauer argues in the alternative that de novo review is mandated under this circuit precedent where a plan administrator interprets material outside the plan.niebauer maintains that the compensation committee here interpreted emails and other documents to reach its conclusion.those interpretations of documents,the argument goes,are not entitled to deference.
hannington is inapposite.in that case,a plan administrator relied on a provision of the veterans benefits act to reduce the benefits due under a plan to a claimant,where that claimant was also receiving disability compensation under the statute.at.we reviewed the plan administrator construction of the statute de novo,holding that the administrator only had discretion to interpret the plan provisions and that deference is inappropriate when the plan fiduciary is required,in the course of determining the meaning of the plan language,to interpret material outside the plan.id.at see also coffin bowater,cir reviewing de novo plan administrator interpretation of stock purchase agreement that allegedly terminated plan obligations to subsidiary workers after sale of subsidiary.
here,by contrast,the material at issue is email correspondence,not documents creating or altering legal obligations such as statutes or contracts.the emails that the compensation committee considered,wherein niebauer discussed his retirement from crane,do not bear on the legal definition of plan terms.rather,they provide pertinent background,a basis for assessing whether the factual predicate of the plan provisions has been triggered.simple can not displace the deference owed to a plan administrator.we thus proceed under the rubric of review.
conflict of interest 
niebauer argues that the compensation committee decision to deny him benefits was irreparably tainted by a conflict of interest,pointing out that the existence of such a conflict is one factor that may justify the conclusion that a plan administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.see metro.life ins.glenn,d denmark,at.in particular,he asserts that the committee was biased by its concern with the ongoing problems plaguing the bep contract and with niebauer integral role in ameliorating those problems,thus precluding it from impartially deciding niebauer claim for severance benefits.in other words,niebauer maintains that the committee was so frustrated with the impending loss of the most important staff member him on crane most important project that it denied his claim for benefits to spite him.
this argument sits in tension with niebauer overall theory of the case.as the district court observed,
niebauer seems to suggest that his absence was going to damage project momentum and that defendants wanted to penalize him because they were angry at his decision to leave the company at a sensitive time.niebauer also strongly contends,however,that he never decided to leave,that defendants knew he wanted to continue his employment,and that they nevertheless arbitrarily terminated him involuntarily,apparently despite the negative impact on the project.
niebauer,d at.thus,if it is true that the committee was so resentful of niebauer departure that its judgment was impaired as to his severance claim,it is implausible that crane would have terminated him in the first instance,as he claims.
but even leaving aside any internal inconsistency in his position,niebauer does not identify an actual conflict of interest.the paradigmatic conflict of interest in erisa cases occurs when the same entity is responsible for both determin ing whether an employee is eligible for benefits and pay ing benefits out of its own pocket.glenn,at.in such cases,the plan administrator financial stake in the outcome acts as a disincentive to award benefits.here,though,the success of project momentum in no way depended on the compensation committee decision on niebauer claim for severance benefits.whatever the committee members thought about the effect of niebauer departure on project momentum,the decision to award benefits would not impact the project either way.rather than conflict of interest,niebauer argument on this score sounds in retaliation a claim that he has also raised independently and that we address below.
claimed procedural errors 
we next turn to niebauer contention that the compensation committee decision was procedurally flawed.he raises two arguments to buttress this claim first,that the decision relied on an incomplete factual record,and second,that the committee transmission of its decision to niebauer failed to comply with erisa notice requirements.we address each in turn.
whether the committee decision relied on an incomplete factual record 
niebauer faults the committee for relying on an inaccurate and incomplete record in rendering its decision.he points to two categories of errors that,in his view,undermine the legitimacy of the committee final decision first,he argues that the committee inappropriately relied on the timeline of events prepared by hackett,the general counsel.he goes on to contend that hackett withheld certain documents from the committee that supported niebauer position,such as various emails and personnel files.
we do not agree that there was anything improper in the content or scope of the materials that the committee considered.as an initial matter,it was entirely appropriate for the committee to rely on materials submitted by crane indeed,the plan contemplates that the committee will do just that,by making eligibility determinations on the basis of information supplied to it by the employer.and while a plan administrator may not rely on evidence that it knows or has reason to know is misleading,buffonge prudential ins.of,cir,that is not what happened here.the timeline,far from being undisputedly false,as niebauer asserts,was a reasonable synthesis of a convoluted series of events,which hewed to the available evidence.for example,although niebauer claims that the timeline falsely represented that he agreed to a february,retirement date,that representation is a fair reading of a december,email to rick kendall on the topic of retirement calculations in which niebauer wrote,i think february will work.
we also resist niebauer imputation of bad faith to hackett in his management of the investigation.niebauer argues that hackett kept certain records from the committee because they supported niebauer position.in particular,niebauer points to emails between him and kendall about retirement calculations emails between him and coworker chris duquette in which niebauer rebuffed congratulations on his retirement,stating that he had not actually retired as well as a document in his personnel file which listed the reason for niebauer departure as retired involuntary.hackett testified at his deposition that,in assembling materials for the committee to review,he look ed for any that were relevant on the topic of niebauer departure in either direction,mindful of the committee fiduciary duties to get all the facts and to look at this thing in good faith.hackett stated that he turned over to the committee all emails,sent during the relevant time period,that he deemed relevant to niebauer claim.niebauer does not offer any reason to discredit this testimony.
niebauer argues that,as a result of these supposed inaccuracies and omissions,the committee was under the mistaken impression that he had at least at one point decided to retire,before ultimately changing his mind.but deposition testimony makes clear that the committee members understood that niebauer position was that he had not announced an intent to retire during the initial december call with stephen defalco.in other words,they understood that hackett timeline did not align with niebauer stance.certainly,if they were not aware of niebauer position when the issue was considered at the first meeting,they were by the time they decided his appeal,which offered a refutation of the timeline,niebauer,d at,and also provided copies of the allegedly withheld kendall emails.it is this final decision that carries weight.terry bayer,cir.
although niebauer now argues that the appeal was necessarily incomplete because it was prepared once he no longer had access to his crane email account,he noted at the time that he had intentionally presented his version of events in exhaustive detail so as to give the committee full context for his arguments.he does not now explain how the handful of documents that were unavailable to him at the time he filed his appeal would have materially strengthened his presentation of his position to the committee.as the district court concluded,t he appeals process protected against potential bias on the part of hackett by allowing niebauer to present his unfiltered perspective to the compensation committee.niebauer,d at.thus,even if the factual record undergirding the committee initial decision was incomplete in some way,it was adequately supplemented by niebauer appeal.
whether the committee complied with 
niebauer next argues that the committee failed to comply with erisa notice provision,which requires plan administrators to provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.see setting forth implementing regulations.plan beneficiaries whose claims have been denied are further entitled to a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.relying on these provisions in particular niebauer argues that the notice of the compensation committee final decision on his appeal was inadequate.
the notice requirements of erisa are designed to insure that when a claimant appeals a denial to the plan administrator,he will be able to address the determinative issues and have a fair chance to present his case.digregorio hartford comprehensive emp.benefit serv,cir quoting halpin grainger,cir.this purpose is the lodestar in determining whether there has been substantial compliance with the notice provisions strict compliance is not required.see terry,at.in assessing a challenge,we ask whether the beneficiary was supplied with a statement of reasons that,under the circumstances of the case,permitted a sufficiently clear understanding of the administrator position to permit effective review.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a claimant typically must demonstrate that he or she has been prejudiced as a result of the notice inadequacy.bard bos.shipping ass n,cir.
here,niebauer complains that notice of the committee final decision was inadequate because it failed to provide specific reasons.but although niebauer claims that t he entirety of the committee decision on the appeal was contained in two sentences,the memorandum at issue in fact provided a procedural and factual background,in addition to a description of the relevant provisions of the plan and the information the committee considered in arriving at its decision,before summarizing its conclusion.at the end of the memo,the committee encapsulated its decision as follows 
after considering and discussing the information presented,the committee concluded that niebauer had in fact elected to resign his employment rather than continue to work in support of the crane project to which he had been assigned and further that his resignation was not for good reason as that term is described in the severance plan.see article,sections and.therefore niebauer appeal is denied.
this explanation,which clearly outlines the reason for the committee decision,satisfies erisa notice requirements.see orndorf paul revere life ins,cir the denial letter need not detail every bit of information in the record.
in any event,the notice of the committee initial decision,with which erisa notice provisions are primarily concerned,was adequate to permit effective review of niebauer claim.as crane observes,it is undisputed that the key issue before the committee was whether niebauer had resigned or instead had been involuntarily terminated.niebauer was undeniably aware that this question was dispositive of his claim indeed,after receiving notice of the committee initial decision he submitted an appeal with seventy pages of supporting documentation,addressed to the precise issue of whether he had retired,or whether,in his parlance,he was retired against his will.after considering the documents that he submitted,the committee upheld its earlier decision on the same grounds.as such,niebauer has no credible claim that his understanding of the issues at stake was so muddled as to inhibit effective review compare terry,at where claimant submitted additional information to committee that directly addressed whether he was disabled from performing any job,h is actions demonstrate d that he was well aware of the reasons for the decision,and was submitting additional evidence on the crucial point,with bard,at where administrator provided no notice of denial,claimant was not informed that he needed to show that his total disability occurred prior to termination of his employment,and accordingly submitted medical documentation not meant to address that point which ultimately proved quite harmful to his administrative appeal.
substantial evidence 
as noted above,where the plan confers administrative and interpretive discretion upon the administrator,we review substantive challenges to decisions made under the plan for an abuse of discretion.cusson,at.to pass muster,administrators determinations must be reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.colby,at internal quotation marks omitted.evidence is deemed substantial when it is reasonably sufficient to support a conclusion.ortega candelaria johnson johnson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the question before us is not which side is right,but whether
