myers,myers appeals from a summary judgment in favor of the city and county of san francisco city.myers argues that chapter of the san francisco administrative code ordinance is invalid under the dormant commerce clause,due process clause,and california law.the ordinance requires contractors with the city to provide nondiscriminatory benefits to employees with registered domestic partners.myers also asserts that the district court erred when it determined that myers lacked standing to argue that the ordinance is preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.the district court had jurisdiction under,and.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm,but remand for the district court consideration an issue raised for the first time in this appeal.
for nearly thirty years,the city has pledged not to do business with entities that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.see air transport ass of america city county of san francisco.in the spring of,the city,in an effort to enhance that promise by adding concrete requirements,enacted the ordinance,which provides as follows 
no contracting agency of the city,or any department thereof,acting for or on behalf of the city and county,shall execute or amend any contract with any contractor that discriminates in the provision of bereavement leave,family medical leave,health benefits,membership or membership discounts,moving expenses,pension and retirement benefits or travel benefits as well as any other benefits between employees with domestic partners and employees with spouses,between the domestic partners and spouses of such employees,where the domestic partnership has been registered with a governmental entity pursuant to state or local law authorizing such registration 
ordinance b.
the ordinance states that this requirement of nondiscrimination extends to 
i any of a contractor operations within san francisco ii a contractor operations on real property outside of san francisco owned by the city or which the city has a right to occupy if the contractor presence at that location is connected to a contract or property contract with the city and iii where the work is being performed by a contractor for the city within the united states.
id.d.if a contractor is found to have breached these nondiscrimination requirements,the city may impose a penalty per day for each employee affected by the discrimination and may terminate or suspend the contract,in whole or in part.id.h.in addition,the breaching contractor may be deemed an irresponsible bidder and be barred from contracting with the city for up to two years.id.i.
in,myers,an corporation,bid on a servicing contract for electrical transformers located in tuolomne county,california.the city notified myers that the company was the low bidder on the contract,but that in order to be a responsive bidder,myers was required to certify its willingness to comply with the ordinance.myers declined to certify because compliance with the ordinance was contrary to the religious and moral principles adhered to by the corporation.upon myers failure to issue the required certification,its bid was rejected by the city.
myers filed suit urging that the ordinance be held invalid under the commerce clause,due process clause,erisa,and california law and prayed for relief in the form of a declaratory judgment,an injunction,and money damages.on for summary judgment,the district court upheld the ordinance,except as to a provision,not at issue in this appeal,which required contractors to abide by the ordinance at any of a contractor operations elsewhere within the united states.see air transport ass n.at.in a companion case,the district court determined that erisa preempted the ordinance as to benefits covered by erisa and provided through erisa plans.id.at.however,the district court did not extend this ruling to myers because it held that myers did not have standing to argue erisa preemption.the district court reasoned that a decision in myers favor grounded in erisa would not redress the injury to myers in light of its stipulation that myers is unwilling to comply with any of the city equal benefits requirements,even if myers unwillingness to comply means that myers would consequently be ineligible for the award of a city contract.
the district court entry of summary judgment and its resolution of state and federal constitutional issues are reviewed de novo.see salve regina college russell,d valley bank of nevada plus system,cir.we will affirm if the district court applied the correct substantive law and the evidence reveals no genuine issue of material fact when viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.see valley bank,at.
in reviewing challenges to local regulations under the commerce clause,we follow a approach 
when a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce,or when its effect is to favor economic interests over interests,we have generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.when,however,a statute has only indirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly,we have examined whether the state interest is legitimate and whether the burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits.

myers first contends that the ordinance is facially invalid under a first tier inquiry because it directly regulates interstate commerce.ncaa,at.direct regulation occurs when a state law directly affects transactions that take place across state lines or entirely outside of the state borders.valley bank,at internal quotations omitted.the supreme court has emphasized that the practical effect of a challenged statute is the critical inquiry in determining whether that statute constitutes direct regulation.healy beer,d see also valley bank.at.p ractical effect must be evaluated not only by considering the consequences of the statute itself,but also by considering how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other states healy,at.see also ncaa,at valley bank,at.
in order to prevail on this facial challenge to the ordinance,myers must meet a high burden of proof it must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the ordinance would be valid.the fact that the ordinance might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid.united states salerno,d.myers asserts we should not apply salerno and argues that salerno has been undermined by recent supreme court cases.in place of salerno,myers would have us craft a new standard,based upon language in planned parenthood casey,d,that would hold a law to be facially unconstitutional when it would operate as a substantial obstacle to an otherwise lawful course of action in a large fraction of relevant cases.
myers supports its argument by pointing out that a plurality of supreme court justices has stated in dicta,to the extent we have consistently articulated a clear standard for facial challenges,it is not the salerno formulation.city of chicago morales,d stevens,with two justices concurring.however,another plurality of justices is equally adamant that salerno is the correct standard in every context,with the exception of certain first amendment cases.see stenberg carhart,d thomas,dissenting,joined by two justices planned parenthood of arizona lawall,cir.while we have held that casey overruled salerno in the context of facial challenges to abortion statutes,lawall,at,we will not reject salerno in other contexts until a majority of the supreme court clearly directs us to do so.see rodriguez de quijas express,d if a precedent of this court has direct application in a case,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to this court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.
myers asserts that the ordinance directly regulates interstate commerce because section d i requires contractors with the city to provide equal benefits to all employees located in the city even if they are engaged in business unrelated to a city contract section d iii requires contractors to provide equal benefits to all employees at an location if any employees at that location are working on a city contract and other municipalities and states may adopt legislation conflicting with the ordinance,creating an administrative nightmare for city contractors.
in assessing this argument,we must first decide whether myers has accurately described the face of the ordinance.since myers will prevail under salerno only if the ordinance must necessarily be read as directly regulating interstate commerce,we construe the ordinance narrowly and resolve any ambiguities in favor of the interpretation that most clearly supports constitutionality.see able united states,cir.
the most obvious problem with myers reading is that the ordinance contains no language explicitly or implicitly targeting either entities or entities engaged in interstate commerce.rather the ordinance applies to all contractors with the city without any reference to the type or extent of a contractor commercial operations.the ordinance is therefore unlike the statute we held unconstitutional in ncaa which by its terms applied only to national collegiate athletic associations which have member institutions in or more states.at emphasis added.the only such national association was the ncaa,an organization that must actively engage in interstate commerce in order to function properly.see also healy,at.by its plain terms,the connecticut affirmation statute applies solely to interstate brewers or shippers of beer,that is,either connecticut brewers who sell both in connecticut and in at least one border state or shippers who sell both in connecticut and in at least one border state.edgar mite,d plurality opinion the illinois act differs substantially from state laws in that it directly regulates transactions which take place across state lines a tender offer for securities of a publicly held corporation is ordinarily communicated by the use of the mails or other means of interstate commerce to shareholders across the country.
there is also a problem with myers characterization of section d iii,which states that the ordinance applies where the work is being performed by a contractor for the city within the united states.we agree with myers that under one interpretation of this provision contractors would be required to provide nondiscriminatory benefits to all employees at a location if there were any employees working on a city contract at the location.however,that is not the only plausible interpretation of the provision supported by the record before us.another way to read this section is that contractors are required to provide nondiscriminatory benefits to employees working on a city contract,no matter where those employees are located.
a narrow reading of the ordinance scope yields an interpretation in which the city requires all contractors with the city to provide equal benefits to all employees located in the city even if they are engaged in business unrelated to a city contract and requires all contractors to provide equal benefits to those employees working on a city contract even if those employees are located on property.as so construed,employers are subject to the ordinance only as to employees that have direct contact with the city.see edgar,at.plurality opinion the limits on a state power to enact substantive legislation are similar to the limits on the jurisdiction of state courts,citing shaffer heitner,d,which held that t he standard for determining whether an exercise of jurisdiction over the interests of persons is consistent with the due process clause is the standard.
further,the ordinance will affect an entity only after that entity has affirmatively chosen to subject itself to the ordinance by contracting with the city.while we assume for purposes of this opinion that the city is acting in a regulatory capacity rather than as a market participant,it is significant to our direct regulation inquiry that the city imposes the ordinance through contract rather than by legislative fiat.see automated salvage transport,wheelabrator envtl,cir holding that although a settlement agreement between a state agency and wheelabrator affect ed the conduct of the wheelabrator defendants outside of the state,it is the antithesis of direct regulation.
this part of our commerce clause inquiry,however,is not complete for we must determine the practical effect of the ordinance by considering how the ordinance will interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other state and local governments.see healy,at.myers hypothesizes,
conflicts could arise when other local jurisdictions define the partnership or require benefits in ways that could not be reconciled with the city requirements.for example,myers might comply with the ordinance by eliminating a marital benefit,then be confronted by another city regulation that does not permit that option.
similarly,cities that do not want to advance a public policy affirming nonmarital cohabitation might instruct their purchasing agents not to do business with any contractor that provides domestic partner benefits to unmarried couples.
myers speculation fails,however,to take into account the salerno standard.
by choosing to attack the ordinance on its face,myers has the burden of showing that the ordinance will have the practical effect of directly regulating interstate commerce under all circumstances.this means that,at a minimum,myers must either present evidence that conflicting,legitimate legislation is already in place or that the threat of such legislation is both actual and imminent.see huron portland cement city of detroit,d and while the appellant argues that other local governments might impose differing requirements as to air pollution,it has pointed to none n o impermissible burden on commerce has been shown.
myers argues that the supreme court has held that we are required to speculate about possible legislation that may be enacted.however,upon close examination of supreme court precedent it is apparent that the court has never invalidated a state or local law under the dormant commerce clause based upon mere speculation about the possibility of conflicting legislation.in healy,for example,the court determined that a connecticut price affirmation statute was unconstitutional under the dormant commerce clause in part because the practical effect of the affirmation law,in conjunction with the many other and affirmation laws that have been or might be enacted throughout the country,is to create just the kind of competing and interlocking local economic regulation that the commerce clause was meant to preclude.at.the court then went on to analyze the effects of three such conflicting statutes that had been enacted in massachusetts,new york,and rhode island.id.at.in addition,in healy the threat of additional conflicting legislation was real and not speculative.the court pointed out that a t the time of our decision in three years earlier,states had adopted affirmation laws.id.at.see also,at.the proliferation of state affirmation laws has greatly multiplied the likelihood that a seller will be subjected to inconsistent obligations in different states.edgar,at.takeover statutes are now in effect in states.
our precedent follows this interpretation of the supreme court holding in healy.in ncaa we stated 
nevada is not the only state that has enacted or could enact legislation that establishes procedural rules for ncaa enforcement proceedings.florida,illinois,and nebraska have also adopted due process statutes and similar legislation has been introduced in five other states the serious risk of inconsistent obligations wrought by the extraterritorial effect of the statute demonstrates why it constitutes a per se violation of the commerce clause.
ncaa,at internal footnotes omitted.myers makes much of our phrase or could enact legislation,asserting that it requires us to hypothesize about potential future conflicts.however,it is clear in context that the likelihood of conflicting legislation in ncaa was far from speculative.such legislation had in fact been adopted by three states and introduced in five states.in addition,we emphasized that the risk of inconsistent regulation was serious.id.at see also old bridge chemicals,new jersey dep t of envtl,cir although the supreme court has at times invalidated a state regulation because of the possibility that it might conflict with another state regulation,in more recent cases the court has required a demonstration of actual conflict.internal quotations omitted valley bank,at the plaintiff speculates that other states will pass similar but inconsistent legislation.
because myers has not brought to our attention any actual or pending legislation that conflicts or would conflict with the ordinance,we uphold the ordinance against myers facial attack under the commerce clause.
myers argues that even if the ordinance is not facially invalid under a inquiry that the ordinance should be invalidated as applied because the burden it imposes on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.pike bruce church,d.under the pike balancing approach,i f a legitimate local purpose is found,then the question becomes one of degree.and the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved id.we have stated,even in the context of dormant commerce clause analysis,the supreme court has frequently admonished that courts should not the empirical judgments of lawmakers concerning the utility of legislation.pac.northwest venison producers smitch,cir internal quotation omitted see also alaska airlines,city of long beach,cir for a facially neutral statute to violate the commerce clause,the burdens of the statute must so outweigh the putative benefits as to make the statute unreasonable or irrational.
of course,the ordinance affected myers the city decided not to contract with myers after myers refused to certify that it would comply with the ordinance.on appeal and in the district court,myers has relied solely on conclusory statements about the burden the ordinance has on interstate commerce.for example,in response to an interrogatory asking myers to provide an estimate of the cost to itself of implementing a benefits program for domestic partners of employees,myers stated,myers can not offer an estimate specific to the contract that is at issue in this lawsuit,as it is not known if any of the employees who would have been assigned have,or would have acquired,domestic partners.myers did state that the cost of providing only family medical benefits was approximately per month however,this figure provides almost no indication of the economic impact of the ordinance on interstate commerce.while we do not require a dollar estimate of the effect the ordinance will have,we do require specific details as to how the costs of the ordinance burdened interstate commerce.the commerce clause is concerned with the free flow of goods and services through the several states it is the economic interest in being free from trade barriers that the clause protects.see carbone,at.on the green apartments city of tacoma,cir.
myers also challenges the legitimacy of the purported benefits of the ordinance to the city.we held in alaska airlines,at,that the burdens on interstate commerce of a statute will outweigh the benefits if the asserted benefits of the statute are in fact illusory.myers argues that the benefits arising out of the ordinance are illusory because the ordinance allows contractors and vendors with the city to avoid the effects of the ordinance by seeking a sole source exemption.this exemption has been granted by the city on numerous occasions.for example,when the city wanted to buy unique pieces of art for the airport,it waived the application of the ordinance as to the sole source,the art broker,from whom it could purchase the art.the sole source exemption,however,is a rational response to the problems that might arise for the city should the sole source of a needed or desired product or service refuse to do business with the city on account of the ordinance.the city need not strike all evils at the same time.katzenbach morgan.internal quotation omitted.we hold that the burden on interstate commerce evidenced in the record does not clearly outweigh the city legitimate interest in applying the ordinance to those with whom it contracts.
myers next argues that the ordinance is facially invalid under principles of due process because the ordinance exerts extraterritorial control over myers lawful choice not to provide benefits to domestic partners.for this assertion,myers relies primarily upon bmw of america,gore,d,in which the supreme court stated,a state may not impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasors lawful conduct in other states.id.at.the supreme court stated that t o avoid such encroachment,the economic penalties that a state inflicts on those who transgress its laws,whether the penalties take the form of legislatively authorized fines or judicially imposed punitive damages,must be supported by the state interest in protecting its own consumers and its own economy.id.
in order for myers to succeed on this argument,it must first persuade us that the provisions of the ordinance constitute economic penalties under bmw.the ordinance does provide that a contractor who has agreed to comply with the ordinance and then breaches that promise will be subject to economic consequences,including fines.ordinance h i.in addition,the city will refuse to contract with those who fail to certify that they will comply with the ordinance.these economic consequences,however,are significantly different from the economic penalties disfavored in bmw,which dealt with punitive damages awarded in a state tort case.punitive damages are imposed on unwilling defendants.see bmw,at.the breach of contract provisions in the ordinance will only apply if a city contractor consents to be bound by its terms.similarly,an entity will be denied the ability to contract with the city only after it has chosen not to meet the city requirements.
even were we to assume that the ordinance requirements constitute an economic penalty,narrowly construed the ordinance only applies in the city,on property,or as to employees working on a city contract.thus,the ordinance is supported by the city interest in protecting its own consumers and its own economy.id.at.while it is possible that the city could attempt to wield extraterritorial control through broadly interpreting section d iii,on this facial challenge we will not invalidate the ordinance unless myers can establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the ordinance would be valid.see salerno,at.
article,section of the california constitution provides,a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.a charter city,like the city,may make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs i n respect to other matters they shall be subject to general laws.cal.const.myers makes two arguments based on these constitutional provisions.first,myers argues that the recently enacted california family code family code et is a general law conflicting with,and thereby preempting,the ord
