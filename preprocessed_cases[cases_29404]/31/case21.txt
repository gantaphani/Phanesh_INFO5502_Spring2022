plaintiff mark dutkewych is a participant in a disability plan the plan,insured and administered by defendant standard insurance company under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.the plan limits disability ltd benefits to months for a disability caused or contributed to by mental disorders substance abuse or other limited conditions.applying this limited conditions provision,standard terminated dutkewych benefits after months,on june.after dutkewych administrative appeal failed,he brought this lawsuit against standard for unpaid benefits.the district court entered summary judgment against dutkewych claims.dutkewych standard ins,cv,wl.dutkewych appealed.
dutkewych contests standard decision to limit his ltd benefits to months,saying he has been diagnosed with chronic lyme disease,a physical illness that is not limited under the terms of the plan.despite the hot dispute between the parties on this issue,this case does not turn on the insurer doubts about the validity of dutkewych diagnosis with chronic lyme disease.instead,this case turns on the insurer application of a different provision of the plan,the subset of the limited conditions provision related to mental disorders mental disorder limitation.standard maintains that,even if dutkewych was disabled as a result of chronic lyme disease in june,the mental disorder limitation nonetheless applies because his mental disorders,regardless of their cause,contributed to his disability as of june.
standard interpretation of the mental disorder limitation is reasonable and its application to dutkewych case is supported by substantial evidence.we affirm the entry of summary judgment to standard.
factual background 
standard ltd plan 
the plan provides that a participant qualifies as disabled from your own occupation if,as a result of physical disease,injury,pregnancy,or mental disorder 
you are unable to perform with reasonable continuity the material duties of your own occupation and 
you suffer a loss of at least in your indexed predisability earnings when working in your own occupation.
the maximum benefit period allowed dutkewych to receive benefits to age.
certain disabilities,however,are subject to a limited benefits period limited conditions provision.specifically,p ayment of ltd benefits is limited to months during your entire lifetime for a disability caused or contributed to by any one or more of the following mental disorders substance abuse or other limited conditions.mental disorders is defined to include any mental,emotional,behavioral,psychological,personality,cognitive,mood or abnormality,disorder,disturbance,dysfunction or syndrome,regardless of cause or the presence of physical symptoms.other limited conditions is defined to include chronic fatigue conditions and chronic pain conditions,such as fibromyalgia.
the plan provides two rules for disabilities subject to limited pay periods 
if you are disabled as a result of a mental disorder or any physical disease or injury for which payment of ltd benefits is subject to a limited pay period,and at the same time are disabled as a result of a physical disease,injury,or pregnancy that is not subject to such limitation,ltd benefits will be payable first for conditions that are subject to the limitation.
no ltd benefits will be payable after the end of the limited pay period,unless on that date you continue to be disabled as a result of a physical disease,injury,or pregnancy for which payment of ltd benefits is not limited.
standard specified in the plan that it ha s full and exclusive authority to control and manage the group policy,to administer claims,and to interpret the group policy and resolve all questions arising in the administration,interpretation,and application of the group policy.
dutkewych disability 
in early,dutkewych suffered from mental illness,substance abuse,and a dizzying array of physical symptoms that have since received competing diagnoses.dutkewych left his work as an associate attorney at a boston law firm on october,and sought ltd benefits from standard.we summarize here the relevant chronology of dutkewych medical history and standard decisions concerning his benefits.
dutkewych early diagnoses 
in march,dutkewych began to experience symptoms including severe fatigue,intense back pain and stomach irritation.his symptoms worsened over the summer as dutkewych developed a painful rash,began bruising and bleeding,suffered severe joint pain,and experienced cognitive issues,including trouble with reading comprehension,concentration,short term memory,directions,organization,and sense of time.his primary care physician,eric serrano,did not identify a cause.
in august,serrano referred dutkewych to a,brenda haynes,who considered the possibility of lyme disease.at that time,dutkewych reported no recent viral exposure or tick exposure that he was aware of.a blood test returned negative results for lyme disease,but the test results warned that false negatives are possible in the early stages of the disease before the patient produces detectable levels of antibodies.
serrano then referred dutkewych to a rheumatologist,don goldenberg,who examined dutkewych in september.goldenberg concluded that dutkewych musculoskeletal symptoms are consistent with what is termed fibromyalgia,which overlaps significantly with mood and sleep disturbances.goldenberg noted that dutkewych had a history of obsessive compulsive disorder,which made it likely that unexplained physical symptoms with multiple physician evaluations would heighten the intensity of the symptoms.he recommended dutkewych treatment be primarily regulated by his psychiatrist.
one week later,dutkewych visited the psychiatric emergency department at the cambridge hospital.he reported his mental health history and his more recent somatic symptoms.he noted his recent diagnosis by goldenberg,and attributed his worsening depression to the idea that his doctors did not want to pursue his physical symptoms.at that time,his wife reported that he was with prescription drugs.dutkewych was admitted to the cambridge hospital partial hospitalization program,an outpatient program,for the following two weeks.at discharge,he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder,obsessive compulsive disorder,and generalized anxiety disorder.
in november,dutkewych visited a family practitioner,jeanne hubbuch,who ordered additional tests for lyme disease.this time,dutkewych reported experiencing no tick bites,but noted that ticks had been seen in his house.western blot test returned positive results for lyme disease under the igenex igg criteria,but negative results under and babesia fish criteria.
on december,dutkewych was admitted to the mclean hospital for substance abuse treatment.at the hospital,he reported that he had been abusing vicodin,and explained that he had used a stolen credit card to buy things that he then sold to pay for drugs.his intake form noted his recent diagnosis of lyme disease and his ongoing depression.
he was discharged from the hospital on december,and immediately entered mclean residential treatment program.in an ambulatory services initial assessment,dutkewych reported a l ongstanding history of obsessive compulsive disorder and episodic depression.although his ocd was in reasonably good control,his depressive symptoms were still significant and included suicidal ideation.he admitted to persistent and daily substance abuse over the last year.joshua katz,who evaluated dutkewych during this time,reported that m any if not all of dutkewych physical and cognitive symptoms can be explained by chronic narcotic use and intermittent withdrawal symptoms.dutkewych was discharged on january.
standard approval of limited ltd benefits 
on april,standard approved dutkewych claim for ltd benefits.at that time,a significant portion of the medical records in dutkewych claim file relate d to his psychiatric condition.the physician consultant who reviewed his records noted that dutkewych has had a combination of chemical dependency and psychiatric disorder of life threatening proportions.standard concluded that his claim supports that as of october,dutkewych has been unable to perform with reasonable continuity the material duties of his own occupation due to symptoms and treatment related to substance abuse and major depression.
standard specifically warned dutkewych that his policy limits payment of ltd benefits to months during your entire lifetime for a disability caused or contributed to by mental disorders,substance abuse or other limited conditions.as major depression is considered to be a mental disorder,standard will be applying the mental disorder limitation and thus limiting payment of ltd benefits to a maximum of months.
dutkewych treatment for chronic lyme disease 
between june and december,dutkewych entered a second residential substance abuse treatment program and participated in two halfway house programs.from around june to june,dutkewych was admitted to the mclean adult partial hospital and residential program.from june to september,he resided at phoenix house springfield center,a residential facility for substance abuse treatment in springfield,massachusetts.from september to december,he continued his treatment at the north cottage program,a residential facility for substance abuse treatment in norton,massachusetts.
during this time,dutkewych began seeing karen isselbacher,luz ruiz,and bernard raxlen.each agreed with the diagnosis of lyme disease.isselbacher,a primary care physician,conducted a spinal tap in july,and found elevated levels of proteins which she interpreted as evidence of lyme disease.raxlen,a psychiatrist,diagnosed dutkewych with lyme disease in december following a spect scan and a clinical evaluation.ruiz,a neurologist,sought an additional western blot test in december which returned identical results to the test in november positive for lyme disease under igenex criteria,but negative for lyme disease under criteria.
under their care,dutkewych has intermittently received intravenous iv antibiotic treatment for lyme disease.after consulting with three physicians,respectively at columbia,john hopkins,and beth israel,isselbacher began to treat dutkewych with iv antibiotics in july.while on iv antibiotics from july to march,dutkewych reported improved symptoms.he suffered a relapse after ending treatment,and restarted iv antibiotics in april.he stopped again in june,when his port became infected,and restarted in february,when a new port was installed.
during this time frame,dutkewych also applied for and received a premium waiver on his life insurance policy from standard and total disability benefits from the social security administration ssa.on april,standard approved dutkewych for a premium waiver on his life insurance policy based on a disability.on june,the ssa approved dutkewych for total disability benefits due to lyme disease,fibromyalgia,pain,depression and substance abuse.the ssa found that dutkwewych lyme disease with associated joint pain and fatigue as well as his depression preclude him from performing work at any exertional level of the occupational base on a regular and continuing basis.
standard termination of ltd benefits 
on april,standard informed dutkewych that his benefits would be terminated as of june,due to the end of the month limitation period.standard explained that,b ecause the group policy limits payments for disability caused or contributed to by a mental disorder,in order to continue to receive ltd benefits,dutkewych must be disabled by a physical disease or injury.specifically,t he physical disease s or injury ies must be so severe as to cause disability in the absence of substance abuse,a mental disorder or other limited condition.
standard relied on a physician consultant,leonard sigal,described as in internal medicine and rheumatology and a leading figure in both the treatment and research of chronic lyme disease for many years,to review dutkewych entire medical record.sigal concluded that dutkewych diagnosis of lyme disease was speculative.he noted that dutkewych antecedent psychiatric disorder,substance abuse,and diagnosis of fibromyalgia had been overshadowed by his treating physicians in favor of the premise that all of his complaints were attributable to chronic lyme disease.
in so concluding,sigal discounted the positive western blot results at the igenex laboratory since,in his experience,the laboratory routinely reports positive results that are not in agreement with clinical findings and often reports positive results in patients with no likelihood of exposure.he also disagreed with isselbacher reading of the spinal fluid analysis.he noted that spinal fluid obtained on july,had normal glucose,a trivially elevated protein,and no inflammatory white or red blood cells counted.he concluded that it was essentially normal.sigal accordingly rejected the diagnosis of chronic lyme disease by a small group of physicians,considered local or regional lyme disease experts despite the lack of explicit clinical and laboratory evidence and the lack of response to month after month of multiple antibiotic therapies 
in the termination letter,standard stated that it could not conclude that a physical disease has been identified as defined by the policy.furthermore,e ven if it was to accept the diagnosis of lyme disease,the consulting physician noted that the claimant may be able to work at this time if his psychiatric issues were appropriately dealt with.importantly,standard explained that it was unable to conclude that dutkewych remains disabled as the result of a physical disease or injury and since ltd benefits payable for disability caused or contributed to by substance abuse,a mental disorder or other limited conditions are limited to months,his claim will close with standard payment through june.
standard explained that dutkewych could request a review of standard decision within days.with his request for review,dutkewych would have the right to submit additional information in support of his claim.
dutkewych request for review 
on october,dutkewych administratively appealed standard decision to limit his benefits to two years.he attached letters from his wife,his,two of his brothers,and two of his treating physicians.
each of his family members explained dutkewych struggles with lyme disease over the past few years.his stated that mark limitations are both physical and intellectual.she wrote that his depression is clearly a reaction to his pain and fatigue rather than an endogenous depression.his brother attested that dutkewych had gone thr ough significant physical and mental changes over the past years.as an example,his related that mark can not read a simple novel without getting confused and need ing to the pages that he just read five minutes earlier.
sheila statlender,a clinical psychologist who had been treating dutkewych since march,submitted a report dated march.statlender stated that dutkewych has not abused substances since they began treatment.significantly,she diagnosed him with mood disorder due to neuroborreliosis central nervous system lyme disease,with depressive features and noted his ongoing symptoms of anxiety and depression.
similarly,ruiz letter,dated august,found dutkewych to have mental disorders,and attributed them to his diagnosis of lyme disease.amongst dutkewych persistent symptoms,ruiz listed cognitive limitations,depression,and anxiety.but,ruiz wrote that d epression and anxiety can not explain dutkewych joint and muscle pain,headaches,neuropathy,lack of endurance and worsening fatigue upon exercise.these symptoms,and dutkewych clinical presentation,are consistent with lyme disease.
dutkewych sent standard an additional report from a neuropsychologist,leo shea,following evaluations on may,and june.shea concluded that dutkewych significant decline in cognitive capacities can not be explained by depression alone.he concluded that the cause of dutkewych cognitive difficulties is primarily based in the resultant neurologic sequelae of lyme disease with central nervous system involvement.shea noted that dutkewych cognitive reserve has also been impacted by his history of serial concussions,obsessive compulsive diagnosis,and the medications prescribed to attenuate these diagnosed conditions.
in addition,standard had received a letter from dutkewych,dated april,that summarized his own medical condition.since first contracting lyme disease,dutkewych wrote,my symptoms have clustered in four primary areas extreme fatigue and lethargy,intense joint pain,cognitive issues and.to date all of these issues persist.of all of the symptom areas,dutkewych identified the cognitive issues as often the most troubling.although he used to handle complex public bond financing at the law firm,he wrote that he was now forgetful,easily overwhelmed,and struggled with reading comprehension.finally,despite working with my therapist weekly and taking medication,depression and anxiety continue to be an issue.dutkewych noted that i t is consistent with lyme disease to have mental health issues that are rooted in the illness.
standard denial after administrative review 
based on dutkewych request,standard administrative review unit reviewed standard decision to terminate dutkewych ltd benefits after months.as part of this process,the administrative review unit asked two independent physicians,who had not been involved in the earlier decision,to review dutkewych medical file.specifically,the administrative review unit asked raymond dattwyler an immunologist and rheumatologist,to comment on the laboratory findings in dutkewych medical file,the cdc criteria,and the assessment of dutkewych condition.the administrative review unit also asked bob gant,a clinical neuropsychologist,to review the information related to dutkewych claimed cognitive deficits,and the findings of shea.
in a report dated march,dattwyler concluded that dutkewych simply did not have the clinical manifestations that i would expect to see in a patient with lyme disease.critically to dattwyler,dutkewych lyme serologies are negative and none meet the cdc criteria.dattwyler specifically rejected any test results from a lab that does not adhere to cdc guidelines,such as the igenex tests.simply stated his negative serologies and his clinical picture strongly support the finding that dutkewych does not have lyme disease now and never did.
in a report dated april,gant stated that he was unable to establish a psychological or neuropsychological diagnosis with the available information.in my opinion,gant wrote in an addendum report issued on april,shea administered an insufficiently brief examination to support his conclusions regarding a diagnosis of chronic lyme disease,limitations related to this disease,and his ultimate conclusions regarding impaired work functioning.gant recommended a comprehensive and forensically sophisticated neuropsychological examination to verify a definitive diagnosis 
both consulting physicians questioned the existence of chronic lyme disease as a diagnosis in general.in his report,dattwyler cautioned that there is no acceptable definition of chronic lyme disease,and that i t is not accepted as a diagnosis by mainstream medicine.instead,t he term chronic lyme disease is being applied to patients with vague complaints most of who m have never had lyme disease.gant concur red with dattwyler statement that chronic lyme disease is not accepted by mainstream medicine.in fact,gant wrote in his report,available medical information indicates that there is not medical consensus that lyme disease is a credible diagnosis to offer an individual with this claimant clinical history.
on may,the administrative review unit issued a letter to dutkewych counsel to inform her that it had completed its independent review.the administrative review unit found that the correct decision was to close dutkewych claim as of june,under the disabilities subject to limited pay periods provision of his plan.
in the review letter,the administrative review unit reiterated that the disabilities subject to limited pay periods provision of the plan limits payment of ltd benefits to months during your entire life time for a disability caused or contributed to by any one or more of the following mental disorders,substance abuse,or other limited conditions.the administrative review unit then summarized,in detail,dutkewych medical history,the evidence that he had submitted in support of his claim that he was disabled as a result of lyme disease,and the reports of standard consulting physicians.in addition,the administrative review unit noted the controversy within the medical community regarding the diagnosis and treatment of lyme disease.the administrative review unit concluded that it is entirely reasonable and,in fact,prudent that the standard evaluate disability claims in the context of mainstream medical opinion.
relying on the assessments of dattwyler and gant,and the consistent assessments of sigal and goldenberg,the administrative review unit concluded that dutkewych was not disabled as a result of lyme disease.rather,it stated,the available medical evidence supports that dutkewych mental health conditions in combination with his chronic pain condition fibromyalgia and substance abuse are the most likely cause of his reported symptoms.the administrative review unit agreed with standard earlier decision to limit dutkewych benefits to months under the limited conditions provision as a result.the administrative review unit explained 
because we do not find evidence to support that dutkewych was impaired from performing his own occupation as of june,by a physical disease or injury which was independent from his mental disorders,substance abuse and fibromyalgia with possible chronic fatigue,we have determined that dutkewych does not qualify for additional ltd benefits from the standard,and that his claim must remain closed.
present litigation 
following standard decision to terminate ltd benefits after months,dutkewych sought review in the district of massachusetts.in his first amended complaint,filed on september,he asserted that,a t the end of the two year limited pay period for disabilities caused or contributed to by a mental disorder,dutkewych was disabled due to the symptoms of lyme disease,a physical disease under the terms of the plan.dutkewych sought enforcement of the terms of the plan for unpaid benefits,and attorneys fees and costs.both parties moved for summary judgment.
the district court held that standard did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that dutkewych was not disabled by lyme disease,and terminated his benefits after months.dutkewych,wl,at.w hile there is evidence in the record supporting a diagnosis of lyme disease or chronic lyme disease,the court stated,there is still substantial evidence in the record supporting otherwise,upon which standard relied in making its determination that dutkewych was not disabled by lyme disease.id.at.in reaching its conclusion,the court noted the qualified consulting physicians opinions as to dutkewych diagnosis with chronic lyme disease,id.at,as well as the substantial evidence that dutkewych suffered from impairments,such as depression,id.at.as a result,the district court granted standard motion for summary judgment and denied dutkewych motion for summary judgment.id.at.this appeal followed.
