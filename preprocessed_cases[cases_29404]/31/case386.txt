facts and procedural posture 
pryzbowski is enrolled in the health maintenance organization of new jersey,a wholly owned subsidiary of healthcare,hereafter healthcare,which is a health maintenance organization hmo offered by the employer of pryzbowski husband under its employee benefit plan within the terms of erisa.on november,pryzbowski sought treatment from medemerge,her primary care provider,for severe back pains that she had been experiencing for several days.medemerge is a physician practice group under contract with healthcare to provide health care services.pryzbowski had previously undergone numerous surgeries for her back,the most recent having been performed by giancarlo barolat of thomas jefferson university hospital in philadelphia,all of which were covered under her previous health care plan.at medemerge,she was treated at different times by john pilla,carol sgambelluri,and kent ellis.
a ct scan performed on november,revealed disc degeneration and a large,defect compressing the thecal sac,consistent with disc herniation.it also showed a previously implanted neurostimulator.medemerge referred pryzbowski to alan sarokhan,an orthopedic surgeon.sarokhan wrote to ellis,stating that s he certainly needs a neurosurgical evaluation and needs one promptly it is my opinion that she will most likely find that the most recent operating surgeon is the only one in the area who will be likely to even approach this with any confidence.app.j,at.on december,pryzbowski went to see aiden doyle,a neurosurgeon,again through a referral from medemerge.doyle concluded,she should go back to the surgeon who put it in.i have discussed this with them and obviously i really do feel that i should be fiddling with that.app.k,at.
based on these two reports,medemerge sent a request to healthcare on december,for a consultation with barolat,who was the neurosurgeon who last performed surgery on pryzbowski.barolat was not a participant in the particular plan offered by healthcare.pryzbowski policy with healthcare required that it give prior written authorization for services by providers and facilities.healthcare approved the consultation and barolat examined pryzbowski on january.he concluded that surgery was needed and that the following specialists or specialists services were required spinal instrumentation and fusion by a separate orthopedic surgeon,pulmonary clearance and from cohen,consultation with the pain service,and a psychological assessment and.the specialists to whom he referred were also associated with thomas jefferson university hospital and outside healthcare network.
over the next few months,pryzbowski sought to get healthcare to approve the recommended surgery by barolat and the related services.in the meantime,pryzbowski was seen by specialists,including edward barrett a mental health specialist,alexander levin a pain management specialist,and sarraf a pulmonary specialist between february,and april,and they transmitted their reports thereafter.it is evident that this was not satisfactory to barolat,because a handwritten note dated may,headed.barolat office,states will not perform the surgery unless specials sic at jefferson in consult.ushc will not approve.appellees,lang certification,ex.healthcare authorized the specialists services and the back surgery on june,and barolat performed the surgery on pryzbowski on july.unfortunately,pryzbowski continued to suffer from severe back pain after the surgery.barolat later opined that the persistence of the excruciating pain was most likely caused by the significant delay that occurred between the onset of the symptomatology and the surgical intervention.app.m,at.
pryzbowski filed a complaint,later amended,against healthcare,medemerge,and three physicians with medemerge in the superior court of new jersey.she asserts six counts against healthcare,which allege that healthcare negligently and carelessly delayed in giving its approval for the necessary surgery which the plaintiff urgently needed,causing pryzbowski severe and permanent injury,emotional distress,and future expenses for medical care and treatment count one that healthcare delay was arbitrary and capricious count two and that,by delaying its approval for the surgery,healthcare acted with a willful and wanton disregard for the harm that would likely result to the plaintiff count three.the complaint also asserts that healthcare delay in approving the surgery breached its health insurance contract with pryzbowski count four that the delay in surgery approval was in bad faith count five and that healthcare breached its duty to screen,hire,train and employ capable and responsible individuals to make thoughtful and reasonable decisions as to healthcare count seven.
in the five counts pryzbowski asserts against medemerge the physician defendants,she alleges that medemerge negligently and carelessly delayed in authorizing obtaining authorization from healthcare for the surgery count eight that medemerge,in failing to obtain authorization,acted with a willful and wanton disregard for the harm that would likely result to the plaintiff count nine that the physician defendants negligently and carelessly delayed in authorizing obtaining authorization for the back surgery count ten and that they acted with a willful and wanton disregard in delaying authorization count eleven.another count alleges that medemerge breached its duty to screen,hire and employ capable and responsible individuals to serve as its agent,servants,employees count six.
healthcare removed the case to the united states district court for the district of new jersey.on december,the district court granted healthcare motion to dismiss the counts against it counts.subsequently,medemerge and the physician defendants moved for summary judgment on the remaining counts,which motion was granted on september.pryzbowski now appeals both the december,dismissal and the september,summary judgment order.we have jurisdiction under.
discussiona.claims against healthcare 
there are two separate but related preemption issues that arise under erisa,both of which are presented in this case.the application of express preemption,set forth in a of erisa,arises in connection with pryzbowski claims against medemerge and the physician defendants.her claims against healthcare raise the issue of complete preemption,a jurisdictional concept based on a of erisa.
we first consider pryzbowski challenge to the district court holding that removal was proper and that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against healthcare because they were completely preempted under a of erisa.pryzbowski complaint,originally filed in state court,appeared on its face to allege only state causes of action and named as defendants parties who were not completely diverse from pryzbowski,thereby displaying no obvious basis for removal to federal court under.in franchise tax bd.of cal.constr.laborers vacation trust for,d,the supreme court stated,where there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties as in pryzbowski case the propriety of removal turns on whether the case falls within the original federal question jurisdiction of the united states district courts.
under the complaint rule,federal question jurisdiction exists only when an issue of federal law appears on the face of the plaintiff complaint.the anticipation that a defendant may raise a federal defense will not confer federal question jurisdiction.on the other hand,any complaint that comes within the scope of a federal cause of action necessarily arises under federal law and is therefore completely preempted.franchise tax,at.the paradigmatic example of this extraordinary preemptive force is of the labor management relations act lmra.see avco aero lodge,d.in franchise tax board,the court did not reach the question of complete preemption under erisa because the claim asserted there was not within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts and therefore could not be removed by defendant to federal court.see at.
it was in metropolitan life ins.taylor,d,that the supreme court faced the question whether or not the avco principle can be extended to statutes other than the lmra in order to recharacterize a state law complaint displaced by a b as an action arising under federal law.id.at.after noting the similarity between the language of erisa and that of the lmra,the court concluded that congress intended that a of erisa be given the same extraordinary preemptive force as had been given to of lmra.see id.at.this conclusion from the statutory language was confirmed not only by the statements of one of the sponsors of erisa but also by the conference report,which stated that all suits to enforce benefit rights under the plan or to recover benefits under the plan are to be regarded as arising under the laws of the united states in similar fashion to those brought under section of the relations act of.conf,at,reprinted in.following the decision in metropolitan life,there can be no question that causes of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of a are removable to federal court.metropolitan life,at.
we do not understand pryzbowski to be challenging the principle that such claims are completely preempted but to be arguing that the claims she asserts against healthcare were not removable because they did not fit within a.section a allows a beneficiary or participant of an plan to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.under a,a beneficiary may obtain accrued benefits due,a declaratory judgment about entitlement of benefits,or an injunction to require the administrator to pay benefits.see pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.it follows that if pryzbowski claims fall within the scope of erisa civil enforcement provisions,they are completely preempted.
this court has on several occasions considered whether a plaintiff claim against his or her hmo is completely preempted under erisa.in dukes healthcare,cir,we distinguished between claims directed to the quality of the benefits plaintiffs received and claims that the plans erroneously withheld benefits due or that seek to enforce plaintiffs rights under the terms of their respective plans or to clarify their rights to future benefits.id.at.we stated that claims that merely attack the quality of benefits do not fall within the scope of a enforcement provisions and are not completely preempted,whereas claims challenging the quantum of benefits due under an plan are completely preempted under a civil enforcement scheme.see id.at.we held that,because the plaintiffs in dukes alleged that the hmo failed to exercise reasonable care in providing medical treatment,their claims were not completely preempted.see id.at.
thereafter,in in re healthcare,cir,we applied the distinction in determining whether claims by parents against healthcare based on the death of their newborn baby were completely preempted.in making that decision,we relied upon the distinction made in dukes between an hmo role in arranging for medical treatment rather than its role as a plan administrator determining what benefits are appropriate.id.at quoting dukes,at.we held that healthcare adoption of a policy of discharging newborn infants within hours after their delivery was essentially a medical determination that could be subject to a medical malpractice action.see id.at.we also held that the hmo alleged negligence in selecting,training,and supervising medical personnel implicated the quality of medical treatment.see id.at.therefore,we concluded that none of the claims were completely preempted and we directed that the case be remanded to state court.see id.at.
most recently,in lazorko pennsylvania hospital,cir,we again applied the distinction between claims raising quality of care issues and claims raising quantity of benefits issues.lazorko alleged that financial disincentives imposed by the hmo discouraged medical providers from hospitalizing a mentally ill beneficiary who later committed suicide.we decided that this was a quality of care claim because the denial of the beneficiary request for hospitalization occurred in the course of a treatment decision,not in the administration of the plaintiff and beneficiary plan generally.id.at.thus,we held that the plaintiffs claim was not completely preempted under a.
though the distinction was helpful in those cases,we have acknowledged that the distinction would not always be clear.see dukes,at.we recognized that there might be a situation where the quality of the medical care provided would be so deficient that the beneficiary essentially would not have received any health care benefit at all.see id.and in in re healthcare,we noted that making the distinction would be particularly difficult when an hmo has acted as both a plan administrator and a provider of medical services.see at.
the recent supreme court decision in pegram herdrich,d,suggests preferable terminology.although that case concerned fiduciary acts under erisa and not preemption,the distinction made there between eligibility decisions,which turn on the plan coverage of a particular condition or medical procedure for its treatment,and treatment decisions,which are choices in diagnosing and treating a patent sic condition.at,is equally applicable for complete preemption analysis.regardless of the language used,the ultimate distinction to make for purposes of complete preemption is whether the claim challenges the administration of or eligibility for benefits,which falls within the scope of a and is completely preempted,or the quality of the medical treatment performed,which may be the subject of a state action.
this court has not had occasion to consider how a claim that the hmo or plan administrator delayed in the approval of benefits should be treated under erisa.it is evident that a claim alleging that a physician knowingly delayed in performing urgent surgery on a patient whose appendix was about to rupture would relate to the quality of care,and not be subject to removal on the basis of complete preemption.on the other hand,a claim alleging that an hmo declined to approve certain requested medical services or treatment on the ground that they were not covered under the plan would manifestly be one regarding the proper administration of benefits.such a claim,no matter how couched,is completely preempted and removable on that basis.see dukes,at noting that a claim that the plans erroneously withheld benefits due would be completely preempted jass prudential health care plan,cir holding that a claim against an hmo utilization review decision was completely preempted by erisa.
in analyzing whether a claim falling between these poles is completely preempted,it is necessary to refer to a.as the court stated in metropolitan life,congress has clearly manifested an intent to make causes of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of a removable to federal court.at.accordingly,we must examine pryzbowski claims against healthcare to determine whether they could have been the subject of a civil enforcement action under a.
counts one through five of pryzbowski complaint allege that healthcare negligently and carelessly delayed approval of her surgery with barolat,acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in doing the same,acted in willful and wanton disregard of her health,acted in bad faith,and breached her health insurance contract.underlying these allegations of delay is the policy adopted by healthcare and many other hmos requiring beneficiaries either to use specialists or to obtain approval from the hmo for specialists.these activities fall within the realm of the administration of benefits.
had pryzbowski sought to accelerate healthcare approval of the use of providers,she could have sought an injunction under a to enforce the benefits to which she was entitled under the plan,thereby using the provisions of the civil enforcement scheme provided by congress.there have been numerous cases in which the courts have issued preliminary injunctions under similar circumstances.see,marro communications.granting preliminary injunction to compel plan administrator to precertify high dosage chemotherapy mattive healthsource of savannah.granting preliminary injunction enjoining plan administrator from denying coverage for chemotherapy dozsa crum forster ins.granting preliminary injunction enjoining plan administrator from denying coverage for autologous bone marrow transplant treatment.
pryzbowski final claim against healthcare count seven alleges that it failed properly to hire,train,and supervise its employees to make thoughtful and reasonable decisions as to healthcare.amended complaint,count.although ostensibly directed at the provision of medical treatment,a federal court may look beyond the face of the complaint to determine whether a plaintiff has artfully pleaded his suit so as to couch a federal claim in terms of state law,jass,at accord parrino fhp,cir franchise tax,at.noting that a plaintiff may not defeat removal to federal court by omitting to plead necessary federal questions in a complaint.inasmuch as pryzbowski has not alleged that healthcare or its employees engaged in any medical treatment with regard to her,the alleged negligence by healthcare in the hiring,training,and supervising of its employees necessarily concerns the administration of her benefits,healthcare only role in this case.it follows that count seven is also completely preempted under a of erisa.
pryzbowski contends that her claims are analogous to the claims made in dukes and in re healthcare,where we held that complete preemption was inapplicable and removal improper.in both cases,we recognized that the hmo had assumed the dual role of an administrator of benefits and a provider of medical services.in in re healthcare,we held that the hmo policy to discharge newborn infants within hours was essentially a medical determination of the appropriate level of care.at.we also held that the claim that the hmo was negligent in failing to provide an visit by a pediatric nurse,despite having given assurances that such a visit would be provided,was directed at the hmo function as medical provider.see id.at.therefore,the plaintiffs claims alleged medical malpractice and were not completely preempted by erisa.in dukes,the plaintiffs claims centered on the low quality of the medical treatment that they actually received.at.they argued that the hmo was liable under an agency theory and also directly responsible for negligence in selecting,retaining,screening,monitoring and evaluating the personnel who actually provided the medical services.see id.at.we held that those claims did not involve failure to provide benefits due under the erisa plan and therefore were not completely preempted.
in the case before us,as we note above,pryzbowski claims against healthcare are limited to its delay in approving benefits,conduct falling squarely within administrative function.a holding that pryzbowski claims against healthcare are not completely preempted would open the door for legal challenges to core managed care practices,the policy of favoring specialists over specialists,which the supreme court eschewed in pegram.at rejecting claims attacking financial incentives behind hmo structure,in light of congressional policy of promoting hmos.we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that the claims pryzbowski asserts against healthcare are completely preempted.it follows that the district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over the case and dismissed the claims against healthcare.
we are not unaware that our holding that healthcare will not be required to explain or defend the delay in provision of services to pryzbowski may leave her,and other beneficiaries,without effective relief for the improper administration of benefits.the delay attendant on the required preauthorization by hmos has been a matter of public concern.in fact,this has led the department of labor recently to publish a long pending final rule that requires that claims seeking pretreatment authorization for medical services must be decided within days and that imposes other stringent time limits on appeals from adverse decisions.see fed.reg.while the new rule applies only to claims filed on or after,it should serve to give notice to health care administrators that erisa not only provides protection from litigation arising from benefits administration but imposes certain responsibilities with respect to such administration.
claims against medemerge and the physician defendants 
jurisdiction 
unlike healthcare,medemerge and the physician defendants do not contend that the claims against them are completely preempted under a.neither can their anticipated defense of express preemption under a be the basis for removal of these claims.see franchise tax,at.as we stated in dukes,w hen the doctrine of complete preemption does not apply,but the plaintiff state claim is arguably preempted under a,the district court,being without removal jurisdiction,can not resolve the dispute regarding preemption.dukes,at.federal jurisdiction over pryzbowski claims against medemerge and the physician defendants,if it is to be sustained,must be based on another ground.
in this case,the district court did not rely on a preemption for its jurisdiction over these defendants but instead exercised supplemental jurisdiction under.that section authorizes a district court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.a.we have interpreted this provision to require the following t he federal claims must have substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction t he state and federal claims must derive from a common nucleus of operative fact and the plaintiff claims must be such that s he would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.in re prudential ins.am.sales practices,cir quoting united mine workers gibbs,d,which sustained the constitutionality of pendent jurisdiction.
we have already determined that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over pryzbowski claims against healthcare.moreover,pryzbowski claims against medemerge and the physician defendants are derived from the same factual predicate as her claims against healthcare,as all her claims stem from the treatment she received from all of the defendants in response to her complaint of back pain and the delay she experienced in securing the approval for the physicians and services that barolat believed were necessary.under these circumstances,it would be expected that all of pryzbowski claims against the defendants would be combined in one judicial proceeding.therefore,the district court had the authority for its exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over the claims against medemerge and the physician defendants.
pryzbowski argues that once the claims against healthcare were dismissed,the district court should have remanded her claims against the other defendants to state court.that was certainly an option for the district court but not one it was obliged to take.in new rock asset partners,preferred entity advancements,cir,we stated that where the party drops out and the federal court retains jurisdiction over what becomes a state law claim between parties,the bounds of article iii have not been crossed.in such situations,district courts have discretion to continue exercising supplemental jurisdiction.see id.
pryzbowski challenge to the district court failure to remand seems to be directed exclusively to a lack of jurisdiction in the district court.she has given us no persuasive reason why the district court decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction was an abuse of its discretion.the district court had become fully familiar with the factual background and the positions of the parties,and we see no reason why it should not have continued to exercise jurisdiction over pryzbowski claims against medemerge and the physician defendants.we certainly can not conclude that its decision was an abuse of discretion.
summary judgment 
once the district court dismissed the claims against healthcare counts and and counts and were dismissed without opposition,see pryzbowski,d at,the parties focused their discovery on counts and against medemerge and count against doctors pilla and ellis the remaining defendants then moved for summary judgment.in support of their motion,defendants filed the certification of their counsel,joseph lang,who attached extensive documentary evidence and references to certain depositions.these documents set forth pryzbowski medical history in connection with her complaints of back pain and efforts to obtain the necessary treatment and services the district court noted that plaintiff has not provided this court with any evidence whatsoever in opposing this motion but merely has referenced defendants exhibits from time to time,and that it was unable to consider unsupported conclusory allegations.id.at.
the district court viewed the defendants motion for summary judgment as having two bases.the first was that pryzbowski claims were preempted by a of erisa.the second was that pryzbowski failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted.we consider them in turn.
express preemption by a 
section a,the express preemption provision of erisa,provides that erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they relate to any employee benefit plan covered by the statute.a.erisa also includes a saving clause protecting from preemption state laws regulating insurance,banking,or securities.see b a.as we have explained,u nlike the scope of a b,which is jurisdictional and creates a basis for removal to federal court,a governs the law that will apply to state law claims,regardless of whether the case is brought in state or federal court.lazorko,at.
in one of the early cases to come before the supreme court concerning the express preemption provision,the court stated that a law relates to an employee benefit plan if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.shaw delta air lines,d.the court thereafter recognized that more guidance was needed in drawing the line between what was preempted and what was not.it attempted to do that in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d hereafter travelers,where the court stated that it would inquire into the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive.id.at.to that end,the court noted that congress intended 
to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among states or between states and the federal government,and to prevent the potential for conflict in substantive law requiring the tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction.
id.at.quoting mcclendon,d citation omitted ellipses and brackets in original.thus,the basic objective of the express preemption provision was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.id.at.
in travelers and several cases thereafter,the court held that the challenged state statutes were not preempted because they were laws of general application that were neither directed to erisa plans nor interfered with their administration.for example,in travelers the court held that a statute that imposed surcharges on hospital rates for patients with commercial insurance purchased by erisa plans,which was intended to help blue shield plans,had only an indirect economic effect on erisa plans and was not expressly preempted by a.see id.at.see also california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d state prevailing wage law does not relate to employee benefit plans and is not preempted by erisa where statute is indifferent to erisa coverage de buono med.and clinical servs.fund,d generally applicable gross receipts tax on health care facilities not preempted despite some burden on administration of erisa plans but see alessi,d state compensation act barring offset of workers pension benefits by compensation benefits preempted.
the issue of express preemption arises in other contexts than challenges to state statutes.one of the most frequent is the reliance by hmos and insurance companies on a in defending suits brought by beneficiaries arising out of the denial of plan benefits.this line of cases stems from the supreme court decision in pilot life ins.dedeaux,d,where a beneficiary of an erisa plan sued the insurance company that covered his employer disability employee benefit plan,alleging it improperly denied his claim for disability benefits.he claimed tortious breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duties,and fraud in the inducement.plaintiff sought to avoid preemption under a by trying to fit some of his claims into the saving clause exception for state laws regulating insurance,but the court rejected that effort.instead,the court viewed the common law causes of action raised in plaintiff complaint as based on alleged improper processing of a claim for benefits under an employee benefit plan,stated that such claims undoubtedly meet the criteria for under a,and held that the suit could not proceed because of the expansive sweep of the clause.id.at.
thus,suits against hmos and insurance companies for denial of benefits,even when the claim is couched in terms of common law negligence or breach of contract,have been held to be preempted by a.see,bast prudential ins.of,cir holding that a preempted,among other things,a claim alleging bad faith denial of benefits tolton american biodyne,cir holding that a preempted claims for wrongful death,medical malpractice,and insurance bad faith based on a refusal to authorize treatment corcoran united healthcare,cir holding that a preempted a wrongful death action based on the negligent denial of benefits.
the rationale for these holdings is that the decision whether a requested benefit or service is covered by the erisa plan falls within the scope of the administrative responsibilities of the hmo or insurance company,and therefore relates to the employee benefit plan.the same rationale has been applied by courts holding that suits against hmos for delay in authorizing benefits were preempted under a.for example,in kuhl lincoln health plan of.city,cir,the court considered a claim that the hmo canceled the beneficiary surgery in an hospital,thereby delaying his ability to receive treatment and leading to his death.although the complaint brought by his survivors alleged common law claims and characterized the hmo actions as malpractice,the court viewed the claim as based on improper processing of medical benefits,and therefore expressly preempted by a.see id.likewise,in spain aetna life ins,cir,the court held that a wrongful death claim based on the hmo delay in authorizing cancer treatment was expressly preempted because i
