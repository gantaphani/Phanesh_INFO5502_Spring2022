at the heart of this case is the debate over cash balance pension plans,a new type of plan that favors,in many cases,younger workers over those closer to retirement age.the plaintiff,james campbell,is a former employee of bankboston,a business that switched from a traditional defined benefit plan to a cash balance system.he sued,alleging violations of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,and the age discrimination in employment act adea,et.we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment for the defendants.
there is no dispute as to the facts.campbell was continuously employed by bankboston,and its corporate predecessors for years,through september.for the entirety of his employment,he worked in the domestic institutional custody business,which held and traded securities for mutual,pension,and endowment funds.campbell had reached the position of senior fiduciary specialist he was primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with regulation of the office of the comptroller of the currency,in the united states treasury department.see pt.regulating the fiduciary activities of national banks.
two different plans are at issue in this case.the first is a separation pay plan,adopted in and amended in.campbell says he was entitled to benefits under the plan.the second is the retirement plan,which bankboston converted to a cash balance plan in and amended in.the effect of the conversion and amendment,in practice,was to reduce campbell retirement benefits by about a year from what he would have expected to receive had the plan not been amended in.
separation pay plan 
bankboston predecessor,the first national bank of boston,adopted a separation pay plan on june,which provided compensation for employees whose employment is terminated as a result of work force reduction or job elimination.it did not apply to those who voluntarily left the company.it also required employees to make a reasonable and effective effort to secure a comparable position of employment,defined as one with a base salary within of the current job and which requires a reasonably similar employment background and skill set.the plan paid two weeks base pay for each full year of service.the plan administrator was given sole discretion to establish rules to administer the plan,to interpret and construe it,and to determine eligibility.moreover,the administrator had the power to amend,modify,or discontinue the plan for any reason at any time.
on july,bankboston announced the sale of its domestic institutional custody business to investors bank and trust ibt.ibt is not a national bank and thus does not fall under the scope of regulation.see id.c.the agreement with bankboston required ibt to offer comparable jobs to all bankboston custody employees.the sale closed on october.
bankboston announced that it would treat a refusal to accept a position with ibt as a voluntary resignation under the separation plan,thus denying the severance package to those custody employees who did not accept a job with ibt.many employees complained that this interpretation was contrary to the severance plan,which only denied benefits if employees did not pursue comparable internal job opportunities.the employees took that phrase to mean bankboston jobs,not job offers from other companies.in response,on september,the last day of employment for those working in the custody business,the plan administrator,helen drinan,amended the plan.the new amendment excluded those who refuse an offer of employment from an employer who acquires any of the assets or operations of a bankboston company or business.
campbell was offered a position at ibt.because ibt was not a national bank,it did not need to comply with regulation thus,the job ibt offered to campbell was not a regulation compliance position.ibt instead offered campbell the position of compliance manager within its trust and custody unit.campbell declined the offer of employment.as a result,bankboston did not pay campbell under the severance plan.at stake was two weeks of pay for each of the years that campbell had worked for bankboston,a total of more than.
b.the cash balance plan 
bankboston retirement plan prior to was a traditional defined benefit plan.a defined benefit plan pays an annuity based on the retiree earnings history,usually the most recent or years,and the number of completed years of service to the company.the bankboston plan was determined by a formula which factored in the retiree years of service,the average compensation at time of retirement,and the retiree social security primary benefit 
on january,bankboston adopted the cash balance retirement plan.cash balance plans are a type of defined benefit plan that guarantee an employee a certain employer contribution level,usually an annual percentage of salary,plus a fixed percentage of interest.cash balance plans may superficially resemble defined contribution plans,in which an employer deposits a fixed amount into an account.however,cash balance plans are actually defined benefit plans,because the level of interest is guaranteed.
the plan version adopted in contained a benefit safeguard minimum benefit guaranteeing that,for employees such as campbell,the retirement benefits would be at least as much as would have been payable had the previous defined benefit plan still been in place upon their retirement.one effect of this provision was that the benefits due under the previous plan continued to accrue for those employees protected by the grandfather clause.
in,bankboston commissioned a study of its benefits program,which concluded that this grandfather provision would cost the company a significant amount of money.thereafter,on january,bankboston again amended its retirement plan this amendment eliminated the continued accrual of benefits under the previous defined benefit plan after december.there is no contention that this amendment lacked internal revenue service irs approval.all accrued benefits were converted to cash balance accounts by calculating the value of accrued benefits as of the end of and crediting that amount in separate conversion accounts,where they continued to earn interest.because campbell would receive less under a cash balance formulation than under the benefit safeguard,even after that provision had ceased to accrue benefits,the december,amendment had the effect of ending campbell pension accrual altogether.
after the sale of bankboston custody business to ibt,campbell applied for retirement benefits.under the retirement plan in place before january,campbell benefit under the older defined benefit plan would have kept accruing until his retirement on september.he would therefore have expected to receive per year.however,under the plan amendment,campbell was due only per year,an annual difference of 
campbell filed a complaint in federal court on december.the original complaint named only bankboston as a defendant campbell later amended the complaint to include additional defendants the separation pay plan helen drinan,the plan administrator the cash balance retirement plan and the retirement plan committee.the amended complaint contained seven causes of action.campbell alleged that the separation pay plan denial of benefits constituted a violation of erisa,et,and a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.he alleged that the retirement plan replacement of the older defined benefit plan with a cash balance plan violated erisa,the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and adea.campbell also alleged that he was wrongly terminated because he was not permitted to continue to work for bankboston following the sale of the custody business to ibt,and that he was discriminated against on the basis of age because he and other highly compensated employees were not permitted to participate in an early retirement program.
on may,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on all seven counts.campbell bankboston,d.campbell appeals the grant of summary judgment as to his erisa challenge to bankboston pension plan,his erisa challenge to the denial of payment of separation plan benefits,and his age discrimination challenge to the retirement plan 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party favor.rochester ford sales,ford motor,cir.when reviewing the actions of plan administrators for challenges to denials of benefits under a b,the standard of review depends on the discretion afforded the administrator.if the benefit plan grants the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,we review only to ensure that the administrator decision is not arbitrary or capricious if the plan does not grant such discretionary authority,we review benefit decisions de novo.firestone tire rubber bruch,d see terry bayer,cir.we need not decide which standard applies because,for reasons we explain below,we do not reach the issue of campbell only challenge to a plan administrator decision.
separation pay plan 
campbell contends that at the time his position at bankboston was terminated,he was owed severance pay under the severance pay plan.he challenges the denial of severance plan benefits under a b,which creates an action for plan participants or beneficiaries to recover benefits due.
the severance plan amendment adopted on september,clearly and unequivocally denied campbell severance pay upon his refusal to accept a job offer from ibt.campbell challenge,then,depends both on a claim that the severance plan was impermissibly amended,and that he was due severance pay under the original plan.
the separation pay plan listed seven exceptions to separation pay eligibility.one of these exceptions included employees who accept a position with another bank of boston company or continue employment with an employer who acquires any of the assets or operations of a bank of boston company or business.on september,drinan modified this exception to include employees who accept a position with another bankboston company or continue employment with,or refuse an offer of employment by,an employer who acquires any of the assets or operations of a bankboston company or business.
campbell argues that the amendment was invalid because the plan administrator owes fiduciary duties to him.thus,he says,his right to severance pay should be determined under the text of the plan before it was amended.
fiduciary duties do attach to persons who exercise discretionary authority or control respecting management of the plan or management or disposition of its assets.a.a person has such fiduciary duties only when fulfilling these defined roles.the act of amending the terms of a plan is not one to which a fiduciary duty applies.see schoonejongen,d applying this distinction to welfare benefit plans such as severance plans see also lockheed spink,d extending this rule to pension benefit plans.this is true even when the employer amendment effectively makes a decision such as who is entitled to receive plan benefits and in what amounts or how such benefits are calculated.hughes aircraft jacobson,d.
campbell argues that the existence of a fiduciary duty depends not on the type of action taken but on the identity of the actor whether the plan sponsor or an independent administrator is amending the plan.because the plan administrator,drinan,was a fiduciary with regard to the management and distribution of the assets,campbell rationalizes,her fiduciary duty also applied to her amendment of the plan.this argument fails.the erisa fiduciary duty doctrine envisions that one entity will have fiduciary duty attach to some activities but not others the existence of a duty turns not on who acts but on the nature of the action.see,lockheed,at,at.though drinan management decisions were under the auspices of fiduciary duty,her decision to amend the plan was not.the fact that here the plan administrator was a natural person and not a in many of the supreme court of no moment erisa defines person to mean both individuals and organizations,such as corporations.as a result,that is not a relevant distinction under erisa.
there are statutory limits,imposed by erisa,on the ability of an employer to amend a plan involving vested benefits.for example,amendments may not decrease the accrued benefit of a participant.g until they are paid,however,severance plan benefits have not vested.a severance plan is defined as a welfare benefit plan,see id.massachusetts morash,d,and as such,severance plans are exempted from the vesting and funding sections of erisa,a see allen adage,cir.thus,employers may amend or eliminate a severance pay plan at any time,at.reichelt emhart,cir.
because the plan administrator was not acting as a fiduciary when she amended the severance plan,and because employers have the right to amend or end a welfare benefit plan at any time,the september,amendment to bankboston separation pay plan was proper.campbell does not contest that,under the terms of the amendment to the plan,he was not owed severance pay.it was not a violation of erisa for campbell not to have been paid benefits under the separation pay plan 
retirement plan 
background 
the adoption of cash balance plans,and in particular the transition to such plans from more traditional defined benefit plans,has become increasingly controversial.the first cash balance plan was adopted in.since that time,hundreds of companies have converted to the newer cash balance plans.
in traditional defined benefit retirement plans,such as bankboston plan,a large share of the pension benefits are reaped by older employees in their final years of service.this is because the benefits are calculated based on years of service to the company and on the average of the highest years of salary,which usually occur in the final years.by contrast,in a cash balance system,much of the pension benefit is gained in the early years of service,because the pension account earns interest.the more time there is until retirement,the more a given amount in the account will grow.thus,even though early additions to the pension account may be based on a percentage of a much smaller salary,the effects of time mean that these additions will contribute to the final total much more than larger additions to the account entered closer to retirement.
there are many reasons why companies may wish to switch to a cash balance plan.cash balance plans favor younger workers,while traditional defined benefit plans favor experienced employees who plan on staying with one company.cash balance plans are also more portable than plans,because they can be taken as a lump sum upon leaving the company.thus,a move to a cash balance plan is one way for a company to attract younger and more mobile workers.furthermore,if a company has an older workforce,a cash balance plan may be a cheaper plan to administer.under a traditional plan,the largest benefits are earned in the years immediately preceding retirement.because there is little time for interest to accrue,an annuity purchased to secure those benefits will be more expensive.cash balance plans award benefits earlier in an employee career,and so they may be less expensive for employers.
if begun from scratch,cash balance plans would not be terribly controversial.the controversy engenders from the transition from traditional defined benefit plans.older workers,such as campbell,expected to see their pension benefits rise dramatically as a result of their service just before retirement.instead,as a result of their companies adoption of cash balance plans,their pension increases under the old plans ceased.
under some plans,these workers whose traditional benefits have ceased to accrue are at least entitled to cash balance plan benefits.however,some transition schemes,including that employed by bankboston,include a provision.this provision specifies that employees pension entitlement does not grow until their pension benefits,as calculated under the new cash balance system,equal their actual accrued benefits under the old system.benefits already earned under an old plan may not be taken away,see d a g,but benefits expected but not yet accrued are not similarly protected.the result is
