sarah fink admitted herself for psychiatric hospital treatment in late,expecting that her medical expenses would fall within the continuation group health coverage that her mother,margaret fink,had obtained from a former employer,platte community memorial hospital,platte.five days later,platte terminated contracts with its group health benefits provider,dakotacare,a south dakota health maintenance organization,and with dakotacare administrative services,das,a dakotacare subsidiary hired to assist platte in providing continuation benefits.margaret fink declined to elect platte new group health benefits plan for,but she paid the january continuation coverage premium to dakotacare after discovering sarah was ill.dakotacare refunded the premium in late january and refused to pay for medical services rendered to sarah after the effective date of platte termination of dakotacare.
sarah then commenced this action,asserting numerous state law claims against platte,dakotacare,and das.defendants removed the case to federal court.the district court concluded that all of sarah state law claims are preempted by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,as amended by the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of cobra.after recharacterizing those claims as erisa claims,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of platte,dakotacare,and das.sarah appeals,challenging the district court preemption and summary judgment rulings,which are issues we review de novo.see painter golden rule ins,cir,cert.denied,d stearns ncr,cir,cert.denied,d.we reverse.
background 
margaret fink resigned her employment with platte in early,moving to the state of washington.platte was a covered employer then maintaining a group health benefits plan,so cobra required platte to offer margaret continuation coverage for at least eighteen months after a qualifying event such as termination of employment.see a.continuation coverage must consist of coverage which is identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated beneficiaries under the plan with respect to whom a qualifying event has not occurred.margaret elected to purchase the cobra continuation coverage offered by platte group health provider,dakotacare.that coverage began on february.as a student at the lutheran school of theology in chicago,sarah was then an eligible dependent under platte group health plan and therefore a qualified cobra beneficiary.see a ii.
the critical events for purposes of this appeal occurred in late and early.in november,platte decided to switch group health providers from dakotacare to lincoln mutual insurance company.platte sent margaret fink a letter informing her of the impending switch on december,margaret applied for health insurance offered by her new employer and sent platte a letter advising that w e are choosing not to go on the new lincoln mutual insurance plan.on december,sarah admitted herself to mckennan hospital mckennan for treatment of a disorder.on december,after learning of her daughter illness,margaret paid the continuation coverage premium for january with a check payable to dakotacare cobra services,enclosing the appropriate payment voucher.margaret testified that she paid this premium to ensure there was no gap in her family health insurance coverage,because she did not know when she would be covered by her new employer health plan,or when platte switch from dakotacare to lincoln mutual would take effect.
in the days that followed sarah hospital admission,a dakotacare employee repeatedly assured mckennan staff that sarah mental health treatment was covered under margaret continuation coverage.however,on january or,dakotacare received notice that platte had cancelled its group health benefits contract with dakotacare effective january.on january,dakotacare informed margaret by letter that her continuation coverage was terminated effective january,and dakotacare refunded margaret december premium payment on january.sarah remained in the hospital through february.on may,mckennan informed margaret that she would be billed for all of the medical expenses sarah incurred between january and february.the finks assert they would have transferred sarah to another hospital had they known that platte group health plan did not cover sarah treatment at mckennan.
after concluding that all of sarah state law claims are preempted by erisa,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of dakotacare and das because o nce the contract between dakotacare and platte terminated,the coverage of platte plan members also ended.the court then granted summary judgment in favor of platte,the plan sponsor under erisa,because its decision to switch its group health plan from dakotacare to lincoln mutual was not a qualifying event under cobra,see,and therefore platte had no duty to notify margaret that she must switch to the new provider to continue her continuation coverage.in addition,the court concluded that sarah leaving school was a second qualifying event,but it did not trigger platte duty to notify sarah of additional cobra rights because neither margaret nor sarah notified platte of the event.
ii.erisa preemption 
sarah fink complaint asserted common law claims against dakotacare and das common law tort claims against dakotacare,das,and platte and claims for violation of the unfair trade practices chapter of the south dakota insurance laws against dakotacare.see codified laws to.the district court dismissed these claims as preempted by erisa.we agree.
in pilot life ins.dedeaux,d,the supreme court held that erisa civil enforcement provisions,codified at a,are the exclusive vehicle for actions by participants and beneficiaries asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits.applying pilot life,this court has consistently held that state law causes of action are completely preempted by erisa when they arise from the administration of benefits.kuhl lincoln nat.health plan,cir,cert.denied,d see painter,at donatelli home ins,cir.it is clear that sarah state law claims arise from the denial of her claim for continuation coverage benefits under platte group health plan.that plan was a welfare benefit plan governed by erisa.see.
seeking to save her state law claims from this doctrine,sarah first argues that recent supreme court decisions have narrowed the scope of erisa preemption.even if that is true in other contexts,the court has expressly declined invitations to either expand or contract the pilot life doctrine that erisa civil enforcement remedies preempt conflicting or competing state law judicial remedies.see rush prudential hmo,moran,d unum life ins.of am.ward,d.
second,sarah argues that her claims for violation of the south dakota unfair insurance practices act are saved from preemption by the erisa savings clause,which excepts from the statute broad preemption provision any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.b a.but this argument ignores the distinction between a substantive state insurance law,which if saved will provide a relevant rule of decision in an erisa civil enforcement action,unum,at,and a state judicial remedy,which is under pilot life even if it was created or authorized by a state insurance statute.see generally equitable life assurance soc y of crysler,cir.the district court correctly ruled that sarah state law causes of action,including her claims under the south dakota unfair insurance practices statute,are preempted by erisa.
iii.sarah erisa claims 
when a complaint pleading only state law claims that are preempted by erisa is removed to federal court,one or more of the claims must be recharacterized as an erisa claim to establish federal jurisdiction.see metro.life ins.taylor,d.in this case,sarah filed a third amended complaint after removal that both reasserted her state law claims and added an erisa claim against only dakotacare.the district court nonetheless recharacterized sarah claims against platte and das as erisa claims before granting summary judgment in favor of these defendants as well as dakotacare.this was error.when a plaintiff after removal amends her initial complaint to asser
