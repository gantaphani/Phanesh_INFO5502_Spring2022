opinion of the court 
appellant john bauer appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment for appellee summit bancorp summit and denying his for summary judgment on his claim count one that summit retirement plan violates the employment retirement income security act of erisa,as amended,et because it excludes hourly employees.based upon the following discussion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the material facts are undisputed.bauer worked as a summit sales representative for approximately eighteen and years,from may,until november.he was compensated on an hourly basis,apparently to accommodate his schedule as a firefighter.thereafter,for approximately years,from november,until july,bauer was compensated by summit on a salaried basis.neither party disputes that in each of the years that bauer was employed,he completed at least hours of service per year.
in,after years of employment with summit,bauer retired.he applied for his retirement benefits under the plan.summit benefit administrators advised him that he was eligible to receive retirement benefits based upon only his years of service as a salaried employee.although his years as an hourly employee were not counted in computing retirement benefits for the years he was ineligible to participate in the plan as an hourly employee,they were counted in satisfying the plan vesting period for the years he was eligible to participate in the plan as a salaried employee.see part infra.
b.the plan 
the plan was first implemented in.it was amended and restated in and again in.the portions of the plan pertinent to this appeal remain in substance unchanged over the years.see notes,infra.they can be described in terms of the number of credited years of service as an employee in computing benefits,minimum requirements,and minimum vesting standards.
employee is defined in section of the plan as any person who is employed by an employer who is compensated by a weekly,monthly or annual salary,regardless of the number of hours worked emphasis added.benefits are calculated based upon a participant years of service.years of service are defined in section of the plan to mean a year or fraction of a year during which a participant is or was an employee of the company or a corporation or branch acquired by the company emphasis added.a year of service is earned for each calendar year in which an employee is paid or entitled to payment for hours by the corporation.
an eligibility computation period is used to establish an employee entitlement to participate in a qualified plan.section of the plan,regarding minimum standards states 
eligibility requirements.
an employee who was a participant in the prior plan on june,shall continue his participation thereafter if he continues to be employed by an employer.any other employee shall commence participation in the plan on the first day of the month following the latest of 
a his birthday 
b his completion of one year of service or 
c the date his employer adopts the plan.
each employee shall automatically become a participant immediately upon becoming eligible in accordance with the foregoing requirements,and shall continue as a participant for as long as he is an employee 
the second basic computation period is the vesting computation period.it is used to determine what portion of an employee benefit is at a given point in time section of the plan required that after five years of service,an employee was vested 
vested percentage of accrued benefit.
upon termination of his employment for any reason other than retirement,a participant shall be entitled to the following vested percentage of his accrued benefit 
the plan in this appeal is what has commonly been referred to over the last thirty years as a plan.such a plan covers salaried employees of summit and its subsidiaries,who are age and above,and,who have completed one year of service.by its terms,summit hourly employees are not eligible to participate in the plan.as stated,years of service as an hourly employee are counted for vesting purposes,but are not counted for participation purposes.
procedural background 
when bauer was advised by summit benefit administrators that he was eligible to receive retirement benefits based upon only his years of salaried service,he exercised his administrative rights under the plan and appealed to its benefits committee.he requested benefits under the plan retroactive to his original date of hire in.the benefits committee denied his request and affirmed the initial denial of claimed benefits 
bauer then filed a complaint in federal district court against summit alleging that its plan violated erisa as it excluded hourly employees from participating.the district court disagreed.it granted summit motion for summary judgment and denied bauer for summary judgment.this appeal follows.
ii.issue on appeal 
bauer raises only one issue on appeal whether the district court erred in granting summit motion for summary judgment on the basis that the plan did not violate erisa when it included salaried employees,and excluded hourly employees,as eligible plan participants.
iii.standard of review 
we exercise a plenary review of the grant by the district court of summit motion for summary judgment,using the same standards as employed by the district court initially.see jordan federal express,cir,citing sempier johnson higgins,cir.
iv.discussion 
introduction 
nothing in erisa requires employers to establish employee benefits plans.lockheed spink,d.neither does it require that every employee is entitled to participate in a plan that it does decide to offer,for,as the supreme court,in shaw delta air lines,d,stated erisa does not mandate that employers provide any particular benefits,and does not itself proscribe discrimination in the provision of employee benefits.id.at.what erisa does require,however,is that if an employer decides to provide a plan,that plan is subject to certain minimum requirements regarding participation,funding and vesting standards.id.citing see also alessi,d 
the present erisa litigation has arisen because summit has excluded bauer from participating in its plan for the years he was employed on an hourly basis,affording him benefits for only the years he was employed on a salaried basis.bauer claims that he is also entitled to participate in the plan for each of his years of employment.bauer,in essence,asserts that he is entitled to benefit coverage although he is explicitly excluded by the terms of the plan itself.his cause of action arises under.
statutory analysis 
recovery of benefits 
an action for benefits under an erisa plan may be brought only by a participant in or beneficiary of an erisa plan.a a.under erisa,a participant is defined as any employee or former employee of an employer who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.an employee is defined by erisa as any individual employed by an employer.
erisa provides bauer with a specific cause of action with which to challenge his denial of benefits.it authorizes a suit by a participant to recover benefits due under the terms of an erisa plan or to enforce or clarify rights under the erisa plan.a b 
a plaintiff must satisfy two requirements to establish participant status.see wolf,cir.first,the plaintiff must be a common law employee.see nationwide mut.ins.darden,d second,the plaintiff must be,according to the language of the plan itself,eligible to receive a benefit under the plan.an individual who fails on either prong lacks standing to bring a claim for benefits under a plan established pursuant to erisa.id.citing clark dupont de nemours,wl cir,table.
we are required to enforce the plan as written unless we find a provision of erisa that contains a contrary directive.see bellas cbs,cir,cert.denied,d dade north am.philips,cir.the erisa provision identified by bauer in this appeal as a contrary directive is a.
minimum participation requirements under a 
the only limitation imposed by erisa on any of the requirements for participation is entitled minimum participation,and is set forth in a.it states no pension plan may require,as a condition of participation in the plan,that a employee complete a period of service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan extending beyond the later of the following dates i the date on which the employee attains the age of or ii the date on which he completes year of service.a a.
the section continues a plan shall be treated as not meeting the requirements of a unless it provides that any employee who has satisfied the minimum age and service requirements specified in such paragraph,and who is otherwise entitled to participate in the plan,commences participation in the plan no later than the earlier of a the first day of the first plan year beginning after the date on which such employee satisfied such requirements,or b the date months after the date on which he satisfied such requirements a emphasis added.
minimum participation standards and internal revenue code sections a and a 
we may look to the internal revenue code to determine whether or not the erisa section being construed has a counterpart.see gillis hoechst celanese,cir.juxtaposed in the statute alongside the minimum participation standards of erisa is internal revenue code,also entitled minimum participation standards.it states a trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under section a if the plan of which it is a part requires a condition of participation in the plan,that an employee complete a period of service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan extending beyond the later of the following dates i the date on which the employee attains the age of or ii the date on which he completes year of service.a a.we then look to irc a,a,as directed.
irc a a provides that a classification shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph regarding contributions or benefits that discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees or section b a i regarding minimum coverage requirements that discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees merely because it is limited to salaried or clerical employees.emphasis added.a classification limiting plan coverage to salaried or clerical employees shall not,for that sole reason,be considered discriminatory.a a reg.a b 
plan classifications of employees 
neither party disputes that bauer is a common law employee.he thus satisfies the first prong necessary to obtain participant status.see wolf,at.we must turn,therefore,to an analysis of the second prong,that is,whether bauer is an employee eligible for benefits under the terms of the plan itself.id.
contentions of the parties 
introduction 
there has been considerable litigation involving plans that exclude employees who are paid by the hour.perhaps due to the clear language of the statute,a a and a a,the case law has focused,not on whether the plan classification was allowable under the statute,but whether it discriminated in favor of highly compensated employees to the detriment of the excluded hourly workers as it was applied 
bauer argument regarding minimum participation standards under erisa as applied to plan classifications 
here bauer does not contend that the hourly plan classification discriminates in favor of those who are highly compensated in application.neither does he dispute that,under the express terms of the summit plan,he is ineligible for benefits for the years he was classified as an hourly employee.
what bauer alleges is that summit plan violates erisa minimum participation requirements,a,by restricting its definition of an employee to those who were salaried.by not crediting his years of hourly employment,the plan,bauer argues,imposed an additional requirement not sanctioned by any statute or regulation.
bauer claims that any employee,however compensated,who works hours a year or more is entitled to pension benefits for that year.bauer contends that,once an employee meets the minimum standard of participation,the latter of reaching age or completing one year of service,he or she is eligible to participate,and summit can not impose a third requirement that an employee be salaried 
other than to cite a,bauer does not point to any contrary directive in the erisa statute that would forbid summit to limit participation in its plan to its salaried employees.see bellas,at.the case authority offered in support for bauer proposition is an unpublished,unreported,yet factually similar,case from the southern district of new york.there the issue was raised on a motion to dismiss.ambris bank of new york,wl.
in ambris,the employee argued that the hourly classification functioned as an impermissible additional service requirement.in denying the defendant motion to dismiss,the ambris court heard no evidence,was limited to the four corners of the complaint,and owed deference to the plaintiff.
even given this procedural setting,bauer argues that ambris is sound and correctly reasoned and that its reasoning is grounded in basic principles of statutory and regulatory construction,that what congress says in a statute is what it means citations omitted.
the district court in the southern district of new york did not reason in ambris.it merely found that,in ruling on a rule b motion,it did not appear that the plaintiff had not stated a claim upon which relief could be granted.ambris,wl at.from a precedential standpoint,nothing more can be inferred.unlike the case before us,the merits of the ambris plaintiff claim were never reached 
summit argument 
summit argues that a minimum participation standards do not prevent an employer from denying an employee participation in an erisa plan as long as that exclusion is made on a basis other than age or length of service.summit has consistently excluded employees from participation.this exclusion is not premised upon an employee age or length of service.
in support of its position,summit cites lynn csx,cir plan limited participation to,salaried employees,excluding hourly employees from coverage in addition,summit contends that the district court correctly dismissed ambris as unpersuasive.
recent erisa litigation regarding worker classifications 
recent litigation regarding the use of statutory erisa standards to provide benefit plan coverage to certain classifications of workers has centered upon contractors,leased employees and temporary employees.
freelancers,agents or other independent contractors 
in capital,ratcliff,cir,the tenth circuit upheld the denial of claims for benefits coverage sought by a class of newspaper agents for the kansas city star newspaper.the class of plaintiffs had signed an agency agreement acknowledging that they were independent contractors,not employees,and therefore excluded from participation in the benefits plan.the court,deferring to the terms of the erisa plans,found that there was no dispute that the carriers had knowingly agreed to be excluded.see also trombetta cragin fed.bank for sav.employee stock ownership plan,cir where the seventh circuit found the plaintiffs were not common law employees as they had signed individual agreements designating themselves as independent contractors for all purposes 
leased employees 
in abraham exxon,cir,individuals who worked as leased employees were specifically excluded under the terms of exxon plans.id.at.the plan administrator denied the plaintiffs benefit claims on this basis.the fifth circuit affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment for exxon.the court concluded that the minimum participation requirements of erisa a did not preclude an employer from denying participation in an erisa plan if the employer does so for reasons other than age or length of service,stating 
section a does nothing more than forbid employers to deny participation in an erisa plan to an employee on the basis of age or length of service if he is at least years of age and has completed at least one year of service.section a does not prevent employers from denying participation in an erisa plan if the employer does so on a basis other than age or length of service.
id.at emphasis added 
similar results were reached by the fourth circuit in clark dupont de n
