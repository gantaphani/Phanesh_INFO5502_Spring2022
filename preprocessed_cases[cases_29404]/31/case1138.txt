albertson,employees disability plan and several other albertson employee plans albertson bring this appeal from the district court order reversing albertson decision to terminate stacey shane shane long term disability ltd benefits received under albertson employees disability benefits plan the disability plan.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to,and we affirm.
background 
shane is a former albertson employee and participated in albertson disability plan.in april of,shane suffered a knee injury and began receiving ltd benefits on january.from january,through january,shane received and was continuously for ltd benefits.however,based upon the results of a year recertification initiated by albertson in april of,albertson medical review committee mrc discontinued shane ltd benefits beyond april,stating that shane no longer met the disability plan definition of total disability.shane administrative appeal of the decision was denied on september.on february,shane filed the instant suit in district court pursuant to a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.
before the district court,several issues were presented including whether the court should refer to albertson disability plan effective as of august,the disability plan or the disability plan effective as of february,the disability plan and the appropriate standard for reviewing the termination of shane ltd benefits.the district court set the matter for trial on march,however,after receiving briefing from the parties,the district court vacated the trial date and took the matter under submission.on july,the district court ruled in favor of shane by finding that the disability plan governed shane ltd claim and,in applying the de novo standard of review,that shane was entitled to continue receiving ltd benefits.the instant appeal by albertson followed.

iii.discussion 
a.did the district court err in finding that the disability plan governed shane ltd benefits claim 
albertson contends that the district court erred in finding that the disability plan,rather than the disability plan,applied to shane ltd claim.however,albertson contention on this point is not supported by the record.notably,the disability plan,while granting albertson the right to amend the provisions of the disability plan at any time also expressly provides that 
a ny amendment to the plan shall be effective only with respect to total disabilities which commence on and after the effective date of the amendment.total disabilities commencing prior to the effective date of a plan amendment are to be provided for under the terms of the plan in effect at the time those disabilities commenced.
importantly,shane began receiving her ltd benefits on january,thus qualifying her as a total disability under the scope of the disability plan and well prior to the effective date of the amended and restated disability plan.in addition,based upon shane qualification for ltd benefits prior to the effective date of the disability plan,the plain language of the disability plan defers to the disability plan by stating that total disabilities commencing prior to the effective date of a plan amendment are to be provided for under the terms of the plan in effect at the time those disabilities commenced.because shane total disability commenced while the disability plan was in effect,the subsequent disability plan,by its own terms,has no application.
we also find unpersuasive albertson argument that the disability plan applies based upon the fact that the disability plan was in existence prior to the mrc decision to terminate shane benefits.albertson,citing paul revere life ins,cir,argues that i t is well settled that the controlling plan is the plan in effect at the time of sic the final decision is made.however,albertson argument overstates the holding in and ignores the plain language of the and disability plans.in the employee disability coverage claim was governed by the plan in effect at the time the employee claim accrued because n othing in the employee policy with the employer assured employees that their rights were vested.id.at.in this case,unlike,both the and disability plans possess clear language establishing that shane ltd claim is to be provided for under the terms of the plan in effect at the time her disabilit y commenced.shane ltd benefits based upon her t otal d isability commenced during the disability plan and prior to the disability plan,thus her claim is governed by the disability plan.as such,the district court determination to apply the disability plan is sound 
b.did the district court err in relying on the doctrine of contra proferentem in determining that the disability plan governed shane ltd benefit claim 
in finding that the disability plan controlled shane ltd claim,the district court cited the doctrine of contra proferentem by stating that i f a term is ambiguous it will be construed against the drafter and aligned with the reasonable expectations of the insured.as correctly noted by albertson,the doctrine of contra proferentem is not applicable to erisa plans,such as the disability plan at issue in this case.see winters costco wholesale,cir t he rule of contra proferentem is not applicable to erisa plans that bestow explicit discretionary authority upon an administrator to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.therefore,the district court citation to the doctrine raises a concern regarding its determination that the disability plan controls.however,while the district court cited the doctrine of contra proferentem,the district court decision is wholly absent of any indication that it actually applied the doctrine in construing the provisions of the and disability plans.a plain reading of the district court decision demonstrates that none of the relevant terms or provisions construed were deemed to be ambiguous.as such,we find the citation to the doctrine to be immaterial to the district court ultimate determination applying the disability plan.
c.did the district court apply the correct standard of review regarding albertson decision to discontinue ltd benefits to shane 
albertson contends that even if the district court properly relied on the disability plan,its decision to apply the de novo standard of review rather than the abuse of discretion standard to albertson decision to terminate shane ltd benefits constitutes reversible error.albertson takes issue with the district court finding that the mrc,the body that terminated shane ltd benefits,was not properly vested with the requisite discretionary authority to review shane ltd claim,which led to the district court de novo review.
as an initial matter,there is no issue with the district court finding that the disability plan provides discretionary authority to the identified plan fiduciary,the trustees,to review and evaluate ltd claims such as shane.notably,the disability plan grants the trustees the authority t o determine all questions relating to the eligibility of employees for benefits,as well as the amount and payment of benefits.as such,had the trustees made the decision to discontinue shane ltd benefits the district court would have likely invoked the abuse of discretion standard of review.see abatie,at i f the plan does confer discretionary authority as a matter of contractual agreement,then the standard of review shifts to abuse of discretion.citation omitted emphasis in original.however,the mrc,not the trustees,was the body that made the decision to terminate shane ltd benefits.therefore,the issue is whether the mrc prop
