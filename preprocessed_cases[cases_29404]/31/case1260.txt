background 
at all pertinent times,welch was an employee of the coleman company.on march,coleman entered into an agreement with unum to provide ltd insurance for all employees.welch became eligible for this insurance on september.
prior to the enactment of amendment in august,the ltd plan provided that for an employee who became disabled before the age of sixty,the maximum benefit period was until age,but not less than sixty months.aplt app.vol.i,at.this initial plan contained a termination provision which stated,t ermination of this policy under any conditions will not prejudice any payable claim which occurs while this policy is in force.id.at.it also contained a provision stating that the policy may be changed in whole or in part.id.at.
on january,welch became disabled,claiming that she was no longer able to work due to fatigue,joint pain,and headaches.on or about july,unum received welch claim for ltd benefits.she reported that she was unable to work due to chronic pain and extreme fatigue.welch was diagnosed with fibromyalgia,which is a chronic pain disorder characterized by w idespread musculoskeletal pain and excess tenderness and fatigue.id.at.
in a letter dated september,unum notified welch that her claim for disability benefits had been approved retroactive to july.id.at.the ltd plan provides for a elimination period,which is a period of consecutive days of disability for which no benefit is payable.the elimination period begins on the first day of disability.id.at.because welch became disabled on january,her elimination period did not conclude until july.the letter also gave an explanation of how welch benefits were calculated and when to expect monthly benefits checks,as well as notice that ongoing benefits were conditioned upon her ability to meet the definition of disability and that the maximum period of payment was to age.id.at.
on august,the ltd plan was amended by unum and coleman.the amendment,referred to as amendment,stated that t he entire policy is replaced by the policy attached to this amendment.id.at.amendment contained a limitation period for payments on disabilities,due to sickness or injury,which are primarily based on symptoms.id.at.amendment defined symptoms as 
the manifestations of your condition which you tell your doctor,that are not verifiable using tests,procedures,or clinical examinations standardly accepted in the practice of medicine.examples of symptoms include,but are not limited to headaches,pain,fatigue,stiffness,soreness,ringing in ears,dizziness,numbness and loss of energy.
id.at.amendment provided that t he effective date of these changes is january.id.at.claims for disabilities which occurred prior to that date were to be determined according to the initial plan,while claims for disabilities which occurred after that date were to be determined with reference to amendment.id.
on april,unum wrote to welch about the status of her ltd claim.id.at.the letter informed her that her benefits,assuming her condition remained the same,would only be paid through july.id.the letter explained that the plan under which unum would be providing benefits had a limitation for disabilities based on symptoms and that the medical information contained in welch file with unum indicated that her disability fell within the limitation.id.
on september,welch requested unum to reconsider its decision to limit her benefits pursuant to the symptoms limitation.id.at.she asserted that this limitation was not included in the plan summary available to coleman or to her at the time she left coleman and thus should not be applied to her.id.welch also disputed unum position that her illness was not verifiable,and she enclosed copies of medical records from november,january,july,and june,as well as copies of letters from her doctor.id.
in a letter dated november,unum advised welch that it had reviewed the information she had provided,along with the medical records previously contained in her file.id.at.however,unum stated that welch claim would continue to be paid under the symptoms limitation since an organic etiology for her symptoms ha d not been determined.id.at.while acknowledging that welch was diagnosed with fibromyalgia,unum asserted that the severity of your fibromyalgia is based solely on your self reported symptoms.id.after several more such exchanges,unum sent welch a letter dated september,stating that after completing its review,unum original decision to deny welch continued benefits was appropriate.id.at.the letter also stated that because welch is claiming disability as of january,she is subject to the provisions of the policy dated january.id.at.
on september,welch filed suit in the district court of sedgwick county,kansas,seeking a declaratory judgment that unum had improperly discontinued her ltd benefits.unum removed to the federal district court for the district of kansas pursuant to on the undisputed ground that the suit implicates the employee retirement and income security act erisa.both parties submitted motions for summary judgment to the magistrate judge hearing the case.the magistrate judge ruled in favor of welch and against unum.
the magistrate judge found that unum had the power to retroactively amend the ltd plan.however,he found that c ourts,in a variety of contexts,have rejected retroactive application of modifications if it affects benefits that have vested or already become due.aplt app.vol.ii,at magistrate judge mem.order,filed,citing chiles ceridian,cir.the magistrate judge found that the termination provision of the initial ltd plan provided that benefits would vest if and when the plan was terminated.additionally,the court found that w hen amendment was enacted on august,the initial policy was replaced in its entirety and was therefore terminated.id.at.therefore,the magistrate judge ruled that welch benefits had vested and that unum retroactive application of amendment improperly deprived her of her vested benefits.he declared that welch ltd benefits can not be limited to months under the symptom provision of the new plan,and that she was entitled to receive benefit payments each month until she reaches age,but not less than months,as long as she continues to be disabled as defined by the provisions of the plan.id.at.unum filed a motion to alter or amend judgment,which the magistrate judge denied.
unum now appeals,asserting that the magistrate judge improperly held that welch benefits under the initial plan vested upon termination,the magistrate judge improperly held that the initial plan was terminated by the enactment of amendment,and the magistrate judge,as a matter of law,should have entered summary judgment for unum.because we agree that the initial plan did not terminate,we reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of welch.however,because the magistrate judge did not determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious for unum to apply amendment symptoms limitation to welch claim for benefits based on her condition of fibromyalgia,we also remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellant.meiners university of kansas,cir.in interpreting the terms of an erisa plan,we examine the plan documents as a whole and,if unambiguous,we construe them as a matter of law.chiles ceridian,cir.we apply the de novo standard of review to interpret the terms of a plan,giving the language its common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person in the position of the plan participant,not the actual participant,would have understood the words to mean.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
vesting under a welfare benefit plan 
erisa regulates two types of benefit plans,pension benefit plans that create vested rights and welfare benefit plans that need not create vested rights.member servs.life ins.am.bank trust of sapulpa,cir.the coleman ltd plan is a welfare benefit plan because disability insurance plans are considered welfare,not pension,benefits.chiles,at.welfare benefit plans are 
exempt from the statutory vesting requirements that erisa imposes on pension benefits.accordingly,an employer may amend the terms of a welfare benefit plan or terminate it entirely.however,benefits under a welfare benefit plan may vest under the terms of the plan itself and an amendment to any erisa plan may not operate retroactively if that amendment deprives a beneficiary of a vested benefit.
member services,at citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis added.see also chiles,at benefits provided under a welfare benefit plan need never vest an employer or plan sponsor may unilaterally modify or terminate welfare benefits,unless it contractually agrees to grant vested benefits.p laintiffs carry the burden of showing an agreement or other demonstration of employer intent to have benefits vest under the plan.chiles,at.
because unum retroactively applied amendment which was enacted august,to limit benefits for welch disability which began january,we must determine whether the ltd plan included a contractual promise that benefits would vest upon the occurrence of some condition.because an employee benefit plan must be established by a written instrument,a promise to provide vested benefits must be incorporated,in some fashion,into the formal written erisa plan.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we interpret the terms of the ltd plan de novo to determine whether the plan included a promise to vest benefits.id.if it did,and if welch benefits had indeed vested under it,then it was inappropriate for unum to retroactively apply amendment to welch claim.
unum contests the magistrate judge finding that the ltd plan vested benefits upon the termination of the plan as well as welch arguments that the ltd plan vested benefits upon the conclusion of the elimination period,and the attainment of her disability.we address each contention in turn.because we conclude that welch benefits were not vested under the ltd plan,we hold that it was not improper for unum to retroactively apply amendment to welch claim for benefits.
vesting upon plan termination 
a.did the plan provide for vesting upon plan termination 
the initial ltd plan contained a provision which stated,t ermination of this policy under any conditions will not prejudice any payable claim which occurs while this policy is in force.aplt app.vol.i,at.the magistrate judge found that this provision constituted a contractual promise to vest benefits in the event of the plan termination.see aplt app.vol.ii,at reasoning that a reasonable person in the position of welch would read the termination provision in the initial plan as allowing to change the terms of the plan,but if the plan terminates,her disability benefits may not be prejudiced,reduced or withdrawn,if she had a payable claim before the plan was terminated.subsequently,the magistrate found that the enactment of amendment caused the plan to terminate,triggering the vesting of welch benefits,such that it was improper for unum to retroactively apply amendment to limit welch disability benefits.id.at.because we hold,as discussed below,that the initial ltd plan did not terminate,it is unnecessary for us to decide whether or not the plan termination clause included the clear and express language necessary to guarantee the contractual vesting of a welfare benefit.chiles,at internal quotation marks omitted.
was the initial plan terminated by amendment 
the magistrate judge found that amendment effectively terminated the initial ltd plan and replaced it with a new plan.to reach this conclusion,the court relied on the language of amendment,which stated that t he entire policy is replaced by the policy attached to this amendment,aplt app.vol.i,at,and a review of the history of the disability plan,which showed that 
i n the past,some amendments purported to simply modify portions of the plan by changing only specific sections of the plan and substituting a few new pages in the policy however,other amendments including amendment which is relevant by their own terms to entirely replace the old plan,with a completely new policy attached to the amendment.
aplt app.vol.ii,at.
as the magistrate judge noted,there is a scarcity of guidance on questions of welfare plan termination.chiles,at.thus,we must evaluate all of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of amendment to determine whether it actually effected a termination of the initial plan.we conclude that the factors considered by the magistrate are not dispositive of a plan termination.rather,we hold that the facts of this case show that the ltd plan was modified,not terminated.
first we observe that unum did not undertake any administrative steps that would indicate that amendment terminated the initial plan and created a new plan.unum did not follow the guidelines set forth in the plan documents for terminating the plan.with respect to termination of a welfare plan,erisa only requires that t he assets of a welfare plan which terminates shall be distributed in accordance with the terms of the plan except as otherwise provided in the regulations of the secretary.chiles,at quoting d.the initial coleman ltd plan only specifies that if the company terminates the plan,it must giv e written notice to the policyholder s at least days in advance.aplt app.vol.i,at.the coleman ltd policyholders did not receive notice of a plan termination at the time of the enactment of amendment.moreover,coleman employees were not presented with an opportunity to opt in or out of a new plan.although amendment made substantive changes to the plan that affected particular claims for benefits,like welch,the employees coverage under the plan was not disrupted in a way that would indicate that the initial plan had terminated and a new plan had been initiated.
indeed,this case bears little resemblance to cases in which we have held that there was a plan termination.in chiles,at,when an employer sold one of its divisions to another company,new trustees were appointed to a replacement ltd plan instituted by the buyer,the buyer became the administrator of the new plan,the seller transferred money to fund the new plan,and the buyer assumed all of the seller obligations with respect to ltd plan participan
