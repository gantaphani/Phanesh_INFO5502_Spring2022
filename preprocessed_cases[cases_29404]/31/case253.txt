barbara lauder sued first unum life insurance company first unum under erisa for wrongfully denying her disability benefits on the basis that she was not covered by her employer policy at the time of her injury.the united states district court for the southern district of new york,barrington parker,judge,held that lauder was covered on the date of her injury and that first unum had waived its right to dispute whether lauder was in fact disabled.the district court awarded as damages disability benefits in the amount of and also awarded attorney fees.although we agree that lauder was covered under the policy and that first unum can not now challenge her claim of disability,we disagree with the district court calculation of damages and award of attorney fees.we therefore affirm on coverage and waiver,and vacate and remand the question of attorney fees and the damages calculation.
background 
lauder was employed for many years by coach stores.coach carried a group long term disability policy issued by first unum which covered lauder while she was an employee.lauder left her position at coach pursuant to a termination agreement dated november.the termination agreement stated that lauder employment shall terminate effective november.
late in the afternoon of november,lauder slipped and fell in the parking lot of a convenience store.on january,she applied to first unum for disability benefits.in support of her application,she submitted an employee statement on which she stated that the last day she worked before the disability was october,and that november,was the date that she was first unable to work.the employer statement submitted by coach stated that october,was lauder last day of work.lauder also submitted a physician statement,as well as a letter from her doctor,which indicated that she had cervical instability with a limited range of motion to her neck and that no improvement of her condition was expected.additionally,lauder completed a release of medical information form.
in response to lauder application,first unum called her in early february and questioned her about her medical condition.first unum also called coach benefits manager in an attempt to find out the date on which lauder last worked.first unum made a request for medical records,but then canceled the request a few days later on the ground that it did not want to incur the expense of pursuing the matter.on february,first unum denied lauder request for disability benefits,stating that her coverage was in effect through october,and that she was no longer in the eligible class of employees when her accident happened on november.
lauder appealed the decision,attaching a letter from coach dated december,that outlined her benefits after termination.the letter stated that her last day worked was november,and that her long term disability coverage would terminate at the end of that month.coach also appealed the decision to deny benefits in an april,letter,which stated that november,was lauder termination date.
the appeal unit of first unum upheld the decision to deny benefits on march,stating that 
o ur review of the documents contained in your claim file indicate that you last worked at coach on october,while we do understand that your employment separation with coach was not effective until november,your coverage for the purposes of your long term disability insurance is in effect only if you meet the active employment requirements found in the policy.
lauder subsequently proceeded to file suit.
after a bench trial,the district court found in january that lauder was an active employee of coach on november,and that the administrative record established that first unum had ample evidence of this fact.the district court further found that first unum had before it preliminary information concerning lauder disability,but chose not to pursue an inquiry into the validity of her claim for administrative reasons.based on these factual findings,the district court concluded that lauder had adequately demonstrated to first unum that she was within the eligible class of employees on the date of her injury.additionally,the district court held that first unum had waived its argument that lauder was not disabled,and that lauder consequently had established her initial entitlement to benefits.the district court then proceeded to award attorney fees to lauder.
in a final judgment dated april,the district court awarded lauder damages in the amount of,representing disability benefit payments from the date of injury to the date of the final judgment.it also awarded lauder attorney fees in the amount of.this appeal followed.
discussion 
first unum makes the following arguments on appeal that the district court erred in concluding that lauder was covered by coach policy at the time of her injury that the district court erred in applying the doctrine of waiver to lauder erisa claim that it was an abuse of the district court discretion to award attorney fees to lauder and that the district court erred in calculating,without explanation of its method,the disability benefit amount it found was due as damages to lauder.lauder,who has on the issue of damages,agrees with first unum that the figure arrived at by the district court is incorrect and asks that this court perform its own benefits calculation.we will address these matters in turn.
standards of review 
at the outset,we address the appropriate standards of review that apply to the claims in this case.with respect to the denial of benefits to lauder,the district court applied the erisa standard set forth in firestone tire rubber bruch,d.there,the supreme court stated that 
a denial of benefits is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.
id.at.first unum has not taken issue with the district court conclusion that coach plan did not expressly grant first unum such authority and that the de novo standard therefore applied.we agree that the correct standard of review was used below,and apply the same standard to our review of the district court legal conclusions regarding the erisa claim.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.see zuckerbrod phoenix mut.life ins,cir.
with respect to the district court decision to award attorney fees,we review for abuse of discretion.see salovaara eckert,cir.as we noted there,although the decision to award attorney fees is uniquely within the province of a district court,we nevertheless need to ensure that any such decision is made with restraint and discretion.id.quoting schlaifer nance estate of warhol,cir.finally,whether the court correctly calculated damages is a question of law that we review de novo.see juliano health maint.org.of,cir.
ii.coverage 
first unum claims that lauder was not covered by coach long term disability policy on november,the date of her injury.in essence,first unum argument is that because lauder was terminated that day,her active employment ended when she walked out her employer door for the last time.thus,first unum asserts,lauder was not covered by the policy when she later slipped and fell in the convenience store parking lot.
we agree with the conclusion of the district court that lauder was covered by coach policy.there is sufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate that both coach and lauder considered november,to be her last day of active employment.this evidence includes lauder testimony that she worked that day as well as her termination agreement,coach december,letter to lauder regarding her benefits,and coach april,letter to first unum,all of which stated that november was lauder last day of work.additionally,we note that coach paid premiums to first unum to cover lauder until the end of november,and coach considered her insured through the end of that month.
we do not credit first unum argument that lauder was not actively employed,and therefore ineligible for coverage,because her accident occurred after she had left coach on her termination date.according to first unum policy,lauder was actively e
