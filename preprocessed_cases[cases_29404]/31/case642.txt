plaintiff thomas schweitzer schweitzer alleges that defendant teamsters local local terminated his employment with the union in an effort to avoid the payment of his pension,health,and welfare benefits,in violation of section of the employee retirement income security act erisa.though local may have considered the cost of pension and health insurance premiums in deciding whether to lay off employees,we find that the union exhibited no desire to avoid pension liability through schweitzer termination.local evidence sufficiently indicates that any desire to avoid the payment of benefits was not central to their decision to terminate schweitzer,and schweitzer fails to rebut their assertion.we therefore find it reasonable to conclude that local did not violate section of erisa,and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for local in this regard.
background 
in february of,at the age of,thomas schweitzer began volunteering as an assistant organizer for local after suffering an injury that prevented him from continuing his work as a truck driver.roughly one year later,schweitzer was hired by the union as a assistant organizer and was assigned to work under homer mann mann.as part of schweitzer employment compensation and benefits package,local made weekly contributions to a health and pension fund on his behalf in the amount of per week for health insurance benefits and per week for pension benefits.
in recent years,the power and membership of unions has decreased significantly as a result of various economic,social,and structural forces.see matt bai,the new boss,times,at explaining the ongoing decline of current union membership in the united states.for local,as with other similarly situated union chapters,a decline in membership beginning in led to a large loss of membership revenues,which was coupled by a corresponding increase in operating expenses.in particular,membership dues paid to local decreased nearly a quarter of a million dollars between and,falling from million in,to million in,and to million in.concurrently,the total operating expenses increased by roughly over the same period of time,rising from million in,to million in.
when alan barnes barnes became president of local in july,he met with local accountant,jim noe noe,to discuss the chapter financial condition and determine ways to address the problem.in response,noe noted that staff salaries and other professional fees were the chapter two most significant and largest expenses.
barnes responded by cutting local professional expenses.as a result,the union expenses declined by between and.these cuts,however,were not sufficient to address the growing gap between revenue and expenses facing local.barnes next began layoffs of local union employees,whose salaries and benefits comprised of local overall expense budget.but because a large number of the employees at local are elected to their positions by union members,most were only subject to removal if they violated local bylaws or the teamsters constitution.as such,barnes was faced with a limited pool of potential employees who were eligible for termination.
barnes began making the cuts in february,terminating eligible staff members in order of seniority.the first employee to be released was cheryl howard,a clerical employee with the least seniority.in march,barnes made the decision to lay off schweitzer,then years old,who at the time was the union organizer most recently hired.several other employee layoffs followed and continued until local was able to the chapter financial security in january.
schweitzer filed an age discrimination claim with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc shortly after he lost his job.in response to a request by the eeoc seeking an explanation for local decision to layoff schweitzer,the attorney for the union prepared a letter stating in detail the reasoning behind the termination.an excerpt of the letter provides 
in february,local laid off its most recently hired clerical staff member to reduce its personnel expenses.however,the union needed to cut expenses further.it was decided by president ken barnes,in consultation with freddie kells,that the organizing department was the most reasonable place to reduce costs,and schweitzer was laid off by letter dated march,
the letter explains further 
laying off schweitzer saved not only his relatively small salary but also his substantial fringe benefit costs.the local union currently contributes per week for central states pension benefits and per week for health and welfare benefits for each employee.these rates,which increase annually,are the same as those established for union members who work under the national master freight agreement.schweitzer also received a monthly car allowance of.accordingly,at current rates local would incur total costs of per year for schweitzer salary and benefits,not including payroll taxes.

the eeoc complaint was subsequently dismissed and schweitzer filed this lawsuit,alleging in part that the union chapter decision to discharge him constituted a discriminatory interference with his right to benefits under of erisa,et.the district court granted local motion for summary judgment,holding that,with regard to the erisa claim,schweitzer failed to produce any significant evidence to rebut local contention that his termination was necessary given the chapter economic difficulties.schweitzer filed a timely appeal of that decision.
