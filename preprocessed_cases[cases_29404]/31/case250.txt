this is an appeal from a january,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york john martin,judge dismissing the complaint of anna and louis fay upon summary judgment motion of oxford health plan of new york.the fays claimed,pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,coverage for private nursing care for louis fay under the employee benefits plan in which anna fay,through her employment at sinai medical center,is a participant.we affirm the district court conclusion that the fays are not entitled to the hour,care they desire because such care is not generally covered by the fays health care plan and because the health plan has determined such care is not medically necessary in fay case.
there is no dispute about louis fay medical condition.fay has multiple sclerosis,diagnosed in,and diabetes mellitus.fay is quadriplegic,is totally dependent in all self care,has a tracheostomy,and is due to respiratory insufficiency.fay is competent,and although unable to speak,communicates using a letter board.although fay condition is severe,his health insurance carrier need only provide those services promised in its contract provisions.despite its empathy for fay and his family,this court finds that the contract does not extend to the,care fay desires.
since,fay has received nursing care at his home to assist with mechanical ventilation and a tracheostomy,and to manage his diabetes through injections and blood glucose monitoring anna fay,who works for sinai medical center,receives health care benefits through her employer.louis fay,her husband and dependent,also receives these benefits.prior to,sinai offered an employee retirement income security act erisa,a b,plan through aetna which included a benefit for private duty nursing.fay received such a benefit.as of january,however,sinai chose to offer its health plan benefits through oxford health plans.
a.the plan the plan 
the plan describes coverage for participants as follows 
a member shall be entitled to receive the following medical care and services of physicians,surgeons,and other plan providers as set forth in attachment a,including medical,surgical,diagnostic,therapeutic,and preventive services,which are generally and customarily provided in the area,which are determined by health plan to be medically necessary and which are performed,prescribed,directed or authorized in advance by member primary care physician,or health plan.
the body of the plan sets out the details of plan administration,including eligibility,termination of coverage,and limitations of coverage,and provides definitions of key terms like medically necessary and medical director.the specific details of the plan coverage appear in attachment a schedule of benefits and exclusions.introducing these benefits,attachment a first explains that all services and benefits under this certificate are available only if and to the extent that they are medically necessary and are provided,authorized or directed by member primary care physician or health plan.the attachment then establishes the parameters for several key aspects of the plan health care coverage.
attachment a defines medical care as including medically necessary medical care and services,including office visits and consultations,hospital and skilled nursing facility visits,and periodic physical examinations when authorized in advance by member primary care physician oxford as required under the terms of this certificate.it also expressly defines home health care to include house calls and,home care,further defined as 
c are in the home by health professionals other than physicians,provided by a state licensed or certified home health agency within the service area when authorized in advance by member primary care physician and health plan.such care shall be limited to two hundred home care visits per contract year.for the purpose of this certificate,a visit is defined as treatment of up to hours by an eligible home health provider.home care includes i or intermittent home nursing care by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse,ii or intermittent home health aide services which consist primarily of caring for the member,iii physical,occupational,or speech therapy where provided by the home health service or agency,and iv medical supplies,drugs and medications prescribed by a participating physician,and laboratory services by or on behalf of a certified home health agency to the extent such items would have been covered or provided hereunder if the member had been hospitalized or confined in a skilled nursing facility.
the attachment then explains that skilled nursing facility snf services may include care which is medically necessary for days per member per calendar year,but not c ustodial,convalescent or domiciliary care in an snf or elsewhere.
having detailed these available areas of coverage,attachment a next sets out several explicit exclusions,including p rivate or special duty nursing,care.specifically,the plan states,e xcept as specifically provided in any attachment hereto,the following services and benefits are excluded from coverage hereunder p rivate or special duty nursing,unless determined to be medically necessary and approved in advance by health plan.
attachment c to the plan outlines the grievance procedure,which consists of four elements the member who is dissatisfied files a complaint with a customer service associate,who investigates and attempts to achieve a resolution,and notifies the member of such resolution within fifteen days if the member is still dissatisfied,she may file a written complaint with the issues resolution department ird,which conducts a review and provides a written response within fifteen days if still dissatisfied,the member may file a formal written grievance with the grievance review board,composed of a committee of health plan employees designated by the health plan board of directors,that issues a decision within fifteen days and if still dissatisfied,the member may appeal in writing to the board of directors by letter to the secretary of the grievance review board.an appeals committee designated by the board of directors reviews the final appeal,holding a hearing if the member so desires.the appeals committee issues a final ruling within fifteen days.
oxford coverage of care for fay 
in and,oxford provided to fay coverage for private duty nursing care,under the plan home health care and skilled nursing facility provisions.both items of coverage had annual limits the home health benefit provided visits,of hours each,per year days of per day care and the snf benefit provided days of coverage in such a facility.for and,oxford agreed to convert the snf days to cover fay home care provided that his condition continue d to meet the criteria for home care,giving a total of days of private duty coverage.oxford informed the fays,however,that when the fays exhausted these benefits,oxford would no longer cover,care for the remainder of the year.in,sinai agreed to cover the remainder of the days,as an interim solution and an exception to the contract provisions.in a letter to fay,sinai advised that mount sinai will not extend the extra contractual benefits into and that fay should pursue other coverage and funding options.
as warned,oxford notified the fays that coverage for home nursing services would cease on august,and that they should inquire as to other funding options.oxford enclosed with its notification letter a list of federal and state agencies from which the fays might seek additional funds.in,oxford did not approve the fays request for home care benefits,claiming that such coverage was neither covered by the plan nor medically necessary,as that term is used in the plan.while oxford approved the home care visits days of per day coverage for,it refused to convert the snf days as it had in and.no home nursing care benefits have been paid since that time.
district court proceedings 
the fays filed this lawsuit against oxford health plan of new york,and the mount sinai medical center point of service plan on january.the fays sued to recover plan benefits,pursuant to erisa,a b,which provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.
upon the parties for summary judgment,the district court granted defendants motions and denied the plaintiffs motion.fay oxford health plans,civ.jsm,wl july.the district court concluded that the plan was not a proper party,because it was incapable of providing the requested relief,as the plan had specifically assigned to oxford the responsibility for coverage determination and benefit payment.fay,wl,at.the fays do not appeal this dismissal.the district court then granted oxford motion for summary judgment on the basis that plaintiffs have failed to exhaust administrative remedies.id.
thereafter,the fays exhausted the plan grievance procedures.the ird issued a written decision on october,stating that coverage was denied both because private duty nursing is not a covered benefit under fay oxford policy and because,in the opinion of oxford medical director,the home nursing being provided to fay is not medically necessary as it is not the most appropriate supply or level of service which can safely be provided.the grievance review board upheld the ird denial of care in a march,letter,stating that the home care benefit is appropriate for or intermittent nursing care only and not for the nursing care requested.the fays appealed to the grievance committee,which,on june,upheld the denial of coverage stating that private duty nursing is excluded from coverage,except in cases where the medical director determines it to be medically necessary,and that,here,no such determination was made.
the district court restored the action to its active calendar after oxford final determination denying coverage.after initial discovery,oxford and the fays again for summary judgment.on january,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order,granting oxford motion.fay oxford health plans,civ.jsm,wl.the district court first concluded that oxford contract with sinai does not require it to provide unlimited hour private duty nursing care at home,even if such care is determined to be medically necessary.id.at.the district court reasoned that the private duty nursing exclusion could not be read to obligate oxford to provide such benefits,even if medically necessary,because such an interpretation contravened the plain language of the plan.id.at.the district court then concluded that,even if the plan could be read to obligate oxford to provide such coverage,the determination by oxford medical director that fay could best be cared for in a skilled nursing facility would be sustained.id.at.the district court noted its previous conclusion that the plan gave the medical director discretion to make medical necessity determinations and that,therefore,the court could overturn decisions of the director only if it found those decisions arbitrary and capricious.id.at.the district court explained,however,that the fays claim would fail under either an arbitrary and capricious or a de novo standard of review.id.at.the court then dismissed the fays complaint.id.at.
claims on appeal 
on appeal,the fays raise several challenges to the district court grant of summary judgment the district court incorrectly concluded that the plan unambiguously excludes coverage for private duty nursing coverage the district court erroneously deferred to the medical director opinion as to the medical necessity of care for fay and the district court improperly accorded privileged status to a document prepared by oxford counsel,gary burfoot because this court finds the first two issues dispositive,it does not reach the third issue.the court also rejects the fays alternative claim for damages.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.graham long island,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where the parties submissions show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
erisa does not set out the applicable standard of review for actions challenging benefit eligibility determinations.zuckerbrod phoenix mut.life ins,cir.the supreme court has held,however,that a denial of benefits challenged under erisa a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire and rubber bruch,d.the plan administrator bears the burden of proving that the deferential standard of review applies.kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir.although express use of the terms deference and discretion in the plan is not necessary to avoid a de novo standard of review,this court will construe ambiguities in the plan language against the insurer.id.at.where such discretionary authority is reserved,denials may be overturned as arbitrary and capricious only if the decision is without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.id.at quoting pagan nynex pension plan,cir.
discretion in the plan 
the plan invokes discretion by defining medically necessary as those services which,as determined by the medical director,meet four listed requirements.emphasis added.this phrase grants oxford discretionary authority as to determinations of what is medically necessary,but does not afford oxford broader discretion to construe other plan terms.thus,while this court will review determinations of medical necessity with deference to the findings of the medical director under an arbitrary and capricious standard,see zuckerbrod,at,it will review other exercises of the agreement de novo,see bruch,at.even under de novo review,however,the fays claim that the plan generally provides the home health care requested fails.
plan interpretation 
erisa plans are construed according to federal common law.masella blue cross blue shield of,cir.this court will review the plan as a whole,giving terms their plain meanings.see,brass am.film,cir where the contract language is plain and unambiguous,a court may construe the contract and grant summary judgment.bradwell gaf,cir in construing the policy,we look to the language of the policy and other indicia of the intent of the policy creator.where there are ambiguities in an erisa plan that this court is reviewing de novo,those ambiguities are construed in favor of the plan beneficiary.masella,at.language is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire agreement.ret.plan for salaried employees of rko,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.whether contract language is ambiguous is a question of law that is resolved by reference to the contract alone.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
general benefits 
three plan provisions are crucial to resolving the fays claim the medical care,home care,and exclusion provisions.read together,these provisions demonstrate that the,private duty home nursing the fays desire is generally unavailable under the oxford plan.in attachment a,the plan lays out a detailed schedule of benefits and exclusions.under professional services performed within health plan service area,the plan describes both medical care and home health care.because of the importance of these provisions to the outcome of the fay case,they are reproduced in pertinent part here.the medical care provision provides that 
medically necessary medical care and services,including office visits and consultations,hospital and skilled nursing facility visits,and periodic physical examinations as described in attachment d hereto,are covered in accordance with the terms of this certificate when authorized in advance by member primary care physician oxford as required under the terms of this certificate.
the fays read this provision as guaranteeing all services that are medically necessary.thus,the fays argue that because private duty nursing is,in their view,medically necessary for fay,the plan should cover his,service.the fays,however,neglect the impact of the subsequent home health care provision also contained under professional services performed within health plan service area.the home health care provision provides details on services not specifically listed under the medical care provision 
home care.care in the home by health professionals other than physicians,provided by a state licensed or certified home health agency within the service area when authorized in advance by member primary care physician and health plan.such care shall be limited to two hundred home care visits per contract year.for the purpose of this certificate,a visit is defined as treatment of up to hours by an eligible home health provider.home care includes i or intermittent home nursing care by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse,ii or intermittent home health aide services which consist primarily of caring for the member,iii physical,occupational,or speech therapy where provided by the home health service or agency,and iv medical supplies,drugs and medications prescribed by a participating physician,and laboratory services by or on behalf of a certified home health agency to the extent such items would have been covered or provided hereunder if the member had been hospitalized or confined in a skilled nursing facility.
the fays attempt to dismiss the limitations of the home care provisions home care visits of up to hours each per year,claiming that this provision addresses only,care and does not address the private duty nursing,care they desire.this provision demonstrates,however,that only care,not the care the fays seek,is generally available under the plan.the private duty nursing the fays desire does not appear in the plain language of either the medical care or home care provisions.as discussed below,the plan directly addresses such,care,only as a specific exclusion from regular coverage.
specific exclusions 
under the final section of the plan schedule of benefits and exclusions,the plan lays out specific exclusions from coverage.the plan provides in relevant part 
except as specifically covered in any attachment hereto,the following services and benefits are excluded from coverage hereunder 
private or special duty nursing,unless determined to be medically necessary and approved in advance by health plan.
the fays claim for,nursing care falls squarely within this exclusion.the fays read the language of the exclusion to require that oxford provide private or special duty nursing generally,barring from coverage only that care not found medically necessary.they argue that the exclusion would be unnecessary if such services were not generally available.this interpretation,while not wholly unreasonable,appears to overstate the power of the exclusion unless determined to be medically necessary clause.
the home care provision establishes that limited,care is generally available under the plan.notably,even home care is available only on a finding of medical necessity the private duty exclusion emphasizes the nature of the generally available care by specifically excluding,care from oxford regular benefits.as the fays allege,however,the language of the exclusion suggests that in certain cases meeting the tests of medical necessity and prior approval by the plan,oxford may choose to make an exception to its general exclusion.
while the plan promises general medical care in the form of office visits and consultations,hospital and skilled nursing facility visits,and periodic physical examinations,this broad guarantee of basic services is constrained by the rest of the plan provisions.the plan does not regularly provide the type of service the fays,instead specifically excludes such care from its purview.although the exclusion potentially suggests the limited availability of the private duty service,that service is confined to special cases on the basis of medical necessity and prior approval.the district court thus correctly found that the plan does not generally allow the type of care fay requests.
like the district court,this court is reluctant to draw a duty from an exclusion.even if the placement of the private duty provision in the exclusion section suggests,as the district court believes it does,oxford intent to provide no private duty care,the language of the private duty exclusion,viewed objectively,is ambiguous.see,at requiring an objective review of plan provisions.construing this ambiguity in favor of the beneficiary,this court finds itself required to decide if fay could have qualified for home care under the apparent exception to the private duty bar.see masella,at.to so decide,this court must determine whether oxford conclusion that such care was not medically necessary for fay prevents the fays from receiving private duty care as an exceptional case.
c.the potential exception to private duty exclusion 
as noted,the plan discusses the type of,care the fays desire only in the context of establishing a blanket exclusion of such services from coverage.that exclusion,however,leaves a possibility of the provision of private duty care in certain cases because it includes the phrase unless determined to be medically necessary and approved in advance by health plan.according to the plan definitions,services are medically necessary if they are 
provided by a hospital,skilled nursing facility,physician or other provider required to identify or treat a member illness or injury and which,as determined by health plan medical director,are 
consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis and treatment of member condition,disease,ailment or injury 
appropriate with regard to standards of good medical practice 
not solely for the convenience of the member,his or her plan physician,hospital,or other health care provider and 
the most appropriate supply or level of service which can be safely provided to the member.
emphasis added.because this provision gives explicit discretion to the medical director to determine what is medical necessary,this court will review assessments of necessity under a deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,reversing only if the director decision appears without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.kinstler,at quoting pagan,at.to decide whether oxford denial of benefits was,as the fays allege,such an unreasonable and unsupported decision,this court reviews oxford determination in light of the standard for medical necessity outlined in the plan.
the medical necessity testimony 
oxford relies on affidavits of two of its medical directors who have reviewed the fay case extensively,alan sokolow and arthur dresdale.sokolow,a medical director at oxford since,joined the team supervising fay care in.after reviewing reports by oxford employees familiar with fay medical condition and the records of the treatment fay had received since,sokolow stated that the private duty nursing care sought by fay is not appropriate for his condition and is accordingly not medically necessary.instead,the medically appropriate care would be that care offered at a skilled nursing facility.sokolow identified several reasons for his conclusion that an snf offered the most appropriate type of care,namely that the staff,physical facilities,and resources available at snfs are not available through home care.after reviewing the standards outlined in the plan medical necessary definition,sokolow stated that hour a day private duty nursing care is not the most appropriate supply or kind of service which can be safely provided to fay.quoting plan certificate at,o.
dresdale,a medical director at oxford since and a member of the grievance committee that heard the fays internal appeal,offered similar bases for his unequivocal opinion that fay could safely and more efficiently receive the care he requires in a snf.like sokolow,dresdale opined that care could not maintain the levels of staff training and experience,equipment,and other medical resources that an snf could provide.recognizing fay total dependence on au
