chacko commenced his employment with sabre in.by,chacko,then a senior vice president of one of sabre divisions,had become concerned about his prospects of advancement within the company.thus,when he learned in early september that sabre intended to implement a layoff,he approached eric speck speck,sabre chief marketing officer.chacko informed speck that he wanted assurances from sabre ceo that he was on track to becoming a company officer if not,chacko desired a severance package from sabre in the upcoming layoff.on september,speck informed chacko that the ceo was not enthusiastic about chacko career path at sabre.sabre had therefore decided to offer chacko a severance package.speck told chacko that sabre human resources department would contact chacko with the details of the severance package.chacko and speck planned for chacko last day of work to be october,and agreed to work out the details and announcement of his departure 
at the time of chacko meeting with speck on september,sabre had in effect the sabre.severance plan the general severance plan or gsp,which set forth the terms and conditions upon which sabre would provide severance benefits to involuntarily terminated employees.specifically,the gsp provided for up to weeks of salary benefits payable in a lump sum,conditioned upon the execution by the terminated employee of an agreement and general release agr in a form determined by sabre that release d all causes of action and claims against sabre and related parties.when chacko received a separation summary outlining the terms of his severance package the following day,however,it stated that he would be offered weeks of salary benefits payable over an period,conditioned upon his signing an agr containing and provisions the expanded agr believing the and periodic payment provisions to be contrary to the gsp,chacko refused to sign the expanded agr.instead,over the course of the following week,he attempted to negotiate with sabre over the terms and conditions of his severance package.
on october,sabre benefits administration committee the committee adopted a resolution amending the gsp to grant expressly to sabre the discretion to include and provisions in the terminated employee agr and to pay severance benefits in periodic installments the amendment the resolution provided that the amendment was effective immediately.
chacko officially separated from sabre on october,on november,he filed a claim for severance benefits,in which he expressed a willingness to sign an agr in the form contemplated by the gsp and demanded payment of his severance benefits in a lump sum.on november,sabre informed chacko that the administrator had denied his claim for benefits based on the fact that the gsp,as amended and in effect on chacko termination date of october,specifically allows for the execution of an agr containing a provision as a condition of eligibility for benefits,and further specifically provides for the payment of benefits in periodic installments.chacko appealed,and an independent appeals committee the appeals committee was appointed to review the administrator decision.the appeals committee denied chacko appeal on the grounds that he had no vested rights under the gsp in effect on september,the gsp expressly granted sabre the right to terminate or amend the gsp at any time the october,amendment to the gsp was validly executed sabre had complied with erisa notice requirements regarding the amendment and chacko was not eligible for benefits under the governing one in effect on october,he refused to sign the expanded agr.
chacko brought suit against appellees,claiming,inter alia,that he was wrongfully denied severance benefits under the gsp in violation of erisa a b.the district court granted appellees motion for summary upon finding that the administrator denial of severance benefits was not an abuse of discretion.on appeal,chacko argues that appellees are precluded from denying his claim for benefits because they engaged in inequitable conduct and the administrator abused its discretion by applying an incorrect legal his claim for benefits.appellees respond that chacko claim is,in essence,a challenge to the administrator determination that the amendment applied to chacko claim for benefits because he was terminated on the date his employment with sabre actually ended october,rather than on the date speck informed him that sabre had decided to terminate his employment september.appellees argue that the district court correctly held that the administrator made a factual determination that chacko was terminated on october,and that this factual determination was not an abuse of discretion.
we review grants of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.maclachlan exxonmobil,cir.summary judgment is proper when the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
chacko first contends that inequitable conduct on the part of,alleged breaches of their fiduciary them from denying him severance benefits under the gsp.more specifically,chacko argues that appellees acted with a complete lack of integrity by offering him a severance package under the executive plan one day before that plan became effective that they failed to provide him with full and complete material information regarding the availability of severance benefits under the executive plan that they breached a fiduciary duty of loyalty and engaged in by conditioning his receipt of benefits upon the execution of a agreement and that their decision to deny him benefits was not a reasoned product of the exercise by the gsp administrator of her fiduciary duty.therefore,chacko argues,the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim for benefits.in other words,chacko contends that he is entitled to benefits under the gsp,regardless of whether he satisfies the terms of eligibility for those benefits,because appellees allegedly breached their fiduciary duties.
even if chacko allegations of inequitable conduct were supported by the summary judgment evidence,which they are not,chacko only claim on appeal is a claim for benefits under erisa a b section a b provides an erisa plan participant or beneficiary with a cause of action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b emphasis added.chacko he is entitled to benefits not because they are due to him under the terms of the gsp but rather because appellees engaged in inequitable conduct and breached their fiduciary simply not cognizable under erisa a b.
chacko also challenges the administrator denial of benefits under the terms of the gsp.a plan administrator benefit determinations involve two tasks construing the terms of the plan and determining the facts underlying the benefit claim.where the plan expressly confers discretion on the plan administrator to construe the plan terms,the administrator construction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d gosselink,cir vega life ins,cir.moreover,the administrator factual determinations are reviewed for abuse of discretion,regardless of the administrator ultimate authority to determine benefit eligibility.meditrust fin.servs.sterling,cir vercher alexander alexander,cir.
chacko does not dispute that the gsp vests the administrator with discretionary authority to construe the terms of the gsp and,hence,that the abuse of discretion standard applies.instead,he argues that the administrator decision is entitled to reduced deference because the administrator faced a conflict of interest in
