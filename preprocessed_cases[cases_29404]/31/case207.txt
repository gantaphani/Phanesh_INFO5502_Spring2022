defendants sandra briand and joseph merino appeal from so much of a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,entered after a bench trial before arlene lindsay,magistrate judge,as found them liable for breach of fiduciary duties imposed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,held merino jointly and severally liable for in losses to the international brotherhood of industrial workers health and welfare fund the fund or biw fund,held briand jointly and severally liable for of that amount,and permanently enjoined each of them from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any employee benefit plan.on appeal,briand contends that the district court erred in finding that she breached her fiduciary duty to the fund,in finding that any breach by her caused the fund injury,and in barring her from future positions as a fund fiduciary or service provider.although the notice of appeal was filed on behalf of both briand and merino,no arguments have been presented on behalf of merino,either in the brief filed in the name of both appellants or at oral argument.accordingly,any challenge merino may have had to the judgment has been waived,and as to merino,the judgment is affirmed.with respect to briand,we affirm for the reasons that follow.
background 
the biw fund was an employee benefit plan established pursuant to a trust agreement among the international brotherhood of industrial workers locals and collectively the union and the employers of union members.the purpose of the biw fund was to provide benefits to its participants with respect to,inter alia,accidents and health care.between and august the fund administrator was merino.
during that period,briand was merino wife.from to august,briand was employed by local in various capacities from to august,she served as its president.in august,briand became the administrator of the fund.
the present action,commenced in by the united states secretary of labor the secretary,charged that merino and briand breached their fiduciary duties,imposed on them by erisa,by allowing the biw fund to deal with a known embezzler who proceeded to embezzle employer contributions meant for the fund.the facts pertinent to this appeal,as found by the district court in a memorandum and decision dated august,district court opinion,or as corrected in a decision and order dated february,district court order,are largely undisputed and are summarized as follows.
a.the biw fund agreements with clarke lasky 
clarke lasky lasky was the president and owner of employee health plan administrators ehpa,a company that represented employers in their relations with employee benefit funds by,inter alia,enrolling the employers and their employees in the funds and collecting and transmitting employers contributions to the funds.in,lasky was convicted of embezzling funds from an employee benefit plan.he was ordered to make restitution of the embezzled funds and was sentenced to six years imprisonment.
in,after his release from prison,lasky approached merino with a proposal to enroll approximately employees of ehpa employer clients in the biw fund.those employees had previously been enrolled in a benefits plan administered by the national organization of industrial trade unions noitu.merino was aware of lasky prior conviction for embezzling money from another employee benefit fund.accordingly,merino inquired of a noitu official as to why the relationship had been terminated.the noitu official he consulted was daniel lasky,lasky uncle.
daniel lasky advised merino not to do business with his nephew,saying that lasky was a bum,meaning that lasky did live up to his word.deposition of joseph merino at.daniel lasky told merino that noitu had severed its relationship with lasky and ehpa after lasky failed to remit more than in employer contributions to noitu.see district court opinion at.
when merino confronted lasky with daniel lasky statements,lasky claimed that the problem with noitu had arisen because a few of his employer clients had fallen behind on their contributions and that the contributions would eventually be paid.exploring further,merino examined ehpa contracts with employers to verify that they had some employees who could be enrolled in the biw fund he visited ehpa offices and was impressed by their appearance and he demanded that lasky swear on his lasky mother that he would not do to the biw fund what he had done to noitu.id.internal quotation marks omitted.merino also demanded that lasky be bonded in order to do business with the biw fund and although lasky eventually produced what purported to be a bond,merino later learned that a bond had never actually been purchased.id.
merino presented lasky proposal at a meeting of fund trustees,which was attended by the fund attorneys.lasky prior conviction was discussed,and the fund thereafter requested and received a letter from his probation officer stating that lasky was not prohibited from working with employee benefit funds.merino,testifying at his deposition,did not recall whether he disclosed to the trustees his conversation with daniel lasky.
briand attended that trustees meeting in her capacity as president of local.she was not then a fund trustee,and she had no vote.however,at an earlier meeting with merino,daniel lasky,and the fund attorneys,briand had stated her view that the fund should refrain from doing business with lasky,because she did not consider him trustworthy.the trustees nonetheless approved the proposed agreement with lasky and ehpa the initial agreement,which provided that,beginning october,the employees of ehpa employer clients would be enrolled in the fund and that ehpa would,on a monthly basis,collect and remit to the fund the employers contributions for those employees.a complementary agreement between ehpa and local permitted the employees of ehpa clients to become members of local.
from october to march,lasky timely collected the employer contributions and remitted them to the fund.in april,however,merino was informed that lasky had collected,but failed to remit to the fund,approximately in employer contributions for march and april.lasky,when confronted by merino about the missing payments,initially insisted that the check was in the mail.a few days later,when the fund still had not received such a check,merino again confronted lasky,who insisted that it must have been lost in the mail.lasky promised to deliver a certified check for the full amount due the following day.the fund never received either check.
merino,not wanting to lose the new members lasky had brought to the fund,did not terminate the fund relationship with lasky and ehpa but instead negotiated a repayment agreement with lasky the april agreement,which was approved by the fund trustees.under that agreement,lasky executed a promissory note to the fund in the amount of the embezzled contributions,plus percent interest,and was to make payments over a period of months,generally at the rate of per month as security,he executed in the name of ehpa and himself a confession of judgment in the amount of,and he gave the fund a deed in trust for the home of his,a security agreement signed by her pledging that home as collateral for his debt,and a personal guarantee from his father,gerald lasky.
merino did not consult the fund attorneys as to the legality of the april agreement nor did he heed the advice given him by briand to terminate the fund relationship with lasky and ehpa.and despite insisting on the above forms of security,merino made no effort to ascertain what they were worth.he neither sought to determine the unencumbered value of the pledged home nor investigated the financial condition of ehpa,lasky,or lasky father.in fact,the security,in comparison to the amount embezzled,was worth little 
at trial it was revealed that lasky home had approximately of equity in lasky own promissory note in the amount of,was of dubious value.although lasky tax return revealed an adjusted gross income of,he owned no property,stock,or cars.lasky owed back taxes to the irs,was supporting his children from a prior marriage,and according to his then wife was struggling each month to make ends meet by,lasky income dropped to.the personal guarantee of gerald lasky was not much better.it was given after his retirement and move to florida to a condo which was likely judgment proof under florida law.he was also being partially supported by his son at the time.

briand becomes fund administrator lasky strikes again 
in august,briand replaced merino as fund administrator.in april,as president of local,she had been an observer at the fund trustees meeting in which the april agreement was approved.she had expressed no view at that meeting as to the advisability of that agreement.she privately advised her husband merino,however,that he should sever the fund relationship with lasky and ehpa.nonetheless,when briand became fund administrator,she did nothing to sever the relationship with lasky,to rei n him in,or to protect the fund,district court opinion at.
lasky made the repayments required by the april agreement for less than a year.by march,he had reduced the amount he owed the fund to approximately,see district court order at,but he failed to make any further repayments with respect to the funds diverted in.in addition,lasky collected the march employer contributions and did not remit them to the fund.the amount of this second embezzlement was approximately.see id.at.
briand promptly contacted the employers,notifying them of the default,informing them that the fund would no longer do business with ehpa,and arranging for many of the employers to make their contributions to the fund directly.briand sent lasky a letter terminating the fund relationship with lasky and ehpa and informing lasky that the fund would commence legal action if he did not remit the march contributions by the end of the month.briand also instructed the fund attorneys to notify the united states department of labor of lasky default.
c.the decision of the district court 
the secretary commenced the present action in,alleging several causes of action against merino,briand,lasky,and others.to the extent pertinent to the present appeal,the secretary contended that merino and briand breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and care,in violation of erisa a a and b,a a and b,by a allowing the fund to enter into the initial agreement with lasky,b allowing the fund to enter into the april agreement with lasky,and c allowing lasky to continue to collect employer contributions after his diversion of employer contributions from the biw fund first cause of action that merino and briand caused the fund to engage in a prohibited transaction in violation of erisa a b and d,a b and d,because the april agreement constituted an extension of credit to lasky for the repayment of the moneys he had diverted from the fund second cause of action and that merino and briand were liable under erisa a,a,for lasky breaches of his fiduciary duty because their own breaches of the duties of loyalty and care enabled lasky thefts of fund assets sixth cause of action.the secretary requested principally that merino and briand be ordered to pay the fund to compensate for the losses caused by lasky comprising as the unpaid balance of the money he diverted in,plus the he diverted in march,and be permanently enjoined from working with or controlling the assets of any employee benefit plan.
following proceedings before a district judge disposing of certain claims,the secretary,merino,briand,and other undismissed defendants agreed that the remaining proceedings would be conducted before a magistrate judge.following a bench trial,the magistrate judge found against merino and briand on the above three causes of action.to the extent pertinent to briand,the court found as follows.
with respect to the first cause of action,for breach of the duties of loyalty and care,the court found that briand had not been a fiduciary of the fund prior to becoming the fund administrator in august and that she was not liable for the fund entering into either the initial agreement with lasky in or the april agreement.however,the court found that briand,after becoming fund administrator,breached her fiduciary duties by allowing lasky to continue to collect employer contributions.district court opinion at.the court reasoned as follows 
at first glance,it seems reasonable that briand would continue on the course of action adopted by the trustees since lasky was current with his payments as of august.however,when briand became the fund administrator,she was under a strict duty to use care,skill,prudence and diligence in ensuring from that point on that the fund assets were handled properly briand knew everything that merino knew about lasky.she knew that lasky had embezzled welfare funds in the past,had improperly withheld employer contributions from noitu,that noitu dropped local because of the lasky agreement,that lasky misappropriated biw funds and lied to merino when questioned about the funds,and she must have learned that lasky lied about being bonded since no bond was available to secure the loss.in light of this history,the probability that lasky would renege on his agreement and divert future contributions was exceedingly high.just as it was imprudent for merino to allow lasky to continue to collect contributions after april of,when briand stepped in and assumed fiduciary duties,she too had an obligation to act in the best interests of the fund,which included an evaluation of the fund relationship with lasky.briand acknowledged that she considered lasky to be untrustworthy and believed that the fund should not be engaged in business with ehpa under any circumstances.briand depo.at.indeed she counseled her husband,merino,to terminate the ehpa agreement in april.yet,despite everything she knew and believed about lasky,briand did nothing to rei n him in or to protect the fund.had she simply raised her objections with the other trustees,or alerted ehpa employers of the problem and made different payment arrangements,or sought enforcement of the fund agreement with ehpa which required that ehpa establish a three month reserve to protect against future delinquencies,or even demanded a bond from lasky which he was required to provide,she might have avoided what next occurred.briand silence and failure to take any action to protect the fund fell far short of the duties she assumed as a fiduciary and led to the loss the fund experienced in when lasky struck again.
district court opinion at internal quotation marks omitted see also district court order at briand failure to take any steps to rei n in lasky once she became a fiduciary permitted lasky to strike again in march leading to a loss of.the fund thus suffered a loss of as a direct result of briand failure to exercise care in the performance of her duties.
as to the second cause of action,for causing the fund to engage in a prohibited transaction,the april agreement,the court concluded that briand was under an obligation to revisit the fund relationship with lasky,including the payout agreement.district court order at.however,the court was 
unable to conclude based upon the evidence presented at trial that briand failure to seek rescission of the payout agreement once she became a fiduciary further damaged the fund.indeed,the evidence indicates that lasky had virtually no tangible assets and that prompt remedial action on briand part would not have materially improved the fund position.
id.accordingly,the court found that briand should be held liable only for the that lasky embezzled from the fund after she became fund administrator,not for the unrepaid from lasky embezzlement.
finally,as to the sixth cause of action,the court concluded that briand violation of her duties of loyalty and care had enabled lasky second embezzlement 
although briand became a fund trustee after lasky had already withheld from the fund,she did nothing to change the relationship.briand knew that lasky could not be trusted.she was of the view that the fund should not be doing business with ehpa.she knew that lasky had on three earlier occasions wrongfully withheld employer contributions from a benefit fund.her failure to restrict,or mo
