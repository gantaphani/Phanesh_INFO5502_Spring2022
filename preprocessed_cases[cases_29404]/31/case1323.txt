on this appeal,we review a summary judgment entered on behalf of gary levinson levinson on his claim against reliance standard life insurance company reliance for disability benefits.reliance appeals from summary judgment on the issue of liability,the district court decision refusing to remand the claim decision back to reliance plan administrator for further review,and its award of damages to levinson.to resolve this appeal,we consider three issues whether the district court erred in determining that reliance disposition of levinson claim was arbitrary and capricious whether the district court erred in failing to remand the case to reliance after concluding that its claim decision was arbitrary and capricious and whether the district court erred in awarding disability benefits to levinson.
background 
levinson,an attorney,filed a claim for benefits with reliance under his law firm group disability policy the policy or the plan governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa levinson claimed that he was entitled to disability benefits due to a serious problem with the heart,specifically severe prolapse of the mitral valve associated with mitral insufficiency which precluded him from working on a full time basis.a cardiologist advised levinson to work only on a basis because job stress caused by working as a real estate attorney could put him at risk for enhancing the progression of his heart condition.
under the reliance policy,an insured is entitled to monthly benefits if he is totally disabled as the result of a sickness or injury covered by this policy is under the regular care of a physician has completed the elimination period and submits satisfactory proof of total disability to reliance.the policy also says that those who are partially disabled will be considered totally disabled,except during the elimination period in support of his claim,levinson submitted an attending physician statement aps from azar his cardiologist that said levinson was totally disabled since june,and described levinson physical limitations as prohibiting him from engaging in heavy physical work and stressful situations.
reliance separately obtained levinson medical records and denied levinson benefits,citing a lack of physical symptoms and objective medical findings.reliance stated that levinson condition did not preclude him from performing the material duties of his occupation,so he did not meet the definition of totally disabled.in making its decision,reliance relied on the report of a nurse in its medical records department and the opinion of a claims person.levinson requested formal review of the decision,and submitted a supporting letter from azar.after reliance denied his appeal,levinson filed this lawsuit in state court pursuant to a b to recover benefits due to him under a group policy governed by erisa.reliance removed to the district court.
levinson moved for summary judgment,asking the district court to review de novo reliance decision.reliance opposed the motion,and argued that the appropriate standard of review was whether its claim decision was arbitrary and capricious.levinson conceded in his reply brief that the proper standard was arbitrary and capricious,and that he was entitled to summary judgment under that standard as well.the magistrate judge recommended granting the motion,noting the lack of evidence to support the plan administrator decision to deny benefits.the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation,finding reliance liable to levinson for benefits and held a bench trial to determine the amount of damages.reliance argued that the district court should either remand levinson claim to reliance for an initial calculation of damages,or should limit the evidence of damages to evidence contained in the administrative record.the district court did neither,and determined reliance had not shown that levinson condition had improved,and awarded benefits through the date of trial.the parties had agreed on the monthly benefit amount levinson was to receive of his covered monthly earnings on the date prior to disability or per month.the parties did not agree on the time period over which the benefits were payable the court decided the period extended to the date of trial,or on the amount of other income benefits to be offset from the agreed upon monthly benefit amount.the policy dictated that wages and other compensation benefits were to be offset from the monthly benefits.the court found that levinson was entitled to damages in the amount of,and the parties agreed to ten percent interest.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards that controlled the district court decision.see shannon jack eckerd,cir.whether the district court erred in failing to remand the case to reliance plan administrator is a question of law subject to de novo review.see id.we can not say that the district court erred in remanding for the plan administrator to make a reasonably relevant inquiry.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.see.a worthington united states,cir.
whether the claim decisions were arbitrary and capricious 
the district court concluded,after an independent review of the record and a de novo determination of the issues,that the plan administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious and that reliance had no basis upon which it could deny levinson claim.the district court found that the plan administrator decision did not survive even the most deferential standard of review.
because the policy gives the administrator discretion to determine eligibility for benefits,we must determine whether the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d jett blue cross blue shield of,cir.normally,a decision to deny benefits is arbitrary and capricious if no reasonable basis exists for the decision.shannon,at.because reliance pays out to beneficiaries from its own assets,however,a conflict of interest exists between its fiduciary role and its profit making role.thus,the proper standard in this case is a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard.that is,the arbitrary and capricious standard must be contextually tailored to the case.brown blue cross blue shield of,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.when conflicts like the one in this case exist,a highly deferential review is inappropriate.see id.at.a wrong but apparently reasonable interpretation is arbitrary and capricious if it advances the conflicting interest of the fiduciary at the expense of the affected beneficiary or beneficiaries unless the fiduciary justifies the interpretation on the ground of its benefit to the class of all participants and beneficiaries.id.at.it is fundamental that the fiduciary interpretation first must be wrong from the perspective of de novo review before a reviewing court is concerned with the of the fiduciary.id.at.whether a claim decision is arbitrary and capricious requires a determination whether there was a reasonable basis for reliance decision,based upon the facts as known to the administrator at the time the decision was made.jett,at.
to support his initial claim,levinson submitted an aps from azar stating that he was totally disabled.levinson was under the care of a physician,and there is no dispute that he completed the elimination period.reliance also had access to levinson medical records that detailed his heart condition.at the time reliance made the decision on levinson claim,it appears that the only facts known to it were based on azar aps,levinson medical records,and levinson status as a full time employee at the law firm.reliance decision on levinson appeal involved a review of the same facts as its first decision,as well as azar letter of january which stated levinson could not perform the material duties of his occupation on a basis and,office attendance records showing that between levinson initial appointment with azar and the date of his termination levinson had taken two sick days,left early for a doctor appointment one day,and had taken vacation days it appears,therefore,that reliance relied on the nurse review and the opinion of its claim person that levinson was asymptomatic and not disabled,and not upon any independent medical evidence to conclude that levinson did not meet the definition of disabled furthermore,reliance assertion that levinson was asymptomatic does not appear to be a reason for denying benefits anywhere in the language of the policy.
we find that reliance decisions on levinson claims were wrong from a perspective of de novo review,and its in this case requires that we determine whether the claims decisions were arbitrary and capricious.it does not appear that there was a reasonable basis for reliance decisions,based on the evidence known to reliance at the time it made the decisions.aside from the report from his law firm indicating that levinson was a employee,there did not appear to be any evidence before reliance that contradicted levinson evidence from his physician that he was totally disabled under the terms of the plan.therefore,the district court was correct in holding the claim decision was arbitrary and capricious.
b.the district court refusal to remand to reliance 
reliance argues that remand is required where it can not be said that it would have been unreasonable for reliance to deny levinson claim on any ground.reliance also argues that remand is required where the administrative record could support liability only through the date of the most recent medical evidence and contained insufficient evidence upon which to determine the amount of benefits through that date.
the district court held that remand was not necessary in this case because the administrator had considered all of the record evidence and had reached a conclusion under the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard that was unsupported by the evidence in the record.the district court reasoned that in cases like this one,where the administrator considered all of the record evidence and reached a conclusion,remand is not appropriate.
reliance cited miller united welfare fund,cir,for the proposition that after a finding that an erisa claim decision was arbitrary and capricious,the case must be remanded for reconsideration and to consider additional evidence unless the district court finds it would be unreasonable to deny the claims on any grounds.the second circuit held that it was error for a district court to hold a de novo bench trial to determine whether care was medically necessary.see id.at.in this case,there was no de novo bench trial with extrinsic evidence to determine that levinson was disabled the district court considered only what was in the administrative record.the second circuit also found that the administrator may have been able to deny the claim on a more complete record.see id.at.in this case,the record was complete,and reliance had ample opportunity to obtain evidence for the record to rebut levinson evidence.it did not.the district court found that the evidence in the administrative record pointed only in favor of finding that levinson was disabled,a finding the district court in miller did not make.see id.at.
reliance also argues that the independent medical opinion obtained for its summary judgment motion is evidence it could consider on remand.in support of this proposition,reliance cites a seventh circuit opinion that held a s a general matter a court should not resolve the eligibility question on the basis of evidence never presented to a pension fund trustees but should remand to the trustees for a new determination.wardle central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund,cir quoted in jett,at.other circuits suggest that once the administrator completes its review,the record becomes closed.see booton lockheed med.benefit plan,cir suggesting burden is on plan to build up adequate and relevant information to make a decision on the claim sandoval aetna life and casualty ins,cir denying beneficiary request for remand to consider evidence never presented to administrator before administrator completed review.
in shannon,after affirming the district court decision that a claim decision was arbitrary and capricious,we also affirmed the district court decision to remand to the plan administrator.see shannon,at.but,the facts in shannon are distinguishable from the facts in the instant case.in shannon,the plan administrator relied only upon a conclusory recommendation of denial from its medical consultant and the denials of other insurance companies in deciding that a pancreas transplant was investigational.the district court ruled that the decision was arbitrary and capricious and ordered a remand so the plan administrator could consider additional evidence that the beneficiary wanted to present.see id.in levinson case,the a remand to consider evidence that would tend to show levinson was not disabled.
we find persuasive the eighth circuit reasoning in davidson prudential ins.of america,cir.in that case,davidson contended that the district court erred in refusing to remand the case to the plan administrator to consider a vocational report and a psychiatrist report prepared after litigation had commenced.see id.at.the district court refused to remand,because if davidson believed the evidence he now offers was necessary for prudential to make a proper benefits determination,davidson should have obtained this evidence and submitted it to prudential.id.we find that this reasoning should apply with equal force to the insurance company as to the beneficiary.reliance had more than adequate opportunities to establish an administrative record containing evidence contradicting levinson evidence pointing to disability on two occasions when it first considered levinson claim and upon levinson administrative appeal.reliance did not do this.it was not until after litigation commenced that reliance obtained evidence contradicting levinson evidence that he was disabled under the policy.therefore,the district court refusal to remand the issue of levinson eligibility for benefits to reliance should be upheld.
reliance argues that even if the district court correctly determined that remand was not necessary to determine levinson initial eligibility for benefits under the plan,remand was required to determine the amount of benefits levinson should receive.reliance contends that the administrative record does not contain any information as to whether levinson worked or since october,which would be relevant to determining the amount to offset from levinson benefits.reliance also contends that the administrative record last medical evidence is from january,so reliance liability should run to that date only according to reliance,remand would have allowed it to gather and consider evidence regarding the appropriate offset for benefits payable through january,and regarding levinson subsequent eligibility for benefits under the policy 
reliance argues that this court should require the district court to vacate its award of damages to levinson and remand to reliance to decide the amount of benefits to which levinson is entitled.then,if levinson is not satisfied with that amount,he can bring another action under a b,and the district court can review reliance determination under the arbitrary and capricious standard to assess its reasonableness.
the text of a b,under which levinson brought this action,allows a beneficiary to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan a b.under the text of the statute,it does not appear that the court was required to remand to reliance to determine the amount of benefits to which he was entitled.we stated in jett that a s a general matter a court should not resolve the eligibility question on the basis of evidence never presented to an erisa plan administrator but should remand to the administrator for a new determination.jett,at quoting wardle,at alteration in original.that statement,however,was made in the context of the beneficiary asking the court to consider additional evidence concerning his eligibility under the plan.in this case,the district court already determined at summary judgment that levinson was eligible for benef
