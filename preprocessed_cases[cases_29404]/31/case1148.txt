the district court determined that the provisions of the employee retirement income security act erisa apply to xerox disability plan ltd plan because the plan pays only of appellant ali bassiri usual salary.bassiri challenges that determination.the district court certified this issue for interlocutory appeal,and we thus have jurisdiction under b.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
factual background 
ali bassiri was a permanent employee of xerox corporation from to.while employed at xerox,bassiri was eligible for disability benefits,and he was enrolled in the xerox ltd plan and a prudential disability income plan.the three plans provided full coverage in the event of a disability for the first five months of his disability,bassiri would be paid full salary under the xerox disability plan for the next months,bassiri would be paid salary under the xerox ltd plan and any remaining disability period would be covered under the extended prudential policy.under the terms of the ltd plan,payments lasted only as long as the recipient was a permanent employee of xerox they ended upon termination.
bassiri had an excellent work record and was promoted to a management position in.in september,bassiri began experiencing severe pain in his wrists and upper extremities.in january,bassiri temporarily lost use of one hand.shortly thereafter,he was diagnosed with severe bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome,with accompanying damage to his nerves,spine,arm,wrist,and shoulder.
on january,bassiri doctor notified xerox management that bassiri required a leave of absence.in april,bassiri underwent surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome.when bassiri returned to work on may,xerox informed bassiri that he would be terminated effective july.
bassiri received disability benefits for the first five months of his disability,from january to june.from june until his termination in july,bassiri received payments under the xerox ltd plan.
bassiri filed a complaint against xerox on may,alleging that xerox had wrongfully terminated his employment,and that xerox had wrongfully terminated his disability payments.bassiri complaint,as amended,alleged that either a the xerox ltd plan was an erisa employee welfare benefit plan under section of erisa,codified at,and he was entitled to a remedy under erisa or b the xerox ltd plan was a payroll practice exempt from erisa under b,and he was entitled to relief under state law for breach of contract,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation.
xerox filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss bassiri state law claims as preempted by erisa.on november,the district court held that the xerox ltd plan was an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa.the court rejected bassiri contention that the ltd plan was a payroll practice exempted from erisa because it concluded that the plan did not pay normal compensation under b.it therefore dismissed bassiri state and common law claims as preempted by erisa.on december,bassiri filed a motion asking the district court to certify its decision for interlocutory review pursuant to b.the district court certified the order,and this appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
our task in this interlocutory appeal is limited we are asked only to decide whether xerox ltd plan is an employee welfare benefit plan that falls within the scope of erisa,and if so,whether the fact that the ltd plan pays less than bassiri full salary precludes it from qualifying as a payroll practice specifically exempted from erisa.we review de novo the district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,as well as its interpretation of erisa.see spink lockheed,cir.
section of erisa,codified at,defines an employee welfare benefit plan as 
a ny plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer to the extent that such plan,fund,or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment 
emphasis added.the xerox ltd plan was established by bassiri employer,xerox,and is maintained by a plan administrator who reports to xerox.the ltd plan documents state that the purpose of the ltd plan is to provide disability benefits for eligible employees of xerox corporation.therefore,the ltd plan is clearly established or maintained by an employer for the purpose of providing disability benefits.we thus agree with the district court that the ltd plan falls squarely within erisa definition of an employee welfare benefit plan.
the principle question before us,however,is whether xerox ltd plan is a payroll practice exempted from erisa coverage under department of labor regulations implementing the statute.the regulations define a payroll practice as among other things 
payment of an employee normal compensation,out of the employer general assets,on account of periods of time during which the employee is physically or mentally unable to perform his or her duties,or is otherwise absent for medical reasons such as pregnancy,a physical examination or psychiatric treatment 
b.according to the preamble to the regulation,such plans are exempted from coverage under erisa because,although related to benefits described in section of erisa,they are more closely associated with normal wages or salary.
we must determine whether xerox ltd plan,which pays of one regular salary,could constitute payment of normal compensation.we do not begin this question with a blank slate the department of labor has issued several opinion letters interpreting normal compensation.we therefore first consider what deference,if any,we should give to the department of labor opinion letters.
since,the department of labor has penned eleven opinion letters defining normal compensation to include payments of less than full salary.each of the eleven letters advise that the respective programs are payroll practices because they pay not more than normal compensation.see dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at,dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at,finding that a disability program that paid disabled employees of regular salary is an exempt payroll practice disability payments that either equal,or represent a significant portion of,an employee normal compensation,but in no event exceed an employee normal compensation are payroll practices dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at july,holding that disability plan that paid up to of regular salary was a payroll practice because payments do not exceed the employee normal compensation dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at,it is the position of the department that an employer payment of less than normal compensation may constitute a payroll practice that is not an employee welfare benefit plan.dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at,dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at july,dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at,dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at,dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at,dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at july,dep t of labor,opinion,erisa lexis,at.thus,under the interpretation of the department of labor,payment of of an employee regular salary may constitute normal compensation.
the district court concluded that the department of labor letters should be given deference under skidmore swift,only to the extent that they have the power to persuade,citing christensen harris county,d.the district court was mistaken,however,because the proper construct for review of these opinion letters is auer deference,not skidmore deference.in christensen,the court considered opinion letters in which the department of labor purported to interpret a statute,the fair labor standards act.under skidmore,an agency interpretation of a statute that is not reached through the normal procedure does not have the force of law and is not entitled to chevron deference.see christensen,at.but where an agency interprets its own regulation,even if through an informal process,its interpretation of an ambiguous regulation is controlling under auer unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.see auer robbins,d.
