general electric group life assurance company ge appeals from a summary judgment order obligating it to pay death benefits to larry weber,the widower of shelley clark weber.ge,the administrator and fiduciary of group insurance plans available to the employees of winner communications,winner,including weber,argues that weber was not eligible for the voluntary life insurance coverage and also disputes the award of prejudgment interest.we affirm.
background 
weber began working for winner in its marketing department on september.on march,weber completed a ge enrollment request form.therein,she requested life,dental,dependent dental,dependent life,medical,dependent medical,and long term disability insurance.weber requested a basic life insurance benefits policy in the amount of twice her basic annual earnings.at the same time,weber,using a separate form,enrolled for voluntary life insurance coverage from ge in the amount of.weber enrollment application notes that she had been employed full time at winner since september,with basic annual earnings of.weber listed weber as the primary beneficiary.
a.the voluntary life insurance policy 
the terms of weber voluntary life insurance policy are set forth in a ge group certificate,which contained the terms of the group insurance policy issued by ge to winner and its eligible employees for simplicity sake,we will refer to the certificate as the policy.part of the policy,the insurance schedule,provides that there is no waiting period prior to eligibility for the voluntary employee life insurance coverage.it also states that a n employee may elect an amount of insurance in increments of to the lesser of or five times basic annual earnings,subject to a minimum of.
part lays out the policy definitions.three of those definitions impact this appeal.first,the policy defines actively at work as follows 
you are actively at work on any day if on that day you are 
working at the employer usual place of business or at such place or places that the employer normal course of business may require 
performing all of the duties of your job on a basis and 
not confined in any institution providing care or treatment of physical or mental infirmities.
second,the policy defines an eligible employee as follows 
someone who under the terms of the policy 
meets the requirements in the definition of employee and 
completes the waiting period described in the date of eligibility section and 
is working within the united states.
lastly,the policy defines an employee as follows 
someone who meets the following requirements 
is an employee of the employer,as stated in part insurance schedule 
regularly works at least hours per week at the employer usual place of business or at such place or places that the employer normal course of business may require,unless otherwise stated in part insurance schedule 
is paid for such work in accordance with applicable wage and hour laws and 
is in a classification eligible for insurance as shown in the employer plan of insurance or as noted in the insurance schedule,if applicable.
in a part subsection entitled effective date of insurance,the policy states,once you have met the conditions of insurability,you will be insured under the policy on the latest of 
the date you become eligible 
the date we approve any evidence of insurability we require or 
the date shown in our approval of your request for insurance.
the policy cautions,you must,however,be actively at work on that date.otherwise,you will be insured on the date you are again actively at work emphasis added.
lastly,the policy states that ge is a fiduciary,as that term is used in erisa more specifically,the policy notes that,i n this capacity,ge is charged with the obligation,and possesses discretionary authority to make claim,eligibility and other administrative determinations regarding those policies,and to interpret the meaning of their terms and language.
b.weber claim 
weber passed away on september.she was survived by her husband the appellee here and her then son.on behalf of weber,an insurance broker named clark james sent ge a death claim for weber basic and voluntary life insurance policies on september.james letter attached a notice of claim proof of death form,which janessa devore,winner personnel manager,completed on september.in that form,devore noted that may,was weber date last worked on a basis and certified under penalty of perjury that the information she supplied was true,correct and complete.
shortly thereafter,on october,ge paid out weber basic life insurance benefits to weber however,in regard to the voluntary insurance benefits,ge requested additional documentation from winner because weber date of last active service was so close to the effective date of the voluntary life insurance coverage that ge needed to verify that weber was actively at work,working on a basis,thirty hours or more per week on or after may.
winner duly sent along documentation regarding weber work at winner.on october,winner of national sales,sam youngwirth,sent ge a letter documenting weber duties as a winner employee.he attached winner payroll register for weber from january,to may.youngwirth also attached a series of from weber to devore that listed weber hours worked.in an entitled hours worked may,weber states that she worked hours on monday may,hours on may,hours on may and hours on may despite this documentation,an insurance broker working with weber advised ge that he believed that weber had worked up until two weeks prior to her death.
ge denied weber claim in a letter dated december.therein,ge explained that weber was never eligible for the voluntary life insurance coverage because she was not a employee,actively at work as defined by the policy at the employer usual place of business,performing all the duties of her job on a,hour per week basis after the may,effective date for the policy.the denial letter noted that ge based its decision on the documentation it requested from winner and on the policy.having explained the decision to deny the claim,ge invited weber to submit any documentation that might alter the determination.
weber,through counsel,protested the denial in a letter dated august,but submitted no new documentation ge responded on september.ge maintained that weber failure to work at least hours a week after may,doomed her claim for coverage.specifically,ge stated that,b ased on the information we have received to date,weber did not work at least hours a week,on or after the policy effective date of may,and was not eligible for coverage under the policy.ge thus reiterated the determinative rationale identified in its initial decision.
c.weber lawsuit 
weber filed suit in oklahoma state court in march against ge and the insurance brokers with whom he had dealt ge promptly removed the case to federal court,asserting that weber state causes of breach of contract,promissory estoppel,bad faith breach of contract,and breach of fiduciary recovery under an employee welfare benefit plan and,therefore,were preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,simultaneously,ge moved the federal court to dismiss the complaint based on erisa preemption.weber countered that ge had failed to show that erisa governs the voluntary life insurance plan and contended that the plan fell within the j safe harbor because ge premised its removal on federal question jurisdiction,weber asked the court to remand the case to the state court.
in august,the district court held that erisa governed weber claims and directed weber to file an amended complaint.weber complied,amending his complaint to include two erisa claims alongside two state claims ge answered.weber then filed a motion to remand the case on may,arguing that erisa did not govern the dispute because the voluntary life insurance policy fell within the j safe harbor exemption from erisa umbrella.in support,weber offered fourteen exhibits,including portions of the depositions of a winner human resources employee and the insurance brokers,winner benefit plan description packet,and various documents eventually produced by ge in the administrative record.just a few days after he moved for a remand,weber settled with the insurance brokers.
the district court refused to remand the case in a minute order dated june.therein,the district court noted that the only issue remaining is erisa,and set a new schedule for the case.ge filed the administrative record with the district court on july.weber thereafter moved for summary judgment.subsequently,based on the administrative record,the court granted weber motion for summary judgment.
in its order granting weber motion for summary judgment,the court concluded that ge had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying weber death benefits.the court found that weber met the actively at work definition,at the latest,on may.the court rejected ge interpretation of the policy,explaining that the plain language of the actively at work definition did not require an employee also to have worked hours per week after the effective date.nor could ge argue,the court concluded,that the actively at work definition mandated that weber work full time for a single day.furthermore,the court also noted that clearer language was available to ge if it intended to inform an employee that hours per week was required,but that ge had not used such language.in sum,the court concluded that ge interpretation of the policy was arbitrary and its determination unreasonable 
in response to weber motion to alter or amend its judgment,the district court finalized its judgment on june,awarding to weber.this figure included the in voluntary life insurance benefits,augmented by prejudgment interest at the rate of.this appeal by ge followed.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
at the threshold,we address an issue that weber failed to but that he cloaks in a jurisdictional mantle.in his answer brief,weber reiterates his he raised repeatedly throughout the district court erisa does not preempt his claims because the voluntary life insurance policy at issue falls within the scope of the j safe harbor.thus,he argues that removal was improper because there was no federal question at the time the case was removed which would have supported the federal court original exercise of jurisdiction.
weber argument is crippled by his failure to the district court decision denying remand after the removal.absent a,we have no jurisdiction to consider,trigalet young,cir,an issue determined adversely to the appellee unless resolution of that issue would not enlarge the appellee rights or diminish the appellant.barnhart,cir w ithout taking a cross appeal an appellee claiming error may not attack the decree with a view either to enlarging h is own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of h is adversary.quotation omitted see also couture bd.of educ.of albuquerque pub,wl,cir.weber argument has the potential to enlarge his rights because,under oklahoma tort theories,weber could pursue punitive damages against ge.see.tit,setting conditions for the award of punitive damages in tort actions see also badillo mid century ins,applying in context of insurance dispute.in fact,in his original state court petition,weber did just that.as discussed below in section,weber can not pursue such damages under erisa.
while we have a duty to consider jurisdictional issues even if we must raise them sua sponte,weber argument does not implicate our jurisdiction.ge notes that just a few days after weber filed his motion to remand,he settled with the insurance brokers the parties.at that point,the remaining parties were citizens of different states and the matter in controversy exceed ed the sum or value of.a thus,we have diversity jurisdiction.
the district court twice determined that erisa completely preempted weber state claims,see metro.life ins.taylor,d felix,at,and weber did not these decisions.as a result,we can not consider weber renewal of his remand argument.roe cheyenne mountain conference resort,cir a rguments which would lead to the vacation of the judgment below and the partial relief awarded to the plaintiff may not be heard because defendants failed to.we exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 
weber eligibility for benefits 
ge advances two interrelated arguments for overturning the district court summary judgment decision.first,ge argues that weber was never eligible for the voluntary life insurance coverage because she did not work hours per week after the may,effective date.second,ge argues that weber was never actively at work after may.we hold that,under our proper standard of review,ge interpretation of the policy eligibility and actively at work language was arbitrary.
standard of review 
we review summary judgment orders de novo.flinders workforce stabilization plan of phillips petroleum,cir.we accord no deference to the district court decision.see sandoval aetna life cas.ins,cir.like the district court,we must first determine the appropriate standard to be applied to ge decision to deny benefits.see fought unum life ins.of,cir.
erisa providers may retain the authority to interpret ambiguous provisions in a plan.miller monumental life ins,cir.where an erisa provider has,in fact,retained this authority in explicit terms,we employ a deferential standard of review,asking only whether the denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious,flinders,at firestone tire rubber bruch,d w e hold that a denial of benefits is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.under the arbitrary and capricious standard,we curtail our review,asking only whether the interpretation of the plan was reasonable and made in good faith.flinders,at quoting fought,at.
however,we dial back our deference if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest.metro.life ins.glenn,d quoting firestone,at.in such a situation,that conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.id.at internal quotation marks omitted quoting firestone,at.see also flinders,at.to incorporate this factor,we have crafted a sliding scale approach where the reviewing court will always apply an arbitrary and capricious standard,but will decrease the level of deference given in proportion to the seriousness of the conflict.flinders,at quoting chambers family health plan,cir.this approach mirrors the glenn court method of accounting for the factor.see glenn.at explaining that factor should prove more or less important depending on the conflict of interest magnitude.
here,the policy explicitly states that ge is a fiduciary,as that term is used in erisa additionally,i n this capacity,ge is charged with the obligation,and possesses discretionary authority to make claim,eligibility and other administrative determinations regarding those policies,and to interpret the meaning of their terms and language.ge thereby retained discretionary authority,which triggers this court arbitrary and capricious standard of review.as both the insurer and the plan administrator,ge operates under a conflict of interest in this case.see glenn.at.accordingly we will still employ the arbitrary and capricious standard,but we will weigh ge conflict of interest as a factor in determining the lawfulness of the benefits denial.
lastly,in reviewing a plan administrator decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard,the federal courts are limited to the administrative materials compiled by the administrator in the course of making his decision.fought,at internal quotation omitted.
ge interpretation of the policy 
w hen reviewing a plan administrator decision to deny benefits,we consider only the rationale asserted by the plan administrator in the administrative record and determine whether the decision,based on the asserted rationale,was arbitrary and capricious.flinders,at.we make that determination based on the language of the plan.accordingly,as the first step towards interpreting an erisa plan,we scrutinize the plan documents as a whole and,if unambiguous,construe them as a matter of law.miller,at quoting admin.comm.of assocs.health welfare plan willard,cir.in making this determination,we consider the common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person in the position of the plan participant,not the actual participant,would have understood the words to mean.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting willard,at emphasis added.
if the language is ambiguous,then we must take a hard look and determine whether ge decision was arbitrary in light of its conflict of interest.fought,at.as part of this review,we typically consider whether the decision was the result of a reasoned and principled process,is consistent with any prior interpretations by the plan administrator,is reasonable in light of any external standards,and is consistent with the purposes of the plan.flinders,at internal quotations omitted see also geddes united staffing alliance employee med.plan,cir.neither party addresses these questions specifically and the record reveals little about ge claims assessment process,so we are left to our own analytic devices.
whether it was arbitrary and capricious for ge to conclude that the policy hours per week requirement establishes that weber was ineligible for the voluntary life insurance coverage 
relying on the definition of employee,ge emphasizes that,to qualify as an employee,a person must r egularly work at least hours per week at the employer usual place of business ge then assumes that this requirement was a condition precedent to coverage that could be satisfied only after the effective date.ge justifies this assumption by connecting the policy definitions of employee,eligible employee,actively at work,and effective date of insurance.
first,we consider the effective date of insurance provision,which states,o nce you have met the conditions of insurability,you will be insured under the policy on t he date you become eligible.in addition,however,the employee must be actively at work on that date.thus,the effective date provision has three broader requirements meeting the conditions of insurability,becoming eligible,and being actively at work.we review each requirement in turn.
the policy lists two pertinent conditions of insurability the employee must s atisfy the waiting period shown in the insurance schedule and c omplete and submit one of our enrollment forms.it is undisputed that the policy states that there is no waiting period and that weber completed an enrollment form.
next,we consider whether weber became eligible.while this term is not capitalized,we will assume that it refers to the defined term eligible employee.an eligible employee is one who m eets the requirements in the definition of employee,c ompletes the waiting period,and is working in the united states.only the first prong of this definition is at issue.in pertinent part,the term employee encompasses s omeone who r egularly works at least hours per week at the employer usual place of business emphasis added.
weber was hired and assigned to work a week.her employer certified she was a regularly employed,employee through may.weber time sheets,which winner provided to ge,confirm as much.they reveal that weber regularly worked weeks before may.thus,she regularly worked at least hours a week that illness or vacation might irregularly interrupt an employee regular assignment does not change the regular work experience of an employee.
of course,ge received reports from winner that weber worked less than hours per week during a few weeks after may.that is not enough,however,to cast doubt on the other evidence in the administrative record that weber regularly worked at least hours a week prior to may,the effective date of insurance.nothing in the definition of employee suggests that eligibility is limited to those who regularly work at least hours a week after may.if ge intended to require that the employee actually work hours per week after the effective date to be an eligible employee,it had every opportunity to add specific language to that effect.fought,at.but because ge did not do so,it would be unreasonable to allow ge to do so post facto id.moreover,we note that the voluntary life enrollment application that weber completed on march,requires the employee to certify,i am employed by the employer listed and at present am working at least hours per week for this employer at the regular place of business this language confirms that the hours a week requirement may be satisfied prior to the effective date.
because weber unequivocally met the policy definition of employee,ge denial of benefits on the ground that she never satisfied that definition was arbitrary and capricious.
whether it was arbitrary and capricious for ge to conclude that weber was not actively at work after the effective date of the policy 
having concluded that weber was an eligible employee,we turn now to ge argument that weber voluntary life insurance coverage was never triggered because she was not actively at work after may,the effective date of the coverage.in this regard,ge again maintains that,in order to be covered,weber had to work at winner at least hours per week after may so as to satisfy the policy requirement that she be performing all of the duties of her job on a basis.we reject this reading of the policy as arbitrary and capricious.
pursuant to the policy effective date of insurance section,an employee that has met the conditions of insurability will be insured under the policy on the date she become s eligible provided she is actively at work on that date,or on a later date when she is again actively at work.an employee is actively at work if on any day she is 
working at the employer usual place of business or at such place or places that the employer normal course of business may require 
performing all of the duties of her job on a basis and 
not confined in any institution providing care or treatment of physical or mental infirmities.
emphasis added.
the plain language of the actively at work provision does not require that the employee work any set number of hours,either on a particular day or over the course of a particular week.we can quickly dismiss ge contention that this language required weber to work more than hours in any week after the effective date.tellingly,the actively at work definition states that the employee can fulfill its requirements on any day when the employee meets the three prongs.and we also reject ge contention that the actively at work requirement mandated that weber work an day or even a day after may.coverage under the policy hinges on whether the employee is performing all of her duties on a basis.this language simply does not equate to a requirement that the employee perform all of her duties for a full work day or and actually work a set number of hours on any only requires that work be performed according to the employee duties on a basis.
here,the evidence establishes that weber was actively at work shortly after may.specifically,the administrative record reveals that weber was at work on may,and.the record also reveals that winner considered weber a employee on those days.thus,she was at work on a basis.although weber did not work hours per day on any of those four days,she was nonetheless performing the duties of her job on a basis.nothing in the administrative record suggests otherwise.the only consequence of the fact that weber did not work from may until may is that the policy became effective,at the latest,on may rather than on the may effective date.
in reaching this conclusion,we are persuaded by the reasoning of the fourth circuit in tester reliance standard life insurance,cir.the tester court explained that the proper inquiry for considering whether the decedent was an active,employee under the policy at the time of her death depends on whether or not she worked at her job on a regular basis despite her sick leave.id.at emphasis added.under this inquiry,we have little doubt that weber was an active,employee after may despite her sick leave.while the tester court was employing the de novo standard of review,see id.at,we are still swayed by its reasoning.
our understanding of weber policy also finds some support in bartlett martin marietta operations support.life insurance plan,cir.t
