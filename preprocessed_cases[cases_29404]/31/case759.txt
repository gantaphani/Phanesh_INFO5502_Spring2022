geri kannapien and janice rozhon each accepted a severance package from their employer,the quaker oats company,and retired a few weeks later.the severance package consisted of benefits to be paid pursuant to written plans governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.although kannapien and rozhon have received the amounts to which the express written terms of the plans entitle them,they filed suit against quaker and its parent company,pepsico,seeking equitable relief under erisa,see a,alleging that quaker failed to honor the terms of its retirement plan.the district court found that kannapien and rozhon had failed to produce any genuine issue of material fact that was in dispute and granted summary judgment for the defendants.see kannapien quaker oats,d.we agree and affirm the judgment of the district court.
kannapien and rozhon filed a suit against quaker and pepsico in late october,alleging various claims under erisa.in july,the district court struck all class allegations because the case was not properly brought as a class action.the court granted leave to kannapien and rozhon to amend their complaint in november to add two illinois claims.after this amendment,kannapien and rozhon complaint raised three classes of claims erisa estoppel claims under a b erisa claims for breach of fiduciary duty also under a b and illinois claims for breach of contract and promissory estoppel.after discovery,quaker and pepsico moved for summary judgment,which the district court evaluated based upon the pleadings and affidavits submitted by the parties.the record before the district court established the following facts,which we construe drawing all inferences favor of kannapien and rozhon.see sides city of champaign,cir.
the golden grain company operated a manufacturing plant in bridgeview,illinois,that produced consumer food products such as and mission pasta.golden grain originally hired kannapien and rozhon as salaried employees on january,and may,respectively.kannapien worked as an administrative assistant and rozhon worked as a payroll and insurance clerk.during their employment at golden grain bridgeview plant,kannapien and rozhon participated in the company profit sharing plan.benefits under the profit sharing plan consisted solely of financial contributions made by golden did not make any monetary contributions.
quaker oats acquired golden grain in,and kannapien and rozhon became employees of quaker.quaker did not immediately terminate golden grain profit sharing plan upon taking over,but eventually the funds that had accrued under the profit sharing plan were transferred into separate k accounts for the benefit of the employees.on july,all salaried employees of golden grain,including kannapien and rozhon,became participants in the quaker retirement plan,an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of erisa.
in,quaker merged with a subsidiary of pepsico,but retained the quaker name.as a result of the merger,the quaker retirement plan as relevant to this litigation was amended and restated on january.benefits under the retirement plan are calculated using an employee credited service time,which the retirement plan expressly states does not include any time an employee served before becoming a participant in the quaker retirement plan.the amended retirement plan also entitles employees who were involuntary terminated by the company within two years of the merger to benefits,which consist of additional monthly payments to eligible employees.the retirement plan does not define what constitutes an involuntarily termination.
in addition to the retirement plan,quaker implemented a severance plan that also provided benefits to employees who were discharged involuntarily.unlike the retirement plan,benefits under the severance plan are determined using a period of time that commences with an employee date of hire by a company acquired by quaker.the benefits under the severance plan are unrelated to the basic benefits under the retirement plan or to the benefits provided under the retirement plan,except that both the severance plan benefits and benefits are available only to involuntarily discharged employees.
in december,both kannapien and rozhon received statements that estimated their basic pension benefits under the retirement plan.these statements each contained the disclaimer that they merely estimated retirement plan benefits and that they were not official plan documents.the estimate statements further stipulated that in the event of a conflict between this statement and the official plan documents,the official plan documents will govern.
the estimate statement sent to kannapien contained a clerical error that listed her credited service as beginning on january,hire date at golden grain.but under the express written terms of the retirement plan,kannapien credited service did not begin until july,the date she became a participant in the quaker retirement plan.similarly,rozhon received an erroneous estimate statement that detailed her credited service as beginning on may,her hire date with golden grain,instead of the july,date.despite listing incorrect credited service start dates,the estimate statements received by kannapien and rozhon used the proper time interval under the retirement plan terms from july,to december to accurately estimate the actual dollar amounts that each would receive under the plan.
in,following the sale of its mission pasta product line,pepsico began to decrease production at the bridgeview plant.in light of this,the plant manager,tom winters,received approval to decrease the plant labor costs.in order to reduce its workforce,quaker offered to give its employees who volunteered for early retirement not only their standard benefits under the retirement plan,but also two additional benefits reserved for involuntarily terminated employees.specifically,employees who elected for early retirement would be deemed eligible to receive benefits under the severance plan,as well as the benefits under the retirement plan.
accordingly,winters held a meeting at the bridgeview plant in early,during which he stated that the company was looking for employees who would be interested in leaving.he directed interested employees to obtain information from jeffrey satterlee,the human resources manager.kannapien,who served as an administrative assistant to winters,asked winters if she should consider contacting satterlee.winters encouraged her to do so and told her that she would be very pleased by the amount she would receive if she left the plant.at the time he made this statement to kannapien,winters had no knowledge of the actual dollar amount of kannapien benefits.
neither kannapien,nor rozhon,had considered retiring before,but each contacted satterlee after the plant meeting.satterlee met with kannapien and rozhon separately and presented each with personalized written documentation prepared by quaker employee administration center,that described the additional benefits available to them if they retired early namely,the benefits under the retirement plan and the benefits under the severance plan.nothing in the documents prepared by the employee administration center stated anything about the basic benefits employees would receive under the retirement plan,nor did anything in these documents purport to supplant or modify the terms of the retirement plan.the documentation prepared by the employee administration center informed kannapien and rozhon that the benefits would be paid from the retirement plan and would be based on years of service.while the documents did not define the term years of service,the retirement plan stipulates that years of service include only relevant years for vesting years of credited service,determined once an employee has begun participating in the quaker retirement plan.
at his meetings with kannapien and rozhon,satterlee did not discuss their respective standard benefits under the retirement plan,nor did satterlee represent that the offer of additional severance plan and benefits would alter the unambiguous language of the retirement plan.in fact,satterlee told both women that he could calculate their pension benefit,and advised each of them to contact the employee administration center to obtain an estimate.however,at his meetings with kannapien and rozhon,satterlee mistakenly informed each of them that their benefits would be calculated based on their original golden grain hire dates instead of the proper date under the terms of the retirement plan,july.kannapien and rozhon admitted in separate depositions that satterlee made an honest mistake in misstating the pertinent dates to them,and that they relied heavily on this mistake in deciding to retire.
after their meetings with satterlee,kannapien and rozhon each agreed to retire so they could receive the additional severance plan and benefits.both women ended their employment with quaker in late april.for about a year after retiring,kannapien and rozhon each received benefits according to the terms of the severance plan kannapien received and rozhon received.kannapien and rozhon also admitted in their depositions that the receipt of these funds from the severance plan motivated their decisions to retire.
in may,kannapien and rozhon each received a statement summarizing the remaining benefits owed to her under the retirement plan.these statements calculated both the basic and benefits according to the terms of the retirement plan and awarded each woman benefits based upon years of credited time span from july,until may.upon receiving these statements,kannapien and rozhon separately contacted satterlee to express concern over the calculation of their benefits under the retirement plan because both women expected their credited service to be calculated using their hire dates with golden grain.satterlee,in turn,contacted the employee administration center on behalf of kannapien and rozhon and also advised kannapien and rozhon on how to appeal the benefits calculations.
kannapien and rozhon appealed their respective benefits calculations to pepsico administration committee in june.kannapien claimed that her golden grain service date should have been used in calculating both her basic benefits and the benefits under the retirement plan rozhon challenged only the calculation of her benefits under the retirement plan.in august,the administration committee notified kannapien and rozhon separately,and in writing,that they were denying their appeals because golden grain employees did not become participants in the quaker retirement plan until july,and they had already received a retirement benefit for the preceding the funds received pursuant to the golden grain profit sharing plan.the letters also noted that the dollar amounts presented to kannapien and rozhon in the december estimate statements were properly calculated using the appropriate july,date.
after their appeals were denied,kannapien and rozhon commenced this litigation.in granting quaker and pepsico motion for summary judgment,the district court found that kannapien and rozhon had not sufficiently alleged an erisa estoppel claim because they relied largely on innocent,oral misstatements and the language of the retirement plan is unambiguous,kannapien,d at kannapien and rozhon had not properly raised an erisa claim for breach of fiduciary duty because the suit had not been filed against any plan fiduciaries,id.at,and kannapien and rozhon claims were preempted by erisa,id.at.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,kannapien and rozhon contend that they sufficiently raised an issue of material fact on each of the counts in their complaint.we will review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.see sperandeo lorillard tobacco,cir vallone cna fin,cir.while we have recently recognized that the clearly erroneous standard of review applies in an erisa case if the summary judgment motion deals solely with the characterization of facts and neither party claims the right to a jury trial,the general standard of de novo review applies in this case.see mcdougall pioneer ranch,cir.summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
erisa estoppel claims 
kannapien and rozhon first claim is for erisa estoppel under a.kannapien and rozhon concede that they have been paid benefits according to the written terms of the retirement plan however,they seek to estop quaker and pepsico from enforcing the express terms of the plan because they allege that they detrimentally relied upon misstatements by quaker employees in their decisions to retire.we agree with the district court that kannapien and rozhon do not raise any genuine issue of material fact with respect to their erisa estoppel claim.
the written plan document ordinarily governs erisa plan administration statements or conduct by individuals implementing the plan can only estop an employer from enforcing the plan written terms in extreme circumstances.vallone,at sandstrom cultor food,cir see also downs world color press,cir.we have consistently required that modifications to an erisa plan must be in writing because erisa exists,in part,to protect the financial integrity of pension and welfare plans by confining the payment of benefits to a plan written terms.see operating eng rs local health benefit fund gustafson constr,cir downs,at.as a result,in order to prevail on an estoppel claim under erisa,we ordinarily require that plaintiffs show a knowing misrepresentation made in writing reasonable reliance on that representation by them to their detriment.vallone,at coker trans world airlines,cir.here,we see no basis upon which to grant estoppel to kannapien and rozhon as they fail to satisfy any required element of an erisa estoppel claim.
first,kannapien and rozhon can not prove that any quaker employee knowingly misrepresented the terms of the retirement plan to them.see brosted unum life ins.of america,cir.the december estimate statements did not contain any knowing misrepresentations.these statements inadvertently listed kannapien and rozhon respective hire dates however,the district court determined that the record clearly established that these mistakes were solely clerical errors and not knowing misrepresentations.the record supports this conclusion because the written statements accurately reflected the dollar amounts that kannapien and rozhon would receive under the written terms of the retirement plan.at any rate,kannapien and rozhon concede that these clerical errors in the estimate statements were unintentional.
further,the representations made to kannapien and rozhon by their human resources manager,their golden grain hire dates would be used in calculating their the product of an innocent mistake,not a knowing misrepresentation.indeed,the record contains ample evidence to support this as well.specifically,satterlee advised both kannapien and rozhon to consult the employee administration center to obtain benefits estimates after telling them that he could not individually compute their benefits.satterlee also sought to rectify his misinformation by contacting the employee administration center on their behalf once he discovered his error.kannapien and rozhon also conceded in their depositions that they believed satterlee made an honest mistake.
finally,winters statement to kannapien that she would be pleased if she considered taking early retirement does not constitute a knowing misrepresentation.in fact,we agree with the district court that this statement does not misrepresent anything about the terms of the retirement plan,see kannapien,d at,nor does it represent anything at all because this statement was not a statement of fact,see frahm equitable life assur.soc.of,cir.
likewise,kannapien and rozhon can not point to any written misrepresentation by quaker or pepsico.oral misrepresentations may become grounds for erisa estoppel only where plan documents are ambiguous or misleading.vallone,at bowerman stores,cir bland fiatallis,cir approving use of extrinsic evidence to prove the meaning of language in erisa welfare plan documents only if the language of the plan document is ambiguous and the ambiguities are not clar
