opinion of the court 
danielle santomenno,karen poley,and barbara poley collectively,participants brought suit against john hancock life insurance company and its affiliates collectively,john hancock under the employment retirement income security act of erisa,et,and the investment company act of ica,et,for allegedly charging their retirement plans excessive fees on annuity insurance contracts offered to plan participants.the district court granted john hancock motion to dismiss.it dismissed the ica excessive fee claims because only those maintaining an ownership interest in the funds in question could sue under the derivative suit provision enacted by congress and the participants are no longer investors in the funds in question.as to the erisa claims,the district court found that dismissal was warranted because participants failed to make a demand upon the plan trustees to take appropriate action and failed to join the trustees as parties.we affirm the district court judgment with regards to the ica claims,but vacate and remand on the erisa counts.
this action arises out of the administration of k benefit plans.the trustees of these plans entered into group annuity contracts with john hancock.participants brought this action on march.the basis of participants complaint is that john hancock charged a variety of excessive fees in providing investment services to these plans.santomenno was a security holder in the relevant funds from july through sometime in june,poley from july to sometime in january,and poley from january to sometime in january.counts i through vii were brought under section a of erisa,a.count viii was brought under section b of the ica,b,and count ix was brought under section b of the ica,b.
john hancock moved to dismiss under.b.drawing upon the common law of trusts,the district court found that all of participants theories of liability under erisa were derivative and dismissed all seven erisa counts because participants did not first make demand upon the trustees of the plan and did not join the trustees in the lawsuit.as the district court explained 
in short,absent demand,or allegations going to demand futility,or some allegations,which if proven,would establish that the trustees improperly refused to bring suit,it would appear that the beneficiaries of an erisa plan can not bring a claim under section.likewise,any such suit must join the plan trustees.here,because there are no such factual allegations and because the trustees have not been joined,dismissal of the erisa counts,counts i through vii,would seem to be proper.

the district court dismissed count viii,brought under section b of the ica,because participants no longer owned any interest in john hancock funds.the district court observed that continuous ownership throughout the pendency of the litigation is an element of statutory standing.id.at citing siemers wells fargo,no.c,wl,at.the district court proceeded to dismiss count ix because,in its view,section b of the ica could only provide relief to participants if they could show a violation of some other section of the act.id.quoting tarlov paine webber cashfund.because participants section b claim had been dismissed in count viii,the district court reasoned that the section b claim would seem to fail also.id.

we begin by addressing the ica issues.the first question is whether continuous ownership of securities in the fund in question during the pendency of litigation is required for actions brought under section b of the ica.section b,in pertinent part,provides 
for the purposes of this subsection,the investment adviser of a registered investment company shall be deemed to have a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services,or of payments of a material nature,paid by such registered investment company,or by the security holders thereof,to such investment adviser or any affiliated person of such investment adviser.an action may be brought under this subsection by the commission,or by a security holder of such registered investment company on behalf of such company,against such investment adviser,or any affiliated person of such investment adviser,or any other person enumerated in subsection a of this section who has a fiduciary duty concerning such compensation or payments,for breach of fiduciary duty in respect of such compensation or payments paid by such registered investment company or by the security holders thereof to such investment adviser or person.
b.a suit brought under section b is similar to a derivative action in that it is brought on behalf of the investment company.because the action is brought on behalf of the company,any recovery obtained in a b action will go to the company rather than the plaintiff.daily income fund,fox,d citations omitted.accordingly,i n this respect,a b action is undeniably derivative in the broad sense of that word.id.citations omitted.
in the context of derivative suits governed by,courts have imposed a requirement of continuous ownership this requirement 
d erives from the first sentence of rule,which refers to actions brought by one or more shareholders to enforce a right of a corporation the rule provision that a derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation,has served as an anchor for the concept that ownership must extend throughout the life of the litigation.
lewis chiles,cir citations omitted.
section b plainly requires that a party claiming a breach of the fiduciary duty imposed by that legislative provision be a security holder of the investment company at the time the action is initiated.see,dandorph fahnestock.imposing a continuous ownership requirement throughout the pendency of the litigation assures that the plaintiff will adequately represent the interests of the security holders in obtaining a recovery for the benefit of the company.
participants assert that there is no basis upon which to impose a continuing ownership requirement on an ica b claim.appellant br.at.citations omitted.several arguments are advanced in support of participants position.first,citing two district court decisions in re american mutual funds fee litigation,cv,wl,at,and in re mutual funds investment litigation,d,participants contend that.does not apply to suits brought under section b.participants also attempt to distinguish siemers,wl,at,the primary case relied upon by the district court in dismissing the ica section b claim.participants assert that siemers is distinguishable because that plaintiff did not have an interest in the investment fund when he filed his complaint.here,plaintiff danielle santomenno did,but the poleys did not.appellant br.at.participants further offer a policy argument the imposition of a requirement would effectively deter a plaintiff,who wishes to mitigate damages by selling his or her investment,from suing a result at odds with the salutary goals of the ica.appellant br.at.
we disagree with participants contentions.first,we note that in re mutual funds investment litigation,one of two cases relied upon by participants,did not concern the continuous ownership question.instead,the district court in that case addressed the contemporaneous ownership requirement rather than the continuous ownership requirement the idea that,at the time of the alleged harm,plaintiffs must have owned shares in the fund.d at emphasis added.there was no question in that case that the plaintiffs continued to hold shares in one of the mutual funds in question 
this leaves participants with in re american mutual funds fee litigation,an opinion that goes against the weight of authority on this topic and is premised upon an overly expansive reading of the supreme court decision in daily income fund.the district court in in re american mutual funds fee litigation viewed daily income fund as dispensing with a continuous ownership standing requirement because such a requirement was recognized in the context of cases arising under,and that rule does not apply to section b claims.id.at.daily income fund,however,addressed only the demand requirement of a common derivative action to which rule applies,that before bringing suit a shareholder must make demand upon the corporation directors to take appropriate action with respect to a right the corporation could itself have enforced in court.at.citations omitted.because the right created by section b could not be read as one belonging to the company itself,the court held that there was no basis for imposing a demand requirement.id.at.daily income fund did not address the question of whether a securities holder must maintain that status throughout the pendency of the litigation.
participants mistakenly assume that the root of the continuous ownership requirement is rule.instead,the prerequisite arises from the fact that congress directed that only the securities and exchange commission and securities holders,acting on behalf of the investment company,could bring an action to enforce the rights created by section b.as the court recognized in daily income fund,any recovery in an action brought under section b belongs to the investment company.at.when a plaintiff disposes of his or her holdings in the company,that plaintiff no longer has a stake in the outcome of the litigation because any recovery would inure to the benefit of existing securities holders,not former ones.a continuous ownership requirement gives effect to this undeniably derivative nature of a section b claim.id.stated otherwise,a continuous ownership requirement reflects a shareholder real interest in obtaining a recovery for the corporation which increases the value of his holdings.chiles,at citing lewis knutson,cir schilling belcher,cir.as participants no longer own john hancock funds,they lack any real interest in securing a recovery.
participants policy argument that a continuous ownership requirement deters a plaintiff from mitigating damages by preventing him or her from selling shares during the pendency of litigation is unconvincing.first,because the recovery belongs to the company,not the security holder,see daily income fund,at,it would not seem appropriate to impose a duty to mitigate damages on individual security holders.moreover,it has long been recognized that only those parties who would actually benefit from a suit may continue to prosecute the action,a rationale that we explicitly adopted in kauffman 
standing is justified only by this proprietary interest created by the stockholder relationship and the possible indirect benefits the nominal plaintiff may acquire qua stockholder of the corporation which is the real party in interest.without this relationship,there can be no standing,no right in himself to prosecute this suit.
at citations omitted.
furthermore,we note that even if continuous ownership were not a requirement of section b,participants claim under that section still fails.as observed above,a plain reading of section b indicates that ownership when the suit is first filed is an indisputable prerequisite.the poleys interests in the john hancock funds were terminated prior to the filing of the original complaint.therefore,they can not be classified as security holder s under section b.santomenno,meanwhile,still owned john hancock funds when the case was first initiated,but no longer had any interest in the funds when the second amendment complaint was filed on october.it is the second amended complaint that is the operative pleading for standing purposes.as the supreme court observed in rockwell international united states,d 
the state of things and the originally alleged state of things are not synonymous demonstration that the original allegations were false will defeat jurisdiction.so also will the withdrawal of those allegations,unless they are replaced by others that establish jurisdiction.thus,when a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then voluntarily amends the complaint,courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.
id.at.citations omitted.even if we were to hold that continuous ownership is not required by the statute,participants section b claim would fail because their interests in the john hancock funds were terminated prior to the filing of the second amended complaint.as a result,they are not security holders entitled to bring an action on behalf of the investment company.accordingly,dismissal of participants section b claim was proper.
the second ica issue is whether participants claim under section b of the ica survives a motion to dismiss.section b,in pertinent part,provides that 
a contract that is made,or whose performance involves,a violation of the ica,or of any rule,regulation,or order thereunder,is unenforceable by either party unless a court finds that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than nonenforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the ica.
participants argue that the district court incorrectly dismissed their section b claim by erroneously believing it was premised upon a breach of the fiduciary duty provision of section b of the ica.participants assert that the section b claim is not based upon a violation of section b,but is instead premised upon an alleged violation of section f of the ica,f,which requires that the fees and charges deducted under a registered separate account funding variable insurance contract,in the aggregate,are reasonable in relation to the services rendered,the expenses expected to be incurred,and the risks assumed by the insurance company.f a.while conceding that section f does not establish a private cause of action,participants contend that its standards are enforceable in an action brought under ica b.appellant br.at.
participants contend that because amendments made in to section b substantially tracked section of the investment advisers act of iaa,which had been previously construed by the supreme court in transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis,d to provide a right of action,section b similarly creates a private right of action in their favor to seek rescission and restitution.appellant reply br.at.citing alexander sandoval,d,participants contend that the district court should have read section b of the ica as the supreme court read section of the iaa as creating a private right of action the court reasoning that statutes should be similarly construed,especially when the statute at issue was enacted after a provision is judicially construed,supports plaintiffs position here.appellant reply br.at.
participants misread sandoval,which made it clear that only congress could create private rights of action.at.like substantive federal law itself,private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by congress.congress empowered the securities and exchange commission to enforce all ica provisions through section,see,while creating an exclusive private right of action in section b.in sandoval,the court observed that t he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others at.citations omitted.
unlike section b of the ica,the iaa construed in transamerica did not expressly provide for a private cause of action.see at.the transamerica court observed that where the same statute contains private causes of action in other sections such as with the ica,it is highly improbable that congress absentmindedly forgot to mention an intended private action.at.quoting cannon university of chicago,d powell,dissenting.as the court explained,it is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies,a court must be chary of reading others into
