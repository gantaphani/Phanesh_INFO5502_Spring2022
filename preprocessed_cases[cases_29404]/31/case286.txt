the industrial division of the communications workers of america or the union,as the representative of approximately retirees from visteon corporation manufacturing plants in connersville and bedford,indiana,appeals the district court order,affirming the bankruptcy court order permitting visteon to terminate retiree health and life insurance benefits without complying with the procedures set forth in.both courts reasoned that,notwithstanding the language of that statute,it would be unreasonable to interpret as limiting an employer right to modify or terminate benefits during the pendency of a chapter bankruptcy proceeding,if the employer could unilaterally terminate those benefits outside of bankruptcy pursuant to a reservation of rights clause in the benefit plan.since visteon reserved the right to unilaterally terminate the retiree benefits at issue here,the courts concluded that congress did not intend to limit that right.
on appeal,the union argues that the plain language and legislative history of compel exactly the result the district and bankruptcy courts avoided.the union claims that congress intended to restrict a debtor ability to modify or terminate,except through the process,any retiree benefits during a chapter bankruptcy proceeding,regardless of whether the debtor could terminate those benefits outside of bankruptcy.based on the plain language of as well as its legislative history,we agree.accordingly,as explained more fully below,we will reverse the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings 
factual and procedural history 
visteon corporation is one of the world largest suppliers of automotive parts.originally formed as a division of ford motor corporation,it spun off in to become its own corporate entity.in doing so,it took over operation of plants in connersville and bedford,indiana previously run by ford or its subsidiaries.see.hourly workers at both plants were represented by the.see.
for decades,visteon,or its,have provided certain health and life insurance benefits to retirees from these plants.see.visteon agreement to provide such benefits has been memorialized in successive collective bargaining agreements cbas,as well as in summary plan descriptions spds.
the most recent spds at both plants state that retiree medical coverage will continue during retirement or continue during retirement until death.however,both spds have language wherein visteon retains its right to modify or terminate coverage.the second page of each spd provides in part as follows 
visteon systems,llc intends to continue the plan as described in this handbook.however,the company reserves the right to suspend,amend or terminate the any of the coverages or features provided under the any time and in any ma nn er to the extent permitted by law subject to the collective bargaining requirements.as a result,this handbook is not a contract,nor is it a guarantee of your coverages.
with slight variations.each spd reiterates 
visteon systems,llc intends to continue the plan indefinitely.however,the company reserves the right to suspend,modify or amend the benefits provided under the plan,or even terminate the plan or any of the benefits provided under the plan.
however,the plan is subject to the provisions of the current collective bargaining agreements between the plan sponsor and the unions.as a result,this handbook is not a guarantee of your coverage.
with slight variations.
visteon closed its connersville plant in and its bedford plant in.prior to each plant closing,the union and visteon negotiated closing agreements that set forth the terms under which the plants would close.see.for the most part,these agreements do not refer to retiree benefits.however,the agreements do include a waiver and release,which provides in relevant part visteon may in the future amend its benefit plans and make available different retirement,placement or separation benefits for which i may not be eligible.the plant closure agreement does not limit or in any way modify the provisions of any benefit plan.
on may,visteon filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy in the district of delaware.see.since filing the petition,visteon has continued to operate its business as a debtor in possession,and is in the process of restructuring so that it can successfully emerge from bankruptcy.see.
on june,visteon moved the bankruptcy court for permission to terminate all united states retiree benefit plans pursuant to b see.visteon request affected approximately of visteon present and former employees,their spouses,and their dependants.see.several groups of retirees,including the connersville retirees and bedford retirees represented by the,objected.see.they argued that visteon could not terminate any retiree benefits during a chapter proceeding without first complying with the requirements of.see.
on december,the bankruptcy court granted visteon motion as to the vast majority of the retiree benefits,including those at issue in this appeal see.the court concluded that since visteon has the right under law to terminate benefits unilaterally,did not apply.see id.the court explained 
the court finds that as a matter of applicable law,as well as the plain meaning of the controlling documents,the debtors would have outside of bankruptcy the right to terminate these plans at will 
the reason that the benefits can be terminable is that they are not vested.in making my ruling,i incorporate in toto judge drain analysis in in re delphi,wl,and i rely on that analysis as a support for my ruling i hold that the plain meaning analysis as applied by judge venter in in re farmland,is not persuasive because it would lead to an absurd result in that it would expand retiree rights beyond the scope of state law for no legitimate bankruptcy purpose.under butner united states,which is based on constitutional principles,the statute can not modify existing state law absent some specific bankruptcy reason and there is none here in connection with the issue of retiree benefits.
the bankruptcy court therefore evaluated visteon motion to terminate retiree benefits under,and authorized the termination based on the court conclusion that it was a reasonable exercise of business judgment.see.
even though visteon could terminate its benefit payments immediately pursuant to the bankruptcy court order,it remained obligated under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of cobra,to provide lifetime cobra coverage to retirees whose benefits it discontinued during a chapter proceeding.visteon consulted with its benefit administrators and determined that it would take several months to terminate the old plans and set up new cobra plans.see.visteon therefore planned to delay termination of payments for retiree benefits until april.see.after that date,retirees could continue their visteon health coverage only by electing cobra coverage,and paying the full cost of that coverage plus a two percent administrative fee.see.
on february,the union moved the bankruptcy court for a stay pending appeal of its order permitting the termination of benefits.see.the bankruptcy court denied the motion.see.despite finding that some retirees faced irreparable harm it concluded that the union was unlikely to succeed on the merits on appeal,and therefore it could not meet the burden for obtaining preliminary injunctive relief.see id.
visteon appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court,and also moved that court for a stay of the bankruptcy court order.the district court denied the appeal,and refused to issue a stay pending appeal.see.the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court finding that the benefits were not vested was not clearly erroneous.see.it also agreed with the bankruptcy court conclusion that the protections afforded by did not apply to retiree benefits that could be unilaterally terminated outside of bankruptcy.although the court acknowledged that the union argument to the contrary might seem legitimate based on a plain reading of the statute,it nonetheless reasoned that such an interpretation would result in retirees receiving more protection from a company under bankruptcy than they would receive from a company outside of bankruptcy a unique if not revolutionary interpretation of the bankruptcy code by improving on the,contractual rights of a third party constituent as a result of the filing of a bankruptcy case.
the district court did,however,grant a limited stay so that the union could seek expedited appeal.the court acknowledged that the union legal argument had some merit,as neither the supreme court nor any circuit court has ruled on this issue,and its contrary reading of was supported only by the interpretation of by several respected bankruptcy judges.it also noted that a strict application of the plain meaning doctrine may warrant a fresh reading of this statute,but that such an interpretation would still have to get over the hurdle that interpreting the statute in that manner results in the retirees getting more protection through a bankruptcy proceeding than they would absent bankruptcy.see also.
during the stay granted by the district court,visteon was permitted to provide insurance solely through cobra plans however,it was required to pay the april premiums of any retirees who purchased insurance.see.this expedited appeal followed 
effective may,visteon stopped all payments for the retiree benefits at issue in this case,and the retirees were able to continue visteon health insurance only through paying for cobra coverage.the union represented at oral argument that the majority of the approximately retirees are now without health insurance,as the cost of purchasing coverage through cobra or other private insurance providers is prohibitive

iii.chapter bankruptcy and the protections of 
as a general rule,chapter of the bankruptcy code strikes a balance between two principal interests facilitating the reorganization and rehabilitation of the debtor as an economically viable entity,and protecting creditors interests by maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate.in re philadelphia newspapers,llc,cir.section,however,factors another interest into the balancing equation.as we have explained,was enacted to protect the interests of retirees of chapter debtors.datacomm,arcara in re datacomm,cir quoting collier on bankruptcy,alan resnick henry sommer,ed.
section was enacted,along with its counterpart a,as the primary substantive components of the retiree benefits bankruptcy protection act of rbbpa,stat.codified as amended at,a.congress enacted the rbbpa in response to ltv corporation termination of the health and life insurance benefits of retirees during its chapter bankruptcy,with no advance notice to the affected retirees see,reprinted in,the bill addresses situations with respect to retiree insurance benefits,such as occurred last year when ltv corporation,after filing a chapter bankruptcy petition,immediately terminated the health and life insurance benefits of approximately retirees.
in crafting,congress provided certain procedural and substantive protections for retiree benefits during a chapter proceeding.section a ensures that some measure of those protections extends beyond the proceeding.for the purposes of both sections,retiree benefits are defined as 
payments to any entity or person for the purpose of providing or reimbursing payments for retired employees and their spouses and dependants,for medical,surgical,or hospital care benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,or death under any plan,fund,or program through the purchase of insurance or otherwise maintained or established in whole or in part by the debtor prior to filing a petition commencing a case under this title.
section e provides in relevant part that n otwithstanding any other provision of this title,the shall timely pay and shall not modify any retiree benefits unless the court,on the motion of the trustee or authorized representative of the retirees orders,or the trustee and the authorized representative agree to,the modification of such benefits.e.
the trustee must attempt to reach an agreement with the retirees regarding modification of retiree benefits before it can ask the bankruptcy court to modify or terminate them section f requires that the trustee make a proposal to the authorized representative of the retirees which provides for those necessary modifications in the retiree benefits that are necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and assures that all creditors,the debtor and all of the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably.f a.the trustee must also provide the authorized representative with information about the company financial situation to allow for informed evaluation of the proposal.see f b.after making this proposal,the trustee must meet with the authorized representative to confer in good faith in attempting to reach mutually satisfactory modifications of such retiree benefits.f.
the court will grant a motion to modify retiree benefits only if it finds that the trustee has made a proposal satisfying these requirements,the authorized representative has refused to accept it without good cause,and the modification is necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and assures that all creditors,the debtor,and all of the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably,and is clearly favored by the balance of the equities.g.even after the court permits a modification,however,the authorized representative may still move for an increase in benefits,which the court should grant if consistent with the g standard.see id.
section e provides additional protection for retiree benefits by giving them priority they would not otherwise have.that provision states a ny payment for retiree benefits required to be made during a chapter proceeding has the status of an allowed administrative expense under,rather than the general unsecured status that would otherwise apply.e.benefits paid during the proceeding do not reduce the retirees general unsecured claim for any benefits which remain unpaid whether based upon a right to future unpaid benefits or from any benefits not paid as a result of modifications allowed pursuant to this section.i.
congress focused the protections of on retirees who would otherwise be without needed benefits.thus,congress specified that does not apply to any retiree,or the spouse or dependents of such retiree,if such retiree gross income for the twelve months preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition equals or exceeds,unless that retiree is able to show that can not otherwise obtain comparable coverage.m.
as already noted,the rbbpa also amended a,the section of chapter which sets forth the requirements a reorganization plan must satisfy in order for the bankruptcy court to approve the reorganization and allow the debtor to emerge from bankruptcy.the rbbpa added the requirement that 
the plan provides for the continuation after its effective date of payment of all retiree benefits,as that term is defined in section of this title,at the level established pursuant to subsection e b or g of section of this title,at any time prior to confirmation of the plan,for the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits.
iv.discussion 
as explained at the outset,this appeal requires that we decide whether limits a debtor ability to terminate during bankruptcy those retiree benefits that it could,consistent with plan documents,collective bargaining obligations,and the prescriptions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,terminate unilaterally outside of bankruptcy the union argues that the plain language of applies to all retiree benefits,whether or not the debtor could terminate those benefits outside of bankruptcy pursuant to language in the applicable plan documents reserving that right.appellees visteon and the official committee of unsecured creditors unsecured creditors counter by relying primarily on the majority view of courts that have addressed this issue.like the courts in those cases,appellees contend that restricting a debtor from terminating during bankruptcy those retiree benefits that it could otherwise terminate at will is absurd,and courts must conclude that the plain language of a statute does not reflect congressional intent if it produces an absurd result.
we hold that is unambiguous and clearly applies to any and all retiree benefits,including the ones at issue here.moreover,despite arguments to the contrary,the plain language of produces a result which is neither at odds with legislative intent,nor absurd.accordingly,disregarding the text of that statute is tantamount to a judicial repeal of the very protections congress intended to afford in these circumstances.we must,therefore,give effect to the statute as written.see lamie united states,w hen the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the test is not to enforce it according to its terms.internal quotation marks omitted.
we recognize that the majority of bankruptcy and district courts that have addressed this issue have concluded that does not limit a debtor ability to terminate benefits during bankruptcy when it has reserved the right to do so in the applicable plan documents.see,retired union employees ass new valley in re new valley,wl,in re delphi,wl,in re am.royalties,in re doskocil.but see retailers serv.employees comm.of ames dep t store,in re ames dep t stores,civ,wl,in re farmland.
we also realize that our conclusion appears to be in tension with the decision of the court of appeals for the second circuit in ltv steel united mine workers in re chateaugay,cir.there,the court was confronted with the related,but different,issue of applicability to benefits provided pursuant to a cba that expires while the debtor is in chapter proceedings.
we are convinced that in reaching these contrary conclusions as to the scope of,these courts mistakenly relied on their own views about sensible policy,rather than on the congressional policy choice reflected in the unambiguous language of the statute.
plain language 
as in all cases of statutory construction,our analysis of begins with the statute plain language.see,hourly of debtor erie forge steel,in re erie forge steel,cir construing authorized representative provision of in accordance with its plain language.the words of a statute are not to be lightly jettisoned by courts looking to impose their own logic on a statutory scheme.see united states terlingo,cir courts may look behind a statute only when the plain meaning produces a result that is not just unwise but is clearly absurd.internal quotation marks omitted.when statutory language is plain and unambiguous,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.lamie,at internal quotation marks omitted.c ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain.it is for congress,not the courts,to enact legislation.when courts disregard the language congress has used in an unambiguous statute,they amend or repeal that which congress enacted into law.such a failure to defer to the clearly expressed statutory language of congress runs contrary to the bedrock principles of our democratic society.see lamie,at our unwillingness to soften the import of congress chosen words results from deference to the supremacy of the legislature.quoting united states locke.
as discussed above,e plainly states n otwithstanding any other provision of this title,the trustee shall timely pay and shall not modify any retiree benefits,except through compliance with the procedures set forth therein.e emphasis added.retiree benefits are defined,in turn,as payments to any entity or person for certain select purposes under any plan,fund,or program maintained or established in whole or in part by the debtor prior to filing a petition commencing a case under this title.a emphasis added.with the exception of subsection m,which specifies that does not apply to retirees able to obtain comparable benefits,contains no limitation or restriction.
section could hardly be clearer.it restricts a debtor ability to modify any payments to any entity or person under any plan,fund,or program in existence when the debtor files for chapter bankruptcy,and it does so notwithstanding any other provision of the bankruptcy code.there is therefore no ambiguity as to whether applies here.congress did not restrict the application of to those benefits that the debtor was otherwise compelled to provide.benefits that the debtor could have terminated outside of bankruptcy,but which it was nonetheless providing at the time of its chapter filing,are plainly included in the phrase,payments to any entity or person under any plan,fund,or program.
congress took care to specifically exclude some benefits from the protective umbrella of.the protections established therein do not extend to benefits provided for purposes other than health,accident,disability,or death or to benefits provided to retirees able to obtain comparable coverage or to benefits contemplated,but not maintained or established,prior to the debtor filing for bankruptcy.however,congress did not limit otherwise broad scope based on whether or not the debtor reserved a right to terminate in its plan.see in re farmland,at on its face,the language of the statute is clear there is nothing in the language of the statute to suggest that congress intended to allow the termination of retiree benefits in those instances where the debtor has the right to unilaterally terminate those benefits under the language of the plan or program at issue.
nevertheless,the unsecured creditors argue that is ambiguous because it does not specifically address whether benefits which could be unilaterally terminated outside of bankruptcy are retiree benefits.however,that is not an ambiguity.language is ambiguous only if it is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.dobrek phelan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it is impossible to read the plain language of as excluding benefits which are terminable outside of bankruptcy because,as we have explained,they are plainly payments to any entity or person under any plan,fund,or program.
furthermore,a statute is not ambiguous simply because it is broad.in employing intentionally broad language,congress avoids the necessity of spelling out in advance every contingency to which a statute could apply.in re philadelphia newspapers,at.by using the word any three separate times,congress ensured that the statute would apply to all benefits,absent the few exceptions directly addressed,without its having to itemize that entire universe of benefits.we are,therefore,unpersuaded by the suggestion that failure to specifically address benefits that could be unilaterally terminated outside of bankruptcy somehow breathes ambiguity into the word any.the breadth of the statute language requires that it be universally applied absent the few exceptions included in the text it does not create a license to disregard the statute plain language.
visteon relies upon in re chateaugay in arguing that the phrase under any plan,fund,or program makes ambiguous in these circumstances,because it compels judicial consideration of the plan under which benefits are provided.otherwise,according to visteon,it would be impossible to determine which benefits,if any,are due.the court in chateaugay addressed the distinct but related issue of whether the rbbpa interim required a debtor to continue paying retiree benefits during bankruptcy even after expiration of the applicable cba.the court concluded that the debtor was free to terminate benefits without complying with.it reasoned 
the act expressly states that the trustee in bankruptcy must continue to pay benefits to retired former employees under a plan,fund,or program maintained or established by the debtor prior to filing a petition for bankruptcy.thus,we must analyze the plan,fund,or program maintained or established by ltv before it filed for bankruptcy in order to determine the trustee obligation to ltv retired former employees.
at.since the debtor there was not obligated to continue paying benefits upon expiration of the cba,the court reasoned that no further payments were necessary.
however,as the dissent in chateaugay pointed out,the second circuit majority analysis failed to remain faithful to the plain language of the provision the court was interpreting.the majority concluded that the statute only mandated continuation of payments the debtor was required to make under a plan,as opposed to simply payments being made under a plan.this is not what the statute said.congress did not use the word required,nor did it use the word obligations.rather,as we have explained,congress mandated that the debtor continue to pay benefits under a plan,fund,or program maintained or established by the debtor prior to filing a petition.the expiration of the agreement to provide benefits did not alter the fact that those benefits were provided under a plan that was in effect when the petition was filed.interpreting this language in light of the legislative history,the chateaugay dissent concluded that the measure required continuation of all retiree health benefits in effect immediately prior to bankruptcy,including those retiree benefits provided pursuant to a cba that expires during the course of the bankruptcy proceeding.at.
to the extent that chateaugay is relevant to our analysis,we find judge restani cogent and dissent more persuasive,and far more faithful to the statutory text than the analysis of that court majority.however,the issue before the court in chateaugay differed from the one before us,and whatever the merits of visteon argument in that context,it plainly fails here 
given the importance of the text,it is worth reiterating that e requires that a trustee shall timely pay and shall not modify any retiree benefits.e.retiree benefits are defined as payments to any entity or person under any plan,fund,or program maintained or established in whole or in part by the debtor prior to filing a petition.a.payments made during bankruptcy under a plan that is terminable at will are unambiguously retiree benefits under this definition.the fact that the debtor could have unilaterally stopped the payments had it not been in chapter is therefore irrelevant.once a bankruptcy petition is filed,e takes effect,and the trustee must timely pay and not modify any retiree benefits except through the procedure benefit payments pursuant to a terminable at will plan in effect when the petition is filed thus continue to be for the pendency of the proceeding under any plan,fund,or program.
it is also argued that becomes ambiguous when read in conjunction with its counterpart a.as we have noted,the latter provision was also enacted as part of the rbbpa.it is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that a statute is to be read as a whole.leckey stefano,cir internal quotation marks omitted.reading in conjunction with a,however,merely reinforces our conclusion that limits visteon ability to modify or terminate any retiree benefits.
section a specifies that in order to emerge from bankruptcy,the debtor reorganization plan must provide for 
the continuation after its effective date of payment of all retiree benefits,as that term is defined in section of this title,at the level established pursuant to subsection e b or g of section of this title,at any time prior to confirmation of the plan,for the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits.
a.ambiguity is purportedly ushered in through the phrase,for the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits.as we have explained,contains no limitation based on the debtor obligation to provide benefits,yet a clearly does.courts,assuming that congress intended the two provisions to be identical in scope,have accordingly found ambiguity when considering them together.in in re new valley,for example,the court acknowledged that the language of section,particularly the phrase any retiree benefits appears to embrace all retiree benefit plans in its modification procedures.wl,at.however,because it read a as appear ing to limit the application of section to retiree benefits which the debtor has obligated itself to pay,presumably pursuant to prior contractual agreement,the court concluded that the statutory scheme was not clear,at.it looked beyond the plain language of the statute to ascertain the meaning of.
the union advocates a quite different interpretation of a,which it contends avoids creating ambiguity in.it posits that the clause,for the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits,refers solely to those obligations that a debtor takes on during the process,and not to any obligations.according to the union,a 
does not come into play until the process has been completed and a chapter debtor has obligated itself to continue retiree benefits for some period of time in the course of a process.section a merely ensures that retirees who exit the process having secured a promise from the debtor that their retiree benefits will continue for a period of time do in fact receive the benefit of their bargain in the chapter plan upon its confirmation.
appellant br.
although we agree that a does not create ambiguity in the statutory scheme,we are not persuaded by the union interpretation of the provision for two reasons.first,the syntax of the section is inconsistent with the union argument that a obligations arise solely from.section a requires the continuation of the payment of retiree benefits,at the level established through the process,for the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits.a.the continuation of payments is accordingly to be in accordance with two separate clauses.the first,at the level established through the process clearly states that the level of benefits is the level agreed upon,or ordered by the court,pursuant to.the second,for the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits,contains no such reference to.had congress intended to refer to a duration or obligation arising from the process,it would have said so.it would have required the continuation of retiree benefits at the level,and for the duration,established pursuant to.
secondly,the union reading is incompatible with how operates in practice.section permits modification of retiree benefits either by agreement between the debtor and the authorized representative,or,if agreement can not be reached,through court order.in those instances in which agreement is reached,any duration agreed upon could be described as the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits.however,where the court has ordered modification,it makes no sense to refer to the duration as something to which the debtor has obligated itself.
we think the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits plainly encompasses any durational obligations,including those arising outside of the bankruptcy context.of course,such obligations could be modified by agreement during the process.in re am.royalties,at section a requires the plan to provide for continued payment of retiree benefits according to the contract or the modifications made under.however,the process may not yield agreement on durational obligations,either because no agreement is reached at all and modification is,or because the agreement reached addresses only level of benefits and not duration.in such cases,the sole source of durational obligations is the underlying contractual agreements,and if the debtor has no obligations under those agreements,as is the case here,a does not require continuation of benefit payments upon the debtor emergence from bankruptcy.
contrary to the court reasoning in in re new valley,however,we do not believe that congress intended the plain language of a to limit the reach or operation of.rather,the difference in the plain language of these two provisions compels the opposite conclusion.
a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that where a section of a statute does not include a specific term or phrase used elsewhere in the statute,the drafters did not wish such a requirement to apply.united states mobley,cir see also bfp resolution trust,i t is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposefully when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.by including for the duration of the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits in a,congress requires debtors emerging from bankruptcy to continue to provide benefits only if they are otherwise obligated to.so long as they do not take on new durational obligations during the process,debtors emerge from chapter as free to terminate benefits as they would have been had they never entered chapter.
in sharp contrast,requires the continuation of all retiree benefits without limitation to the period the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits.we must assume that this omission was purposeful.as professor susan stabile explains in her thorough discussion of,when congress wanted to limit a company responsibility for retiree benefits,it explicitly did so the omission of a explicit language in section provisions indicates that congress did not implicitly intend to adopt the same contractual,durational limit in that context.susan stabile,protecting retiree medical benefits in bankruptcy the scope of section of the bankruptcy code,cardozo,hereinafter the scope of section.therefore,during the limited period of the bankruptcy proceeding,we conclude that congress intended to do exactly what it said,require the debtor to continue and not modify any retiree benefits,even if it would not otherwise be obligated to continue them 
in interpreting this scheme,we also can not ignore the substantial change in debtors rights enacted in through the amendment of to include subsection l.see bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,stat.codified at l.subsection l provides 
i f the debtor,during the period ending on the date of the filing of the petition modified retiree benefits and was insolvent on the date such benefits were modified the court shall issue an order reinstating as of the date the modification was made,such benefits as in effect immediately before such date unless the court finds that the balance of the equities clearly favors such modification.
subsection l prevents an insolvent debtor from terminating retiree benefits in the period before filing for bankruptcy.like the rest of,this subsection contains no limitation based on whether the debtor has obligated itself to continue providing these benefits.additionally,though,l would be virtually meaningless if it did not apply to those benefits the debtor could unilaterally terminate or modify.outside of the bankruptcy context,an employer is already prohibited by various laws,including erisa,the relations act of,codified in various sections of,and basic principles of contract law,from modifying those benefits it is obligated to provide.subsection l therefore has meaning only if it adds something new,namely,the protection of benefits a debtor could otherwise terminate at will.
subsection l therefore provides additional evidence of the coherence of the statutory scheme congress has created here.many of the cases relied on by appellees to support their contention that can not apply to terminable at will benefits were decided before this amendment,and therefore the courts issuing them did not have the benefit of this added evidence of congressional intent.although we think that the language of was always unambiguous,this subsection certainly reinforces our view of the text.see collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.l ending some support to the minority view that applies to benefits which are terminable at will,is the addition of new subsection l to section limiting a company ability to modify retiree benefits during the period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.
we realize,as visteon correctly argues,that the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york in in re delphi recently considered and rejected the argument that the amendment of undermines the majority view that the provision does not apply if benefits are terminable at will.however,the reasoning in in re delphi is unpersuasive because the court analysis is not faithful to the plain language rule that it purports to,and must,apply.
although the delphi court stated that t he starting point for this analysis is the language of the statute,the court did not actually begin its analysis with the statutory text.in re delphi,wl,at.instead,it immediately turned to case law and to a consideration of fundamental principles underlying the bankruptcy code.id.based on those principles,it concluded that the provision language does not compel the interpretation that applies to those benefits which could be terminated unilaterally outside of the bankruptcy context.id.later,the court addressed subsection l.it stated 
section l does not specifically deal with the issue of plans modifiable as of right and could conceivably apply to breaches by debtors in financial distress of vested rights.more importantly,even if it does also apply to modifiable plans,i do not view section l,which applies to a specific type of prepetition action,as overruling doskocil and the line of cases that follow it,which apply to postpetition actions,nor does there appear to me to be any legislative history or other policy statement that would clearly set forth congress intention generally in section l to override,beyond its specific terms,the fundamental principle that bankruptcy does not give new rights to individual parties in interest 
this analysis exemplifies a fundamental flaw of many of the cases which have failed to afford its plain meaning.rather than beginning with the language of a or e,and the language of the related provisions of l or a,the delphi court began with its own assumptions of why could not prohibit a debtor from doing in bankruptcy what it could do outside of bankruptcy.it then found statutory language,such as subsection l,insufficiently persuasive to alter its view of what would be an appropriate result under chapter.statutory interpretation should be made of sterner stuff than that.the language congress chose when crafting a statute must be considered first and foremost,and if plain and unambiguous,it must be credited,except in rare and exceptional circumstances.rubin united states,internal quotation marks omitted.
appellees argue that this is such a rare and exceptional circumstance.we do not look past the plain meaning unless it produces a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters or an outcome so bizarre that congress could not have intended it.mitchell horn,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.appellees argue both legislative history and absurdity.we find neither a convincing reason to disregard the plain language of the statute.
legislative history 
appellees argue that the rbbpa legislative history is inconsistent with our interpretation of.they rely on certain legislators statements that would prevent debtors from reneging on their promises or their legal and contractual obligations.see visteon br.listing examples of such statements.seizing on these snippets of legislative history,appellees contend that congress did not intend to apply in the absence of such promises or obligations.the majority in chateaugay focused on these same statements to buttress their conclusion that did not apply following expiration of the cba requiring payment.see chateaugay,at as numerous legislators noted,the act was created to insure that promises made to employees during their working years are not broken during their retirement years.quoting cong.rec.daily ed,statement by frost.
o nly the most extraordinary showing of contrary intentions in the legislative history will justify a departure from the unambiguous plain language of a statute.united states albertini,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the statements cited by visteon fall woefully short of such an extraordinary showing of contrary intentions.id.it is uncontested that applies to benefits that a debtor is legally or contractually obligated to provide.therefore,it is not the least bit surprising that the legislative history reflects concerns about a debtor legal and contractual obligations.this does not advance our inquiry very far.we must determine if applies only to such benefits,despite plain language to the contrary.neither visteon nor the unsecured creditors are able to point to a single statement anywhere in the legislative history suggesting that the safeguards of are triggered only in those instances where the debtor is legally or contractually obligated to provide benefits 
in fact,the legislative history contains numerous references to a much broader congressional concern.no doubt because they were reacting to ltv termination of benefits,legislators discussed the legitimate expectations of retirees,and the necessity in a just society of giving effect to those expectations whenever possible.representative fish stated t hese retiree benefits,in my judgment,should receive special bankruptcy code protection because a just society has an interest in trying to effectuate the legitimate expectations of former vulnerable retirees may suffer enormously from benefit terminations.cong.rec.daily ed.may,statement of fish emphasis added.similarly,representative feighan said 
under current law,retirees of bankrupt corporations often find their legitimate expectations of health and life insurance coverage the very company for whom they worked all their lives.those who build a company deserve better.they have earned the right to be treated fairly and compassionately this bill would clarify the bankruptcy code to end the current unfairness.

moreover,we do not believe that those legislators who spoke of legitimate expectations were referring only to vested benefits or benefits provided under an unexpired cba.as representative edwards explained,congress thought it imperative that it protect the retirees from the sudden and unilateral termination of their health,life,and disability benefits because r etirees who have devoted their working lives to the betterment of their employers businesses deserve payment of their retiree health benefits to the fullest extent possible in a reorganization.id.statement of edwards emphasis added.
we also think the statements of senator metzenbaum,the senate sponsor of the rbbpa,merit serious attention.in discussing the scope of the legislation,he described a legislative intent directly at odds with the majority construction of the statute in chateaugay.senator metzenbaum explained that the bill requires a company to continue paying for these retiree benefits even after the termination of a collective bargaining agreement.only if a company can prove a modification is absolutely necessary and that it treats everyone fairly can a court,after a hearing,order any modification.retiree benefits security act of hearings on before the subcomm.on courts and administrative practice of the comm.on the judiciary,sess.hereinafter senate hearings statement of metzenbaum emphasis added.senator metzenbaum also explained the policy concerns underlying the legislation bankruptcies are painful for workers,communities,small business suppliers and others.but the burden of turning a company around should not rest on the backs of retirees.they deserve a fair shake from the companies they build and from the law governing the reorganization process.cong.rec.daily ed.may,statement of metzenbaum emphasis added.all of these remarks speak of a far broader legislative intent than appellees would have us believe 
appellees argument also ignores additional pieces of legislative history that specifically address the scope of.the report drafted to accompany the senate version of the bill,a more authoritative piece of legislative history than statements of individual legislators,explains 
section makes it clear that when a chapter petition is filed retiree benefit payments must be continued without change until and unless a modification is agreed to by the parties or ordered by the court.section e rejects any other basis for trustees to cease or modify retiree benefit payments.
at emphasis added.that report,like the section it references,could hardly be more clear.once a chapter petition is filed,there is only one way to terminate or modify retiree benefits while the debtor remains in chapter,and that is through the procedure established in.again,the fact that the debtor could terminate those same benefits outside of bankruptcy is irrelevant.see also cong.rec.daily ed.may,statement of heflin companies can not unilaterally terminate benefits for retirees when the company files chapter.rather,this bill makes it clear that when a chapter petition is filed,retiree benefit payments must be continued without change,until or unless a modification is agreed to by the parties or ordered by the court.id.statement of metzenbaum t his measure makes absolutely clear that reorganizing companies may never unilaterally cut off retiree insurance benefits.
our analysis of legislative history would be incomplete without further discussion of the underlying events that moved congress to enact the rbbpa.see elliot coal mining office of workers comp.programs,cir a court should look to the mischief and defect that the statute was intended to cure.quoting heydon case,eng.ex.
here,there is no question that congress enacted the rbbpa to respond to the harm and outrage following ltv corporation termination of the benefits of retirees without notice during its bankruptcy.as one legislator explained 
t he vulnerability of retiree benefits was exposed when ltv unilaterally terminated the health and life insurance benefits of tens of thousands of retirees across the country.public outrage followed causing ltv to restore the benefits,but the ensuing fear and mistrust made it obvious that a legislative response was necessary.congress needed to ensure workers that a unilateral termination would never occur again.
cong.rec.daily ed.may,statement by oakar.
in attempting to craft an appropriate legislative response to ltv bankruptcy,congress heard testimony about the effect of ltv bankruptcy on its retirees,see generally ltv bankruptcy hearing before the comm.on the judiciary,sess.hereinafter ltv bankruptcy,as well as about the broader causes of retiree benefit insecurity,see generally promise.congress was aware that among the retirees affected by ltv actions were persons who received their insurance benefits pursuant to collective bargaining agreements,and those who received those benefits pursuant to bargained plans,at.congress accordingly was fully committed to ensuring that both union and employees would be equally protected by the rbbpa.see,cong.rec.statement of metzenbaum the provisions of the rbbpa apply to union and nonunion retirees.ltv bankruptcy at statement of metzenbaum w e will make every effort at the legislative level to protect the rights of the salaried employees just as we will make an effort to protect the rights of the employees who have the collective bargaining agreement.importantly,congress also heard testimony that since retiree benefits were increasingly unvested,see promise at,soon the only benefits employers would not be able to unilaterally terminate outside of bankruptcy were those covered by a current contractual agreement,such as a cba,id.at.congress was therefore aware that debtors would almost always have an right to unilaterally terminate the benefits of employees.
if we were to credit appellees interpretation of and remove from its protections those benefits that could be unilaterally terminated outside of bankruptcy,the provision would almost never protect employees.as congress knew,a ny debtors,more than be able to point to language giving them the right to unilaterally terminate the programs.in re farmland,at.appellees reading therefore eviscerate s the statute,making it essentially only apply to collective bargaining agreements or other programs,and the legislative history makes it clear that such limitations were not intended.id.
appellees also cite to subsequent legislative history in support of their argument that does not apply to benefits that could be unilaterally terminated outside of bankruptcy.in,bills were introduced in both houses of congress which would have added a clause stating that protections apply whether or not the debtor asserts a right to unilaterally modify such payments under such plan,fund,or program,cong.see also,cong.neither bill was enacted into law.appellees insist that congress consideration and rejection of these amendments indicates both that does not apply to benefits that are terminable at will,and that congress concluded that extending protection to such benefits was unwise.
we are unpersuaded.evidence of congressional inaction is generally entitled to minimal weight in the interpretive process.this is especially true where congress enacts a statute as clear as this one.in pension benefit guaranty ltv,u,a case which also arose in the wake of ltv bankruptcy,the supreme court addressed whether the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc could base a decision to order an employer to restore a pension plan on the employer creation of plans,which the pbgc believed improperly exploited the agency.ltv relied in part upon the fact that congress had considered,but not enacted,an amendment that would have expressly authorized the pbgc to prohibit plans.because congress rejected the amendment,ltv argued that the court should infer that congress did not want the agency to have this authority.the court was not convinced.it explained that 
subsequent legislative history is a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier congress it is a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute when it concerns,as it does here,a proposal that does not become law congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction including the inference that the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted emphasis added.
here,too,we think the best inference to be drawn from the subsequent legislative history relied on by appellees is that congress chose not to act because the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change.id.
as we have discussed,a court must give effect to a statute unambiguous plain language unless it produces a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters or an outcome so bizarre that congress could not have intended it.mitchell,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also holy trinity church united states,if a literal construction of the words of a statute be absurd,the act must be so construed as to avoid the absurdity.the court must restrain the words.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.having concluded that is unambiguous and certainly not demonstrably at odds with indications of congressional intent in the statute legislative history,we are left with appellees final argument that interpreting to give retirees more rights under chapter than they would have outside of bankruptcy is so absurd,notwithstanding the plain language of the statute and all the indications of congressional intent discussed above,that congress simply could not have intended the result.this argument reflects a major source of confusion about,and we believe it is the primary reason that courts have failed to give effect to the statute as written.accordingly,although we find the argument meritless,we address it with particular care.
appellees begin by emphasizing that our reading of is contrary to the fundamental bankruptcy principle that prepetition contract rights and property interests should not be analyzed differently or enhanced simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy case.visteon br.quoting in re delphi,wl,at.however,as the supreme court explained in butner united states,t he constitutional authority of congress to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states would clearly encompass a federal statute modifying underlying property rights for the purposes of bankruptcy,quoting,art.i,cl.thus,although property interests are usually defined by law,a federal interest may require a different result.id.at.
section unambiguously states that federal bankruptcy law compels a different result here,yet courts have refused to allow that result.for example,the bankruptcy court reasoned,can not modify existing law absen t some specific bankruptcy reason and there is none here in connection with the issue of retiree benefits.consistent with that court conclusion,appellees argue that it would be absurd to impose restrictions on the modification of benefits in bankruptcy that erisa ensures will not be imposed outside of bankruptcy.as a threshold matter,we point out that this argument sets far too low a bar for absurdity.see terlingo,at courts may look behind a statute only when the plain meaning produces a result that is not just unwise but is clearly absurd.internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,as we will now explain,it is also based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the context in which the rbbpa was enacted,as well as the practical realities surrounding an employer provision of benefits to its retirees.
we begin with a brief discussion of how retiree benefits are treated under erisa.erisa was enacted to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans,shaw delta air lines,and to protect contractually defined benefits.mut.life ins.russell.although erisa contains elaborate vesting requirements for pension plans,it does not mandate vesting of welfare benefit plans,such as those providing retiree health and life insurance benefits.see in re unisys.retiree med.benefit erisa,cir unisys ii.this was not merely an oversight on the part of congress.uaw skinner engine,cir.congress did not impose vesting requirements on welfare benefit plans because 
it determined that t o require the vesting of those ancillary benefits would seriously complicate the administration and increase the cost of plans whose primary function is to provide retirement income in rejecting the automatic vesting of welfare plans,congress evidenced its recognition of the need for flexibility with regard to an employer right to change medical plans.
unisys ii,at alteration in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted.congress believed that imposing strict requirements on these benefits and thereby denying employers their valued flexibility would result in employers choosing not to provide the benefits at all.employers are for this reason generally free for any reason at any time,to adopt,modify,or terminate welfare plans.schoonejongen.
in light of the policy concerns underlying erisa,appellees argue that it is nonsensical to protect during bankruptcy what congress purposefully refused to protect otherwise.that argument,however,is premised on the false assumption that the congress that enacted the rbbpa was content with the fallout from the policy decisions embedded in erisa.the legislative history of the establishes the many of its drafters were deeply troubled by the social problems that had resulted from the exclusion of retiree welfare benefits from erisa protections.
as we have noted,ltv termination of retiree benefits prompted congress to study not only the treatment of retiree benefits during bankruptcy,but for the first time after enacting erisa,to evaluate the sufficiency of retiree benefit protections more broadly.see generally promise.the consensus of many who testified before congress was that retiree health benefits were unacceptably vulnerable because retirees,unlike working employees,were often entirely dependent on these benefits,and yet the law failed to ensure that they vested at retirement.although federal common law under erisa was then more protective of retiree benefits than it is now,the emerging judicial view at that time was that retiree benefits would vest at retirement,unless the employer clearly indicated a contrary intent see,id.at.employers,armed with this knowledge,were including reservation of rights clauses in virtually all new plans.see,id.at testimony of willis goldbeck,washington business group on health n o new plans are being written without very explicit authority to alter or terminate.accordingly,most retiree benefits,at least for retirees,would soon be entirely without protection,susceptible to termination not only during a bankruptcy,but whenever an employer simply amends the plan.id.at.
some legislators thus concluded that the problem that must be remedied was not just bankruptcy law but erisa itself.see,id.at statement of dodd with the enactment of erisa in,the government for the first time rightly assumed a role in guaranteeing pension rights in the private sector.it may be time to consider extending similar protections to earned health benefits.although some continued to be wary about extending the full panoply of erisa protections to retiree benefits,see,id.at statement of heinz t he simple solution would be for the congress to step in,as we did years ago with pensions,and make these benefits permanent at retirement,but we also need to recognize the chilling effect this would have on the employer willingness even to offer these benefits,there was still significant support for extending at least some erisa protections to the retiree welfare benefit context,see,id.at statement of glenn expressing support for minimum funding requirements for retiree health insurance plans see also id.at staff report recommending additional protections for all retiree benefits,including funding and notification requirements,and explor ation of a permanent means for protecting unfunded retiree health benefits in full.
ultimately,the rbbpa addressed retiree benefits only during bankruptcy.nonetheless,the senate report indicates that congressional concern continued to extend further.the report discusses generally the hardship imposed on elderly recipients when such benefits are suddenly curtailed,at.however,it explains,this bill addresses the needs of retirees within the context of the traditional structure of the bankruptcy code.the broader issues associated with retiree benefits remain to be addressed by other committees of appropriate jurisdiction.id.
to the extent that some courts have been unable to understand why congress would protect certain retiree benefits during bankruptcy,but not otherwise,the short answer may be that the rbbpa,like many legislative enactments,was an imperfect compromise.whether the statute was the best protection that could be agreed upon,or whether it was intended only as a first step,the rbbpa is the that became law.that it is a partial solution to congressional concerns in no way converts it into an absurdity.virtually all laws would be absurd if judged by whether they accomplish a perfect solution to an underlying legislative concern.
moreover,since many members of congress were deeply upset at the prospect of employers terminating benefits during retirement,but were either unable or unwilling to require vesting,there is a compelling logic to protecting these benefits solely during benefits are highly vulnerable,and limited protections can have a significant impact.
as the union explained at oral argument,employers do not offer retiree benefits solely to be charitable.under normal conditions,retiree benefits benefit the employer as well as the retiree.retiree benefits are often a form of deferred compensation through their provision,an employer is able to secure work now,and pay for it only fully in the future.furthermore,these benefits boost morale and help an employer retain qualified employees.contrary,during good times,market forces do much to restrain an employer from exercising any retained right to terminate benefits.
the same is not true during bad times.it is then that retiree benefits are most at risk.of course,one of the purposes underlying erisa is to allow employers flexibility to terminate benefits when they feel it prudent to do so,as they presumably might during an economic downturn.a chapter reorganization is unique,however,because a reorganizing company avails itself of the statutory privilege of bankruptcy in order to transition to greater viability.a reorganizing company hopes to emerge and be profitable,at which point the provision of retiree benefits might again inure to its benefit.during the reorganization process itself,though,the debtor faces intense pressure both internally and externally to relieve itself of all perceived liabilities,even those it might otherwise be inclined to keep.see ltv bankruptcy at testimony of richard trumka,national president of the united mineworkers of america ltv says it is under enormous pressure from its creditors,banks,and vendors.senate hearings at statement of heinz making matters worse in bankruptcy is that the banks and in some cases the active workers may agree that retiree benefits are some kind of an albatross.
thus,as professor stabile thoughtfully explains,bankruptcy distorts the normal process 
outside of bankruptcy,employers evaluate changes in employee benefit plans in terms of their impact on overall human resource objectives as well as financial objectives decisions about a particular benefit are made within the broad context of an employer total compensation and benefits package.that overall framework is missing in a chapter case,where a debtor faces pressures that distort planning and decisions.in chapter,the debtor effectively does not act as a sole.a strong creditors committee or even a particularly large individual creditor plays a large role in the debtor.within the confines of a bankruptcy proceeding,there is thus a desire to temporarily freeze the status quo regarding benefits,and to allow modification of those benefits only in a supervised manner that attempts to resolve the competing interests of retirees,debtors,and creditors.
stabile,the scope of section at.
against this backdrop,can be seen as affording additional protection to retiree benefits just as legal and economic pressures converge to encourage a debtor to terminate benefits based on considerations with insufficient regard for consequences to retirees or to the debtor itself.protecting these benefits during a chapter reorganization is thus a measured.
moreover,courts that have concluded it is absurd to apply to benefits that could be terminated outside of bankruptcy have often misinterpreted the rigidity of the section protections,and therefore the extent to which the statute is in tension with erisa.section does not prohibit the termination of benefits during a bankruptcy proceeding.rather,it creates an equitable procedure through which the debtor can argue the economic necessity of doing so,and the retirees can counter with their own arguments about economics,fairness,and equity.the specter of this process may,by itself,foster an agreement about continuing or modifying retiree benefits that would otherwise be impossible to reach.however,if no agreement is reached,a court can,and in fact must,order modification or termination of benefits if doing so is necessary to the reorganization,fair to all affected,and clearly favored by the equities.this is a high standard to reach,but that is consistent with the belief that reorganization should not take place,if at all possible,on the backs of retired workers.cong.rec.daily ed.may,statement of metzenbaum.importantly,though,in its weighing of the equities,a court will undoubtedly consider whether the debtor has reserved the right to unilaterally terminate benefits.it would not be the beginning and the end of the court inquiry,and the court would have to decide how much weight to give that factor in light of all the other equities.still,a debtor legal rights under erisa are not irrelevant during the process.
additionally,it must be remembered that protections terminate upon plan confirmation,when the distorting pressures discussed above recede.thus,contrary to the court conclusion in in re am.royalties,at construing a as vest ing benefits after reorganization,a does not vest benefits.as we have explained,upon emergence from bankruptcy,a ensures that a debtor who reserved the right to terminate retiree benefits has no ongoing obligation,other than one that may have been voluntarily undertaken during the process,to continue to provide benefits.
therefore,is neither entirely nor permanently in derogation of underlying contractual rights.for the most part,all guarantees retirees is a voice,and some minimal amount of leverage,in a process that could otherwise be nothing short of devastating to them and to their families and communities as one legislator explained t his legislation will not guarantee continuation of these benefits,but it will provide a mechanism that will allow the retirees position to be heard.cong.rec.see also cong.rec.daily ed.may,statement of heinz while chapter reorganization work ed to protect the interests of the major,and usually secured,creditors,it left the retirees totally exposed to catastrophic medical losses while bankruptcy lawyers bickered over the reorganization plan.the retirees had no way to make their concerns known to the court during bankruptcy.we therefore reject visteon characterization of as a hammer.it is much more accurately characterized as a microphone,intended to elevate the voices of those who would otherwise not be heard above the din of more powerful creditors carving up the pie of the bankruptcy estate.
appellees attempt to argue that our interpretation of results in the statute being the only provision of the bankruptcy code that improves upon a creditor rights in bankruptcy the union does not counter that assertion assuming,arguendo,that the statutory scheme of is unique,this result is certainly not absurd given congress concerns.the rbbpa legislative history is replete with references to the unique nature of retiree benefits in a bankruptcy proceeding,and it is therefore not surprising that congress would afford them unique protections.as the senate report noted t he special treatment accorded retiree benefit payments is appropriate because of the hardship imposed on elderly recipients when such benefits are suddenly curtailed,at.senator heinz reasoned that special protection was necessary to ensure equality of treatment retirees do start out on a n equal footing with other creditors this bill protects retirees from the kinds of risks no other creditors face.hearings at statement of heinz.the court in in re farmland,thus found it unremarkable that retirees were uniquely protected in bankruptcy 
congress doubtlessly recognized that retirees as a class are unique in a bankruptcy proceeding and that they are deserving of special protection as a general rule,retirees are particularly vulnerable when their former employer goes bankrupt,because of their ages,their reduced incomes,and their inability to replace the benefits that are being terminated.unlike business and trade creditors,retirees are unable to set aside reserves for possible losses or to pass along their losses to other customers all of these suggest a sound basis and rationale for congress according special protections to retirees who are caught up in a chapter proceeding.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that the rule of statutory construction allowing a court to ignore the plain language of a statute when literal interpretation results in absurdity is entirely inapplicable here.far from being absurd,a literal interpretation of reveals a remedial and equitable statutory scheme that,consistent with congress concerns when enacting the rbbpa,attempts to prevent the human dimension of terminating retiree benefits from being obscured by the business of bankruptcy.if the limited role of federal courts in a democratic society is to mean anything,the doctrine of absurdity must not be employed merely because interpreting a statute as enacted yields a result that is contrary to a judge personal beliefs about how things should be.
the text of is plain in meaning and breadth.its wisdom is not for us to decide.we need not,and should not,be concerned with whether retiree benefits should be extended greater protection during bankruptcy than otherwise that is a job for congress.we need only give effect to the law congress has enacted.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we will reverse the district court order that affirmed the bankruptcy court order permitting visteon to terminate provision of retiree health and life insurance benefits without complying with.
the union also argues that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that visteon has the right to unilaterally terminate these benefits under the relevant plan documents and collective bargaining agreements.because we conclude that applies regardless of whether visteon has such a right outside of bankruptcy,we need not reach this question.for the purposes of our opinion,we assume,arguendo,that visteon could unilaterally terminate these benefits if it were not in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding.
the last cbas at each plant included commitments by visteon to provide retiree benefits.see.these express written commitments were not continued after the plants were closed.
section b provides that the bankruptcy trustee after notice and a hearing,may use,sell,or lease,other than in the ordinary course of business,property of the estate.b.this provision is in contrast to transactions that are in the ordinary course of business under subsection c of,which do not require notice and a hearing.see.c.
the bankruptcy court granted visteon motion to terminate all retiree benefits,except for those promised or provided to present and former employees at visteon north penn plant,pursuant to a cba that had not yet expired.see.the court made clear,however,that once the cba did expire,visteon could terminate those benefits as well.see.
as of august,approximately forty percent of the connersville and bedford retirees were not yet eligible for medicare.see.
a visteon benefits administrator submitted a declaration to the bankruptcy court explaining that a stay which required visteon to provide insurance through its original benefit plans,rather than through the cobra plans it was poised to put into effect,could not be effectuated by the health insurance companies for approximately three months,and during that time,no one,including those retirees who had elected cobra coverage,would be covered.see.
on april,we granted the union motion to expedite the appeal,but denied the motion to continue the stay.the stay granted by the district court expired april.
the cost of cobra coverage for those retirees who submitted declarations to the bankruptcy court ranges from to a month,constituting to percent of the retirees monthly incomes.see.many of these retirees and their family members suffer from extremely serious medical conditions,including cancer,diabetes,heart disease,muscular dystrophy,fibromyalgia,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,and schizophrenia.see id.
congress enacted and twice renewed legislation to ensure that ltv continued to pay its retiree benefits while congress debated the problem.see.tit.vi a notwithstanding any provision of chapter of title,united states code,the trustee shall pay benefits until may,to retired former employees under a plan,fund,or program maintained or established by the debtor prior to filing a petition through the purchase of insurance or otherwise for the purpose of providing medical,surgical,or hospital care benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,or death.extending requirement to pay benefits to september.extending requirement to pay benefits to october.finally,in,it enacted the rbbpa,which itself contained an interim measure extending the protections to certain cases already proceeding in bankruptcy.the rest of the rbbpa,codified at and a,applies to bankruptcy proceedings commenced after its enactment.
a trustee is defined for the purposes of to include a debtor in possession,and therefore includes visteon here.see e.
a labor organization shall be the authorized representative of those persons receiving any retiree benefit
