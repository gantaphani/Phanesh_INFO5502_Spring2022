dennis sperandeo brought this action under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.he sought an award of disability payments under erisa,a b,seeking disability income benefits from lorillard tobacco company,lorillard group disability income insurance policy,underwritten by continental casualty company,also known as cna cna.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plan administrator cna.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
sperandeo began working at lorillard as a sales representative in september.on may,he was involved in an automobile accident while he was delivering boxes of tobacco to one of lorillard customers.as a result of this collision,he suffered injuries to his head and shoulder.the hospital records from the day of the accident indicate that sperandeo suffered a concussion and a shoulder sprain,at.the extent of those injuries,as well as their lasting effects on sperandeo,are disputed.
since the accident,sperandeo has been treated by a number of physicians and has undergone physical therapy.on august,he underwent left rotator cuff and acromioplasty surgery performed by david zoellick.on october,he underwent a second rotator cuff reconstructive surgery performed by jeffery visotsky.sperandeo also was treated by a neurologist,glen glista,and by an,dennis moore.additionally,he was examined by several other neurological specialists.with the exception of two days in january,sperandeo has not returned to work at lorillard.
at all times relevant to this litigation,sperandeo was covered by lorillard group disability income insurance policy,which is underwritten and administered by cna.the plan qualifies as a defined welfare benefit plan under erisa.the certificate of insurance issued by cna contains the following language defining disability 
how do we define disability 
disability or disabled means that you the lorillard employee to whom the certificate was issued satisfy the occupation qualifier or the earnings qualifier as defined below.
occupation qualifier 
disability means that during the elimination period and the following months,injury or sickness causes physical or mental impairment to such a degree of severity that you are 
continuously unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation and 
not gainfully employed.
at,emphasis omitted.material and substantial duties of employment are defined to mean the necessary functions of your regular occupation which can not be reasonably omitted or altered.id.at emphasis omitted.
on july,sperandeo filed a claim with lorillard for long term disability benefits under the plan lorillard submitted sperandeo claim to cna for review.the claim was accompanied by a number of medical records submitted by sperandeo and a physical demands analysis pda completed by lorillard.the pda detailed the primary duties of the job of sales representative,which included driving to and from clients businesses,rotating and checking clients inventories of cigarettes,assembling display units and data entry.the pda outlined the physical demands of accomplishing these duties.they included bending,twisting,and lifting products weighing from two pounds for one carton of cigarettes to pounds for a whole case.
cna employees reviewed sperandeo medical records and interviewed him regarding his symptoms and limitations.on october,cna denied sperandeo claim for benefits.cna informed sperandeo that the medical evidence did not support functional impairments from either a physical or standpoint that would continuously preclude him from performing the substantial and material duties of a sales representative,at.
sperandeo appealed this decision and supplied cna with additional medical records.on january,the appeals committee notified him that it had upheld the denial of benefits.see id.at.sperandeo then brought this action against cna and lorillard under erisa,a b,seeking an award of disability income benefits under the plan.
district court proceedings 
in ruling on cna motion for summary judgment,the district court first decided that the appropriate standard for its review of cna determination was de novo.in reaching that conclusion,it articulated the rule set forth by the supreme court in firestone tire and rubber bruch,d.under that rule,a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone,at.the district court noted that the language granting discretionary authority to cna only was found in the summary plan description spd and the certificate of insurance certificate,not in the policy itself.cna had contended that the discretionary language in the certificate should be considered part of the policy or,in the alternative,that it was incorporated into the policy.the district court rejected both submissions.the court noted that the certificate explicitly states that the certificate is not part of the policy similarly,the spd states that it is not part of the plan.the court further noted that the policy,while discussing the contents of the certificate,did not incorporate the certificate into the policy.at.the district court then reasoned that,because the discretionary language was not part of the policy,it was not part of the plan.accordingly,the court followed the rule announced in firestone and concluded that de novo review was appropriate.
the district court then turned to the merits of the summary judgment motion.it determined that cna was correct in denying sperandeo disability benefits based on his shoulder injury.in the court view,the pda established that a sales representative primary material and substantial duties are driving,walking,sitting,and standing,and there was no medical evidence that sperandeo shoulder injury impair ed his ability to perform these tasks.at.the court also noted that the pda indicated that a sales representative must lift cases of cigarettes from floor to ceiling five times per day.id.at.the court recognized that sperandeo had a permanent lifting restriction of pounds,and that some of the cases of cigarettes would weigh as much as pounds.id.however,the court noted that the typical weight of a case was pounds and that without any evidence of how often a case is over pounds,and thus over sperandeo limit,the activity of lifting over pounds can not be considered to be a substantial duty.id.
the court also concluded that cna decision to deny benefits based on sperandeo neurological condition was correct.the court observed that sperandeo did provide evidence that he suffered from post concussive syndrome,but,continued the court,the evidence did not support the conclusion that it made him continuously unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his job.id.emphasis in original.the court supported this conclusion by noting that sperandeo had completed a driving test that showed he could drive without limitations and that several neurologists and a psychologist believed that sperandeo could return to work.the court further noted that christopher randolph,an examining physician,had opined that sperandeo was exaggerating his symptoms and exerting little effort on his diagnostic tests.id.although a treating physician,gerald lewis,did opine that sperandeo should not return to work,the court stated that this opinion was contrary to the driving test results and not supported by the other medical opinions and evidence presented.id.therefore,the court concluded that sperandeo was not entitled to benefits based on his neurological condition.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.vallone cna fin,cir.
in this appeal,we also must determine whether the district court employed the correct standard of review.cna submits that the district court erred in applying de novo review rather than the arbitrary and capricious standard in reviewing the denial of benefits.as we noted earlier,the supreme court has stated that a denial of benefits is to be reviewed de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone,at.cna has the burden to establish that the language of the plan gives it discretionary authority to award benefits.see gibbs ex rel.estate of gibbs cigna,cir.we have emphasized that the default standard of review is de novo and that,in order to alter this default standard,the stipulation for deferential review must be clear.herzberger standard ins,cir.
as a threshold matter,we must identify the documents that constitute the plan.in other cases,identification of the plan has presented difficult analytical questions.indeed,we have remarked that confusion as to what constitutes the plan for purposes of erisa is all too common.health cost controls of,washington,cir.in this respect,erisa is not particularly helpful in delineating those documents that constitute the plan we,along with other circuits,however,have held that the underlying insurance policy is a plan document for purposes of determining the standard of review.see ruiz cont l cas,cir citing cases see also houston provident life accident ins,cir holding that language granting discretion to the plan administrator found in the insurance policy was sufficient to trigger arbitrary and capricious review.
after reviewing the record on appeal we must conclude that the language of this policy contains no indication that cna is entitled to exercise unfettered discretion in determining whether a lorillard employee is eligible for disability benefits.cna points,however,to language in the certificate to support its view that it enjoys such discretion 
the plan administrator and other plan fiduciaries have discretionary authority to determine your eligibility for and entitlement to benefits under the policy.the plan administrator has delegated sole discretionary authority to continental casualty company to determine your eligibility for benefits and to interpret the terms and provisions of the policy.
at emphasis omitted.notably,however,the certificate further states that t his certificate,however,is not the policy.it is merely evidence of insurance provided under the policy.id.at.therefore,neither the certificate nor the policy contains language incorporating the certificate into the policy.in fact,the opposite is true the certificate is explicitly not part of the policy.
the summary plan description spd also indicates that cna has discretionary authority 
the administrator and other plan fiduciaries have discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan and to determine your eligibility for and entitlement to benefits in accordance with the plan.with respect to making benefit decisions,the plan administrator has delegated sole discretionary authority to continental casualty company to determine your eligibility for and entitlement to benefits under plan and to interpret the terms and provisions of any insurance policy issued in connection with the plan.
id.at.however,the spd also states that it does not constitute a part of the plan,nor of any insurance policy issued in connection with it.id.
on the record before us,then,the basic plan document,the policy,contains no indication that cna,as the plan administrator,has authority to exercise the sort of discretion that would justify the deferential judicial review discussed in firestone and herzberger.two other documents,the certificate and the spd,do contain language conferring discretion on cna,but these two documents are not incorporated by reference into the policy or plan.indeed,the terms of both documents make clear that they are not so incorporated.
this situation is not new to this court.indeed,we recently had occasion to deal with such a situation in schwartz prudential insurance of america,cir.there we determined that a plan administrator can not rely on documents to expand its discretion when the plan itself bestows no such discretion id.at.in schwartz,we noted our agreement with the reasoning of our colleagues on the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit in shaw connecticut general life insurance,cir,and on the court of appeals for the ninth circuit in paul revere life insurance,cir.schwartz,at.but see murphy int l bus.machs,cir assuming without analysis that a grant of discretion in an spd was sufficient,although the court did not describe the remainder of the documents.
schwartz controls our decision today.such a result is also consonant with our concern that any language conferring discretion on plan fiduciaries be clear and unequivocal.see diaz prudential ins.of america,cir.the lack of discretionary language in the policy itself,coupled with explicit language of the certificate and the spd that they are not part of the policy,presents,at the very least,the sort of opaque situation that bars under our case law the application of the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review.
as we emphasized in schwartz,diaz and herzberger,a plan easily can provide for the deferential standard by setting forth in the plan a clear statement that the administrator has the plenary discretionary authority that warrants the application of such a standard of review.we have gone so far as to draft model language to include in the plan.see herzberger,at although we have cautioned that our proposed language does not constitute magic words,and that other articulations of discretionary power would be sufficient to allow for the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,we certainly have given plan administrators the tools to set up a plan that will not be characterized as entitling the applicant for benefits to plenary judicial review of a decision turning him down.id.this plan does not indicate in a clear way to plan participants that cna would review benefits determinations using discretion.cna failed to put such language in the policy,and instead only put such language in documents that were explicitly not part of the policy or the plan.therefore,the district court was correct in determining that de novo review was the proper standard of review for sperandeo denial of benefits.
we therefore must determine de novo whether cna decision to deny benefits to sperandeo was correct.see postma paul revere life ins,cir.in our review of cna denial,we shall apply the definition of disability found in the certificate sperandeo must be continuously unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his regular occupation,at emphasis omitted.material and substantial is defined as the necessary functions of his regular occupation which can not be reasonably omitted or altered.id.at emphasis omitted.
disability based on shoulder injury 
sperandeo argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to cna,thus affirming cna denial of the benefits he sought due to his shoulder injury.he contends that the denial of benefits was incorrect because he met the definition of disability.specifically,he claims that the permanent lifting restrictions imposed on him because of his injury rendered him unable to lift cases of cigarettes from the floor to the ceiling as required by the duties of his job.
sperandeo underwent rotator cuff repair surgery on his left shoulder on august.zoellick,who performed that surgery,stated on july,that sperandeo could return to work with the following permanent restrictions maximum lifting of pounds,maximum overhead lifting of five pounds and overhead work as tolerated,at.on october,sperandeo underwent a second reconstructive shoulder surgery performed by visotsky.medical records from both zoellick and visotsky were reviewed by cna.visotsky placed no permanent restrictions on sperandeo.
the pda completed by lorillard states that a sales representative must be able to carry a sales bag,weighing between twelve and twenty pounds,for about twenty yards,five times a day,and be able to lift it from
