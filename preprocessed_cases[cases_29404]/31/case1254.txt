introduction 
this case concerns who,beyond the immediate,might be held responsible by an erisa plan for a theft from that plan,david coldesina,employee profits sharing plan trust plan or the plan,and david coldesina,as plan trustee,are appealing from multiple summary judgment rulings where the district court dismissed their claims against two groups of defendants flexible benefits administrators,flexible benefits and ted madsen,collectively known as the accountant defendants,and kansas city life insurance company kcl and sunset financial services,sunset.
on appeal,the plan makes three arguments.first,the district court erred in dismissing its erisa claims against the accountant defendants given their status as erisa fiduciaries,or,in the alternative,if the accountant defendants are not erisa fiduciaries,the district court erred in dismissing its claims against them based on erisa preemption.second,the district court erred in dismissing its claims against kcl and sunset based on erisa preemption.finally,the district court erred in refusing to consider coldesina supplemental deposition offered by the plan in opposition to kcl and sunset motion for summary judgment.we have jurisdiction under,and,addressing each argument in turn,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ii.background 
as this case was resolved below on summary judgment,the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment,here the plan.atl.richfield farm credit bank of wichita,cir.viewed as such,the record reveals the following.
in the early,coldesina established an employee benefits plan for his dental practice,and he has served as the plan trustee since its inception.in approximately,coldesina began talking to a personal friend,gregg simper,about changing the plan investment strategy,and,as a result of these conversations,simper became the plan investment advisor.while advising the plan,simper also operated his own company,greystone marketing,and was a general agent for kcl and a licensed for sunset,an affiliate of kcl.his relationships with kcl and sunset authorized him to market and sell the investment products of both companies,and indeed his advice to the plan was primarily,if not completely,based on these products.
as plan advisor,simper also encouraged coldesina to hire ted madsen,the sole owner and employee of flexible benefits,to replace the plan then current administrator.coldesina agreed to the change,and flexible benefits began assisting in the administration of the plan,and charging administrative fees.flexible benefits prepared the plan tax returns and other documents concerning plan participants accounts and benefits,was involved in making disbursements to plan participants,drafting promissory notes for participant loans,and tracking plan loans to ensure repayment,and agreed to accept plan contributions and subsequently remit them on the plan behalf as directed.coldesina would write checks from the plan payable to flexible benefits,and then madsen would deposit the checks into his business account on which he was the only signatory.this arrangement was adopted so that madsen would not have to rely on coldesina handwritten ledger in tracking the plan contributions.
it appears madsen had little contact with coldesina as such,he interacted almost exclusively with simper regarding plan activities and acted at simper direction.initially,when flexible benefits started accepting plan monies into its account,madsen would remit the plan funds payable to kcl for kcl insurance products.however,at simper direction,he subsequently began writing checks on behalf of the plan payable to simper company,greystone marketing,with the understanding that simper would transfer the funds to the kcl.the explanation simper gave for this change was that it helped him track the commissions he and his agents were earning within his marketing business,which madsen did not challenge.coldesina never authorized writing plan checks payable to simper or his company,and apparently was not aware of this change.
madsen also relied exclusively on simper for the information he needed to prepare the plan tax forms and annual plan participant account summaries,which simper provided either orally or in handwritten notes.again,madsen never questioned simper informality or asked him for official verification,and he did not independently verify the information.
in,becoming dissatisfied with the plan investments,coldesina decided to the plan assets and asked simper for the plan account documentation to facilitate the change.simper agreed to turn over the necessary documents however,on the day he was supposed to do so he committed suicide,leaving a note that explained how and why he had misappropriated significant sums from the plan.coldesina subsequently discovered that simper had stolen over from the plan.the plan then brought suit against all the parties involved asserting an erisa claim and various claims against simper estate and the accountant defendants and claims for negligent supervision and vicarious liability against kcl and sunset based on their agency relationship with simper.
the accountant defendants moved for summary judgment arguing erisa preempted the claims against them and that the erisa claim was not proper because they were not plan fiduciaries as defined by the act.the district court granted their motion as to the claims,but denied it as to the erisa claim.however,after the erisa claim was set for trial,the initial judge recused himself,and the new judge allowed the parties to file for summary judgment concerning whether the accountant defendants were erisa fiduciaries.upon hearing the motions,the court ruled madsen and flexible benefits were not plan fiduciaries and granted summary judgment in their favor on the erisa claim as well.
kcl and sunset also moved for summary judgment on the claims asserted against them arguing they were preempted by erisa.the district court again granted the motion finding that simper status as an erisa fiduciary triggered the act preemption provisions.in so deciding,the district court refused to consider coldesina supplemental deposition offered by the plan suggesting as justification for the exclusion that the plan was trying to create a sham issue of fact.this appeal followed entry as final judgment.
iii.discussion 
as noted,we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.willmar,cooke,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.c.
flexible benefits madsen the accountant defendants 
the plan asserts that the accounting defendants are fiduciaries as defined by erisa and therefore dismissal of its erisa claim against them was in error.further,the plan concedes that if the accountant defendants are erisa fiduciaries its claims are preempted however,if the accountant defendants are not deemed fiduciaries,the plan argues its claims are not preempted.whether a party is an erisa fiduciary is a mixed question of fact and law.hamilton carell,cir.however,where the parties essentially agree on the underlying facts,as is the case here,the only issue before us is the district court legal conclusion,which we review de novo.see also allison bank,cir peckham gem state mut.of utah,cir.erisa defines fiduciary in reference to the functions being performed for the plan.the statute provides 
a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,ii he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation,direct or indirect,with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan,or has any authority or responsibility to do so,or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.
a.thus,in applying this definition,the court must conduct a functional analysis.see lockheed spink,d.that is to say,regardless of status or title,parties are only plan fiduciaries to the extent they are performing one of the functions identified in the definition.varity howe,d at.
plan management or administration confers fiduciary status only to the extent the party exercises discretionary authority or control.discretion exists where a party has the power of free decision or individual choice.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary herman nationsbank trust,cir defining discretion.on the other hand,or ministerial functions are those that do not require individual decisionmaking.these include tasks which by their nature are inherently ministerial,such as clerical services.see pohl benefits consultants,cir defendant function under the plan was clerical,mechanical,discretionary.they also include those tasks that might otherwise require discretion but which are performed within the confines of plan policies and procedures.it am.life ins,cir quoting at useden acker,cir.
discretion is conspicuously omitted from the fiduciary function of controlling plan assets.indeed,the statute provides that any authority or control over the management or disposition of plan assets is sufficient to render fiduciary status.a i emphasis added.as other courts have recognized,this distinction evidences congress intent to treat control over assets differently than control over management or administration.srein frankford trust,cir it,at firstier bank,zeller,cir in congress judgment,and consistent with general trust law,parties controlling plan assets are automatically in a position of confidence by virtue of that control,and as such they are obligated to act accordingly.see firstier bank,at,sess,reprinted in,
as stated above,madsen and flexible benefits prepared the plan financial statements,received plan contributions and subsequently remitted the funds as directed by simper,and prepared promissory notes for plan loans to participants and tracked the balances of those loans.thus,there are two possible grounds for finding that they functioned as plan fiduciaries.first,their involvement in plan administration,and second,their control over plan assets.
discretionary authority over plan administration 
generally,preparing plan financial documents,including tax forms,is an administrative function however,it is also ministerial.anoka orthopaedic,lechner,cir yeseta baima,cir at preparing reports required by government agencies and reports concerning participants benefits are ministerial tasks.that is,once the preparer has the necessary information,it is,as coldesina admitted,pretty much a numbers calculation.thus,even though the accountant defendants charged administrative fees and said they were involved in plan administration,they did not perform the necessary administrative functions to be considered plan fiduciaries.
control over plan assets 
as stated above,any authority or control over plan assets is sufficient to render fiduciary status.as such,acting as a signatory on behalf of a plan can indicate fiduciary control.see it,at the right to write checks on plan funds is authority or control respecting management or disposition of assets.lopresti terwilliger,cir noting signatory authority in discussing fiduciary status.however,performing this function in name only is likely insufficient.see lopresti,at finding signatory who wrote checks on plan funds was a fiduciary while signatory who never wrote checks and was not involved in finances was not a fiduciary.
here,the accountant defendants were signatories in practice as well as name.madsen received plan contribution funds from the plan,which he deposited into his business account,and then wrote checks on behalf of the plan for the amount of the contribution.this arrangement was initially set up to facilitate better recordkeeping however,the practical reality is that madsen had total control over the plan money while it was in his account.by way of example only,though not authorized to do so,he could have withdrawn the plan money to pay his business expenses or go on vacation,and certainly if he had done either it would have been appropriate to treat his actions as a breach of fiduciary duty.see olson hutton,cir a person who usurps authority over a plan assets and makes decisions about the use or disposition of those assets should know they are acting as a fiduciary.
indeed,this practical reality is precisely why control over assets is treated differently than control over management.see.mut.life ins.russell,d a fair contextual reading of erisa makes it abundantly clear that its draftsmen were primarily concerned with the possible misuse of plan assets.as a general matter,a relationship of trust is established when one acquires possession of another property with the understanding that it is to be used for the owner benefit,and in these circumstances an obligation arises on the part of the one in possession to act in the owner bests interests rather than his own.as such,assigning fiduciary obligations serves the purposes of erisa.indeed,t he words of the erisa statute,and its purpose of assuring that people who have practical control over an erisa plan money have fiduciary responsibility to the plan beneficiaries,require that a person with the authority to direct payment of a plan money be deemed a fiduciary.it,at emphasis added.
the facts here are even more compelling because the account at issue belonged to the accountant defendants and not to the plan itself.in it,the court assigned fiduciary status where the party acted as a signatory on an account established and maintained by the plan,at,and under such circumstances,the signatory and the plan likely shared control over the assets.but here,where the plan was not affiliated with the account and had no authority to oversee its activities,it depended upon madsen to ensure the funds were handled properly.indeed,to say that the accountant defendants did not control the money while it was in their account is to say that no one had control during that time.
in opposition,the accountant defendants argue they were not in control of the plan assets because they were simply performing a ministerial,service.first,the dichotomy between discretionary and ministerial authority is not determinative regarding control over assets.second,this characterization is not entirely accurate.while it is true madsen did not have any involvement in how the plan chose to invest its assets,see baker kingsley,cir,or which claims were properly payable under the plan,it,at,or even which of various competing creditors would be paid,lopresti,at,he did exercise judgment in naming the payee on the checks he wrote on behalf of the plan.
the original understanding when madsen agreed to accept plan contributions into his business account was that he would write the plan checks payable to kcl.however,at simper direction,madsen subsequently began making the checks payable to greystone marketing.there were never any express plan policies directing madsen activities,and coldesina was unaware madsen was writing the checks to greystone marketing.as such,madsen assumed control over disposition of the funds by exercising his own judgment rather than acting at the plan direction.
on this point,lopresti and it are analogous.in lopresti,the court held a plan administrator was a fiduciary based on his signatory status and authority to decide which creditors to pay out of the plan assets.at.likewise,in it,the court held that an outside company serving as signatory and having the authority to pay claims it deemed proper under the plan was a fiduciary because it had the ability to direct the plan assets.at.certainly,madsen had fewer choices in naming a payee than in these prior cases and thus exercised a lesser degree of control over disposition of the assets,but the point is he had this authority.a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent he exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,a emphasis added,and madsen actions,just like the fiduciaries in lopresti and it,demonstrate that as a practical matter,he had a substantial amount
