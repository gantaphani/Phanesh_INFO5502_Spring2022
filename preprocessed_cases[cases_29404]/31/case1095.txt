this appeal involves a operation where a employer,simas floor,set up a union employer,m m installation,to handle union flooring work.the question is whether the company,simas floor,is liable for withdrawal liability incurred by the union company,m m installation,pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,as amended by the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of mppaa.we conclude that assuming it is possible to be responsible on an alter ego theory,the company may be liable when there is commonality between the union and firms and an abuse of the structure to avoid payment of withdrawal liability.as the district court applied a different standard that focused on whether simas floor actions undermined the purposes of erisa and mppaa,resilient floor covering pension fund m m installation,d,we reverse and remand.the district court also rejected the pension fund claim that it could accelerate the withdrawal payments.the fund,and we affirm.
simas floor is a residential and commercial flooring contractor with offices in sacramento,stockton,and visalia.it is owned in equal shares by three cousins,mark simas,michelle simas carli,and craig simas.mark simas is the president the other two are.the cousins are directors along with their fathers,ken,jack,and dave simas.
m m was formed june,by mark simas as a residential flooring and tile contractor.it was created to serve as a union signatory flooring contractor to allow simas floor to bid on union jobs by subcontracting the work to m mark simas is m m controlling shareholder and president,and a director along with jack,ken,and dave simas who each own of the shares.megan hui was simas floor chief financial officer and performed similar functions for m m,as did michele carli in human resources.m m operated out of simas floor sacramento facility,and entered into collective bargaining agreements for its flooring installers with carpet,resilient flooring and sign workers local union.these agreements required m m to make contributions to the resilient floor covering pension fund on behalf of m m flooring installers.by the time its collective bargaining agreement came up for renewal in,painters district council had assumed control of local.the district council insisted that the new agreement also cover simas floor sacramento flooring installers,which was not acceptable to m m.an impasse and strike ensued,followed by a letter to local dated july,from mark simas that repudiated the agreement for flooring installers.this did not affect m m tile work or tile installers who were covered by a different collective bargaining agreement.m m then stopped making contributions to the pension fund,which prompted the pension fund to assess a withdrawal liability,with quarterly payments of due every march,june,september,and december for twenty years.m m made quarterly payments from december through april,when it shut down operations and went out of business.
in a letter of august,the pension fund notified m m that its june payment was delinquent and demanded payment.it explained that in its view,m m was still doing business under the name of either m m installations or simas floor company and continued to be liable for withdrawal liability.ultimately,simas floor made the payments under protest.this suit,in which the pension fund seeks to collect the withdrawal liability from m m and simas floor,and to accelerate payment,followed.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the pension fund moved for judgment on the grounds that simas floor and m m were alter ego employers that m m wound up its business with a principal purpose of avoiding its withdrawal liability in violation of c and that simas floor is the successor employer to m simas floor sought judgment on the footing that it was not an employer within the meaning of mppaa as it is not the alter ego or successor of m m.in a published decision,the district court granted summary judgment to the pension fund,holding that simas floor was m m alter ego because the two companies admittedly had sufficient commonality and because recognizing the separateness of the two would undermine the purposes of erisa and mppaa to protect employee rights.resilient floor covering pension fund m m installation,d.the court did not reach the remaining grounds.it also granted judgment in simas floor favor that a default had not occurred under c a b such that the fund was entitled to accelerate the debt.
simas floor appealed the judgment adverse to it,and the pension fund.
we have previously explained how and why mppaa imposes withdrawal liability on union employers when they withdraw from a multiemployer pension fund.see elliott,carpenters pension trust fund for,cir see also concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension trust for.in a nutshell,erisa,which was enacted in,was intended to protect employees covered by pension plans from being deprived of anticipated benefits because of employer underfunding.when it turned out to do so inadequately,mppaa was enacted in to reduce an employer incentive to terminate its affiliation with a multiemployer pension plan by requiring employers who do withdraw to pay the unfunded vested benefits attributable to the withdrawing employers participation 
mppaa imposes withdrawal liability on an employer that withdraws from a multiemployer pension plan.the statute does not define employer.while title i of erisa does have a definition,it does not directly apply to title iv,which contains mppaa.drawing on title i definition,however,many courts have held that the term employer means a person who is obligated to contribute to a plan either as a direct employer or in the interest of an employer of the plan participants.see korea shipping shipping ass l longshoremen ass pension trust fund,cir carriers container council,mobile ass l longshoreman ass n,pension plan and trust,cir seaway port auth.of duluth ila marine ass restated pension plan,cir cent.states,se.and sw.areas pension fund cent,cir cent.states,se.and sw.areas pension fund int l comfort,llc,cir 
there is no question that m m was the signatory entity and simas floor was not.this means that m m was the employer for purposes of.but both parties agree that if simas floor is the alter ego of m m,then it,too,is an employer and is responsible for m m withdrawal liability 
we assume,for purposes of resolving this appeal,that this is so,that is,that the alter ego doctrine is available under mppaa to hold a entity liable for the withdrawal liability of a union employer.neither the parties nor the district court raised any question about whether alter ego liability or veil piercing is consistent with the statute when withdrawal liability is at issue.however,we note that c provides that i f a principal purpose of any transaction is to evade or avoid liability under this part,this part shall be applied and liability shall be determined and collected without regard to such transaction.while we will decide the issue that has been presented,we expect on remand that the court will consider whether c is intended to be the sole route of redress for evading or avoiding withdrawal liability.
the dispute actually raised in this case centers on what is the correct test for determining whether simas floor is m m alter ego and how the pension fund,which bears the burden of proof,may satisfy the test.the district court acknowledged the alter ego test from ua local plumbing,f d,cir,but changed it.the alter ego test requires proof that the two firms have common ownership,management,operations,and labor relations,and that the firm is used in a sham effort to avoid collective bargaining obligations.id.quotations omitted.the district court replaced the second element with one focusing on whether recognizing the separateness of the two employers undermines the purposes of erisa and the mppaa.m m installation,d at.
simas floor concedes for present purposes that the commonality element of the test is met.instead,it maintains that the district court incorrectly ignored ninth circuit precedent,beginning with carpenters local union stevens,cir,regarding the second element.that element has been variously phrased as whet
