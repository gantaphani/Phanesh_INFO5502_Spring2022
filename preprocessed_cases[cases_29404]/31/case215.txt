cecilia nichols appeals from the february,decision and order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york victor marrero,dismissing without prejudice her claims of wrongful termination of disability benefits under the employee retirement income security act of,as amended and codified at and scattered sections of erisa.the district court held that while the prudential insurance company of america prudential did violate the deadlines for completing review of a denial of benefits set forth in h promulgated pursuant to erisa,it made good faith efforts to complete this review that placed it in substantial compliance with the regulation.the district court therefore dismissed nichols claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,but ordered that prudential complete its review and render a decision within thirty days of the date that nichols complies with prudential requests for additional information and for an independent medical examination.on appeal,nichols argues that the substantial compliance doctrine is inconsistent with the regulation,that prudential did not technically or substantially comply with the regulation,and that in the absence of a decision by prudential,the district court should have reviewed the denial of benefits de novo.prudential argues that the district court order was an interlocutory remand order over which this court does not have appellate jurisdiction,that the substantial compliance doctrine is proper and consistent with the tolling scheme implemented by the current version of the regulation,and that any district court review of the denial of benefits should be under an arbitrary and capricious standard.we hold that the district court dismissal without prejudice is a final decision over which this court has appellate jurisdiction.we further hold that the plain language of h precludes the judicial creation of a substantial compliance doctrine.we finally hold that the lack of discretion vested in the plan administrator,or alternatively,failure to exercise any such discretion,requires de novo review of the denial of benefits.we therefore vacate the district court order and remand to the district court for de novo review of the merits of nichols claim.
background 
while the facts pertaining to the underlying merits of nichols claim are disputed,the facts concerning the course of communications between nichols and prudential at issue here are not.we review and summarize here only this undisputed factual background.
cecilia nichols participated in a group insurance plan the plan offering short and disability coverage,underwritten and administered by prudential.the plan offered disability coverage,and limited coverage to months for disabilities based in part on mental disorders.
in november,nichols submitted a claim based on several diagnosed medical conditions that resulted in pain,fatigue,weakness,nausea,dizziness,depression,and disorientation.as per the terms of the plan,prudential paid disability benefits until april,and then began paying benefits.on december,prudential notified nichols by letter that her benefits would be suspended after april,because she was no longer totally disabled and her disability was based in part on a mental disorder.on december,prudential called nichols by telephone and informed her of the termination of benefits and the right to appeal,and told nichols that she should forward medical evidence of continued disability if she did appeal.nichols called prudential on december,discussed the appeals process and the medical evidence necessary,and was informed that if she appealed,prudential would assess the need for an independent medical evaluation ime at that time.
nichols filed a written appeal with prudential by letter dated april,day.no further correspondence was exchanged until june day,when prudential acknowledged receipt of nichols letter,stated that prudential was performing a review,and stated that nichols would be contacted within days with a decision or the status of the evaluation.on july day,prudential requested by telephone that nichols submit to an ime.a week later,on july day,nichols informed prudential by telephone that she refused any ime and would consult with an attorney.nichols then sent a letter,through counsel,on july day,referring to nichols appeal as an erisa matter and instructing prudential not to delay or disturb resolution of the appeal.on july day,prudential responded by letter,stating that it could not resolve nichols appeal until she submitted medical records of her continuing treatment.nichols wrote a final letter on august day,rejecting prudential july letter,and referring specifically to h as requiring timely processing of nichols appeal.
on october,day,nichols filed the present suit.nichols wrote to prudential on november,notifying prudential of the suit and stating that no further claims proceedings,such as an ime,were appropriate.prudential responded by reminding nichols to attend her scheduled ime by letter dated november.prudential subsequently moved to dismiss without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.nichols prudential ins.of,d.
the district court held that while prudential technically did not comply with the letter of the regulation,nichols ignored its spirit,and dismissed nichols complaint without prejudice to allow prudential to complete its review of her claim.id.the district court observed that h ordinarily set a deadline for appeals of a denial of benefits,which could be extended to days for special circumstances,provided a written notice to the claimant preceded such extension.nichols,d at quoting h.it then found that while prudential had remained entirely silent for days after the date of nichols april appeal letter,prudential subsequently exhibited good faith efforts to gather new evidence and resolve nichols appeal,efforts which nichols resisted.id.at.relying on a tenth circuit case,gilbertson allied signal,cir,and several district court cases from other circuits,the district court held that prudential actions placed it in substantial compliance with the regulatory deadlines.nichols,d at.the district court therefore granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice and ordered that prudential render a final decision within thirty days after nichols complied with prudential requests for additional medical records and an ime.id.at.
this appeal followed.nichols argues that this court should reject the substantial compliance doctrine that in any case prudential actions do not constitute substantial compliance and that on remand,the district court should conduct a de novo review of the administrative record.prudential argues that the district court order is an interlocutory order remanding to prudential as the plan administrator,over which this court has no appellate jurisdiction that prudential was in fact in technical compliance with the regulatory deadlines and that this court should adopt the substantial compliance doctrine and find prudential substantially complied with the regulatory deadlines.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
we first address the issue of our jurisdiction over this appeal.prudential correctly notes that only final decisions of the district court are appealable as of right under.federal appellate jurisdiction generally depends on the existence of a decision by the district court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d internal quotation marks omitted.
prudential argues that the district court order at issue here is a remand to the erisa plan administrator,and that our jurisdiction over such a remand is undecided by this court.see generally zervos verizon,cir citing crocco xerox,cir.our sister courts of appeals have split on whether a remand to a plan administrator is a final decision within the meaning of,with the seventh and ninth circuits holding that such remands are immediately appealable in certain circumstances,and the first,sixth,and eleventh circuits holding that such remands are not final decisions.compare hensley northwest permanente ret.plan trust,cir and perlman swiss bank.comprehensive disability prot.plan,cir,with bowers sheet metal workers pension fund,cir,petralia v.at t global info.solutions,cir,and shannon jack eckerd,cir per curiam.
at this time,we need not decide with which circuits we agree.the district court order under review here does not use the term remand,and substantively differs from a remand order of the type considered in the above cases.each of the cases involved a remand to the plan administrator for a new determination,and,where necessary,vacatur of the previous determination.hensley northwest permanente ret.plan trust,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,perlman swiss bank.comprehensive disability prot.plan,bowers,at petralia,at shannon,at.each of these cases found fault with the plan administrator benefits determination,and returned the matter to the plan administrator to correct these faults.thus,these cases contemplate that the primary responsibility for further action lay with the plan administrator,who must correct its previous determination.this principle is consistent with the general understanding of remand as requiring further action in the forum best suited for further proceedings.see druid hills civic ass federal highway,cir t he purpose of a remand order is to continue litigation rather than terminate it.
the district court order at issue here is quite different.by its own terms,it is a dismissal without prejudice,not a vacatur and remand.indeed,the primary thrust of the decision is that prudential in fact made no error that now needs to be corrected,and that nichols precluded a determination by bringing suit prematurely.see nichols,d at.the decretal language of the district court order mandates only two things first,that the motion to dismiss is granted without prejudice and the alternative and cross motions are denied and second,that prudential must render a final decision within thirty days after nichols submits additional medical records and undergoes an ime.id.at.the order leaves the primary responsibility for further action in the hands of nichols,who must take certain actions,which the district court characterizes as exhausting her administrative remedies,before coming back to court.this is entirely consistent with a dismissal without prejudice,which terminates litigation and the court responsibilities,while leaving the door open for some new,future litigation.see rinieri news syndicate,cir.
we therefore consider the district court order to be a dismissal without prejudice,not a remand.it is well established that a dismissal without prejudice,absent some retention of jurisdiction such as an invitation to amend the complaint,terminates the action and is a final decision from which an appeal lies.wynder mcmahon,cir.the district court decision does state that nichols may return to this court for further proceedings,nichols,d at,which could be interpreted as a retention of jurisdiction.however,as discussed above,the specific decretal language of the district court order dismisses the claims without prejudice and imposes a new deadline on prudential once nichols submits to an ime.id.the decision contemplates a return to the court only after prudential has violated the new deadline or denied benefits.id.the most consistent interpretation of the district court statement is that it simply restates nichols legal right to resume her action in the same federal court once the plan administrator actually makes a decision,or once prudential has violated a federal court order by failing to meet the new deadline.there is no need to read in any retention of jurisdiction into the district court clearly stated decision.
we hold that the specific district court decision at issue here is a dismissal without prejudice,that it is a final decision,and that appeal lies as of right to this court under.accordingly,we turn now to the substance of the appeal.
ii.the regulatory deadlines 
there are two basic substantive questions in this appeal.the first,which we address in this section,concerns prudential compliance with the regulatory deadlines.if prudential missed these deadlines,then nichols claim is deemed denied and her administrative remedies are therefore exhausted,removing any procedural obstacle to the present suit.prudential argues both that it has complied technically with the deadlines,and that we should recognize a substantial compliance exception to the deadlines and hold that prudential substantially complied with the deadlines.we first address the standard of review by which we review the district court conclusions as to these issues,and then consider each argument in turn.the second question,which is addressed in section iii,concerns the standard of review that a district court should use in reviewing a claim that has been deemed denied after the failure of the plan administrator to meet the regulatory deadlines.under erisa,a district court reviews a plan administrator discretionary decision under an arbitrary and capricious standard and all other administrator decisions de novo.the question of which standard of review the district court should apply turns on whether the plan instrument vests the plan administrator with discretion in the administrator treatment of claims,and whether the administrator action in missing the deadlines is a valid exercise of that discretion.
standard of our review of the district court decision 
we first address the standard by which we review the district court judgment.this court has never explicitly stated the standard of review for a district court dismissal of an erisa claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.it is similarly unclear whether such a motion is properly brought for failure to state a claim,lack of subject matter jurisdiction,or on some other procedural basis.see kennedy empire blue cross blue shield,cir affirming conversion of a motion to dismiss an erisa claim for failure to state a claim on exhaustion grounds to a motion for summary judgment.however,while dismissals for failure to exhaust administrative remedies in cases governed by different statutes have been characterized in several ways,we have,in these other contexts,universally held that we review such dismissals de novo.see ex rel.attica cent,cir reviewing a dismissal of an idea claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to failure to exhaust carlyle towers condo.ass n,fdic,cir reviewing de novo a dismissal of a firrea claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to failure to exhaust abney mcginnis,cir reviewing de novo a dismissal of a section claim pursuant to judgment on the claims due to failure to exhaust as required by the plra.we see no reason that dismissals for failure to exhaust administrative remedies should be treated differently in the erisa context,and we will therefore review the district court decision de novo.
technical compliance 
the question of whether nichols exhausted administrative remedies is in turn dependent on whether prudential complied with the regulatory deadlines of h.this regulation requires that a plan administrator decision reviewing a denial of benefits must ordinarily be made within days of the request for such review,but may be made within days for special circumstances.h i.notice of any such extension must be given in writing before the commencement of the extension.h.if no decision is rendered by the deadline,the claim for benefits is deemed denied on review.h.thus,if prudential failed to meet the deadlines,nichols administrative appeal is deemed denied,and her administrative remedies are therefore exhausted.
in the present case,prudential first communicated with nichols about her appeal days after the date of her letter requesting the appeal.it first expressed the need for an ime on day,and stated that it could not proceed without the ime and further medical records on day.as of the commencement of the present suit on day,prudential had never rendered a formal decision on nichols claim.
prudential argues on appeal,though it did not do so below,that despite these time frames,it complied with the letter of the regulation.it points out while the record reflects that nichols original request for review was dated april
