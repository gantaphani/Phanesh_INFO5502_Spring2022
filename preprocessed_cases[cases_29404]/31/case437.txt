these appeals emanate from a civil action initiated in the district of maryland under a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.after mid atlantic medical services,mamsi,an erisa plan fiduciary,had paid nearly for benefits to joel and marlene sereboff the sereboffs,the sereboffs recovered from the offending tortfeasors in a personal injury action in california state court the california litigation.when the sereboffs failed to reimburse mamsi for the medical benefits it had paid,mamsi sued,asserting that,as plan beneficiaries,they had failed to comply with their subrogation obligations to reimburse it for benefits paid on their behalf.by order of january,the district court awarded summary judgment to mamsi,deeming the relief sought to be equitable in nature under a and requiring the sereboffs to reimburse mamsi for the payments it had made the reimbursement award.the court then reduced the reimbursement award to account for mamsi share of the expenses incurred by the sereboffs in pursuing the california litigation the deduction ruling.thereafter,by order of may,the court awarded mamsi the fees and costs it had incurred in securing the reimbursement award the attorney fee ruling.
the sereboffs have appealed the reimbursement award and the attorney fee ruling,and mamsi has on the deduction ruling.the primary issue on appeal involves application of the supreme court decision in life annuity insurance knudson,d,and it is one on which our sister circuits are split whether a plan fiduciary asserting a subrogation right to reimbursement from a plan beneficiary who has received payments from a third party,and who possesses that recovery in an identifiable fund,is seeking equitable relief under a of erisa.we agree with the district court that mamsi claim for reimbursement seeks equitable relief under a and,as explained below,we affirm the reimbursement award and the deduction ruling.we vacate and remand,however,on the attorney fee ruling.
mamsi serves as fiduciary of an employee welfare benefit plan,the mamsi life and health insurance ppo plan the plan.the sereboffs,who live in owings mills,maryland,were beneficiaries of the plan,participating through sereboff employer,the katzen eye group.on june,the sereboffs were injured in an automobile accident in california,and the plan paid their medical expenses in the sum of the plan contains an acts of third parties subrogation provision,which accords mamsi,as plan fiduciary,the right to recover any payments made to beneficiaries by third parties for costs associated with an injury resulting from the acts of another person or party.plan at acts of third parties provision.under the plan,any recovery by mamsi from such payments is subject to a deduction for reasonable attorney fees and court costs incurred by the beneficiaries in securing the payments,prorated to reflect that portion of the total recovery reimbursed to mamsi for the benefits it had paid.id.
on august,the sereboffs initiated the california litigation in the superior court of santa clara county.in late and early,mamsi informed the sereboffs and their lawyer,in multiple writings,that it had paid medical benefits on behalf of the sereboffs and that,pursuant to the plan,mamsi was entitled to reimbursement for those expenditures should the california litigation be successful.mamsi requested that the sereboffs and their attorney execute subrogation lien agreements acknowledging the sereboffs obligations under the plan.mamsi also offered the attorney,stein,the opportunity to represent it in connection with its subrogation claim,on a contingency fee basis.neither the sereboffs nor stein executed the proposed agreements,and stein did not initially respond to mamsi offer that he represent mamsi in its subrogation claim.
on april,mamsi made what it called a formal demand that the sereboffs cooperate in connection with its subrogation efforts under the plan.on april,stein informed mamsi that it was not entitled to reimbursement from the sereboffs,because subrogation liens such as those being pursued by mamsi are not recoverable under decisions of the ninth circuit on may,in responding to stein,mamsi reasserted its request that the subrogation lien agreements be executed.mamsi contended that the plan was a maryland contract subject to the law of that state,and that california law was inapplicable on may,stein advised mamsi that it should retain california counsel to protect its subrogation rights in the california litigation,because he could not properly represent the interests of both the sereboffs and mamsi.
on january,the sereboffs settled the california litigation for the sum of.upon receipt of the settlement funds,however,they declined to recognize mamsi position on subrogation and reimburse it for the benefits it had paid on their behalf.instead,stein disbursed the funds to the sereboffs and his law firm,pursuant to their representation agreement in the california litigation.the sereboffs then placed the funds into their investment accounts.
on august,mamsi instituted this proceeding in the district of maryland,pursuant to a of erisa,which authorizes a civil action by an erisa participant or fiduciary to enjoin any act which violates the terms of an erisa plan,or to obtain other appropriate equitable relief to enforce the plan provisions.a.mamsi thereby sought,inter alia,restitution of the funds held by the sereboffs in their investment accounts.it also sought emergency relief in the district court,seeking to enjoin the sereboffs and stein from disposing of the settlement funds until mamsi claims for reimbursement could be resolved.on august,the sereboffs agreed,by stipulation filed with the court,to preserve of the settlement funds until it ruled on the merits of the dispute 
on september,mamsi moved for summary judgment against the sereboffs,asserting that it was entitled to recover the disputed proceeds under the terms of the plan,and maintaining that it was seeking equitable relief authorized under a of erisa.on september,the sereboffs sought dismissal of the district court action,asserting that mamsi was seeking monetary damages which were not permissible under erisa.on january,the district court denied the sereboffs motion to dismiss.it granted in part mamsi motion for summary judgment,agreeing that mamsi sought relief under a and that it was entitled to reimbursement of the,plus interest the reimbursement award.the court then reduced the reimbursement award to account for mamsi prorated share of the reasonable attorney fees and court costs incurred by the sereboffs in pursuing the california litigation the deduction ruling.
on february,mamsi sought an award requiring the sereboffs to pay the expenses it had incurred in securing the reimbursement award.on may,the district court granted that request,and it entered judgment for mamsi in the sum of,plus interest the attorney fee ruling.as noted,the sereboffs have appealed the reimbursement award and the attorney fee ruling,and mamsi has on the deduction ruling.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment,viewing the facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.seabulk offshore,am.home assurance,cir.in this proceeding,the sereboffs challenge to summary judgment on the reimbursement award and mamsi contention of error with regard to the deduction ruling present questions of law to be reviewed de novo.see johannssen dist.coast,cir.on the other hand,we review for abuse of discretion the sereboffs challenge to the attorney fee ruling.see id.at.
turning to the contentions of the parties,we first assess the primary issue raised sereboffs challenge to the reimbursement turns on whether mamsi sought relief that is properly characterized as other appropriate equitable relief under a of erisa.we then assess mamsi challenge to the deduction ruling and the sereboffs appeal of the attorney fee ruling.
the sereboffs first contend that the reimbursement award was erroneously made,asserting that the relief mamsi sought was legal,rather than equitable,in nature.in determining whether the district court properly granted the reimbursement award,we first assess whether a authorizes mamsi to seek restitution of the disputed funds held in the sereboffs investment accounts.section a is the civil enforcement mechanism available to erisa fiduciaries seeking to recover benefits paid under an erisa plan.a.it authorizes the pursuit of a civil action by an erisa fiduciary to enjoin any act which violates the terms of a plan,or to obtain other appropriate equitable relief to enforce a plan provisions.hyperlink id.emphasis added.in disputes where a does not expressly authorize relief,the federal courts are not empowered to award it.see mertens hewitt,d emphasizing court unwillingness to infer causes of action in the erisa context thus,the availability of relief to mamsi turns on the proper characterization of mamsi action,as lying in law or in equity.
in assessing whether mamsi civil action seeks equitable or legal relief,we are guided as was the district court by the supreme court decision in life annuity insurance knudson,d.in knudson,the court explained that a does not authorize all types of relief that a court of equity might award it only authorizes those remedies that were typically available in equity.at.quoting mertens,at.in that dispute,janette knudson,an erisa plan beneficiary,was injured in an automobile accident she was advanced money by the plan to cover her medical expenses and she then recovered for her injuries in a lawsuit against the tortfeasor.id.at.the settlement funds received from the tortfeasor did not enter into knudson possession,however,but instead were placed in a special needs trust to provide for her ongoing medical care.id.at.the plan fiduciary then sought declaratory and injunctive relief to require knudson and her husband,the plan participant,to reimburse the plan from the litigation proceeds she had received.id.at.
the court denied the relief sought by the fiduciary,concluding that it was not claiming particular funds that,in good conscience,belong to it,knudson,at,but instead was seeking to impose personal liability on the knudsons for a contractual obligation to pay that was not typically available in equity,id.at.the court explained that an erisa plan fiduciary may seek equitable restitution in the form of an equitable lien where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the fiduciary could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the beneficiary possession.id.at.by contrast,the court reasoned that where the property sought to be recovered has been dissipated so that no product remains,the fiduciary claim is only that of a general creditor.id.quoting restatement of restitution cmt.a,at.in that circumstance,the fiduciary is seeking a legal imposition of personal liability on the beneficiary to pay a sum of money owed to the its action falls outside the jurisdictional ambit of a.id.at.
we agree with the district court that,in this dispute,mamsi action seeks equitable restitution,as that term is used in knudson,because mamsi seeks to recover funds that are specifically identifiable,belong in good conscience to mamsi,and are within the possession and control of the sereboffs.first,the funds have not been dissipated,and they are specifically identifiable.by the stipulation of august,between the sereboffs and mamsi,of the settlement funds are preserved by the sereboffs in their investment accounts.although the funds have been placed in accounts with the sereboffs other monies,they can clearly be traced to particular funds recovered in the california litigation.knudson,at.second,the disputed funds belong in good conscience to mamsi.the plan contains express,unambiguous reimbursement provisions,according mamsi the right to recover any payments made to the sereboffs by a third party.third,the disputed funds are within the possession and control of the sereboffs.they received those funds in the california litigation and held them in their investment accounts pending resolution of this proceeding.in knudson,by contrast,the funds received from the tortfeasor were placed in a special needs trust,outside the possession or control of the beneficiary.thus,the action pursued by mamsi,and resulting in the reimbursement award,is equitable in nature under a,and the court properly granted relief with respect to it.
recent decisions by the fifth,seventh,and tenth circuits support our determination that mamsi reimbursement proceeding lies in equity.most recently,the tenth circuit,in administrative committee of the associates health welfare plan willard,cir,concluded that a plan fiduciary may maintain an action for equitable relief if the plan is seeking to recover funds that are specifically identifiable,belong in good conscience to the fiduciary,and are within the possession and control of the beneficiary.in willard,an erisa fiduciary sought to enforce a subrogation clause against a beneficiary through imposition of a constructive trust on settlement funds received from a third party tortfeasor.id.at.the district court allowed the fiduciary to intervene and deposit a portion of the settlement proceeds equivalent to the medical expenses into the court registry.id.at.on appeal,the tenth circuit agreed that the fiduciary effort to secure imposition of an equitable lien fell within the ambit of a.see id.at 
the fifth and seventh circuits followed a similar approach for assessing whether an erisa plan fiduciary may maintain an action for equitable relief.see bombardier aerospace employee welfare benefits plan ferrer,poirot wansbrough,cir admin.comm.of the stores.assocs.health welfare plan varco,cir.in both bombardier and varco,as in this proceeding,the beneficiaries attorneys had accepted payment from the tortfeasors on behalf of their clients,and placed the funds into accounts over which the beneficiaries had constructive possession.in those proceedings,the courts held that the fiduciaries were seeking equitable relief under a.here,the elements of equitable restitution are satisfied,and the district court properly awarded reimbursement to mamsi 
after making its reimbursement award to mamsi,the district court reduced the award to account for mamsi prorated share of the sereboffs attorney fees and costs associated with the california litigation the deduction ruling.mamsi contends that the deduction ruling was erroneous,asserting that such a deduction is not appropriate where the plan is compelled to retain counsel to protect its reimbursement interests,and when the beneficiary fails to abide by the plan provisions.
a primary purpose of erisa is to ensure the integrity of written,benefit plans.united mcgill stinnett,cir.to achieve this objective,the plain language of an erisa plan must be enforced in accordance with its literal and natural meaning.id.quoting health cost controls isbell,cir.in this dispute,the provisions of the plan mandate that any reimbursement to mamsi of payments made to the sereboffs by a third party is subject to a deduction for reasonable attorney fees and court costs prorated to reflect that portion of the total recovery which is due mamsi for benefits paid.plan at.
under the terms of the plan,a prorated portion of the sereboffs attorney fees and costs associated with the california litigation should be deducted from the reimbursement award.the reimbursement award grants reimbursement to mamsi in the sum of,which represents the amount being held in the sereboffs investment accounts that the plan paid for their medical expenses.as that sum is roughly ten percent of the settlement agreement,the district court appropriately reduced the reimbursement award by that proportion of the sereboffs litigation expenses.
in contending otherwise,mamsi relies on court decisions that did not involve agreements regarding the deduction of attorney fees from reimbursement awards.see waller hormel foods,cir united states tobias,cir.in fact,each of those decisions suggests that the inclusion of such a provision in the erisa plan would have altered the ruling.see waller,at basing amount of deduction on value of plan beneficiary legal service to plan because the plan subrogation clause contains no provision regard
