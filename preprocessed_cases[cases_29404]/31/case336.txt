opinion of the court 
richard ranke and other similarly situated individuals in this case are former employees of eastman kodak company kodak,and current or former employees of sanofi.they appeal from the decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania dismissing their complaint for breach of fiduciary duty under the employee retirement income security act of erisa.ranke,wl,decision.because their breach of fiduciary duty claim was under erisa,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b rule b.we affirm.
background 
because the district court granted appellees kodak and sanofi motions to dismiss under rule b,we take the factual background of this case from the complaint and accept all allegations contained therein as true.ala,ccair,cir.
appellants are all former employees of kodak eastman pharmaceutical division and were participants in the kodak retirement income plan krip.in,kodak began the process of merging its eastman pharmaceutical division with sterling winthrop,sterling,a subsidiary of kodak.according to the complaint,human resources personnel at both kodak and sterling told appellants that they would receive pension benefits under both the kodak and sterling pension plans if they decided to accept transfer of employment to sterling.kodak also allegedly informed appellants that it would use their final average salaries from sterling to calculate the pension benefits.in addition,appellants were allegedly told that their total years of service with kodak and with sterling would be used to determine their early retirement eligibility.relying on these representations,appellants say that they accepted employment with sterling instead of remaining at kodak.
in,sanofi acquired certain portions of sterling through an asset purchase agreement.appellants were selected to become employees of sanofi.as an incentive to change employment again,human resources personnel at sanofi allegedly advised appellants that their retirement benefits would remain undiminished for a period of two years after changing employment.sanofi is also said to have informed appellants that during this period,for purposes of calculating benefits,they would continue to accrue years of service based upon their original kodak start dates.relying on these representations,appellants say that they accepted employment with sanofi and thus became participants in the retirement income plan swrip.
in their complaint,appellants identified three communications from kodak and sanofi regarding their pension plans that took place after their change of employment.first,sanofi purportedly informed appellants in that the swrip was being merged with the pension plans of other sanofi companies to become the sanofi group pension plan,which ultimately became the group pension plan ssgp.secondly,appellants allege that,sometime between and,kodak informed them that the irs same desk rule prohibited appellants from combining their kodak and sanofi pension plans.lastly,sometime between and,sanofi allegedly told certain appellants that discussions were ongoing,but that they could expect to have their krip and swrip pension plans combined into a single pension plan of sanofi.until the latter part of,when appellants received their retirement election forms from kodak,there were no other allegations of contact between appellants and appellees regarding pension plans.
the kodak lump election form that was distributed to appellants in contained estimates of appellants pension benefits.in calculating the benefits,kodak only considered appellants total years of service with that company.moreover,kodak calculation did not include appellants pending or final average salaries at sanofi,but instead was based only on their final salaries at sterling in.soon thereafter,upon questioning sanofi,appellants also discovered that their sanofi pension benefits would be calculated based only on their years of service at sterling and sanofi,but would not include their time at kodak.according to appellants,under the current calculations,the value of their pension benefits are lower than expected and they will lose certain early retirement opportunities.
based on these allegations,appellants filed their complaint in april.in july,kodak and sanofi filed their respective motions to dismiss under rule b.on november,the district court granted the motions to dismiss in their entirety.this appeal ensued.
in granting the motions to dismiss,the district court initially noted that appellants failed to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the sanofi and kodak pension plans.according to the court,a pension plan can not be liable as a fiduciary under erisa a,a,since it is not an individual,corporation,or other association.decision,slip op.at,wl.that issue has not been appealed here.
as for kodak and sanofi in their corporate capacities,the district court held that appellants claims,as pled,were under erisa.specifically,the court relied on a,which required appellants to have commenced suit within six years of the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation.according to the court,appellants complaint contained no allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or detrimental reliance on a breach of fiduciary duty occurring after april,six years prior to the complaint filing date,slip op.at,wl.the only acts relevant to a breach of fiduciary duty that the court could identify from the complaint were appellees purported misrepresentations regarding the pension benefits and appellants act of reliance in changing their jobs.all these events,however,occurred no later than april.id.
in concluding that the complaint was not timely filed,the district court rejected appellants contention that the complaint alleged that appellants made important financial and general life choices in detrimental reliance on appellees misrepresentations,and that that detrimental reliance occurred within six years of the complaint filing date.moreover,the court found the detrimental reliance allegation to be vague and unspecified,and insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss,slip op.at,wl.the court also rejected appellants assertion that kodak and sanofi had a continuing duty to furnish accurate information regarding the plans,and that they breached that duty after april.according to the court,this continuing duty has never been used to extend the erisa statute of limitations in cases alleging affirmative misrepresentations,slip op.at,wl citations omitted.
the district court further concluded that the fraud or concealment exception of,which would have extended appellants time for filing their complaint beyond april,was inapplicable.for the fraud or concealment exception to have applied,the court required allegations that kodak and sanofi each took affirmative steps beyond the breach itself to hide its breach of fiduciary duty,slip op.at,wl.it noted that,other than the alleged misrepresentations in and,appellants identified only three other communications with appellees the name change of sanofi pension plan,kodak representations regarding the irs same desk rule,and sanofi representations regarding the possible combination of the krip and ssgp pensions.none of these actions,however,in the court view,constituted fraud or concealment.id.
in the alternative,even if appellants had alleged sufficient facts to bring their claim within the statute of limitations,the district court ruled that it would still dismiss the complaint because appellants did not seek the appropriate equitable relief authorized by erisa a b,a b,slip op.at,wl.citing life annuity ins.knudson,d,the court determined that appellants sought legal,not equitable,relief,slip op.at,wl.specifically,according to the court,appellants request for reinstatement of benefits calculated using formulas from prior to transfer of employment,while couched as an equitable remedy,was closer in nature to a legal remedy not authorized by a b.id.moreover,the court noted that the remedy requested in this case would ultimately require appellees to pay out a sum of money upon appellants retirement,further confirming that it was not an allowable form of relief as outlined in.id.
ii.discussion 
our review of a dismissal under rule b is plenary.leveto lapina,cir citations omitted.in reviewing the dismissal of a claim under rule b,we must accept the allegations of the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.id.dismissal is proper only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.id.
statute of limitations 
erisa,sets forth provisions limiting the time when an erisa beneficiary can commence a breach of duty claim against a fiduciary.it provides as follows 
no action may be commenced under this subchapter with respect to a fiduciary breach of any responsibility,duty,or obligation under this part,or with respect to a violation of this part,after the earlier of 
six years after a the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation,or b in the case of an omission the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation,or 
three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation 
except that in the case of fraud or concealment,such action may be commenced not later than six years after the date of discovery of such breach or violation.
this section thus creates a general six year statute of limitations,shortened to three years in cases where the plaintiff has actual knowledge of the breach,and potentially extended to six years from the date of discovery in cases involving fraud or concealment.kurz phila,cir.since the complaint in this case was filed in april,under the general statute of limitations,april is the last date on which a breach could have occurred that could serve as a basis for the complaint.
date of last action 
on appeal,appellants contend that the statute of limitations had not expired when they brought suit because under a,the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation should have been the last date that they acted in detrimental reliance on kodak and sanofi alleged misrepresentations,as opposed to the dates when kodak and sanofi made their alleged misrepresentations citing our decision in in re unisys.retiree medical benefit erisa litigation,cir unisys iii,appellants argue that the date of the last action can be the last date that a beneficiary makes important financial and general life choices in reliance upon the representations of the fiduciary.in doing so,appellants assign error to the district court determination that the date of the last action was the date that kodak and sanofi breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly making misrepresentations regarding the pension benefits in and,respectively.appellants also assert that dismissal of the complaint under rule b was premature since discovery was necessary in order to determine the particular circumstances of each appellant detrimental reliance.according to appellants,if they did not have actual knowledge of the fiduciary misrepresentation,but they acted in detrimental reliance on a misrepresentation within six years of the complaint filing date,the complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations.in appellants view,it does not matter when the fiduciary made the misrepresentation leading to the breach of fiduciary duty.
kodak and sanofi disagree with appellants assertion that the last date of detrimental reliance was the date of the last action in this case.instead,they argue that the last date when kodak and sanofi made their purported misrepresentations leading to the breach of duty was the date of the last action.pointing to the complaint,kodak and sanofi contend that all of appellants alleged misrepresentations occurred in and,thereby making the claims barred by the statute of limitations.moreover,appellees argue that allowing the last date of detrimental reliance to be the date of the last action would contravene the statutory scheme of.according to appellees,is a statute of repose,and allowing the last date of detrimental reliance to be the starting date for the running of the statute of limitations would potentially allow a beneficiary to extend the statute indefinitely,as reliance can be said to occur continuously into the future.
kodak and sanofi also dispute appellants interpretation of unisys iii as permitting the last date of detrimental reliance to be the date of the last action.they argue that unisys iii supports their position that the dates on which they allegedly made the misrepresentations leading to the breach of duty were the date s of the last action,and that,those dates can not logically be later than the dates that appellants relied on the alleged misrepresentation to change employment in and.appellees further submit that even if the last date of detrimental reliance can be considered to be the date of the last action,the district court properly rejected appellants conclusory allegation that they made important financial and general life choices in reliance upon the representations of kodak and sanofi as vague and unspecified and insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.
unisys iii guides the outcome in this case.in unisys iii,plaintiffs were retirees and disabled former employees who filed complaints against unisys corporation for breach of fiduciary duty under erisa.the dispute arose from unisys decision to terminate all of its preexisting medical benefit plans and replace them with a new one.id.at.under most of the old plans,unisys paid the entire medical premium during the lifetimes of the retirees and provided continuing benefits for their spouses.id.the new plan,however,required the retirees to contribute increasing amounts to the cost of the premiums until,eventually,the retirees were responsible for the entire premium.id.
according to the retirees in unisys iii,the date of the last action occurred in november,when unisys announced the termination of the lifetime medical benefit plans and after the plaintiff retirees had retired.id.at.they argued that until the termination of the lifetime plan occurred,there was no actual harm,and thus a claim for breach of fiduciary duty would have been premature.id.this court disagreed and determined that any breach that may have occurred was completed,and a claim based thereon accrued,no later than the date upon which the employee relied to his detriment on the misrepresentations.id.at.consequently,the court rejected unisys announcement as the date of the last action.the court refrained from choosing between the date of the misrepresentation and the date of the detrimental reliance as the date of the last action,because both were agreed by the parties to be the same.id.at.
similarly,in this case,accepting all of the complaint allegations as true,kodak and sanofi initiated the breach of fiduciary duty by purportedly misrepresenting the pension plan benefits in an attempt to persuade appellants to change employment in and,respectively,and appellants relied on those activities at those times.therefore,the date of the last action was in for kodak and in for sanofi.appellants complaint contains no other allegation of misrepresentations occurring after april that are independent of and not mere continuations of the initial misrepresentations that led to the changes of employment.
appellants rely on an exceptional circumstance noted in unisys iii to argue that the last date of detrimental reliance can be the date of the last action.in unisys iii,the court recognized that plaintiffs who retired more than six years before their complaints were filed may still have viable claims if they relied to their detriment in making decisions within the statute of limitations.id.at.the favorable presumption for those plaintiffs opposing a summary judgment motion was that,before the running of the statute of limitations,unisys may have engaged in additional acts of breach that were separate from the original breaches prompting the retirement of other plaintiffs.the plaintiffs who received this favorable presumption had not detrimentally relied when they retired.their reliances were apparently their first reliances,and as the parties stipulated the reliances occurred simultaneously with the misrepresentations.however,appellants in this case detrimentally relied on the alleged misrepresentations in and,at which time their claims accrued.unisys iii did not hold that plaintiffs may reset the clock by later detrimental reliances occurring after their claims first accrued.
fraud or concealment 
in the alternative,appellants assert that the fraud or concealment exception of erisa is applicable to this case,and that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until after appellants received a statement of their estimated retirement benefits in.appellants argue that the common law discovery rule,implicit in the fraud or concealment exception,is applicable when an erisa beneficiary does not know that his or her retirement benefits were misrepresented,but the fiduciary does.in such a situation,according to appellants,the fraud or concealment exception tolls the general statute of limitations until the fiduciary corrects its misrepresentations.at a minimum,appellants maintain that their complaint should not have been dismissed before they were given an opportunity to investigate the conduct of the fiduciary both surrounding the breach and its concealment.thus,if appellants can discover acts of concealment by either kodak or sanofi within the relevant time frame,after april,they can invoke the fraud or concealment exception and defeat the statute of limitations defense.
appellees counter that the fraud or concealment exception is inapplicable since the complaint does not allege that appellees took any affirmative steps to conceal the alleged misrepresentations.citing our decisions in kurz,at,and unisys iii,at,appellees assert that an erisa beneficiary must plead that the fiduciary took steps to hide its breach of fiduciary duty.moreover,they argue,the fact that a breach is or not readily apparent does not extend the statute of limitations under the fraud or concealment exception.unisys iii,at.appellees also dispute the contention that they had a continuing duty to correct any prior misrepresentation.instead,appellees agree with the district court determination that such an obligation has never been recognized to extend an erisa statute of limitations.
we agree with the district court that the fraud or concealment exception is not applicable to this case.as we instructed in kurz,
we now join our sister courts and hold that fraud or concealment language applies the federal common law discovery rule to erisa breach of fiduciary duty claims.in other words,when a lawsuit has been delayed because the defendant itself has taken steps to hide its breach of fiduciary duty,the limitations period will run six years after the date of the claim discovery.the relevant question is not whether the complaint sounds in concealment,but rather whether there is evidence that the defendant took affirmative steps to hide its breach of fiduciary duty.
at citation omitted.we further discussed the standard for fraud or concealment in unisys iii the issue raised by this provision is not simply whether the alleged breach involved some kind of fraud but rather whether the fiduciary took steps to hide its breach.at.
at a minimum,our decisions in kurz and unisys iii require an erisa fiduciary to have taken affirmative steps to hide an alleged breach of duty from a beneficiary in order for the fraud or concealment exception to apply.for example,in unisys iii we concluded that a fiduciary act of responding to questions in a manner that diverted the beneficiary from discovering a prior misrepresentation could make the fraud or concealment exception applicable.id.at.the complaint in this case,however,does not contain any allegation of affirmative steps taken by either kodak or sanofi that prevented appellants from discovering the alleged breach of duty before the statute of limitations expired.the complaint alleges only that neither kodak nor sanofi informed appellants that their pension entitlements,under either the krip or the ssgp plan,would be adversely affected or diminished.kodak and sanofi failures to notify their beneficiaries of any change in the method of calculating retirement benefits or warn them of any misconception regarding their benefits are not affirmative steps,and can not on their own bring the fraud or concealment exception into play.
moreover,we do not agree with appellants assertion that because discovery may reveal appellees engaged in fraud or concealment,dismissal of the complaint was premature.appellants were to know,upon reviewing their own past experiences,whether they had any communications from kodak or sanofi that prevented or diverted them from discovering the alleged breach of duty at an earlier time.to the extent that any misleading communication did occur,or was believed to have occurred,it should have been pled in the complaint,but it was not.indeed,were we to reverse the dismissal here to allow for discovery,we would be permitting appellants to conduct a fishing expedition in order to find a cause of action.we can not do so.furthermore,even if appellants might discover that kodak and sanofi knew they made misrepresentations but decided to withhold that information from appellants,such conduct,as we explained above,is not fraud or concealment.unisys iii,at we held in kurz that,regardless of whether the acts to conceal the breach occur in the course of the conduct that constitutes the underlying breach or independent of and subsequent to the breach,there must be conduct beyond the breach itself that has the effect of concealing the breach from its victims.
this analysis conforms to the statutory scheme of.in unisys iii,we noted that contains a statute of limitations provision encompassing situations where the beneficiary has actual knowledge of the fiduciary breach id.at.thus,we deemed general limit,which does not require actual knowledge,to create a period of repose,which is applicable here.id.appellants failure to notify argument is similar to the equitable tolling argument that we rejected in unisys iii.both arguments hinge on an erisa beneficiary lack of knowledge of a fiduciary breach.starting the running of the statute of limitations on the date of discovery of the breach,absent fraud or concealment,would prevent the fiduciary from being able to recognize a firm cutoff date for future breach of duty claims,which is inconsistent with a statute of repose.thus,we reject appellants argument.since we do not consider a fiduciary decision not to notify the beneficiary of a prior misrepresentation a separate breach of duty falling within the fraud or concealment exception,appellants can not invoke the discovery provision of the exception.
lastly,we respond to appellants strained characterization of several decisions from this court,including unisys iii,harte bethlehem steel,cir,and bixler central pennsylvania teamsters health welfare fund,cir.citing those cases as support,appellants assert that this court found that the discovery provisions of the statute of limitations extended a beneficiary claims which were based upon the fiduciary failure to meet its duty to convey complete and accurate information which predictably and reasonably could result in the beneficiary taking action in detrimental reliance thereon.in unisys iii,as we have discussed above,erisa general statute of limitations is triggered by a fiduciary action,not a beneficiary discovery of the breach.harte and bixler addressed the standard for proving breach of fiduciary duty.they did not discuss any aspect of the erisa statute of limitations,let alone implicate the common law discovery rule in situations not involving fraud or concealment exception.
equitable relief 
as an additional basis for dismissing the complaint,the district court held that appellants did not plead relief falling within the scope of appropriate equitable relief authorized by erisa a b,a b.as they must in order to sustain their complaint,appellants challenge that holding.there is no need for us to address the correctness of
