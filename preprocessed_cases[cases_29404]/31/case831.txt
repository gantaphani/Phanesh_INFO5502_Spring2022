nestle holdings,and nestle transportation company brought a motion to modify and partially vacate an arbitration award entered against it in favor of central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund,stemming from the company alleged failure to make required contributions to the fund.the district court held that the company transferred union work to employees and therefore incurred partial withdrawal liability under the pension plan amendment act.nestle appeals and we affirm.
nestle,though its subsidiaries nestle holdings,and nestle transportation company collectively nestle,transports its products throughout the country via a vast transportation network.that network is composed of independent common carrier truckers,drivers and employee drivers.in nestle utilized approximately drivers to transport goods.all of these drivers were independent contractors.in addition,it employed approximately drivers,some of whom were represented by various local unions also referred to as fund drivers.of the drivers relevant to this case,eight of the employee drivers were represented by teamsters local union,and worked out of the nestle shipping terminal in joseph,missouri,and three of the employee drivers were represented by teamsters local union,and worked out of the nestle terminal in oconomowoc,wisconsin.the collective bargaining agreements cbas with both local unions required nestle to make contributions to a pension plan,the central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund the fund.
the nestle transportation network was split into local lanes and lanes.three of the joseph terminal fund drivers drove local lanes as did one of the oconomowoc drivers.these local lanes were in practice operated exclusively by the fund drivers,although the cbas in effect at either terminal did not specifically describe the work required of the union members.the lanes were routes over which trucks would transport nestle products between two or more geographic locations.the other seven fund drivers drove lanes,along with employee drivers or employee drivers,drivers and common carriers.all classes of drivers drove lanes on an essentially randomly selected basis depending on factors such as the availability or location of the driver or his hours driven under government regulations.in the fall of,nestle reached an agreement with the local unions to close the two trucking terminals in oconomowoc and joseph for business reasons.the fund drivers at those locations were let go,even though nestle need for truckers who were located near those terminals did not end entirely.the arbitrator specifically noted that nestle continued to assign work originating in the joseph area after the closures to at least one employee driver who resided in the joseph area,and therefore was near the same location as the terminated fund drivers.
after the terminal closures,the local runs in joseph and oconomowoc were performed exclusively by independent common carriers.the lanes that originated at those locales,however,were distributed amongst all remaining classes of drivers.nestle continued to assign the trucking lanes in the same manner it had before and using the same criteria of driver availability,driver location,and number of hours driven to determine particular lane assignments.the only difference is that after the terminal closure,the seven fund drivers who previously drove the lanes were not in the available pool from which a driver would be selected.for example,nestle records showed that fund drivers drove the oconomowoc to waverly,iowa,lane in the second quarter of,but employee drivers drove this lane during the first quarter of.similarly,fund drivers drove the joseph to dekalb,illinois,route in the second quarter of.however,after september,of course,no fund drivers made these runs.nevertheless,despite this reduction in the available workforce,the employee drivers did not increase their workload through,primarily because nestle lost a shipping contract in the region.
after the fund drivers were terminated,the fund assessed nestle almost million in employee retirement income security act erisa partial withdrawal liability pursuant to the pension plan amendment act mppaa,b a i.the fund assessed this fee because it determined that nestle was still liable for contributions to the fund on behalf of these drivers because it transferred their work to employee drivers.nestle subsequently submitted a request for review to the fund,asserting that it did not transfer the fund drivers work and therefore was not liable for partial withdrawal liability because the operations out of oconomowoc and joseph effectively ceased upon the terminals closings,as evinced by the reduction in workload.nestle also asserted that the work which was continued from the joseph and oconomowoc locales was not the same work formerly performed by the fund drivers.the fund upheld the withdrawal liability assessment,and nestle submitted its demand for arbitration in november on june,the arbitrator issued his opinion,finding that nestle had effected a partial withdrawal from the plan by transferring work to employee drivers.nestle appealed the decision to the district court which affirmed the arbitrator decision.nestle holdings central states,southeast and southwest pension fund,d.the district court held that nestle transferred union transportation work to drivers when the work was reassigned after closure of the company transportation terminals,and thus partial withdrawal liability for contributions to a union pension fund was properly imposed upon the company.the district court reasoned that the work was assigned in the same way before and after the closures,and was not essentially different in character.nestle appeals.
the question in this case is whether the covered unionized work that teamster drivers formerly did for nestle out of joseph and oconomowoc has been transferred within the meaning of erisa as amended by the mppaa.see b a i.this was the sole provision relied on by the fund in assessing a partial withdrawal liability on nestle.the mppaa requires a company that withdraws from a pension plan covered by erisa to pay withdrawal liability,which is intended to cover that company share of the unfunded vested benefits that exist when the company withdraws.withdrawal liability may be assessed if the employer makes a complete withdrawal from an erisa plan,or,as in this case,if there is a partial withdrawal under in defining partial withdrawal liability,b a i states 
a there is a partial cessation of the employer contribution obligation for the plan year if,during such year 
i the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all collective bargaining agreements under which the employer has been obligated to contribute under the plan but continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement cba of the type for which contributions were previously required or transfers such work to another location emphasis added.
this is a case of first impression as no federal court has before addressed the meaning of transfers as used in b a i the basic rule in statutory interpretation is that plain statutory language governs.olander,cir see also life annuity ins.knudson,d stating that courts must interpret erisa strictly,according to the plain meaning of the language actually used in the statute.the verb transfers as used in its plain sense means to convey something from one person,place,or situation to another.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary.the statute uses the phrase transfers such work to another location where such work applies to work of the type for which contributions were previously required.therefore,if prior to the closures union employees were performing work for which contributions were required,and which was then conveyed to and performed by employee drivers at another location after the closures,then nestle would be liable under the statute 
nestle argues that,as a matter of law,the company did not transfer the work of its fund drivers domiciled at the joseph and oconomowoc terminals to its drivers for whom it owed no c
