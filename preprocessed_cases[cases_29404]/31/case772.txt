background 
badger die casting 
in,purchased badger die casting with financing from lasalle national bank and a series of promissory notes from the former owners.badger employees were members of the united electrical,radio machine workers of america.their collective bargaining agreement required that badger provide health insurance to employees but also allowed badger to the plan with notice to the employees.
health insurance 
initially,badger employees were covered by a united healthcare insurance policy that was funded in part by employee payroll deductions.employee contributions were withheld from paychecks and kept in badger general operating account until they were used to pay the united healthcare premium.
by october,the company was in financial distress and behind in payments to vendors,service providers,and utility companies.in june,badger withheld from employee paychecks intended for the payment of the june health insurance premium.although these funds were deducted,defaulted on the united healthcare premium for june.as a result,united healthcare terminated the policy.
in june,decided to institute a medical plan for badger,as well as two other companies that he owned western rubber,and gac plastics.to administer the plan,entered into a contract with medical benefits administrator mba.mba was not an insurance company it processed claims and provided insurance coverage for medical claims in excess of.
when decided to switch the company to insurance,he instructed the human resources director,teresa palkowski,to post a notice at the company.palkowski initial draft referred to mba as the new plan administrator,but told her to use the term insurance carrier because administrator could be a red flag.in late june,palkowski posted a notice describing mba as our new health insurance carrier.further instructed palkowski to depart from badger past practice of holding a group presentation on a new plan and,instead,have mba enroll employees in the plan in groups of one or two.in march,badger first gave official notice to the employees that the plan was.
although the plan was effective july,due to processing delays medical claims were not presented to badger for approval until late september.did not give palkowski permission to authorize mba to pay medical bills he only approved the payment of prescription expenses.
on april,lasalle national bank foreclosed on badger assets.on may,mba sent a termination letter to badger employees and directed them to send all unfunded medical claims directly to.as a result,badger employees were left with in unpaid medical claims.
badger employees also participated in a k savings plan.pursuant to the k plan,badger initially withheld employee contributions and matched a percentage.employee funds were then forwarded to strong funds for investment,on a monthly basis.had final authority on all checks he decided whether to forward employee funds to strong funds.
in late and early,badger did not fund its k plan.the k contributions withheld from employee paychecks were for december for january for february for march and for april.badger deducted these k contributions but failed to forward them to strong funds.in accordance with instructions,the employee funds remained in badger operating account and were not paid to strong funds.

through his management company,the garrett group,llc,received management fees and expenses from badger.his initial monthly management fee was,which was thereafter increased to,and finally reduced to.in,and,withdrew,and,respectively.around the time that defaulted on the united healthcare premium for june,he directed his controller to pay him.notably,in,the garrett group purchased a million airplane.badger had customers,but trips to see them were very,very seldom.

western rubber.
in november of,acquired the assets of western consolidated technologies with financing from lasalle national bank and renamed the company western rubber.western employees were members of the united steel workers of america.their collective bargaining agreement required that western provide health insurance for covered employees.
health insurance 
western provided health insurance to its employees first through humana and then through trustmark insurance company.western withheld from employee paychecks intended for payment of the june premium.although these funds were deducted,western defaulted on the june premium.as a result,trustmark terminated its coverage of western and did not pay any doctor or hospital claims for the month of june.
in june,instituted a health plan and hired mba as the administrator.western continued to deduct funds from the employees paychecks,since the company intended to continue to provide the same coverage,and insurance benefits,that were always provided in the past.western informed its employees and the union of this change and instructed them to bring their medical bills to the company for payment.
the company controller,allen desomer,cautioned about the risks,given the older ages of the employees,and specifically advised him that an employee,dale garber,had been diagnosed with cancer.told desomer that was working well at badger,and he did not believe monthly health care costs for cancer treatment would exceed.general manager phil hamilton also advised of garber situation and recommended that a separate insurance policy be taken out to cover his medical expenses.represented that he had a plan to provide funding for garber cancer treatments.despite the concerns expressed by desomer and hamilton,implemented the plan and did not take out a separate insurance policy for garber.
western processed the medical claims for the months of june,july,and august.during these months,desomer could not write checks for employee medical claims without approval.in september,western hired mba to administer its plan,which,like the one at badger,included a insurance policy.mba began to administer the plan in september,but all checks and medical claims still needed approval.
in february,directed desomer to limit expenses to raw materials only and to notify the employees that western was closing its doors.the employees were left with in unpaid medical claims.

motion to dismiss 
moved for dismissal of counts one through three and five through nine,arguing that the indictment did not state a cause of action because the collective bargaining agreements did not support an action for conversion.the district court rejected argument and found that once deducted from employee paychecks,employee contributions are plan assets for the purposes of.the district court held that motion to dismiss in essence,challenges the government ability to prove that converted the employee assets of a plan subject to erisa and that issue must await trial.
jury instruction 
prior to trial,requested a jury instruction that the jury must look to any agreements between the parties and the rights and obligations created by those agreements to determine whether employee contributions are plan assets under erisa.further requested an instruction that when a party is allowed to commingle funds,he holds money merely as a debtor to the other party and can not be guilty of conversion of those funds,unless the parties have an agreement that indicates otherwise.the district court declined the above instruction,holding that this information was irrelevant.
at the close of the trial,the district court judge instructed the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty of converting funds intended for payment of health insurance premiums and the k plan,the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant converted funds to his own use or the use of another the funds were assets of an employee pension benefit plan subject to erisa and the defendant acted willfully and with fraudulent intent.the judge further instructed the jury that 
plan assets include amounts that a participant has withheld from his wages by an employer,for contribution to the plan as of the earliest date on which such contributions can reasonably be segregated from the employer general assets,but in no event shall that date occur later than days from the date on which such amounts would otherwise have been payable to the participant in cash in the case of amounts withheld by an employer from a participant wages.quotations and ellipses omitted.
wealth evidence 
also moved in limine to bar evidence of his wealth.the government argued that this evidence was probative of willfulness and intent to defraud.countered that the wealth evidence was too prejudicial.the district court,in denying the motion,agreed with the government that wealth was relevant on the issue of his intent.at trial,evidence of management fees,expense reimbursements,and personal expenditures was introduced.such evidence included a recreational vehicle purchased in june a million home in brookfield,wisconsin a vacation home in florida with a market value of million in november and a million dollar airplane.
verdict and sentencing

ii.discussion 
erisa plan assets 
asserts that the funds deducted from employee paychecks were not erisa plan assets based on the terms of the collective bargaining agreements.contends that the relationship between himself and the employee benefit plans could not support a conversion action.he asserts that the collective bargaining agreements establish that he was a debtor and not a bailee,and as a debtor he can not be liable for conversion at most he merely failed to satisfy a contractual debt.also argues that the employees had a future interest in the funds,while a possessory interest would be required to support a conversion charge.he asserts that the employees do not have a present interest in the unpaid contributions until they are actually paid to the plan,which never occurred.in sum,contends that because he was never required to segregate the funds and never delivered the funds to the intended recipient,the funds never became plan assets that could have been converted.as such,challenges the district court denial of his motion to dismiss and denial of jury instruction on the definition of plan assets.
to determine whether an employer can avoid criminal liability by never applying employee payroll funds to the erisa plans to which they were intended,we must consider the meaning of erisa plan assets.under,
any person who embezzles,steals,or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use or to the use of another,any of the moneys,funds,securities,premiums,credits,property,or other assets of any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan,or of any fund connected therewith,shall be fined under this title,or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
as used in this section,the term any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan means any employee benefit plan subject to any provision of title i of the employee retirement income security act of.
erisa does not define what constitutes plan assets of an erisa fund.john hancock mut.life ins.harris trust sav.bank,d.despite the absent of a definition,the term plan assets appears throughout the statute.plan assets are required to be held in trust,a,to be used for the exclusive benefit of participants and beneficiaries,c,and to be allocated among participants and beneficiaries upon termination of the plan,a.according to a department of labor regulation,plan assets include amounts that a participant or beneficiary pays to an employer,or amounts that a participant has withheld from his wages by an employer,for contribut
