the central question presented by this interlocutory appeal is whether the district court properly certified the underlying consolidated matters as class actions.appellants health net,health net of the northeast,and health net of new jersey,collectively,health net attack the district court certification order based,inter alia,on the assertion that the order failed properly to define the class claims,issues or defenses pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c b.because we agree with health net that the district court erred by failing to define the claims,issues,or defenses to be treated on a class basis,we will vacate the certification order and remand the case to the district court 
health net appeals the district court order certifying two nationwide classes in actions against health net,wachtel guardian life ins.wachtel and mccoy health net,mccoy.health net of new jersey is a new jersey health benefit plan that provides medical benefits to members its corporate parent is health net of the northeast,and health net,is the ultimate corporate parent of both companies.health net of the northeast is health net,eastern division and also owns health net of new york,and health net of connecticut.health net,the nationwide corporate parent of all health net subsidiaries also owns licensed state plans in three western states,health net of california,health net of arizona,and health net of oregon.
within the relevant states,health net subsidiaries offer medical benefits through three different types of network health plans health maintenance organizations hmos,preferred provider organizations ppos,and pos plans.zev and linda wachtel and renee mccoy plaintiffs are beneficiaries in pos plans offered and administered by health net a pos plan permits a participant to obtain health care from either inet or onet medical providers.providers are inet by virtue of negotiating with a health net subsidiary to offer cost savings to plan subscribers via significantly discounted fee rates.onet providers have not negotiated lower rates and are free to charge their normal fees.beneficiaries pay higher premiums for pos and other plans that permit access to onet providers.
the issues in these consolidated cases involve reimbursement in connection with services from onet providers.as noted by the district court,health net plan contracts do not cover an entire fee charged by an provider.plan participants may be held responsible through balance billing by such providers for charges in excess of the amount health net determines to be usual,customary,and reasonable charges ucr for the services provided.the amount for which beneficiaries are liable for onet services is almost entirely dependent on how health net calculates ucr.health net plan terms,contained in various health net contracts,or evidence of coverage eocs state that health net uses a national database to determine ucr.the district court found that health net relies on two substantially similar databases provided by ingenix,known as the prevailing health charge system phcs and medical data research mdr collectively,the ingenix databases.
plaintiffs sue under four provisions of the employee retirement income security act erisa.the first is erisa a b,a b,which permits a civil action by a plan participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.id.the second is a,a,which permits a participant or beneficiary to a enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.id.plaintiffs sue under a for various alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.plaintiffs also bring claims under erisa b,b,for failure to supply information upon request and under erisa,for failure to issue appropriate spds.
plaintiffs allege that,although health net admits that it is required to use databases that are valid and appropriate for determining ucr,health net uniformly uses the ingenix databases,which plaintiffs allege are invalid in that fundamental flaws in the data result in the systematic manipulation and downward skewing of the database ucr numbers.assuming the ingenix databases are invalid,their use to calculate ucr charges breaches the terms of the plans and leads to systematic of providers,resulting in inappropriately high financial liability for beneficiaries in the form of outstanding balances to providers.plaintiffs allege actual losses as a result of.plaintiffs contend that health net must pay unpaid benefits to class members either by using a valid database or by paying the providers billed charges,whichever is less.
plaintiffs also challenge other health net policies and practices,which they allege health net applies uniformly across various plans,providers,and beneficiaries to determine onet reimbursements.these policies include relying on an outdated version of an ingenix database outdated data reducing onet reimbursements when multiple procedures are performed on the same day the multiple surgery rule,despite the fact that plan terms fail to disclose the existence or substance of such a rule systematically reducing or terminating onet reimbursements for services provided by assistant surgeons or the assistant surgeon rule by use of an undisclosed and incomplete list of services determining ucr amounts for pharmaceuticals using the average wholesale price awp,a national number of manufacturers list prices that is inappropriate for ucr and not disclosed by health net and failing to disclose reimbursement policies in eocs and spds as required by erisa.
the district court,by its opinion and order dated august,certified the wachtel and mccoy lawsuits as class actions under federal rule of civil procedure b,and directed plaintiffs to submit a plan for notification of the certified classes.health net filed a petition in this court under rule f requesting review of the certification order.health net also moved the district court to stay the distribution of the notice pending resolution of the rule f petition.the district court denied the stay on november.on that same day,health net filed a notice of appeal and asked this court for immediate review of the district court denial of a stay of the class notice distribution.on november,this court granted health net rule f petition agreeing to review the certification order and granted a temporary stay of class notice until november,which it later extended indefinitely pending the resolution of the rule f appeal.
the instant appeal involves three consolidated proceedings in this court.on august,the wachtel and mccoy cases were consolidated by the district court.on november,health net filed a notice of appeal from the district court order in the consolidated cases denying health net motion to stay the issuance of class notice pending resolution of the rule f petition.that appeal was docketed in this court as.health net appeal of the class certification itself received new docket numbers after it was granted.the rule f appeal in wachtel is docketed as,and the appeal in mccoy is docketed as.these three matters were all consolidated in this court by order entered on november.
this court certified the instant appeal.the claims of the wachtel and mccoy cases raise federal questions under of erisa.the district court thus had original jurisdiction under.we exercise appellate review under e,pursuant to which the supreme court promulgated federal rule of civil procedure f,which provides for interlocutory appeals of a district court order granting or denying class certification.
we review the district court decisions on class certification for abuse of discretion.chiang veneman,cir.the district court abuses its discretion only if its decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law,or an improper application of law to fact.id.internal citation omitted.
federal rule of civil procedure,which deals with class actions,underwent substantial amendment in,and the amendments took effect on december of that year.see a.included as part of the amendments to the rule was subdivision c b,which provides in relevant part that a n order certifying a class action must define the class and the class claims,issues,or defenses fed.civ.c b.
in our efforts to determine precisely what district courts must do in order properly to define those claims,issues,or defenses appropriate for class treatment in a given matter,we find ourselves in uncharted waters.not only are the requirements of rule c b a matter of first impression for this court,but,to our knowledge,neither our sister courts of appeals nor any other federal court has addressed the issue.furthermore,the advisory committee notes accompanying the text of rule make no explicit reference to subdivision c b.nonetheless,we conclude that the plain text of the subdivision,especially when considered in light of the text and structure of parallel provisions in rule,indicate that rule c b requires district courts to include in class certification orders a clear and complete summary of those claims,issues,or defenses subject to class treatment.
current practice often falls short of that standard.certification orders tend to treat the parameters of the class itself much more clearly and deliberately than the class claims,issues,or defenses.in response to plaintiffs motions for class certification,district courts often issue memorandum opinions discussing the allegations in the complaint,the facts of the case,and some combination of the substantive requirements for class certification found in rule a and b.several of these substantive provisions may even lead to discussion of common versus individual issues present in the case.see fed.civ.a indicating that the existence of issues of law and fact common to the class is required before certification is appropriate fed.civ.b requiring that issues of law or fact common to the class predominate over individual issues.
at the conclusion of this type of opinion,or in an accompanying certification order,the court typically states that it is certifying the following class,or uses some equivalent language,followed by a block paragraph describing precisely those individuals to be included as part of the relevant class or classes.although examples of common claims,issues,or defenses presented by the case may be discussed as part of the court commonality,typicality,or predominance analysis,certification orders and memoranda are most often devoid of any clear statement regarding the full scope and parameters of the claims,issues or defenses to be treated on a class basis as the matter is litigated.
we conclude that the plain text of rule c as amended requires more specific and more deliberate treatment of the class issues,claims,and defenses than the practice described above has usually reflected.more specifically,in our view,the proper substantive inquiry for an appellate tribunal reviewing a certification order for rule c b compliance is whether the precise parameters defining the class and a complete list of the claims,issues,or defenses to be treated on a class basis are readily discernible from the text either of the certification order itself or of an incorporated memorandum opinion.
we arrive at this conclusion primarily through textual analysis of rule c b itself.to define a thing or concept is to state precisely or determinately its boundaries to specify or t o frame or give a precise description of a thing.oxford english dictionary ed.according to the rule,those things to be defined in a certification order include the class and the class claims,issues,or defenses fed.civ.c b emphasis added.the above elements occur in a conjunctive,undifferentiated list,indicating that the requirement to define the class claims,issues or defenses is identical to the requirement to define the class itself within a given certification order.id.furthermore,the use of the definite article the before class claims,issues,or defenses connotes comprehensiveness and specificity,rather than illustrative or partial treatment,in defining those aspects of class action certification.
the substantive standard that we have laid out above also comports with and facilitates compliance with the textual requirements and apparent purpose of other provisions of rule.for instance,rule c indicates that for any class certified under rule b or,the court may direct appropriate notice to the class,fed.civ.c a,and that for any class certified under rule b,the court must direct to class members the best notice practicable under the circumstances.fed.civ.c b emphasis added.that notice must,inter alia,concisely and clearly state the definition of the class certified and the class claims,issues or defenses.id.clear and complete treatment of both the class and the class claims,issues,or defenses at the class certification stage will unquestionably facilitate the timely execution of what is almost always the next fact,often a mandatory next step,see fed.civ.c b in class action litigation,namely the distribution of class notice to class members 
furthermore,compliance with the requirements of rule c b as we have defined them today will significantly aid appellate review of a district court decision to certify a matter as a class action.most significantly,it seems that a clear and complete statement of the claims,issues,or defenses to be treated on a class basis will shed light on a district court numerosity,commonality,typicality,and predominance analysis under rule a and b.in addition,rule c a states that w hen appropriate a an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues id.not only is there overlap between compliance with rule c b and compliance with rule c a,but compliance with the former as we define it today will greatly facilitate meaningful appellate review of complex certification decisions regarding the latter.
although we regard the plain text argument outlined above as sufficient to support our holding,we note that in addition to comporting with the text of the rule itself,the standard for compliance with rule c b that we outline today dovetails with the apparent purpose and goals of amending the rule as expressed in the advisory committee notes.as mentioned above,the advisory committee notes accompanying the amendments to the text of rule contain no explicit reference to rule c b.having said that,the notes to rule c a dealing with the timing of class action that in a certification context,one critical need is to determine how the case will be tried,such that in addition to requiring counsel to submit proposed classes to the court prior to certification,a n increasing number of courts require a party requesting class certification to present a trial plan that describes the issues likely to be presented at trial and tests whether they are susceptible to proof.fed.civ.c a advisory committee note.the interpretation of rule c b that we adopt today will aid courts and parties in meeting this critical need by necessitating the full and clear articulation of the litigation contours at the time of class certification 
in addition to the advisory committee notes accompanying the text,the published report of the standing committee on rules of practice and procedure committee report,the advisory committee input to the judicial conference as to whether to adopt certain amendments to the rule,reflects overwhelming support for the adoption of what is now rule c b.more specifically,members of the committee indicated that adoption of the amendment was worthwhile inasmuch as its inclusion in the rule would aid appellate review of class action certification decisions and would facilitate the distribution of class notices that would better enable class members to make informed opt out decisions.see generally report of the standing committee on rules of practice and procedure published september encompassing committee activity as of that date,including,inter alia,comments that the inclusion of rule c b will clarify the issues for the parties and the appellate court,that the amendment will faci
