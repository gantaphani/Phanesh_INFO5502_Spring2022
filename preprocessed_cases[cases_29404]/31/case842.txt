district court proceedings 
the plaintiffs brought their action against the plan in the united states district court for the southern district of illinois.pursuant to a and a,the plan moved to transfer the case to the northern district of georgia.the plan contended that the southern district of illinois was not a proper venue under e,the venue provision governing actions brought under title i of erisa.the plan also submitted that the northern district of georgia offered the most convenient venue to litigate the case because all of the plan documents and all witnesses associated with the plan were located there and all of the events giving rise to the plaintiffs complaint occurred there.at the hearing on the plan motion to transfer,the plan amended its motion to ask the court to dismiss the case for improper venue if the court decided not to transfer the case to georgia.
the venue provision of title i of erisa allows plaintiffs to lay venue where the plan is administered,where the breach took place,or where a defendant resides or may be found e.waeltz and johnson contended that the plan could be found in the southern district of illinois,either because the district court had personal jurisdiction over the plan or because several plan participants lived in the district.the district court determined,however,that the authorities relied upon by the plaintiffs did not support either of their positions.moreover,it pointed out that of the retired delta airlines pilots,only two resided in the southern district of illinois,and of the two plaintiffs,only johnson resided in the district,and he had not retired.therefore,because the plan carried on all of its business in atlanta,because the plaintiffs had earned no benefits while in the southern district of illinois,and because neither plaintiff received any benefit payments in the southern district of illinois,the district court concluded that the plan did not reside and could not be found in the southern district of illinois.therefore,the court dismissed the case for improper venue.
discussion 
this court ordinarily defers to a district court venue determinations unless the district court has abused its discretion.see milwaukee concrete studios,fjeld,cir.when,as here,a case involves the statutory interpretation of a venue statute,however,and not the discretionary interpretation of disputed facts,this court reviews venue determinations de novo.see id.
title,e of the united states code specifies where plaintiffs may bring actions under title i of erisa.it provides 
where an action under this subchapter is brought in a district court of the united states,it may be brought in the district where the plan is administered,where the breach took place,or where a defendant resides or may be found,and process may be served in any other district where a defendant resides or may be found.
e.waeltz claims only that,for the purpose of venue,the plan may be found in the southern district of illinois 
we have not had occasion in our earlier cases to address the meaning of may be found in e for purposes of venue waeltz submits that,in determining venue,a defendant may be found in any district in which the defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction.he reasons as follows.section e provides for nationwide service of process that simply requires minimum contacts with the united states as a whole.therefore,the statute provides for nationwide personal jurisdiction,see board of trustees,sheet metal workers pension fund elite erectors,cir because the defendant is subject to jurisdiction throughout the united states,it may be found throughout the united states and venue is proper in whatever district court assumes jurisdiction.we turn now to an evaluation of this argument.
in interpreting the statute,we look first to the language of the statute itself.see consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d milwaukee concrete studios,at.nothing in the language of e suggests the construction urged by waeltz.most notably,the construction that he urges would render superfluous the other clauses of erisa venue provision.to allow venue wherever personal jurisdiction exists would allow nationwide venue,because e nationwide service of process clause creates nationwide jurisdiction.if such were the intent of congress,there would have been no reason for congress to provide specifically for venue where a plan is administered or where a breach took place.see mcfarland yegen.as this court often has stated,we are loathe to adopt constructions that render a statutory provision superfluous.kopec city of elmhurst,cir see gendron united states,cir in re lifschultz fast freight,cir.
moreover,in the general federal venue statute,congress has defined the word resides,in terms of a defendant amenability to personal jurisdiction,see c.by contrast,it has never defined the clause may be found in those terms.indeed,congress equating resides with a defendant amenability to personal jurisdiction in the general venue statute suggests strongly that congress did not intend the may be found clause to carry such meaning here 
nor do we believe that waeltz can find support for his reading of the phrase may be found from the leading case interpreting e venue provision,varsic united states district court for the central district of california,cir.in varsic,the ninth circuit rejected the contention that a fund could be found only where it was administered.see id.at.judge wallace noted that congress did not intend to restrict venue,but to create a liberal venue provision to remove jurisdictional and procedural obstacles which in the past appear to have hampered effective enforcement of fiduciary responsibilities under state law for recovery of benefits due participants.id.at quoting the report of the house committee on education and labor,at,reprinted in.the court found it significant that the term found had been construed liberally when used in other venue provisions.for example,the fifth circuit interpreted the term found in the venue provision,to allow venue in a district in which a defendant continuously carries on any substantial part of its activities varsic,at quoting braun berenson,cir.similarly,courts interpreting the copyright venue provision,a,had concluded that a corporation is found in any district in which personal jur
