the pillsbury pension plan plan appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of john craig.the district court determined the plan abused its discretion when it calculated craig pension benefits without including certain bonuses he received in.we affirm.
john craig began working for pillsbury in when a subsidiary of his employer,grand metropolitan,gmi,acquired pillsbury.he moved from new jersey to minnesota to work in pillsbury tax department,performing tax services for both gmi and pillsbury.he later became a pillsbury vice president,and addition to being covered by pillsbury standard pension plan which is not at issue in this case he was covered by pillsbury top hat plan,the plan at issue in this case.a top hat plan is so called because it provides deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees,without being subject to the internal revenue code maximum annual benefit and compensation limits.
craig retired in,requiring the plan to calculate his monthly pension benefit,a task complicated by a change of employment which occurred that year and which requires some background explanation.in,gmi changed its name to diageo.in,diageo announced pillsbury would merge with general mills.craig worked on the merger,receiving offers from both diageo and general mills for employment after the merger completion.craig declined the offers.when the merger did not occur on its expected completion date,diageo reclassified certain employees,including craig.effective january,employees staying with general mills after the merger remained on pillsbury payroll,while those leaving were transferred to the payroll of guinness united distillers and vintners north america guinness,a company owned by diageo.because craig was not staying with general mills after the completion of the merger,he became a guinness employee on january.the merger was completed on november,and he retired soon after on december.
craig reclassification as a guinness employee did not end his participation in the plan.as a diageo company,guinness was an affiliate under the plan.but unlike some affiliates,guinness had not adopted pillsbury pension plans as its own,so it was considered a affiliate.both the plan and the summary plan description spd issued to craig explained how a transfer to a affiliate affected an employee continuing participation in and entitlement to benefits under the plan.
the spd provided in relevant part 
if you are transferred to another pillsbury location or affiliate that is not covered by this plan,a affiliate,you will become an inactive participant in this plan.during the time you are inactive,you will continue to earn continuous service,but not credited service.when your pension benefit is calculated,it will be based on your continuous service before and after the transfer,your credited service prior to your transfer,and the plan benefit formula and your final average pay when you actually retire.
appellant app.at.
section b of the plan provided in relevant part 
any participant who transfers into employment with an employer or an affiliate where such participant becomes an inactive participant,employed by a affiliate shall continue to accrue continuous service but not credited service during the period of such employment.any benefit such participant may become entitled to shall be determined on the basis of continuous service before and after the date of such transfer,on the credited service before the date of such transfer,and on the employee final average compensation and the applicable benefit formula under the plan in effect at the employee termination of continuous service.continuous service for such employee will terminate and benefits under this plan shall commence only after employment for an employer or affiliate terminates.
the pillsbury retirement plan plan,b app.at.
in,craig received in regular pay and in performance bonuses for a total of which both guinness and pillsbury considered pensionable pay,that is,earnings used to calculate a pension benefit.craig also received two retention bonuses totaling which pillsbury would have considered pensionable pay if he had still been a pillsbury employee at the time of retirement,but which guinness did not consider pensionable pay.thus,when the plan asked guinness to provide his compensation for the purpose of calculating his pension benefit,guinness did not include the two retention bonuses,and the plan calculated craig final average compensation using the amount reported by guinness.
craig submitted a request for review contending the two retention bonuses should have been included.inclusion of the two bonuses would increase his pension benefit by per month for the period from february through january,and by per month thereafter when he reached the age of.the plan stood by its exclusion of the retention bonuses,indicating its practice has consistently been to include compensation as determined by the last affiliate employer for use in the calculation of final average compensation.app.at.
craig appealed the plan decision administratively.the general mills minor amendment committee committee responded to his appeal,explaining its use of the compensation figure reported by guinness.according to the committee,a literal reading of the plan would not allow any compensation craig received from a affiliate in the calculation of his final average pay however,because a literal interpretation of the plan would cause some vested pensions to,in effect,disappear or be significantly reduced for an employee who transferred to a affiliate for an extended period of time prior to retiring the plan indicated it was using its discretion to use the amount of compensation reported by a affiliate rather than no compensation at all.
after the plan made a final decision denying craig appeal,he filed an action against the plan in federal district court.for summary judgment were referred to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation to the district court.concluding the plain language of the plan,as well as the spd,required all bonuses to be included in the calculation of final average compensation,the magistrate judge recommended craig motion for summary judgment be granted and the plan motion be denied.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation.this timely appeal followed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.fuller hartford life ins,cir.the parties disagree about whether the district court should have reviewed the plan decision de novo or for an abuse of discretion.the plan contends its decision should be reviewed under an standard because the plan gives its administrator discretion to interpret the plan document and the circumstances required to trigger less deferential review under woo deluxe,cir,are not present.craig claims de novo review applies because this case involves a top hat plan.the district court did not determine which standard applies to a top hat plan,concluding the outcome would be the same under either standard.
the third circuit has concluded de novo review applies to top hat plans even when they give their administrators interpretive discretion because a top hat administrator has no fiduciary responsibilities under erisa.goldstein johnson johnson,cir.we agree.t op hat plans should be treated as unilateral contracts and reviewed in accordance with ordinary contract principles because the policy considerations relied upon in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,to trigger review,the supreme court analogy to trust law,and particularly the fiduciary responsibilities possessed by administrators with discretionary authority are simply not present in the case of a top hat plan.id.
the fact that we conduct a de novo review does not,however,alter our analysis as much as it might appear at first blush.as noted,the plan grants its administrator discretion to interpret its terms.this grant of discretion must be read as part of the unilateral contract itself.as a term of the contract,it must be given effect as ordinary contract principles would require.id.at.ordinary co
