backgrounda.facts 
schneider began working for sentry life in.she held various positions at sentry life,ultimately reaching the position of director,underwriting services,national accounts.at.as an employee of sentry life,schneider participated in the defendant plans,sentry group long term disability plan and sentry group supplemental disability plan collectively,the plan.the plan is an disability plan within the meaning of erisa.
schneider began treatment for depression in,and,in,she came under the care of psychiatrist paul samo.samo diagnosed schneider with recurrent major depressive disorder.beginning in october,her depression prevented schneider from performing the duties of her job at sentry life.accordingly,samo excused her from work beginning on or about october.at this time,schneider notified sentry that she was disabled under the terms of the plan.initially,schneider continued to receive her wages under the healthy return plan,a wage continuation plan that sentry life provided to its employees covering absence from work due to illness or injury.at.the healthy return plan is not implicated in this action.
prior to obtaining approval for her claim for disability benefits under the plan,schneider underwent an independent psychiatric medical evaluation ime.bruce heyl,who conducted schneider ime,evaluated schneider and reviewed samo records.heyl concluded that schneider ha d suffered major depressive illness that in the past and currently disables her from performing the substantial duties of her regular occupation,tab at.in his report detailing the ime,heyl also advised sentry that schneider was currently improving in her clinical depression.id.he predicted that her short and long term prognosis for complete recovery was good and anticipated that she would be able to return to work in june.id.heyl also noted that,because a personality conflict with a supervisor at work was contributing to her illness,r esolution of this relationship conflict would facilitate her return to employment.id.at.
in may,sentry informed schneider that her claim for disability benefits had been approved and she began receiving benefits under the plan.in june,sentry notified schneider that her disability had been verified until july,and that the company would require periodic updates regarding her medical condition from her treating physician.
on july,samo recommended extending schneider disability leave through september,and heyl agreed that her leave should be extended until september.samo also recommended extensions of schneider disability leave in september and october.in november,samo recommended that sentry treat schneider as permanently restricted from work due to her depression,tab at.in a subsequent letter to sentry supporting the permanent restriction recommendation,samo noted that schneider had not continued to improve as quickly as he initially had hoped she would and that she had experienced a setback in her progress,tab at.
in order to determine schneider condition,sentry contracted with a company called psybar to conduct an additional ime with respect to schneider.the ime was conducted by michael spierer,a psychologist,on february.
in february,samo wrote a letter the february letter to sentry describing schneider condition.samo stated that schneider recurrent major depressive disorder was currently mild,tab at.he also opined that it would be unwise for her to return to her prior job,because i f she were to do that it would be likely that the depression would worsen.id.instead,samo explained,o ur goals would be for her to find alternate employment.id.
in march,spierer authored a report detailing the results of schneider ime.spierer nine and page report surveyed schneider medical history and reviewed the findings of samo and heyl.ultimately,spierer concluded that schneider was capable of returning to work as of the date of the report,tab at.spierer also indicated that schneider did not require any special accommodations in order to be able to return to work,but he noted that,if schneider were to work under the supervisor with whom she had a personality conflict,she very likely would experience interpersonal conflict with him.id.
sentry sent a copy of spierer ime report to samo to determine whether he agreed with the findings in the report.in a letter to sentry the march letter,samo responded 
i agree that janet schneider is now ready to return to work.she has made slow,gradual improvements in her condition with time.before this point,however,i would have worried about her returning to work.schneider is interested in discussing possibilities at this time.she would be most interested in becoming an independent consultant to sentry insurance.this may provide her with the flexible sic that she desires.please contact schneider to discuss possible job opportunities at this time.
on april,sentry sent a letter the april letter to schneider explaining that it had reviewed her claim and had determined that her benefits should be terminated.the letter read,in relevant part 
based on the february,independent medical exam report and samo letter dated march,you have recovered and can return to work.as a result of this information,no further benefits are due.
samo indicates that you would be most interested in becoming an independent consultant to sentry insurance.if you wish to pursue this matter,please contact the human resources department.
schneider sent an on may,the may,to gary sopa,a senior disability service representative for sentry.she wrote 
i have a few questions related to the termination of my disability 
sentry ime february and my physician,samo,concur that treatment has progressed to the point where a return to work is possible in samo letter of march,he asked that you contact me to discuss the options available in returning to work.your letter of april,simply indicates that,since i am now able to return to work,no more disability benefits are due to me.i did not receive any contact from sentry to discuss options or the process of returning to work at that time.
i contacted sentry human resources on may,the position i held at the time i became disabled no longer exists as the result of reorganizations that have taken place since then.thus,i am now able to return to work,but have no work to which i can return.i am working with liz mcdonald,in sentry human resources,to determine if other positions may suit my background and capabilities.i have also talked with liz about with other firms,as the outlook at sentry is not very promising at this time.
my status is,according to,sic mcdonald,that of a sentry employee.
it seems to me that,given the circumstances,it is not acceptable for the sentry disability plan to simply end the payment of benefits.as a result of my disability,i have no position in which a return to work is possible.i will gladly return to work if i can find a position,whether within sentry or outside of sentry.i would think,though,that assistance in returning to gainful employment should be provided,since the lack of a position for me to return to is the result of my disability.i would also think that benefits,at some level,should continue until i am able to find work,or for some additional period of time while i search for a new position something along the lines of the process described in the return to work section of the disability plan.some rehabilitation efforts may also be necessary if i need to change fields of work in order to find employment.
a review of the decision to simply terminate benefits is in order please let me know what management decides.
sentry interpreted schneider letter as an appeal.in a management protocol form,dated,that refers to schneider as the claimant,it is noted that sentry employees are to d iscuss request presumably schneider of may that,after the discussion,an appeal to the plan administrator was to be completed,tab at.furthermore,in an dated june,one sentry employee noted to another the denial of the appeal from js janet schneider for continued ltd disability benefits,tab at.the also noted that js will be informed of this decision in a letter dated and mailed today.id.
on june,sentry sent schneider a letter regarding her purported appeal.the letter explicitly stated that it was meant to communicate the decision of the plan administrator regarding schneider appeal,tab at.the letter concluded 
based on both the recent independent medical evaluation and your attending physician statement,you are no longer disabled.as such,you no longer qualify for benefits under the disability plan since you are not disabled,no further disability benefits are available.
upon review,the plan administrator finds that under the terms of the disability policy,no additional benefits are available to you as you are not disabled.the termination of benefits is upheld.
district court proceedings 
schneider filed this action,alleging that her disability benefits wrongfully had been terminated that she had not received adequate notice of the termination of her benefits,as defined by and the regulations interpreting it and that the plan administrator had failed to conduct a full and fair review of her claim for benefits as required by.schneider sought relief in the form of either an award of her unpaid benefits plus interest or,in the alternative,an order vacating the termination of her disability benefits and reinstating the benefits retroactively to april.she also requested costs and attorneys fees.the parties submitted cross motions for summary judgment.
the district court granted summary judgment for sentry.in its order,the district court first addressed schneider contention that sentry initial notice of termination of her disability benefits did not comply with erisa statutory and regulatory requirements for such notice.see g.the court concluded that,even though sentry had not effected strict compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for notice,it had achieved substantial compliance with those requirements.halpin grainger,cir.because schneider ultimately did take an appeal from the denial of benefits,the district court deemed sentry notice adequate,even though the april letter did not state the plan provision on which the denial of benefits was based and did not identify the steps to take an appeal.
furthermore,the district court concluded that the decision to terminate schneider benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.in making this determination,the district court relied on the opinions of spierer and samo to the effect that schneider was able to return to work.the district court also concluded summarily that schneider received a full and fair review of the initial decision to terminate her benefits.
discussion 
schneider takes issue with three aspects of the district court disposition of her claims.first,she contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to sentry on her claim that she was not provided with adequate notice of the termination of her benefits.second,she asserts that,contrary to the district court determination,she did not receive a full and fair review of her claim for benefits as required by erisa.third,she submits that the termination of her benefits was arbitrary and capricious.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of a motion or for summary judgment.gazarkiewicz town of kingsford heights,indiana,cir.summary judgment is to be granted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.in considering for summary judgment,we are obliged to view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.gazarkiewicz,at.
statutory procedures and requirements for denial of benefits 
schneider submits that sentry april letter did not meet erisa statutory and regulatory notice requirements.we first shall review those requirements before turning to an assessment of whether the notice afforded to schneider in the present case was appropriate.
erisa mandates that specific reasons for the denial of benefits be communicated to the claimant.see militello cent.states,se.and sw.areas pension fund,cir,cert.denied,d.the relevant section of erisa provides 
in accordance with regulations of the secretary,every employee benefit plan shall 
provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant,and 
afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.
furthermore,federal regulations,promulgated pursuant to erisa and in force at the time the april letter was sent,set forth the following requirements for the notification of an adverse benefit determination 
the notification shall set forth,in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant 
i the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination 
ii reference to the specific plan provisions on which the determination is based 
iii a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary 
iv a description of the plan review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures 
in assessing the notification which a plan has provided regarding an adverse benefit determination,this court has held that substantial compliance with the applicable regulations is sufficient.halpin,at.our determination that substantial compliance is sufficient to satisfy was guide d by the purpose of the statute and regulations,all of which are designed to afford the beneficiary an explanation of the denial of benefits that is adequate to ensure meaningful review of that denial.id.at.thus,in asking whether substantial compliance with the regulations governing notification has been achieved,we consider w as the beneficiary supplied with a statement of reasons that,under the circumstances of the case,permitted a sufficiently clear understanding of the administrator position to permit effective review id.at.
application to this case 
the parties agree that the plan did not comply strictly with the governing regulations.therefore,with the foregoing principles in mind,we now shall consider whether sentry april letter substantially complied with the statutory and regulatory requirements for notice.
schneider submits that sentry april letter failed to comply substantially with section g.she alleges that the april letter did not set forth the specific reasons for the denial of benefits,did not refer to the plan provision on which the denial of benefits was based and did not identify any information that would have allowed her to perfect her claim.schneider also contends that she never had a chance to present her case for continuation of benefits because sentry april letter did not include information on how to submit her claim for appeal.
sentry,on the other hand,contends that substantial compliance with section g has been shown.according to sentry,the april letter identified spierer report and samo february letter as the basis for the termination of benefits.sentry submits that schneider contention regarding the failure of the april letter to inform her of the plan review procedures is moot because,in sentry opinion,schneider appealed the denial of benefits in her may to sentry.
the notice that sentry afforded schneider was indefensible as a matter of statute,r
