hobert buzzard appeals the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the trustees of the united mine workers of america pension plan and trust trustees.the district court found no abuse of discretion in the trustees decision that buzzard was not entitled to a disability pension under the pension plan.we find that the denial of disability pension benefits in this case is not supported by substantial evidence.we accordingly reverse and remand with instructions that judgment be entered in favor of buzzard.
mine accident and subsequent medical treatment 
buzzard was employed as a laborer in the west virginia coal mines from october,to june.on june,buzzard hit his head on an airlock while driving a scoop in the mines.buzzard was immediately hospitalized and treated for injuries to his head,neck,jaws,shoulders,and back.a doctor examining buzzard on the day of the accident diagnosed his condition as blunt chest trauma and acute cervical strain.
on august,john schmidt,a neurologist,examined buzzard for complaints of headaches,neck pain,dizziness,forgetfulness,and irritability.he diagnosed cervical strain and syndrome.schmidt subsequently noted in a letter to the west virginia workers compensation fund that although his physical examination of buzzard was within normal limits,buzzard appeared somewhat depressed.schmidt recommended a course of physical therapy and elavil,an medication.
for several months,schmidt continued to see buzzard in connection with his mine injury,and noted that buzzard condition was steadily improving.in october,schmidt wrote to the workers compensation fund that buzzard was improving and wants to try to return to work.schmidt estimated that buzzard could return to his former occupation as of october.it was not possible,however,for buzzard to return to his former occupation because his job had been terminated when the mine closed in september.
karen pettry,a doctor of osteopathy,saw buzzard periodically from august to april.a treatment note dated august,indicates that pettry prescribed halcion to treat buzzard insomnia and xanax to treat his anxiety on september,she observed that buzzard does well on meds,bad off.xanax does help.much stress in family.pettry renewed his prescriptions for xanax and halcion.her notes from october,reveal that buzzard continued to suffer from anxiety,although he appeared to be less depressed.on june,pettry wrote that buzzard was experiencing chronic fatigue,paranoid delusions,which she believed were related to anxiety and depression,and that buzzard had experienced violent suicidal thoughts.at this time,she added elavil to buzzard treatment regimen.buzzard continued this course of treatment while he remained under pettry care.
ssdi application and medical evidence 
on march,buzzard applied for social security disability insurance ssdi benefits,claiming that he was totally and permanently disabled as a result of an injury to his neck,head,shoulders and jaws in addition to his severe depression and nervous condition.in an april,letter to the ssa,bruce guberman reported that he had examined buzzard in connection with his application for ssdi benefits,and that buzzard was suffering from a number of ailments,including multiple arthralgias,cervical strain,obstructive pulmonary disease,obesity,and tension headaches.buzzard reported to guberman that he had experienced bouts of depression and nervousness since the mine accident.guberman,himself,observed that buzzard appeared anxious and tense and that buzzard had difficulty in relating to the examiner.guberman concluded,however,that based on his examination of buzzard,constriction of interests and restriction of activities due to psychiatric problems appears to be unlikely.
the ssa thereafter determined that buzzard was not disabled.buzzard requested a reconsideration of the ssa denial and submitted a july,letter from pettry stating that,in her opinion,buzzard was totally disabled as a result of coal workers pneumoconiosis,hearing loss,severe depression with anxiety states,insomnia,recurrent prostatitis and hypertension.in addition,pettry stated that between september and november,buzzard suffered from severe depression with suicidal ideation and that his condition required heavy sedation to control violent outburst sic.the ssa,in turn,referred buzzard to robert solomon for an evaluation.solomon reported to the agency that buzzard was indeed suffering from an affective disorder,but doubted the impairment was severe.as a result,solomon concluded that pettry opinion that buzzard was totally disabled was not supported by the medical evidence.the ssa subsequently reaffirmed its denial of ssdi benefits to buzzard.
buzzard was then evaluated by john atkinson,a licensed clinical psychologist,at the request of his attorney.in a june,report,atkinson wrote that t he patient reports the onset of depression after his injury in.he states that since then he has been depressed on a constant basis atkinson further observed that 
the patient is of quite modest intelligence but actually worked fairly steady sic in the mines until he was injured in.he is now lapsed into a severe depressed state,stays in bed all day and is up all night,medication has not helped this and the patient actually ought to be seen for ongoing psychiatric help although he has no money to purchase these services.
based upon his evaluation of buzzard,atkinson concluded that buzzard was totally and permanently disabled due to a combination of intellectual,physical and emotional factors,including severe depression and anxiety disorder.
elma bernardo,a psychiatrist,then evaluated buzzard at the request of the ssa.buzzard reported to bernardo that his shoulders were injured and that he started to become forgetful in after being involved in the mine accident.bernardo noted her impression that buzzard was suffering from major depressive disorder among other physical and mental health problems.in summarizing her report,bernardo wrote that i see this patient as being affected by multiple medical problems,but i am concerned because although he is depressed,he is not on a therapeutic level of his.
buzzard requested and received a hearing before an administrative law judge alj concerning his application for ssdi benefits.on june,the alj reversed the ssa initial decision and awarded buzzard ssdi benefits.specifically,the alj determined that buzzard suffered from severe depressive disorder with anxiety overlay,and that he had been disabled as a result of this condition since june,the date of the mine accident.in reaching this decision,the alj reviewed the extensive record of medical evidence in buzzard file,including pettry treatment notes and the examination reports prepared by guberman,atkinson,and bernardo.the alj also noted that david clayman,a licensed psychologist,testified at the benefits hearing that buzzard disabling condition was a direct result of the injuries he sustained in the mining accident in june.
application for disability pension 
on november,buzzard applied for disability pension benefits from the umwa pension plan and trust.the eligibility requirements for a disability pension are set forth in article ii,part c of the pension plan,which provides in pertinent part that 
a participant who becomes totally disabled as a result of a mine accident shall,upon retirement be eligible for a pension while so disabled.a participant shall be considered to be totally disabled only if by reason of such accident such participant is subsequently determined to be eligible for social security disability insurance benefits 
pension plan,art.ii,pt.c emphasis added.therefore,to qualify for a disability pension under the plan,buzzard had to establish that he was involved in a mine accident,that he had been awarded ssdi benefits,and that he was disabled as a result of a mine accident.
in an august,letter,the trustees denied buzzard application on the grounds that the medical records fail ed to support the conclusion that his depression and anxiety resulted from a mining accident.the trustees subsequently reconsidered the medical evidence and again determined that there was no causal connection between the mine accident and the disabling condition found by the ssa.
buzzard again requested that the trustees reconsider their denial and submitted in support of his request a march,letter from john atkinson stating that although buzzard may have had some emotional difficulties,his depressive disorder began with his injury and the fact that he can no longer control his life but in fact after the accident his body controlled him and his life was at the mercy of others including various agencies,atkinson further suggested that buzzard depression was 
probably due to the fact that the patient had gotten some of his and ego strength from his employment,his role as provider,he has had a stable marriage and on the job he worked for seventeen years having left his job in june,because of his injuries.it is noted that prior to the injury,the patient did have some psychological problems with his chronic anger state disorder but it is noted that he had never left any job because of any kind of emotional or behavioral factors as of the time of his injury.
on july,the trustees denied buzzard application for a disability pension,again finding that there was no causal nexus between the mine accident and the disabling condition for which buzzard was awarded ssdi benefits.by letter dated july,the trustees refused any further consideration of buzzard application,stating that he had failed to establish that a causal relationship exists between the mining accident of june,and the total disability.
on february,buzzard filed suit against the trustees alleging that they had unlawfully denied his application for disability pension benefits.on march,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the trustees,finding that substantial evidence supported the denial of a disability pension in this case.this appeal followed.
we generally review the district court order granting summary judgment de novo.brogan holland,cir.however,in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the supreme court held that a denial of benefits challenged under erisa is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.bruch,at.emphasis added.if the plan confers such authority upon the plan administrator,a deferential abuse of discretion standard applies to appellate review of the eligibility determination.id.because we have previously held that the plan vests the trustees with full and final authority to determine who is eligible for benefits,our review is limited to ascertaining whether the trustees abused their discretion.boyd trs.of the umw health ret.funds,cir.the trustees denial of a disability pension is not an abuse of discretion if that decision is supported by substantial evidence.brogan.it is against this factual and legal backdrop that we evaluate the merits of buzzard appeal 
buzzard contends that the trustees denied his application for disability pension benefits even though he satisfied all of the eligibility criteria specified in the pension plan.if established,this would,of course,constitute an abuse of discretion.see lefebre westinghouse,a trustee has the obligation to guard the assets of the trust from improper claims,as well as the obligation to pay legitimate claims.
in this case,there is no dispute that buzzard has met the first two requirements of establishing eligibility for benefits under the plan buzzard was involved in a mining accident,and he was awarded disability insurance benefits by the ssa.the sole issue in dispute is whether buzzard was disabled as a result of a mining accident.the trustees denied buzzard application for a disability pension on the grounds that he failed to establish this requirement.we agree with buzzard,however,that the trustees decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
an applicant establishes total disability as a result of a mine accident by showing that the accident was the proximate cause of the disability.see robertson connors,cir.an applicant can establish proximate cause in either of two ways by showing a direct relationship between the mine accident and the disability found by the ssa,see chicarelli umwa health ret.funds,cir discussing the direct or single approach method of establishing proximate cause or by proving that the mine injury combined with a or subsequent impairment to result in total disability.see id.at discussing the combination approach to establishing causation.we explained in robertson that 
if the plaintiff was injured in a mine accident and that injury,whether in combination with a previous or subsequent condition,is substantially responsible for plaintiff inability to perform his job and for whatever medical or vocational reasons he is unable to perform an alternative job,then his total disability results from a mine accident.
robertson,at.
buzzard points to the following evidence in support of his claim that the mine accident proximately caused his total disability.first,in august,a mere two months after the mine accident,schmidt examined buzzard and observed that he appeared somewhat depressed.apparently,buzzard condition was serious enough for schmidt to recommend that buzzard begin a course of elavil,an medication.in addition,pettry treated buzzard for anxiety as early as august of.together,this evidence reveals the proximity between the date of the mine accident and buzzard treatment for depression and anxiety.second,atkinson examined buzzard and concluded that his depressive disorder began with the mine accident.third,clayman testified at the ssa benefits hearing that,based upon his review of buzzard medical history,buzzard disabling impairment was a direct result of the injuries he suffered in the mine accident.
fourth,and most important,the ssa administrative law judge concluded that buzzard became disabled on the date of the mine accident.we have previously held that the disability onset date as found by the alj is entitled to great weight in determining whether the disability in question was proximately caused by a mining accident.richards umwa health ret.fund,cir.this date is significant to our analysis as it reflects that the alj,having reviewed all of the medical evidence on the question of disability,believed that a causal relationship exists between the mine accident and the applicant total disability.although the disability onset date is not dispositive,richards,at,in cases where the alj has found that the disability commenced on or near the date of the accident,we have characterized the disability onset date as the critical factor in determining whether the mine accident caused the applicant disability.robertson,at horn mullins,cir.
for their part,the trustees denied buzzard a disability pension based on the following arguments and evidence.first,they contend that buzzard was unable to return to work because he had lost his job in the mines,not as a result of any psychological impairment caused by the mine accident.in a july,letter to buzzard,the trustees stated that 
regarding the temporal relationship between the june,mining accident and the date of onset of social security disability,buzzard claimed he was unable to work as of the date of injury.however,the records show that he had been released to return to work and had informed schmidt that he wanted to return to work.meanwhile,the mine had closed buzzard was laid off and had no job to return to.additionally,he reported to silk on november,that he wanted to work in the future.there is no indication that he was unable to work due to any effects of the injury.
this argument fails.for one thing,the trustees imply that buzzard could have returned to his former occupation if he had not already been laid off.we stated in boyd,however,that a social security disability award conclusively establishes the medical disability of the pension applicant.boyd,at quoting robertson,at.the ssa indeed found that buzzard was disabled within the meaning of the social security act.stated differently,the agency found that buzzard was unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically
