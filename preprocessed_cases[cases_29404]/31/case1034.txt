background.
is responsible for directing the investment of plan assets,a responsibility delegated to pension asset committee the pac.in exercising this discretionary authority,both and the pac are plan fiduciaries.see a.this action arose out of a million investment of plan assets in the granite corporation granite,a hedge fund that invested primarily in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos fixed income securities that are derived from and secured by pools of private home mortgages granite was marketed to pension staff as an investment that would maximize a consistent rate of return for its investors while investing in low risk instruments.achieving a high rate of return hinged on using leverage,which increased the risk to investors from changes in market interest rates.granite represented that it would hedge this risk by using sophisticated quantitative models to maintain a investment position.
the plan invested in granite in.the value of its granite investment increased to million by february,but a significant rise in interest rates in march devastated the cmo market.granite declared bankruptcy in april,and the plan lost its entire investment on the other hand,between and,voluntary contributions to the plan exceeded erisa minimum funding requirements by million,and the fair market value of the plan assets increased from approximately billion in to over billion in.the plan has never failed to pay benefits to its beneficiaries over its year life.
in investing plan assets,a fiduciary must act with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence of a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters.felber estate of regan,cir,quoting a b.a fiduciary that breaches this duty is liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach.a.the secretary of labor and plan participants,beneficiaries,and fiduciaries may sue for appropriate relief under section.a.
plaintiffs filed this action in june,alleging that is liable to the plan under because it breached its fiduciary duties by failing to investigate granite adequately prior to investing in by thereafter failing to monitor properly the granite investment and by allowing the plan to enter into a prohibited compensation agreement with granite investment advisor.following discovery,the district court granted summary judgment on the prohibited transaction claim because plaintiffs presented no evidence that the challenged compensation was unreasonable.harley minnesota mining,d.the court denied summary judgment on the failure to investigate and monitor claims because a reasonable fact finder could conclude that investigatory and monitoring methods and actions were below erisa standard of reasonable care.d at.however,the court ruled that the plan did not suffer a remediable loss if voluntary contributions created an offsetting surplus and invited further discovery and a renewed motion for summary judgment on that issue.id.at.after this ruling,plaintiffs filed the second action asserting the same claims against seven members of pac.
after further discovery on the surplus issue,renewed its motion for summary judgment.the district court concluded that the plan has a sufficient surplus and dismissed the failure to investigate and monitor claims because the granite investment caused no losses to the plan for purposes of a.in a subsequent order,the court held that the claims against the pac defendants are barred by collateral estoppel and dismissed plaintiffs second suit.plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their claims in both actions.
ii.the failure to investigate and monitor claims.
plaintiffs allege that violated the standard of care when it invested plan assets in granite without adequate investigation and monitoring.to recover,plaintiffs must prove a breach of this fiduciary duty and loss to the plan.see roth lumber,cir.the district court concluded that plaintiffs could not prove the requisite loss to the plan 
the court believes,in the unique circumstances of this case,that if indeed has contributed amounts sufficient to put the plan portfolio in a surplus position,the granite investment has not caused plaintiffs or the plan any cognizable harm.
d at.the unique circumstances to which the court referred are the relevant features of a defined benefit plan,which were recently described by the supreme court in hughes aircraft jacobson,d quotations omitted 
such a plan,as its name implies,is one where the employee,upon retirement,is entitled to a fixed periodic payment t he employer typically bears the entire investment risk of the consequences of plan cover any underfunding as the result of a shortfall that may occur from the plan investments given the employer obligation to make up any shortfall,no plan member has a claim to any particular asset that composes a part of the plan general asset pool since a decline in the value of a plan assets does not alter accrued benefits,members similarly have no entitlement to share in a plan surplus 
on appeal,plaintiffs and the secretary of labor as amicus vigorously attack the district court conclusion that there was no loss to the plan.the secretary warns that a decision that an is not liable for losses caused by fiduciary breaches when a defined benefit pension plan is overfunded will have a substantial impact on the ability of the secretary to enforce the statute.we agree that the district court focus on losses to the plan an essential element of the fiduciary liability under a was misplaced.if there is no loss to the plan,then no one may recover from the fiduciary on behalf of the plan,including the secretary.that is far more than need be decided in this case.moreover,the district court conclusion that there was no loss to the plan seems contrary to the plain meaning of a.concedes,as it must,that the plan million investment in granite became worthless after granite declared bankruptcy in april.this loss reduced the pool of plan assets.we can not agree with the court that the granite investment has not caused the plan any cognizable harm.d at.
but that does not mean we disagree with the district court decision to dismiss these claims.in our view,the proper focus is on whether plaintiffs have standing to bring an action under a to seek relief under for this particular breach of duty,given the unique features of a defined benefit plan as identified in hughes aircraft.in a defined benefit plan,if plan assets are depleted but the remaining pool of assets is more than adequate to pay all accrued or accumulated benefits,then any loss is to plan surplus.as hughes aircraft made clear,plaintiffs as plan beneficiaries have no claim or entitlement to its surplus.if the plan is overfunded,may reduce or suspend its contributions.see hughes aircraft,at.if the plan surplus disappears,it is obligation to make up any underfunding with additional contributions.if the plan terminates with a surplus,the surplus may be distributed to.see d dame first bank of omaha,cir.thus,the reality is that a relatively modest loss to plan surplus is a loss only to,the plan sponsor.
in these circumstances,we agree with the other half of the district court conclusion the granite investment has not caused plaintiffs any cognizable harm.d at.the question,then,is whether plaintiffs may nonetheless sue under a to recover on behalf of the plan.we answer that question
