this case turns on whether the administrator of an erisa disability plan abused her discretion.
jordan worked as a senior administrative secretary for northrop grumman from to.she described her job as typing,filing,telephone,sitting,walking,standing,general administrative office procedures.one of her fringe benefits was long term disability insurance under northrop company plan for employees.in september,at age,she made a written claim for disability benefits under the plan.she wrote that she had pain that interfered with performing her job with my present disability it is extremely pain sic to sit,stand walk for any period.my hands fingers are very,very sore achy painful and prevents sic me from performing my every day secretarial functions.i am also experiencing lower back pain swollen feet leg.she stated that her disability was fibromyalgia,had begun in may,and that she was receiving state disability.additionally,she wrote that,i a single parent.it is very,very difficult trying to meet my present obligations with the income that i am presently receiving from state disability.i would appreciate any help that can be provided to meet my monthly income before this disability started i was not able work sic.she stated that her monthly income before disability was and that it was now reduced to in state disability benefits.
the plan was issued and administered by the travelers insurance company travelers,and subsequently by its successor in interest,metropolitan life insurance company metlife.the plan obligates metlife to pay monthly benefits if you become totally disabled.generally,the employee must be absent from work and under a physician care because of total disability for six consecutive months before benefit payments start.for a person jordan age,payments would continue until age so long as she remained totally disabled.under the plan,the term totally disabled means unable to perform all the normal duties of your regular occupation for the first months and completely unable to engage in any occupation or employment for which you are or become qualified after that.if a claim is denied,the applicant is entitled to have the claim reviewed by the plan administrator.the plan expressly confers discretion on the plan administrator,both to construe the terms of the plan and to make factual determinations 
the travelers will serve as the final review committee under the plan to determine for all parties all questions relating to the payment of claims for benefits under the plan and shall notify you in writing about the decision on your review.the travelers has the discretion to construe and interpret the terms of the plan and the authority and responsibility to make factual determinations.
jordan claims that the illness that totally disables her is fibromyalgia.this syndrome,formerly called fibrositis,has traditionally been used for an,poorly understood set of symptoms,consisting of aching pain and stiffness in one or several parts of the body.as we have previously explained,fibromyalgia cause or causes are unknown,there is no cure,and,of greatest importance to disability law,its symptoms are entirely subjective there are no laboratory tests for the presence or severity of fibromyalgia.the consensus construct of fibromyalgia identifies the syndrome as associated with generalized pain and multiple painful regions sleep disturbance,fatigue,and stiffness are the central symptoms,though not all are present in all patients the only symptom that discriminates between it and other syndromes and diseases is multiple tender spots,which we have said were eighteen fixed locations on the body that when pressed firmly cause the patient to flinch the diagnosis is now based on patient reports of a history of pain in five parts of the body,and patient reports of pain when at least of points cause pain when palpated by the examiner thumb although the mayo clinic states that the syndrome is neither progressive nor crippling,the symptoms can be worse at some times than others objective tests are administered to rule out other diseases,but do not establish the presence or absence of fibromyalgia 
objective physical signs,laboratory results,and results are generally negative,and b ecause the majority of patients appear tense and anxious and have no recognizable objective basis for symptoms,the syndrome is often considered psychogenic.this court,however,has recognized fibromyalgia as a physical rather than a mental disease the disability plan in this case limits coverage for mental illness to two years,and that coverage is not claimed.more recently,the american college of rheumatology has issued a set of diagnostic criteria according to the college,t he symptoms of fibromyalgia are potentially soft and may be subject to examiner interpretation.
jordan complained of low back pain and leg pain to her physician,internist nerendranath reddy,who opined that she had fibromyalgia.reddy referred jordan to a neurologist,mihoko nelson.nelson noted that jordan was in no acute distress and freely ambulatory with diffuse pain,and diagnosed fibromyalgia.nelson then referred jordan to a rheumatologist the specialty area for fibromyalgia,brian.noted diffuse fibromyalgia and trigger spots of out of a classic apparently referring to the diagnostic points for pain on palpation recognized by the american college of rheumatology.stated,as his working diagnosis,fibromyalgia arthritis.some months later,she had a flare up of the myalgias a week or so after symptoms.jordan reported that she did her own laundry,vacuuming,dusting,mopping,cooking and shopping,but not as often as she used to,and that she had discontinued her hobbies.
travelers asked reddy,nelson,and for narrative reports speaking,among other things,to her prognosis regarding eventual return to work.none of the three physicians sent the requested reports.despite its requests,which it repeated,metlife did not receive any narrative report at any time from these physicians.it did not receive during its initial investigation though it did later any statement from any of them that jordan fibromyalgia made her unable to perform her work.in january of,travelers denied the disability claim on the ground that while your activities may be limited to some degree by your symptoms of fibromyalgia,your condition is not of such severity as to preclude your ability to work at your sedentary occupation as an administrative.secretary.
jordan appealed,claiming that the condition was too severe to allow her to work.in april,she saw again.this time,he noted fibromyalgia trigger points,that is,points where,when he palpated with his thumb,she reported pain.in august,travelers again wrote as well as reddy.the letters asked them to state,based on the diagnosis of fibromyalgia,what prevented your patient from performing her occupation,and what objective findings prevented her from performing sedentary work.this time reddy,her internist,responded,writing that patient ca function even sedentary work at present because of flare up of her fibromyalgia and intensity of pains.her rheumatologist,again did not respond.
travelers sent jordan file materials for an evaluation by an internist,rodgers,and by a rheumatologist,jeffrey lieberman.rodgers wrote that there is little objective evidence for a disabling medical dx diagnosis and i wonder about a dx such as depression anxiety had prescribed zoloft,an antidepressant.regarding work,rodgers wrote that there is little evidence that the patient is physically incapacitated from gainful employment and that she could not do the customary activities or the work in her job description.lieberman,metlife rheumatologist,faulted the diagnostic impressions of,jordan treating rheumatologist,on several grounds.these included treatment inconsistent with the standard treatment for fibromyalgia,error in how many trigger points were in the american college of rheumatology standard diagnostic criteria,and that the virus he identified as the source of jordan flareup should have resolved within several weeks or months at the most.lieberman conclusion was that the severity of this patient fibromyalgia is moderate,and she should be capable of sedentary work based on her job description.
travelers sent copies of the reports it had obtained from rodgers and lieberman.responded with a terse letter,stating that under her current state of affairs,she is medically disabled from her job as a secretary,but not explaining why.metlife rejected jordan appeal on the ground that her fibromyalgia was not so severe as to disable her from working at her job.
jordan appealed again in october of but did not submit any new evidence that would support her claim of disability.after this second review,done by a different claims reviewer,the administrator issued a final denial of jordan claim.
jordan filed suit.the district court denied jordan motion for summary judgment and granted metlife after a careful analysis of the medical evidence relied upon by travelers and metlife.jordan appeals.
our en banc decision in kearney standard insurance establishes the procedure for review of an erisa determination we review summary judgment de novo the district court and we,on our de novo review of district court summary judgment determinations,must decide whether to review the plan administrator denial of the claim de novo or for abuse of discretion.kearney holds that,when a denial of benefits is challenged in a district court under a b,review of the administrator decision is de novo,unless the plan unambiguously confers discretion on the administrator kearney applies the supreme court holding in firestone tire and rubber bruch that the denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.the supreme court,in firestone,adopted for purposes of erisa review the restatement of trusts principle that w here discretion is conferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a power,its exercise is not subject to control by the court except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discretion.
when we review for abuse of discretion,it is because the plan has put the locus for decision in the plan administrator,not in the courts,so we can not substitute our judgment for the administrator.we can set aside the administrator discretionary determination only when it is arbitrary and capricious.we have held that a decision grounded on any reasonable basis is not arbitrary or capricious and that in order to be subject to reversal,an administrator factual findings that a claimant is not totally disabled must be clearly erroneous.
thus,we examine,first,whether the administrator is entitled to deferential review,and second,whether the administrator nevertheless arbitrarily denied benefits to jordan.
standard of review 
the plan in this case contains the sentence,t he travelers has the discretion to construe and interpret the terms of the plan and the authority and responsibility to make factual determinations that language unambiguously confers discretion on the administrator.we therefore review the administrator decision only for abuse of discretion,not de novo.
jordan argues that the actions of travelers and metlife were tainted by conflict of interest so that they should be reviewed despite the unambiguous conferral of discretion.this argument was also made in kearney,but we did not reach it because we reviewed de novo for the different reason that the plan in that case did not unambiguously confer discretion shortly after kearney,however,we reiterated our rule that the abuse of discretion standard can be heightened only by a serious conflict of interest of course,if the benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.but the standard of review changes with the existence of a serious conflict only.
conflict of interest,for purposes of determining whether de novo review is appropriate despite an unambiguous conferral of discretion,does not mean that the plan has an interest that conflicts in the ordinary sense of the word with the interest of the claimant.although an apparent conflict exists where,as here,the insurance policy is both issued and administered by the same party,in order to establish a serious conflict of thus to substitute a heightened standard of review for abuse of discretion review in erisa cases the beneficiary has the burden to come forward with material,probative evidence,beyond the mere fact of the apparent conflict,tending to show that the fiduciary caused a breach of the administrator fiduciary obligations to the beneficiary.though the claimant obviously has a financial interest in getting the money,while the plan has a financial interest in keeping it,that alone can not establish conflict of interest in the administrator,because it would leave no cases in the class receiving deferential review under firestone.
jordan argues that a serious conflict of interest in this case results from three claimed failings of the plan administrator.she also argues that these conflicts of interest demonstrate an abuse of discretion by the administrator.we discuss each in turn.
jordan first argument is that the insurers failed to obtain a number of leave slips reddy signed.jordan submitted the leave slips to the district court.they are slips reddy wrote that allowed jordan to have her absence from work classified as excused.the first one says vickie jordan is under my medical care since and should stay off of work until june.if you have any questions you can call my office.the rest are similar,each giving her another month excuse.a couple of them mention low back pain or fibromyalgia as the reason,while the rest just state,due to her medical condition.
failure of the insurers to obtain the leave slips does not establish a breach of fiduciary duty that would cost them their discretionary authority or constitute an abuse of discretion.first,they did not matter.metlife obtained reddy statement that jordan was disabled by fibromyalgia before rendering its final determination.the leave slips did not say any more than that and all but two said less.jordan argues that metlife should have asked for these leave slips pursuant to its duty to describe material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim,but these redundant ipse dixits were unnecessary.they would have added nothing.second,there is no reason shown that jordan could not have produced the leave slips.they were given to her by reddy,she knew of their existence while metlife did not,and there was nothing esoteric about them that might impair her understanding of what they were or why they might bear on her disability claim.third,metlife did ask jordan for material such as the leave slips.when jordan filed her first appeal,metlife sent her a written request for any medical documentation that supports a condition of total disability including your restrictions and limitations.metlife could not know to ask for the leave slips because jordan,but not metlife,knew that they existed,and jordan should have produced them when metlife asked her for documentation supporting her claim.where the administrator asks for documents that the claimant possesses or to which the claimant has equal or superior access,the claimant does not produce the documents,and the documents would not have altered the administrator decision,no conflict of interest can be established based on the administrator failure to obtain the documents.
second,jordan argues that metlife was acting under a conflict of interest because it arbitrarily demanded objective proof of a condition that can not be objectively established.the contention is unsupported by the record.metlife denied her claim,not because it asserted that she did not suffer from fibromyalgia,but because it asserted that she had not established that her fibromyalgia disabled her from working.
fibromyalgia is a medical label that,as jordan correctly argues,can not be objectively proved.the american college of rheumatology deems the diagnosis appropriate for an otherwise unexplained condition in which a patient complains of pain on the left side of the body,the right side of the body,above the waist,below the waist,and in the axial skeleton,and in at least of specified points when the examining physician palpates them with his thumb the symptoms of fibromyalgia consist of the patient reports of pain and nothing else.objective tests,such as myelograms,rather than proving the existence of fibromyalgia,are used to rule out alternative explanations for the pain,leaving fibromyalgia as the remaining label for the collection of symptoms.thus if the administrator had said,we will not accept fibromyalgia as a diagnosis unless you present objective evidence of it such as positive findings on,she would have been demanding what can not exist,which is what jordan claims she did.
the administrator acknowledged that jordan had been diagnosed as having firbromyalgia and did not dispute that jordan had the condition,or demand objective evidence that she had it.rather,the administrator asked for evidence that the fibromyalgia she suffered from disabled her from working at her job.metlife letter to her doctors acknowledged their diagnosis of fibromyalgia,and asked based on her diagnosis what prevented your patient from performing her occupation and also asked what objective findings prevented her from performing sedentary work.if jordan physicians believed that the effects of her fibromyalgia disabled her from performing her occupation,those medical experts could have responded to the administrator request for further information with at least some answer explaining why the illness prevented jordan from performing her work as a secretary.however,reddy and merely reiterated their conclusory findings of disability.they did not answer the quite reasonable inquiry of the administrator.metlife wrote in its final denial t he record on hand shows you have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia,anxiety and depression.the documentation does not support an ongoing disability due to a condition or diagnosis.that is not a judgment that she did not have fibromyalgia.it is a judgment that,although she had been diagnosed as having fibromyalgia,the record the administrator had did not show that she was unable to work because of it.
third,jordan argues that metlife ignored her physicians reports,and by doing so,metlife breached its fiduciary duty and abandoned its right to deferential review.but metlife did not ignore her physicians statements that she was disabled it considered and rejected them,after careful consideration.travelers and metlife repeatedly asked jordan doctors to explain why they thought she was disabled.they failed to respond.they gave the administrator nothing but their ipse dixit to substantiate the claim.metlife had jordan physicians records and opinions reviewed by rodgers,an internist like reddy,and lieberman,a rheumatologist like,and both disagreed with her doctors.metlife gave jordan physicians rodgers and lieberman reports so that her physicians could explain why they disagreed.again,they failed to respond.under our recent decision after remand in black decker disability nord,we held that the failure of an employee physician to respond to inquiries by the plan administrator undermined evidence in the petitioner favor just such a failure occurred here.thus we are bound to treat jordan treating physicians opinions that she was disabled by her fibromyalgia as undermined,which is to say less reliable or unreliable.
somebody has to make a judgment as to whether a medical condition prevents a person from doing her work,and the governing instrument assigns the discretion to the claims administrator.with a condition such as fibromyalgia,where the applicant physicians depend entirely on the patient pain reports for their diagnoses,their ipse dixit can not be unchallengeable.that would shift the discretion from the administrator,as the plan requires,to the physicians chosen by the applicant,who depend for their diagnoses on the applicant reports to them of pain.that the administrator ultimately rejects the applicant physicians views does not establish that it ignored them.
because jordan has failed to demonstrate that the conflicting interest caused a breach of the administrator fiduciary duty to the beneficiary,we review her denial of disability benefits for abuse of discretion.
ii.review of record 
our circuit approach to review of erisa cases was changed by the recent supreme court decision in black decker disability plan nord we had taken the position that an erisa plan administrator must either accept the opinion of a claimant treating physician,or,if the administrator rejects that opinion,come forward with specific reasons for that decision,based on substantial evidence in the record.we imported this standard from the one the social security administration must use under its own regulations for social security disability cases as a practical matter,the standard gives especially great weight to the opinion of a claimant treating physician.
in the panel decision in nord,we had roundly reversed a summary judgment that failed to give this preference to a treating physician opinion,and the supreme court roundly reversed us,holding that courts have no warrant to order application of a treating physician rule to employee benefit claims made under erisa.rejecting all of our reasons for the rule,the court held,nothing in the act suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.nor does the act impose a heightened burden of explanation on administrators when they reject a treating physician opinion.nor was there as much room for judicial innovation in the absence of regulation by the secretary of labor,because the statute engaged an administrative agency to interpret the act 
the court emphasized the inappropriateness of importing social security rules into the erisa context.in contrast to the obligatory nationwide social security program,nothing in erisa requires employers to establish employee benefits plans.nor does erisa mandate what kinds of plans employers must provide.employers have a large leeway to design plans,so unlike a social security claim,the validity of a claim is likely to turn in large part on interpretation of terms in the plan at issue rather than on a uniform set of criteria 
the penultimate paragraph of nord is as follows 
plan administrators,of course,may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant reliable evidence,including the opinions of a treating physician.but,we hold,courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant physician nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician evaluation.
this paragraph quite plainly holds that a treating physician opinion gets no special weight and can be rejected on the basis of reliable evidence with no discrete burden of explanation.nord does not set out any new framework for reviewing administrator denials.rather,it rejects our court treating physician rule and otherwise leaves erisa review alone,thus prohibiting us from overturning discretionary decisions by administrators because they failed to defer to treating physicians opinions.
consistently with the statute,firestone,and nord,we turn to the deferential review of the record that we must perform,as set out by our law before we erroneously grafted the treating physician rule onto it.the statute requires the plan administrator to set forth the specific reasons for denial of a claim,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant,and must afford a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review by the administrator of adverse decisions principles of trust law are imported into erisa,and t rust principles make a deferential standard of review appropriate when a trustee exercises discretionary powers.
deferential review,of course,does not mean no review.if the administrator decision is arbitrary,as where the administrator arbitrarily refuse s to credit a claimant reliable evidence,the adm
