ferrer,poirot wansbrough,the law firm and steven mestemacher appeal the district court grant of the summary judgment motion of bombardier aerospace employee welfare benefits plan the plan,an,employee welfare benefit plan,to enforce the terms of the plan reimbursement provision against the law firm and mestemacher.they also appeal the district court denial of their respective motions to dismiss the plan action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim,as well as its denial of their joint motion for summary judgment.we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
background 
the plan was established by bombardier aerospace to provide managed care services for its employees and their dependents mestemacher was an employee of bombardier aerospace and a participant in the plan.after he was injured in an automobile accident,he sought from the plan for medical expenses.the plan paid mestemacher medical expenses in that amount,subject to a reduction,reimbursement and subrogation provision contained in the plan documents.that provision gave the plan the right to recover or subrogate of the benefits paid by the plan for covered persons to the extent of a ny judgment,settlement,or payment made or to be made,because of an accident,including but not limited to insurance.the documents further specified that attorneys fees and court costs are the responsibility of the participant,not the plan.
mestemacher retained the law firm on a contingent fee basis to seek recovery from the tortfeasor responsible for the automobile accident.after negotiating a settlement,the law firm received the settlement payment on mestemacher behalf and placed the funds in a trust account at bank of america in the law firm name.
b.the instant litigation 
this action arises out of the plan efforts to obtain reimbursement for the funds advanced to mestemacher.the plan filed suit in district court against the law firm,mestemacher,and bank of america before mestemacher settlement funds were ever disbursed to him from the law firm trust account at bank of america in its efforts to recover the funds that it had advanced to mestemacher for medical expenses,the plan sought the imposition of a constructive trust over of the funds being held for mestemacher in the law firm trust account,a declaration that the plan is entitled to ownership of that amount out of the settlement funds that remained in the trust account,an order directing the law firm and bank of america to execute any instruments necessary to transfer legal title of the converted property to the plan,and a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prohibiting the law firm from disbursing the share of the settlement funds claimed by the plan.
in an agreed order,the law firm consented to hold of the settlement proceeds in its trust account,an amount more than sufficient to satisfy the plan reimbursement demand.the law firm nevertheless maintained that it was entitled to of the proceeds of the settlement plus costs,by virtue of its contingent fee agreement with mestemacher.the law firm and mestemacher each filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,contending that a of erisa does not provide a cause of action against an entity like the law firm,which is neither a plan fiduciary nor a signatory to the plan,and does not authorize the plan claim for a constructive trust over funds not in the possession of its participant,mestemacher.
agreeing with the plan assertion that it was seeking equitable relief within the contemplation of a,the district court accepted subject matter jurisdiction over the plan action and denied mestemacher and the law firm motions to dismiss.agreeing further that the terms contained in the plan documents provide a right of reimbursement,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plan and ordered the law firm to transfer to the plan the sum of from the settlement proceeds being held in its trust account.this judgment further ordered that nothing be deducted from the plan funds for attorneys fees and costs.
citing our opinion in company.group benefits plan for salaried and hourly employees whitehurst the district court observed that the plan contained clear and unambiguous reimbursement provisions,including a provision allowing the plan reimbursement from third party beneficiaries such as settlement proceeds.as for whether the plan had stated a claim under a,the court noted that the plan did not seek to impose in personam liability on any of the defendants,but merely sought the in rem imposition of a constructive trust over funds in the trust account.thus,the district court concluded,the plan claim was for appropriate equitable relief under a and fell comfortably within that jurisdictional grant.finally,the court refused to apply either the texas or the federal version of the common fund doctrine to block the plan recovery,noting that the plan expressly provides that attorney fees and court costs are the responsibility of mestemacher and not the plan.final judgment was entered in the plan favor,and mestemacher and the law firm timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo both a grant of a motion to dismiss and a grant of a motion for summary judgment in our de novo review of a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss under either rule b or b,we apply the same standard as does the district court a claim may not be dismissed unless it appears certain that the plaintiff can not prove any set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief.
subject matter jurisdiction 
to determine whether the district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over the instant action,we first must decide whether a authorizes the plan suit for a constructive trust over the funds held in the law firm trust account the law firm and mestemacher assert two bases for holding that a does not authorize the plan suit.they first contend that,because the law firm was not a signatory to the plan,it is not a fiduciary thus the plan can not maintain an action for equitable relief against the law firm under a.they contend secondly that the plan action for a constructive trust is not one typically available in equity and thus falls outside a jurisdictional grant.
the universe of possible defendants under a.
section a authorizes a civil action by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this title or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this title or the terms of the plan.the law firm and mestemacher contend that this authorization is contingent on the existence of a professional or contractual relationship between the plan and the particular defendant that is subject to suit.in other words,according to them,an entity must owe a duty to an erisa plan before it can properly be named as a defendant in a a suit for equitable relief.because it is not a signatory of the plan,insists the law firm,it owes no fiduciary duty to the plan,and thus no cause of action can be maintained against it under a we disagree.
although neither we nor the supreme court has squarely addressed the question whether a plan participant or beneficiary attorney who possesses disputed settlement funds on his client behalf can be subject to suit under a,the supreme court has ruled that a liability is not dependent on an entity status as a plan fiduciary.in harris trust and savings bank salomon smith barney,the court squarely held that a authorizes suit against a party in interest to a transaction prohibited under a in so holding,the court rejected the seventh circuit holding that no cause of action exists under a absent a substantive provision of erisa expressly imposing a duty on the party being sued.the court observed that a admits of no limit aside from the appropriate equitable relief caveat on the universe of possible defendants.indeed,the court noted that,in contrast to other provisions of erisa which expressly delineate the entities subject to suit a makes no mention at all of which parties may be proper defendants.this is because a itself imposes certain duties,and therefore liability under that provision does not depend on whether erisa substantive provisions impose a specific duty on the party being sued.
the litigation in harris trust arose out of a soured business deal between an erisa plan and a party in interest.national investment services of america nisa had been hired by the plan administrator to act as an investment manager for the plan because it had discretionary control over plan assets,nisa qualified as a plan fiduciary salomon smith barney,salomon furnished the plan with services at the direction of the fiduciaries,thus qualifying under as a party in interest.during the relevant time,salomon sold to the plan,through nisa,interests in several motel properties that later turned out to be worthless 
on learning of the nature of this transaction,the plan administrator and its trustee filed suit against salomon under a,claiming,inter alia,that nisa,as plan fiduciary,had caused the plan to engage in a per se prohibited transaction under a in purchasing the motel interests from salomon.salomon countered that a authorizes suit only against the party expressly constrained by a,namely,the fiduciary who caused the party to enter into the prohibited transaction,and not the counterparty to the transaction.the seventh circuit agreed with salomon,but the supreme court reversed for the reasons stated above therefore,even though,in the instant litigation,the law firm is not a party in interest,as that term is defined by erisa the supreme court reasoning in harris trust influences us to conclude today that a authorizes a cause of action against a,non party in interest when he holds disputed settlement funds on behalf of a client who is a traditional erisa party.as harris trust makes clear,an entity need not be acting under a duty imposed by one of erisa substantive provisions to be subject to liability under a.
to this end,we note that the law firm reliance on the seventh circuit opinion in health cost controls of illinois,in support of the law firm contrary an entity must be a plan fiduciary before it can be properly named as a defendant in a a badly misplaced.the question before the health cost court was not,as here,which entities can be subject to suit under a,but rather which entities are entitled to bring suit under a.in health cost,the seventh circuit addressed,inter alia,whether the assignee of an erisa plan reimbursement claims qualified as an erisa fiduciary and thus as a proper plaintiff in a suit for a constructive trust under a.although the court noted that a lawyer hired by an erisa plan to bring suit on the plan behalf is not an erisa fiduciary,and thus not a proper plaintiff to a a action,it held that,because an assignee of a plan reimbursement claims exercises greater discretion over the plan assets than does the plan lawyer,the assignee qualified as a fiduciary and thus as a proper plaintiff under a 
without a doubt,the text of a places limits on the proper plaintiffs to a suit for equitable relief as the language of that provision expressly states,a civil action for equitable relief may be brought only by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary of an erisa plan congress did not see fit,however,to include a similar limitation on the set of proper defendants to a a action,and we decline the law firm invitation to impose such limits judicially today 
in sum,the law firm status as a would have some relevance to this case if the plan were seeking to saddle the lawyers with personal liability for the breach of a fiduciary duty.as it stands,however,the only action that the plan asserts is one for equitable in rem relief under a.as liability under that provision does not depend on whether a substantive provision of erisa imposes a duty on the particular defendant subject to suit,we hold that the law firm,as counsel for the plan participant and stake holder of specifically identifiable settlement funds in a trust that beneficiary comfortably within the universe of possible defendants subject to suit under that provision.
appropriate equitable relief under a 
the law firm and mestemacher contend next that,despite styling its action as one for a constructive trust over the funds contained in the law firm trust account,the plan actually seeks to impose personal liability on the defendants to enforce mestemacher contractual reimbursement obligation to the plan for the amount he received in benefits.thus,they argue,the plan suit is essentially legal in distinguished from falls outside the scope of appropriate equitable relief permitted by a.the plan,we because it seeks to recover specifically identifiable funds that are in the constructive possession and the legal control of the participant but belong in good conscience to the plan,its action for a constructive trust in no way seeks to impose personal liability on either defendant.instead,the plan continues,it seeks relief that indeed is equitable in nature and thus authorized by a.
in mertens hewitt associates,the supreme court interpreted appropriate equitable relief under a to include only those categories of relief that were typically available in equity.subsequently,the court,in life annuity insurance knudson,elaborated on the distinction between legal and equitable relief,stating that a plaintiff could seek restitution in equity,ordinarily in the form of a constructive trust or an equitable lien,where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.on the other hand,reasoned the court,if the property sought to be recovered or its proceeds have been dissipated so that no product remains,the plaintiff claim is only that of a general creditor,and the plaintiff can not enforce a constructive trust of or an equitable lien upon other property of the defendant.in such an instance,the plaintiff is seeking a legal imposition of personal liability on the defendant to pay a sum of money to which the plaintiff is his claim falls outside a jurisdictional grant 
recently,in bauhaus usa,copeland we interpreted mertens and knudson in the context of a plan administrator suit to recover benefits previously paid to a plan beneficiary,after settlement funds from a third party tortfeasor were received on behalf of the beneficiary.the administrator of the plan sought the imposition of a constructive trust over the portion of the funds that had been placed in the registry of the mississippi chancery court,pursuant to the terms of a tort settlement agreement,to satisfy any liens against the funds focusing on the language in knudson regarding the beneficiary possession of the disputed funds,the panel majority in bauhaus found the facts of the case before it legally indistinguishable from those considered by the supreme court in knudson the court observed that the disputed funds in knudson were outside the possession and control of the beneficiary,having been placed in a special needs trust to cover the beneficiary medical expenses reasoning that funds placed in the court registry were just as much beyond the possession and control of the beneficiary as those placed in a special needs trust,the panel majority held that the plan suit did not lie in equity and was therefore unauthorized by a 
although the facts of knudson and bauhaus resemble those in mestemacher case in several respects,those cases are significantly distinguishable from mestemacher.to verify this conclusion,one need only compare the facts of these three cases by answering the relevant inquiry does the plan seek to recover funds that are specifically identifiable,that belong in good conscience to the plan,and that are within the possession and control of the defendant beneficiary in both knudson and bauhaus,as in the instant case,the benefit plans sought to recover funds from a specifically identifiable corpus of money that they had paid out previously as benefits.likewise,in each case,the plan terms contained an express,unambiguous reimbursement provision which made the disputed funds belong in good conscience to the plan.it is,however,the third element of the possession and control over the disputed distinguishes knudson and bauhaus from the case before us today.
in knudson and bauhaus,the beneficiary had neither actual nor constructive possession or control over the funds.in knudson,the funds had been placed in a special needs trust,as mandated by california law,to provide for the beneficiary medical care,and the trustee was totally independent of the plan beneficiary.similarly,in bauhaus,the funds had been deposited in the state court registry in anticipation of an interpleader action to determine their ownership.obviously,that court was totally independent of the plan beneficiary.here,in stark contrast,the funds that the plan is seeking to recover belong to the participant and are simply being held in a bank account in the name of the participant attorneys,who are indisputably his agent.unlike the beneficiaries in knudson and bauhaus,the plan participant,mestemacher,has ultimate control over,and thus constructive possession of,the disputed funds.the law firm and mestemacher concede that the law firm is merely holding the funds in its trust account on mestemacher mestemacher is legally obligated to disburse the funds to mestemacher the moment he directs their release.this crucial distinction is more than sufficient to warrant a finding that the plan action is indeed equitable in nature.
the seventh circuit recent opinion in administrative committee of the stores.associates health and welfare plan varco offers further support for our determination that the plan action for a constructive trust lies in equity in varco,the erisa plan sought to enforce the provisions of a subrogation clause against a participant through imposition of a constructive trust over settlement funds from a third party tortfeasor the participant attorney had accepted delivery of the funds from the tortfeasor on the participant behalf prior to the plan filing suit and,after taking out an amount sufficient to cover his fees,the lawyer had placed the remaining funds in a reserve account in the participant name noting that the participant had control over the disputed funds,the funds were identifiable,and had not been dissipated,and the funds,in good conscience,belonged to the plan,the seventh circuit held that the plan action for a constructive trust was equitable in nature and therefore authorized by a 
in making the same determination today,we remain unpersuaded by the contention voiced by the law firm during oral argument to the effect that mestemacher lacks possession and control over the share of the contained in the trust account to which the law firm asserts ownership by virtue of its contingent fee agreement with mestemacher.this assertion ignores mestemacher contractual reimbursement obligation to the plan,which requires him to reimburse the plan the full amount of the benefits that he had received from the plan and to do so out of any recovery,without deduction for attorney fees and costs.this reimbursement obligation to the plan precluded mestemacher from contracting away to the law firm that which he did not own himself,namely,the right to all or any portion of the that rightfully belonged to the plan.in essence,mestemacher could not create a greater right in the funds by virtue of entering the contingent fee arrangement with the law firm than mestemacher had himself.
in addition,mestemacher contingent fee agreement does not restrict his obligation to compensate the law firm solely to the proceeds of his recovery.rather,that agreement creates an in personam obligation,requiring mestemacher to pay counsel an amount equivalent to of his recovery.mestemacher is personally responsible to the law firm for its attorneys fees in an amount equal to of his recovery.the fact that he may have to satisfy some part or even all of this personal obligation out of his own pocket in no way diminishes his reimbursement obligation to the plan the funds recovered from his tortfeasor.we are satisfied that neither mestemacher contingency fee agreement with the law firm nor the location of the settlement funds in the trust account affects his legal possession and control over the disputed.our conclusion in this regard is consistent with judge posner opinion for the seventh circuit in stores.health and welfare plan wells in which that court held,on substantially similar facts,that a plan administrator a suit for a constructive trust over settlement funds presumed to be held in escrow by the participant attorney nestle d comfortably within erisa concept of equity.
having closely examined the substance of the relief sought in the case before us,we are convinced that,in its efforts to recoup the amount paid to mestemacher in benefits,the plan does not seek to impose personal liability on either mestemacher or his counsel.thus,we hold the plan requested imposition of a constructive trust over specifically identifiable settlement funds held in the trust account of the law firm as agent for be equitable in nature.accordingly,we further hold that a authorizes the plan claim for relief,and we affirm the district court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over this action 
actual fraud and unjust enrichment 
we turn next to the question whether a showing of either actual fraud or unjust enrichment,or both,on the part of mestemacher and the law firm is required before a constructive trust can be imposed on the disputed funds.noting correctly that erisa does not specify the elements of a constructive trust in a a action the law firm and mestemacher maintain that this lacuna in the statutory text should be filled by texas law.under that state law,a plaintiff seeking a constructive trust must establish,inter alia,the breach of a fiduciary relationship or,alternatively,actual fraud,and unjust enrichment of the wrongdoer 
in recognition of erisa overarching aim of national uniformity,we have consistently held that any hiatus in erisa text must be filled by application of federal common law rather than the law of any particular state accordingly,texas law is not directly applicable to the plan claim,and the plan will not be required to establish actual fraud and unjust,that is,some basis exists for concluding that these elements are required under a federal common law standard for the imposition of a constructive trust.
although the law firm and mestemacher argue alternatively that we should incorporate the texas law elements of actual fraud and unjust enrichment into the federal common law rule,federal common gaps in erisa statutory be defined solely by reference to the law of but a single state.this is especially true when adherence to the strictures of texas law would require the plan to establish actual fraud on the part of either mestemacher or the law firm,an element that has never been required by the supreme court or this circuit.indeed,as discussed in the preceding section,knudson requires a a plaintiff seeking a constructive trust to show only the existence of money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff that can clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession,and makes no mention of the necessity of showing actual fraud or wrongdoing on the part of the defendant neither does bauhaus,which contains our most recent discussion of the circumstances in which a constructive trust may be imposed under a,suggest that a showing of actual fraud or wrongdoing is required.
further,as did the knudson court in its efforts to define the contours of appropriate equitable relief under a,we look to standard current works,such as dobbs,palmer,corbin,and the restatements in ascertaining the federal common law rule to be applied of those works,two that have squarely considered whether a showing of fraud or wrongdoing is required for imposition of a constructive trust have concluded that such a trust may properly be imposed in the absence of fraud based on these expressions,as well as the absence of any indication in our precedent or that of the supreme court to the effect that federal common law requires that actual fraud be e
