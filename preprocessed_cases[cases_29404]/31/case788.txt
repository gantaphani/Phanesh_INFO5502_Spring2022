earlene jenkins,who brought this action under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of plan administrator michael yager and her former employer mid america motorworks mid america.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court,and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
jenkins was an employee of mid america,an distributor,from august through september.michael yager owns and operates mid america and serves as the company president.
in,mid america established a and pension plan for the company employees.at all times relevant to this litigation,mid america was the plan administrator and yager was the plan trustee.the plan was prepared by rsm mcgladrey,and was reviewed by mid america attorneys.dwight erskine,the registered principal of raymond james financial services in effingham,illinois,also advised yager regarding the various funds available for the investment of plan funds,and yager purchased the funds for the plan through erskine office 
under the portion of the plan,mid america contributes a discretionary amount to the plan at the end of the year that amount then is divided among the participants.the plan requires yager to direct the investment of the discretionary contribution by mid america.the assets are invested in four funds marketed by american funds american mutual fund,the growth fund of america growth fund,growth fund and the capital world growth income capital world fund.under the plan,employees are eligible to collect their earnings along with their pension earnings upon termination,retirement,total and permanent disability,or death.during the years through,the plan sustained losses of over 
the plan also contains a pension component.employees may defer up to fifteen percent of their salary for investment into the pension portion of the plan mid america matches that contribution up to the legal limit of six percent of that deferral.the plan provides that plan participants may make limited investment directions as to the salary reduction and the plan contributions the k assets by choosing to direct the investment of those assets among four funds marketed by american funds growth fund,the growth fund of america growth fund,the income fund of america income fund and the cash management trust of america cash management fund.these options have not changed since.during the calendar years of,and,the plan k assets sustained investment losses of over 
yager testified in his deposition that he never reviewed the participants individual k investment decisions.from,participants could change their investment directions only once per year.beginning in,participants could change investment directions once every six months.prior to,each plan participant received a form letter in november or december that set forth the participant level of salary deferral and the funds in which the participant k funds were invested.the letter further stated that the participant could make changes to the investment of their funds those changes would be effective january of the following year.plan participants also were given a statement of the balance of their k assets once a year,after the end of the calendar year.under this arrangement,as a practical matter,plan participants had to make investment choices for the following year before they knew how their earlier fund choices had performed in the previous year.
additionally,mid america conducted an annual meeting in december for all participants in the plan at that meeting,erksine explained the performance of the funds over the past year and the options available to participants,as well as answered any questions.however,jenkins attended only one of these annual meetings during her employment with mid america.the materials from this meeting also were left in the break room so that employees could review them.erskine also stated that he was available in person and by telephone in his office to answer any questions about the four funds there is no indication from the record that jenkins availed herself of his services.
district court proceedings 
jenkins brought this action against yager and mid america,alleging that yager performance fell below the standard imposed on erisa trustees.the district court denied jenkins motion for summary judgment on december.in doing so,the district court quoted jenkins summary of her position 
by providing plan participants with unduly restrictive means to direct investments,by failing to prudently monitor the p lan investments,and by failing to operate the p lan according to erisa,yager and mid america breached their fiduciary duties to the p lan.
the district court began by discussing jenkins third contention.section of erisa,a,states that all assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust by one or more trustees,and that those named trustees shall have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of the plan.there are two explicit exceptions to this rule found in a and a,although as discussed later,neither exception applies to the mid america plan.jenkins contended that yager and mid america had violated erisa by delegating control over plan assets to plan participants.however,the district court noted that section c of erisa absolves a fiduciary from liability caused by plan participants when the pension plan provides for individual accounts and permits a participant or beneficiary to exercise control over the assets in his account.c.the district court stated that a plain reading of that language suggests that participant control is assumed permissible in the first instance,for the statute absolves a fiduciary of liability in the case of a plan providing for individual accounts and allowing participant control.at.the district court then held that an implied exception to erisa provision in section existed for plans that allow participant control,and therefore,yager and mid america did not violate section.id.
next,with respect to jenkins remaining claims,the district court determined that the record established that yager did act prudently in selecting and monitoring investments.the district court noted that yager had employed a strategy for the investment of the k funds.he had chosen conservative and stable funds and had decided to remain invested in those funds during periods of market fluctuation.the court then determined that,because yager had selected funds that were conservative and not volatile in the,he had not breached his fiduciary duty for not hastily retreating from that strategy in the face of what appears to have been nothing more than mere market fluctuation.id.at.additionally,the district court held that yager had provided plan participants with all the information that they needed to make informed investment decisions and that he did not violate any duty in not providing additional advice or information.the district court did not address yager fiduciary duty with respect to the funds.
although the district court denied jenkins motion for summary judgment,it did not grant,at that point,summary judgment to yager and mid america because they had not for summary judgment.however,after the district court denied jenkins motion for summary judgment,jenkins determined that,based on the district court interpretation of the law,she could not prevail at trial.jenkins stipulated that the defendants memorandum in opposition to summary judgment could be treated as a motion for summary judgment.in this stipulation,she reserved her right to appeal any final order granting defendants for summary judgment.as a result of the stipulation,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants and dismissed jenkins claims with prejudice.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.vallone cna fin,cir.
a.the implied exception to erisa sections and 
jenkins submits that the mid america plan,which allows plan participants to direct their k funds,violates erisa provisions that forbid the delegation of trustee duties.
in evaluating jenkins submission,we begin with section a of erisa.it states 
except as provided in subsection b of this section,all assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust by one or more trustees.such trustee or trustees shall be either named in the trust instrument or in the plan instrument described in section a of this title or appointed by a person who is a named fiduciary,and upon acceptance of being named or appointed,the trustee or trustees shall have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of the plan 
a emphasis added.section a has two explicit exceptions that are found in a.as the statutory text makes clear,neither of these exceptions are pertinent to our present inquiry.more precisely,that section provides 
the plan expressly provides that the trustee or trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee,in which case the trustees shall be subject to proper directions of such fiduciary which are made in accordance with the terms of the plan and which are not contrary to this chapter,or 
authority to manage,acquire,or dispose of assets of the plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of this title.
id.b.because these exceptions are not applicable,we must determine whether any other provisions of erisa provide authorization for the arrangement found in the plan under review.we therefore must determine whether other provisions of the statute are pertinent to our inquiry.
in undertaking this inquiry,we turn first to erisa section c to determine the responsibilities of the trustee under the plan before us.that subsection provides that a plan instrument may allocate fiduciary responsibilities other than trustee responsibilities among named fiduciaries and to other persons designated by named fiduciaries.c.section c further defines trustee responsibilities as any responsibility provided in the plan trust instrument if any to manage or control the assets of the plan.id.c.
mid america plan instrument,labeled employee savings and profit sharing plan,sets forth the responsibilities of the trustee,ex at.the trustee powers are to invest,manage,and control the plan assets consistent with the funding policy and method as determined by mid america.id.at.more specifically,the trustee is to invest and reinvest the trust fund to keep the trust fund invested in such securities or property,real or personal,wherever situated,as the trustee shall deem advisable id.the plan instrument also describes the funding policy and method that should be established by mid america by stating that mid america shall determine whether the plan has a short run need for liquidity,to pay benefits or whether liquidity is a long run goal and investment growth and stability of same is a more current need.id.at.the trust fund is defined as the assets of the plan and trust as the same shall exist from time to time.id.at.
the plan instrument also states,for the k funds,that e ach participant shall be given the opportunity to direct the trustee as to the investment of such participant account value,with such designations to be made not more frequently than once in any plan year.id.at.in addition,a separate directed investment account shall be made for each participant,and such account shall not share in trust fund earnings,but it shall be charged or credited as appropriate with the net earnings,gains,losses and expenses as well as any appreciation or depreciation in market value during each plan year attributable to such account.id.at.
as established by the plan,the duty to invest the plan assets was a trustee responsibility under section c authority to delegate that duty can not be found in section c.since section does not provide an exception to section a,we must look elsewhere in erisa to find authorization for the plan investments.
erisa section,which sets forth the standard of care for a fiduciary,provides that no fiduciary shall be liable for any loss which results from a plan participant or beneficiary exercise of control in plans.see c.however,in order to qualify as a plan eligible for the liability shield of section c,a plan must meet a number of conditions prominent among them is that it must provide at least three investment options and it must permit the participants to give instructions to the plan with respect to those options at least once every three months.b c.it is undisputed that the mid america plan does not qualify under section c because there is no opportunity to change investments once every three months.therefore,we must determine whether compliance with section c is the exclusive method of creating a exception to sections and.
although section c and its accompanying regulation,create a safe harbor for a trustee,we see no evidence that these provisions necessarily are the only possible means by which a trustee can escape liability for plans.as a states 
the standards set forth in this section are applicable solely for the purpose of determining whether a plan is an erisa section c plan and whether a particular transaction engaged in by a participant or beneficiary of such plan is afforded relief by section c.such standards,therefore,are not intended to be applied in determining whether,or to what extent,a plan which does not meet the requirements for an erisa section c plan or a fiduciary with respect to such a plan satisfies the fiduciary responsibility or other provisions of title i of the act.
emphasis added.the department of labor also has stated that,for plans that do not meet the regulatory definition of a section c plan,noncomplying plans do not necessarily violate erisa noncompliance merely results in the plan not being accorded the statutory relief described in section c.final regulation regarding participant directed individual account plans erisa section c plans.
therefore,we agree with the district court and believe that the statute,when read as a whole along with the accompanying regulations,permits a plan trustee to delegate decisions regarding the investment of funds to plan participants even if the plan does not meet the requirements for the section c safe harbor.therefore,there is an implied exception to sections and for plans,allowing plan participants to direct the investment of their own plan funds.if a plan does not meet the conditions set forth in b,the plan trustee and fiduciaries simply do not receive the benefits of section c,and they are not shielded from liability for losses or breaches of duty which result from the plan participant exercise of control.it does not necessarily mean that such a plan violates erisa instead,the actions of the plan trustee,when delegating authority to plan participants,must be evaluated to see if they violate the trustee fiduciary duty.
violation of fiduciary duty 
erisa section imposes standards of fiduciary duty,including the fiduciary duty to act with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence as would a prudent man under the same circumstances.a b.if a fiduciary breaches his duty,he can be personally liable to the plan for any losses to the plan resulting from his breach,as well as can be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate a.
to state a claim for a violation of fiduciary duty,the plaintiff must establish that the defendants are plan fiduciaries that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and that the breach caused harm to the plaintiff.brosted unum life ins.of america,cir citing kamler telecomm,cir.the first prong is not at issue in this case as yager,as trustee of the plan,and mid america,as administrator of the plan,are both fiduciaries under erisa section a.see a.
as for the second prong,erisa fiduciary duty was meant to hold plan administrators to a duty of loyalty akin to that of a trustee.ameritech benefit plan comm.comm.workers of america,cir.accordingly,t he fiduciary must act as though he were a reasonably prudent businessperson with the interests of all the beneficiaries at heart.id.
jenkins submits that yager breached his fiduciary
