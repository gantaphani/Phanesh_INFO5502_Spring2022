appeal from a june,grant of partial dismissal and from a july,grant of summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the western district of new york david larimer,chief judge in favor of xerox corporation xerox,the xerox corporation retirement income guarantee plan the plan,and individually named plan administrators dismissing the plaintiffs claims for improper calculation of their benefits under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.frommert conkright,d frommert frommert conkright,d frommert.the central issue in this appeal is whether the manner in which the defendants instituted a phantom account offset,through which the hypothetical growth of an employee previous lump sum retirement benefits distribution is factored into his current benefits calculation,violates erisa.we hold that it does.
for the reasons set forth below,we find that the plan has not always contained a phantom account,that it was not properly added to the plan through amendment until,that its application to employees rehired prior to violates erisa provision by impermissibly reducing their benefits,and that its adoption in was made without proper notice to plan participants.we also conclude that in light of our view of the applicable law set forth below,the district court should reassess whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim for equitable relief concerning their allegations that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by misrepresenting the terms of the plan.we therefore vacate the district court decision granting summary judgment to the defendants and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
plaintiffs are a group of over xerox employees who left the company at one time or another and were subsequently rehired.at the time of their initial departure from xerox,they received distributions of the retirement benefits they had earned to date.upon being rehired by xerox,they once again began to earn retirement benefits under the plan.the dispute in this case centers on the manner by which the rehired employees previous distributions are factored into the calculation of their retirement benefits after returning to xerox.
under xerox retirement plan,a retiring employee benefits are determined by looking to the highest result of three alternative calculation methods.see layaou xerox,cir.the first of these methods is the retirement plan formula rigp,which is calculated by multiplying years of service,up to thirty,by percent of the yearly pay,a figure based on the average of the employee five calendar years with xerox.for employees rehired by xerox,the number of years of service includes the total time the employee worked for xerox,not just the period of employment following rehire.
second,the plan looks to the employee cash balance retirement account cbra,which consists of yearly contributions by xerox of an amount equal to five percent of the employee salary.this account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate of one percent above the treasury bill rate.for employees who commenced working at xerox before the end of,the cbra account also includes the transferred balance of a profit sharing retirement account that xerox maintained for each employee until december.according to the record,the transferred balance for the plaintiffs was because they had withdrawn the balance of their accounts when they originally retired from xerox.
the third and final method of calculation is called the transitional retirement account tra and is only available to employees hired by xerox prior to.it consists of the balance,if any,that an employee had in the retirement account as of december,plus hypothetical gains based on the investment results of the funds in which the employee profit sharing retirement account were invested as of that date.
in order to avoid paying duplicative benefits to rehired employees who had previously received a lump sum distribution,the plan has always contained provisions concerning the offset of prior distributions.without such provisions,rehired employees would receive a windfall upon their second departure from xerox because they would receive benefits based on their initial tenure at the company on two separate occasions.it is the manner by which the offset of prior distributions is applied,along with the means by which it was incorporated into the plan,that are the central subjects of dispute in this case.
the plan restatement reflects a significant redesign of the pension benefit scheme previously employed by xerox.most notably,the plan eliminated the profit sharing plan and transferred balances within it to employees tra and cbra accounts.before,tra and cbra accounts did not exist.the plan provided for an individual to have a retirement account and also included a calculation somewhat similar to the rigp formula described above total years of service multiplied by percentage of average monthly compensation.the main difference,however,was that,in determining benefits,the plan did not compare the monthly value of the rigp calculation to the monthly value of the individual retirement account.instead,to determine benefits,a certain percentage of the individual retirement account was deducted from the rigp to offset the earlier distribution.
the restatement also contained provisions regarding the of benefits for plan participants,who are referred to as members.in particular,section of the restatement provided as follows 
nonduplication of benefits.in the event any part of or all of a member accrued benefit is distributed to him prior to his normal retirement date,if section dealing with incompetent beneficiaries does not apply to such distribution and such member at any time thereafter recommences active participation in the plan,the accrued benefit of such member based on all years of participation shall be offset by the accrued benefit attributable to such distribution.
the term accrued benefit as used in section is defined in section of the restatement in pertinent part as follows 
the normal retirement benefit which a member has earned up to any date,and which is payable at normal retirement date in an amount computed in accordance with section,based,however,only upon average monthly compensation received and years of participation rendered by a member up to the date as of which the accrued benefit is computed 
of further relevance concerning the of benefits is section of the restatement,concerning years of participation.section f provides no credit shall be given for any period with respect to which a lump sum payment has been made under sections and.section addresses lump sum distributions of benefits of the type received by the plaintiffs,while section deals with an issue unrelated to this procedures to be followed if a plan participant or her spouse are adjudged incompetent.
as the defendants conceded at oral argument,as well as in their submissions to the court,the restatement did not specify how the plan would account for the prior distributions of the newly created cbra and tra accounts,and,more significantly,made no mention of the phantom account offset or the fact that the hypothetical increased value of the prior distribution would be factored into the calculation of a rehired employee benefits.the defendants,however,contend that a series of subsequently issued changes and clarifications provided notice of the existence of the phantom account to plan participants and sufficient explanation of the manner in which it functions.
on april,the defendants issued two changes to the plan text without prior notice to plan participants.the april changes added language to the definitions of the cbra and tra accounts to allow offsets for distributions made after these accounts were included in the plan.notably,the only reference to the treatment of prior lump sum distributions from the retirement account related to when a plan participant had been the subject of a qualified domestic relations order.the other significant change affected section and provided that a plan participant was entitled only to the larger of the rigp benefit or the monthly benefit based on her cbra and tra account balance,if any.
the plan restatement changed section f,now titled section f,and added two additional sentences.in the restatement,section f read no credit shall be given for any period with respect to which a lump sum payment has been made under sections or.this language was modified in section f of the restatement to provide 
no credit shall be given for any period with respect to which a lump sum payment has been made under section,or.credit for years of participation preceding a payment under sections and will be reinstated if a member again becomes an active member.the benefit payable under this plan to such member who has received a prior distribution will be reduced by the previously distributed amount with adjustments to the relevant time under section cbra tra,or at the time of the subsequent distribution under section formerly section.
section deals with payments or distributions of the type received by the plaintiffs thus,its inclusion within section f meant that the type of distributions made to the plaintiffs were brought within the scope of section f coverage.however,because section is omitted from the second sentence of f,the distributions provided under section are,by the terms of the plan,excluded from reinstatement if an employee is rehired.
in,the defendants issued a benefits update summarizing changes made to the plan since the issuance of the restatement and offering clarification of key points about the plans.among these clarifications was a description of the manner in which the phantom account offset functioned.this explanation read as follows 
it is important to note that if you have received a prior distribution from the plan,this will affect the calculation of your benefit.in calculating your rigp benefit for the purpose of determining the highest of your tra,cbra,or formula benefit,the amount of your prior distribution will be added to your tra and cbra accounts,along with hypothetical investment gains losses attributable to the prior distribution,as if the money had been left in your accounts.however,since you already received the prior distribution and there were no actual investment gains losses on this amount,the payment of your rigp benefit will not include the prior distribution or any hypothetical investment gains losses.
in the restatement,the language of f remained substantially unchanged.however,on july,the plan administrators issued a document altering the language of f of the restatement to include section within the second sentence no credit shall be given for any period with respect to which a lump sum payment has been made under sections and.credit for years of participation preceding a payment under sections and will be reinstated if a member again becomes an active member.this change had the effect of including the prior lump sum distributions under into consideration of the accrual of rehired employees benefits.
xerox benefits department distributed an internal memorandum dated may,in advance of a communication distributed to rehired employees entitled important information for rehired employees regarding your rigp benefits.the internal memorandum advised that the communication was intended to help reinforce employees understanding of prior distributions under the xerox retirement income guarantee plan rigp.the communication itself indicated that it was provided to supplement the prior distribution explanation provided in the benefits update and clarify how your prior distribution will affect future benefits payable to you under the plan.
as the plaintiffs concede,the details of the phantom account offset functions were set out in full in the summary plan description spd.the spd explained your future rigp benefit must take into account the current value of this prior distribution,as if it had remained in your account and experienced investment results.this ensures the same retirement funding levels for all or not they had taken a prior distribution.the spd also explained in some detail the mechanics of the process by which the phantom account is factored into benefit calculations.first,the present value of any of the employee accounts are calculated as if the lump sum had remained in the account and been invested throughout the period following distribution.second,the current values of the cbra and tra that previously were distributed,the estimated values are added to any actual amounts earned since the employee rehire date using these total amounts,a comparison is made among the three account,total cbra,and total determine which method yields the greatest benefits in a monthly value.third,the account with the greatest monthly value is reduced by the current value of the employee prior distribution in that same account 
the restatement also contained language addressing the fact that a rehired employee cbra and tra accounts will be offset by the hypothetical growth of previous distributions.the sections defining the cbra and tra both provided that when a rehired employee benefits are calculated these accounts will be treated as if they contain the previous distribution made to the plan participants as it would have increased had it remained invested during the period from the time of the distribution to the relevant time.
the experience of plaintiff paul frommert demonstrates the manner in which the use of the phantom account was both disclosed and utilized.frommert worked at xerox from until january,when he received a payment of frommert was then rehired by xerox in november.in,frommert received a document from xerox entitled value added your total pay statement informing him that under the rigp formula,the monthly benefit he had earned to date,payable at age,was per month.the value added statement also provided the following information regarding the rigp benefit your benefit will grow with your service and earnings.it will be reduced if you had a prior distribution emphasis in original.in a footnote,it was also noted that the current value of prior distributions,taking into account hypothetical gains,would be used in calculating your rigp benefit for the purpose of determining the highest of your tra,cbra,or formula benefit.
on may,however,frommert received a projected rigp calculation that took into account the phantom account offset and estimated his benefit at only a month.this value was arrived at using total tra and cbra balances of and that included the hypothetical growth of the phantom account.because the tra value was higher than the cbra value,it was used to calculate the monthly benefit,which came out to.the tra monthly value was then compared to the rigp monthly value of and because it was larger,it was adopted as the benefit payment method.but to determine the actual monthly amount frommert was to receive,the phantom account offset still had to be deducted from the tra monthly amount.the current monthly equivalent of the prior distribution was determined to be.after deducting this amount from the total tra monthly benefit of,frommert was left with a monthly pension benefit.
upon learning of his expected level of benefits based on the inclusion of the phantom account,frommert sent a memorandum to patricia nazemetz,director of benefits at xerox.frommert indicated that learning his expected benefits were only per month came as a shock since i believed the number in the value added statements year over year.xerox construed frommert memorandum as a request for additional benefits,which it denied in an october,memorandum.xerox memorandum explained that based upon the rigp plan document as written,upon retirement,you are entitled to the higher of your rigp formula benefit,your tra or your cbra.however,your tra and cbra accounts must take into consideration your prior distribution including investment results as if it had never the left plan.frommert was also informed that he could request that the plan administrator review the denial of additional benefits.frommert subsequently appealed the denial of benefits.that appeal was denied on november.
on november,the plaintiffs commenced this lawsuit in the western district of new york.the defendants moved for dismissal of a number of the plaintiffs claims and,in a decision dated june,the district court granted the motion in part by dismissing a number of counts,one cause of action under erisa,and xerox as a defendant.the defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment and plaintiffs paul frommert and alan clair cross moved for summary judgment.in a decision dated july,the district court denied the plaintiffs and granted the defendants motion in its entirety,thereby dismissing the complaint.
plaintiffs now appeal the district court grant of summary judgment along with the district court decision to dismiss their claim for equitable relief pursuant to erisa a,a.

a.the phantom and implementation 
there is no doubt about the centrality of erisa object of protecting employees justified expectations of receiving the benefits their employers promise them.central laborers pension fund heinz,d.here,that objective was thwarted up until because the defendants attempted to implement the phantom account offset without properly amending the terms of the plan or providing adequate notice to rehired employees that their benefits would be reduced because of the hypothetical growth attributed to their prior lump sum distributions.without the benefit of such information,former employees contemplating returning to xerox were denied the opportunity to make a meaningful decision regarding whether they would accept the terms of xerox pension plan.not until,when the phantom account was fully explained in an spd,was the text of the plan amended and adequate information provided to former xerox employees concerning the treatment of their previous distributions.such belated disclosure of so significant a change can not be squared with erisa mandate.
at the outset,we pause to define what it means to amend a plan under erisa.we do so because of the crucial role that this definition will have in determining whether plan participants received timely notice of the amendment and which plan participants may be bound by the amended plan.both the district court and the defendants view an amendment as occurring simply when the plan administrators change the operation of the plan.we,however,look to the plain meaning of the term and define an amendment to a plan as taking place at the moment when employees are properly informed of a change.because we conclude that an erisa amendment to a plan occurs only when the plan employees are informed of a change in the text of the plan,the defendants argument that an amendment may be made by plan administrators changing the operation of the plan has no merit.
two erisa provisions are also of central importance in analyzing the legitimacy of the phantom account offset at issue here.congress adopted these provisions to safeguard benefits that have been promised to employees.first,erisa rule protects employees expectations in their accrued benefits.it provides that t he accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan.erisa g,g second,under erisa,plan sponsors are prohibited from amending a plan in a way that reduces future benefit accrual without proper notice to plan participants.section h,as then constituted,provided as follows 
h notice of significant reduction in benefit accruals 
a pension plan may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual,unless,after adoption of the plan amendment and not less than days before the effective date of the plan amendment,the plan administrator provides a written notice,setting forth the plan amendment and its effective date,to 
a each participant in the plan 
the district court denied the plaintiffs relief under both of these provisions,finding that the phantom account did not actually reduce the plaintiffs accrued benefits that the plan that controls an employee benefits is the one in effect at the time of the application for benefits that the plan had always provided for the use of the phantom account offset and that,even if the phantom account did reduce the plaintiffs benefits,they received sufficient tardy notice under h.we disagree with each of these conclusions and find,as a matter of law,that the phantom account was not part of the plan until when it was added by amendment of the plan text through its explanation in the spd.based on this finding,we hold that application of the phantom account by the defendants prior to its inclusion in the plan by amendment constituted a prohibited reduction of justified expectations of rehired employees accrued benefits in contravention of g we also hold that the defendants failed to meet their obligations to provide advance notice of the amendment as required by h,meaning that the phantom account may not be applied to employees rehired prior to the issuance of the spd.however,for employees rehired subsequent to the amendment of the plan through the spd,the phantom account is a component of the plan that they joined and thus may permissibly be applied to them.
origins of the phantom account 
the initial question before us is whether the application of the phantom account represents an amendment to the plan.because erisa does not set the level of benefits that a plan must provide,lockheed spink,d,the use of the phantom account is problematic only if it represents an impermissible amendment to the terms of the plan.see erisa g h,g h.that is,if the phantom account has always been a part of the plan,as the defendants contend,then its application to the plaintiffs does not constitute a new occurrence subject to challenge under g,nor would it violate h because there would have been no amendment.
the district court upheld the validity of the phantom account in part because it erroneously concluded that the controlling plan for the purpose of determining benefits is the one in effect at the time of an employee application for benefits.see frommert,d at.although this is true for welfare benefit plans,it is not the case where,as here,pension benefits are involved.see moore metro.life ins,cir erisa regulates pension plans far more extensively than welfare plans.for example,welfare plans are expressly exempted from the act detailed minimum participation,vesting and requirements owens storehouse,cir erisa does not prohibit a company from terminating previously offered benefits that are neither vested nor accrued.unlike pension benefits,welfare benefit plans neither vest nor accrue.internal citation omitted see also langbein wolk,pension and employee benefit law ed.langbein wolk erisa vesting and benefit accrual rules apply to pension plans,but not to welfare benefits plans.the reason that a plan can not be applied to reduce pension benefits is that these benefits are protected by erisa vesting and accrual provisions.see erisa.absent such requirements,erisa would provide minimal protection for employees who would lack any certainty that the benefits they expected to receive upon retirement would actually be available to them and not be eliminated by the later adoption of a less favorable plan.because erisa does not contemplate such an approach of substituting the terms of later plans for the purpose of calculating accrued benefits upon retirement,if the phantom account is to be considered part of the plan,then there must be another means by which this can occur.
in this regard,the defendants contend,and the district court agreed,that the phantom account has always been part of the plan.despite its absence from the restatement,which both the defendants and district court acknowledge,the defendants argue that the plan contained the phantom account both before and after the restatement.specifically,the defendants contend that the phantom account was present in versions of the plan prior to the restatement and that its omission from the restatement was rectified by the changes made to the plan in and through subsequent disclosures regarding how the plan functions.further,the defendants argue that because the restatement contained a nonduplication provision,its only flaw was that it lacked sufficient details concerning how this nonduplication would the phantom account.they argue that this oversight was quickly rectified by changes to the plan that clarified that the phantom account would be the means of ensuring nonduplication in sufficient detail to apprise plan participants of its existence along with later spds detailing the manner in which it functions.implicit in this approach is an assumption that material terms of a plan may be omitted from a plan for significant periods only to surface later and be given binding effect for the period prior to their absence.we do not share this view.
this court has previously considered the effectiveness of the plan purported disclosures of the phantom account to employees through its spds,and found them to have been wanting.see layaou,at.the defendants take pains to distinguish this case from layaou on the grounds that layaou involved a challenge under a different provision of erisa,and that layaou retired prior to the full disclosure of the mechanics of the phantom account.however,they can not overcome layaou significance for this case.we view layaou as having settled the question of whether the plan had sufficiently disclosed the existence and mechanics of the phantom account at any point before.
like the plaintiffs here,layaou had previously been employed by xerox and taken a distribution at the time of his first separation from xerox.id.at.layaou was rehired in and subsequently retired in,when the phantom account was applied to his benefit calculation and reduced his expected benefits from under the rigp formula to under the cbra.id.at.the only notice that layaou had received concerning the of his benefits was contained in xerox annual spd,which simply provided that t he amount you receive may also be reduced if you had previously left the company and received a distribution at that time.id.at.nowhere did the spd address the issue of a phantom account or explain that layaou benefits would be offset by a hypothetically appreciated value of his prior distribution.id.as a result,we held that the plan violated erisa spd requirement,by failing to provide notice to layaou and other similarly situated employees that their future benefits would be offset by an appreciated value of their prior benefits distributions.id.
even though the instant case does not involve a challenge under,the holding in layaou is of significance here because of the central role that the spd plays in communicating the terms of a plan to its members.erisa contemplates that the summary plan description will be an employee primary source of information regarding employment benefits,and employees are entitled to rely on the descriptions contained in the summary.layaou,at quoting heidgerd olin,cir alteration in layaou.further,the spd is of such importance that where the terms of a plan and the spd conflict,the spd controls.burke kodak ret.income plan,cir see also joyce,cir employers are bound by promises made in spds,which congress intended to be a primary source of information regarding plan benefits.since the terms of the phantom account were neither included in the restatement nor included in the plan spds up through,we disagree that the plan has always contained the phantom account or that its existence was adequately disclosed.it is clear,under either an arbitrary or capricious standard or as a matter of law,that the plan administrator conclusion that the plan always included the phantom account is unreasonable 
because we find that the plan did not always include the phantom account,it follows that the various changes,updates and explanations from the plan regarding the existence and nature of the phantom account are not mere clarifications of an existing policy.rather,they had the effect,whether deliberate or unintentional,of engrafting the phantom account onto the plan without actually amending its text.
amendment of the plan to include the phantom account 
having considered and rejected the defendants other arguments in favor of the lawfulness of the phantom account,we are left only to consider whether the phantom account was adopted pursuant to a valid amendment of the plan.the district court found that the plan was validly amended by when the benefits update,which explained in some detail how the phantom account functions,was issued.it reasoned that even if prior notice was not given,by the plaintiffs received sufficient tardy notice of the phantom account offset to satisfy the requirements of h.frommert,d at.this conclusion was based in part on the court rationale that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate that they had suffered any prejudice as a result of the imposition of the phantom account,which the district court concluded was demonstrated by the fact that they had all decided to remain at xerox even after disclosure of the phantom account offset and its effects.id.at.
section h,as it then existed,clearly required the plan administrators to provide fifteen days advance notice of any amendment creating a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual.erisa h,h emphasis added see also prod.maint.employees local roadmaster,cir section h language is also clear and imperative a plan may not be amended absent proper notice.allowing tardy notice several years after the effective date of an amendment to stand in for the advance notice that is actually required under h upends the purpose of the provision by turning future benefit accrual into past accrual.under the district court approach,by the time the plaintiffs learned of the phantom account,some of them had already experienced at least five the restatement until the benefits significantly reduced benefit accrual.as a result,they were deprived of the opportunity to take timely action in response to the purported amendment.such action might have included seeking injunctive relief,altering their retirement investment strategies,or perhaps considering other employment.
that the plaintiffs remained employed at xerox after belatedly learning of the effects of the phantom account can not excuse the plan attempts to impermissibly amend the plan.contrary to the defendants arguments and the district court conclusion,the fact that the plaintiffs remained in xerox employ does not demonstrate that they suffered no prejudice through the purported adoption of the phantom account offset.imposing a requirement that plan participants must show actual prejudice from a challenged plan amendment by terminating their employment imposes an unduly harsh burden on dissatisfied plan participants.this court has rejected such a standard in the context of plan participants challenging deficient spds.burke,at.rather than showing actual prejudice,we held that plan participants must demonstrate that they were likely to have been harmed by the faulty spd.id.at.in this case,we find that the plaintiffs have met this standard.the prolonged absence of any mention of the phantom account from plan documents,most notably spds,likely,and quite reasonably,led plan participants to believe that it was not a component of the plan.rather,rehired employees likely believed that their past distributions would only be factored into their benefits calculations by taking into account the amounts they had actually received.
while an employer may rebut a showing of likely prejudice by demonstrating that the deficiency was in fact a harmless error,that has not occurred here.the assumption that the employees were not prejudiced because they remained in their positions after learning of the phantom account does not lead to the conclusion that it was merely a harmless error.in fact,such a conclusion can only be reached if all of the other important aspects of a job are put to the side and pension benefits are made the determinative factor in whether a position is desirable.while there is no doubting the importance of achieving security for retirement,many other weighty considerations bear on the decision whether to continue or terminate employment,including salary,seniority,and,not least of all,job satisfaction.in this case,these considerations are particularly relevant where purported notice of an amendment came some five years after the effective date of the purported amendment.in the interim,the plaintiffs continued to be employed by xerox and presumably reaped the attendant benefits of prolonged employment,such as increasing seniority,responsibility and salary.thus it can not be reasonably concluded that the plaintiffs somehow waived their right to object to the surreptitious imposition of the phantom account by remaining at xerox.
we also disagree with the district court conclusion that the benefits update effectively amended the terms of the plan.while the substance of the benefits update made clear the full import of the phantom account,layaou,at,its form was insufficient to effectively amend the text of the plan.although the district court labeled the benefits update an spd,we conclude instead that it was insufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan,a,to be an spd.as the benefits update itself indicates,it was only intended to summarize changes to the plan and offer clarification of key points about the plans.such corporate literature can not take the place of an spd,from which plan participants are expected to draw their understanding of the terms of their plan.see burke,at.
accordingly,we disagree with the district court that the benefits update provided timely notice under h.we also find that the benefits update violated the requirements of h because,while the amendment adding the phantom account was fully disclosed,it was not preceded by fifteen days notice to plan participants.without such proper notice to plan participants,the amendment was ineffective as to them.
the impact of the phantom account 
having concluded that the phantom account was impermissibly added to the plan with respect to employees rehired before,we must consider the impact of the phantom account on these employees benefits.
it is clear that the application of the phantom account reduced the amount of benefits on which the employees had justifiably relied.the district court conclusion that the phantom account serves only to allow a comparison between the tra and cbra accounts and the rigp benefit,while perhaps correct in a sense,overlooks the ultimate effect of that comparison.by including a large amount of hypothetical growth in a nonexistent account,the comparison among the three accounts is skewed in favor of selecting either the tra or cbra over the rigp as the basis for payment.however,once either the tra or cbra is selected as providing the highest amount of benefits,the phantom account value is taken out,leaving a benefit amount significantly less than what the rigp would provide.thus,although the application of the phantom account does not directly deplete an employee pension account,by altering the comparative process,it imposes a condition on the payment of benefits that leads just as surely to a decrease.see cent.laborers,at.indeed,on remand in a western district of new york case involving this same plan,the court reached this exact conclusion when assessing the impact of the phantom account on the plaintiff benefits it resulted in a significant reduction in plaintiff benefits,compared to what he would have received without the offset layaou xerox,d.
we find that this reduction of justified expectations of benefits took the form of a retroactive in violation of g.employees rehired prior to worked and accrued benefits under a plan that did not provide for reduction of their benefits by factoring in the hypothetical value of a phantom account.however,once the phantom account was purportedly added,the value of an employee accrued benefits were reduced significantly.the impact is demonstrated through the disparity between the rigp benefits of that frommert was informed he would receive in his value added statement and the ultimate value of that was calculated for his tra account once the phantom account was applied.
on remand,the remedy crafted by the district court for those employees rehired prior to should utilize an appropriate calculation to determine their benefits.we recognize the difficulty that this task poses because of the ambiguous manner in which the terms of the plan described how prior distributions were to be treated.as guidance for the district court,we suggest that it may wish to employ equitable principles when determining the appropriate calculation and fashioning the appropriate remedy.
as we have indicated above,the spd amended the text of the plan to include the phantom account and comparative methodology by fully setting out how they are used to calculate rehired employees benefits.indeed,the plaintiffs agreed during oral argument before the district court that the spd adequately describes the offset procedure.appendix at.employees hired after this amendment to the plan occurred,unlike those rehired before then,became plan participants under the terms of the amended plan.as such,the phantom account may permissibly be applied to them.with full notice of the phantom account existence,these rehired employees,unlike their predecessors who lacked such information,had the opportunity to make an informed decision about taking or leaving the terms of the deal offered to them under the plan 
on remand,it will be necessary for the district court to determine which of the plaintiffs were rehired by xerox after the plan was amended to include the phantom account and thus can be bound by its terms.
availability of equitable relief 
plaintiffs also appeal the dismissal of their claims for equitable relief under the provision of erisa a,a.the equitable relief sought by the plaintiffs under this provision comes in two parts.first,they seek a declaration that the phantom account violates erisa and an injunction against its future use.second,they seek to bring a claim for breach of fiduciary duty by the plan administrators the district court dismissed both aspects of this claim because it concluded that all of the relief sought by the plaintiffs could be adequately provided under a b.frommert,d at frommert,d at.with respect to the breach of fiduciary duty claim,the district court found in the alternative that the claim lacked merit because the plaintiffs had received notice of the phantom account by and,further,that the claim was.frommert,d at.we consider these issues in turn,affirming the district court as to the denial of equitable relief to pursue money damages and vacating the district court judgment concerning the availability of a to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duties against the plan administrators.
equitable relief to pursue payment of benefits 
on appeal,the plaintiffs contend that although they ultimately seek money damages through recalculation of their pension benefits,the vehicle for such relief is a judgment declaring that the phantom account is prohibited by erisa and enjoining its application in calculating the benefits of any plan participants.because we have determined that such sweeping relief is not warranted,we conclude that the necessary remedies can be fully provided under a b.thus,we affirm the decision of the district court as to this portion of the plaintiffs claim for equitable relief.
the relief that the plaintiffs seek,recalculation of their benefits consistent with the terms of the plan,falls comfortably within the scope of a b,which allows a plan participant to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights u
