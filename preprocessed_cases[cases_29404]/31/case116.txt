this case concerns the remedies due for violations of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.the parties have stipulated that borden,improperly terminated the plaintiffs from borden total family protection plan hereafter the plan of life,health,dental,and disability insurance.they only dispute the remedy due under the law.borden contends that the plaintiffs are only due reinstatement in the plan,and reimbursement for expenses incurred that would have been covered by the plan.for the most part,the district court agreed with this position.on appeal,plaintiffs assert that this remedy is inadequate and that they are entitled to additional equitable relief.on,borden challenges the one element of the district court award which could not be characterized as benefits due under the terms of the equitable award of medical costs to an estate,in trust for the,even though the estate was no longer legally obliged to pay those costs.we deny the plaintiffs appeal and rule for borden on the.
antonietta larocca is the named plaintiff in a group of sixty retired workers and some of their relatives who alleged violations of erisa by their former employer,borden,the plaintiffs alleged that borden illegally terminated health,life,disability,and dental insurance due to them under the terms of the plan borden and plan beneficiaries fund the plan with contributions.borden administers the plan and acts as fiduciary.borden also determines eligibility for benefits in addition to covering the plaintiffs when they were employed at borden,the plan also provided for benefits to be paid to them upon their retirement.
the plaintiffs are former borden employees eligible for retiree benefits who worked in borden deran confectionary division and their covered relatives.borden sold this division to great american brands gab on april.the sales contract stipulated that gab was to continue benefits equivalent to those provided under the plan.on june,gab declared bankruptcy under chapter.concerned that gab would be unable to honor its commitment,the plaintiffs sought benefits from borden unsuccessfully.
as a result of this denial,several of the plaintiffs did not have insurance when they were ill.one of the plaintiffs,guiseppe paone,received a liver transplant before dying on june.his medical bills at the new england medical center nemc totaled.nemc sought payment from his estate,but did not sue for the debt.a statute of repose subsequently rendered the paone estate immune from liability for the debt.
the new england confectionery company necco purchased the relevant gab assets on september,and offered health insurance to the plaintiffs who accepted employment with the firm.of them decided to participate.
on october,many of the plaintiffs filed with borden an appeal of the denial of benefits.after unsuccessful settlement efforts,the plaintiffs filed a complaint on november,in the federal court for the district of massachusetts.during discovery,the parties stipulated that borden improperly terminated the plaintiffs from the plan.unable to agree on a settlement,however,they requested the district court assistance in determining the remedies available under erisa by filing for partial summary judgment.the central question was whether the plaintiffs were eligible for equitable relief beyond the relief offered by borden in settlement negotiations.after holding a hearing on the motions,the district court issued a memorandum and order on march,essentially siding with borden position on the proper remedies.the district court ordered one remedy not offered by borden that the company reimburse the bills incurred by plaintiff guiseppe paone,such sums to be paid to his estate in trust for the benefit of new england medical center.
over a year after this ruling,the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to allege violations of state law and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et.the district court denied the motion.on september,it entered an order and final judgment incorporating its earlier ruling.
on appeal,the plaintiffs demand further equitable relief pursuant to erisa a,a,including the cash value of the premium payments that borden avoided by failing to pay them.they also appeal the denial of their third motion to amend their complaint.on,borden claims that the court can not award full medical expenses to guiseppe paone estate because the estate no longer has a legal obligation to pay these bills.we address the demand for further equitable relief in part ii,borden in part iii,and the denial of the motion to amend in part iv.
the parties have stipulated to a joint statement of material facts.the issue that we review proper scope of remedies due to the a legal issue that we review de novo.we first compare the remedies demanded by the plaintiffs with the relief ultimately awarded by the district court.we then turn to the statutory language in order to assess the legal basis for this relief.applying this language and judicial interpretations of it,we conclude that the plaintiffs are only entitled to the relief ordered by the district court.
plaintiffs demands for relief 
on february,borden filed an offer of judgment offering the plaintiffs several forms of relief.prospectively,borden offered reinstatement of each plaintiff to the plan.retrospectively,borden offered to pay medical bills paid or still due and to pay the excess of any copayments or premiums for replacement insurance over the amounts the plaintiffs would have paid under the plan.
the plaintiffs demanded significantly more.they proposed retrospective relief designed not only to compensate those terminated from the plan for replacement insurance coverage and to reimburse them for medical expenses,but also to force borden to disgorge the amount by which the company was unjustly enriched by failing to pay for insurance coverage after the improper terminations the plaintiffs expert assessed the gross value of the coverage wrongfully withheld at as of october.given that the plaintiffs would have paid in employee contributions due the plan,the plaintiffs expert estimated that the net value of the employer contribution left unpaid by borden was.
plaintiffs further argued that borden proposed prospective relief was inadequate because many of them distrust borden,and the plan it sponsors.these plaintiffs have developed close relationships with other insurance plans and the health care providers covered by them.for them,plaintiffs argued,monetary relief should be made available to the retirees and their spouses as an alternative remedy because many of the plaintiffs do not wish to leave their current insurer emphasis in the original.therefore,the plaintiffs requested that the court order,at the option of each plaintiff,either reinstatement to the plan or payment of the future value of plan coverage.
with one exception,the district court agreed with borden position on the scope of the available remedies.to redress past harms,the district court ordered borden to reimburse the plaintiffs for medical expenses that they incurred which would have been covered by the plan to pay the difference between plaintiffs payments for substitute insurance and the amount they would have paid had they continued membership in the plan,and to pay the medical expenses of guiseppe paone the one exception.the district court ordered borden to treat e ach of the plaintiffs as if he or she had retired on april,with an effective retirement date of may.the district court chose the april,date because borden sold the deran division to gab on this date and ostensibly arranged for gab to continue benefits equivalent to those provided under the plan.
to provide prospective relief,the district court ordered borden to give the plaintiffs the opportunity for reinstatement to the plan.it did not give the plaintiffs the option of choosing the cash value of insurance coverage instead of reinstatement.
any plaintiff who did not waive retiree coverage under the borden.total family protection plan the plan,who was not terminated from the plan for nonpayment of premiums or other failure to comply with plan requirements such failure not to include working for a successor employer,and who has requested reinstatement to the plan in accordance with the court orders,will be deemed eligible for retiree medical insurance and retiree life insurance under the terms of the plan as if he or she had retired effective may.plaintiffs who have elected reinstatement will be responsible for health insurance premiums and other contributions at levels they would be paying today if they had retired on april,and those plaintiffs will receive medical and life insurance benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan.
this prospective reinstatement is real.that is,it permits plaintiffs to renew insurance coverage under the borden plan for future protection.the retrospective reinstatement is constructive that is,it is a remedial device which permits the court to award benefits due under the terms of the plan for the period of wrongful termination.
remedies available under erisa 
two civil enforcement provisions of erisa are relevant to this appeal.a.the first permits a beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan id.a b a.the second provides that a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary may sue a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.id.a a.
the plaintiffs argue that their requests for disgorgement and for the opportunity to receive the cash value of reinstatement are appropriate equitable relief under section a.the statutory language invites a inquiry to evaluate this claim is the proposed relief equitable,and if so,is it appropriate we address each question in turn.
the supreme court has held that,in the context of erisa,equitable relief includes those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.mertens hewitt,d emphasis in original.although both damages and restitution may remedy the same injury,d amages differs from restitution in that damages is measured by the plaintiff loss restitution is measured by the defendant unjust gain.dan dobbs,law of remedies,at ed.restitution is an equitable remedy providing a tool for courts to use when one party has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another.kwatcher.serv.employees pension fund,cir,quoting restatement of the law of restitution.the plaintiffs have characterized the bulk of the relief they seek on million in premiums which borden would have had to pay had it covered the plaintiffs over the time period in unjust enrichment,the disgorgement of which is restitution.they also justify their proposed prospective remedy giving plaintiffs the choice between reinstatement to the plan or its cash value as a way of avoiding unjust enrichment by borden.by measuring relief with reference to the amount borden has gained and would gain by terminating coverage,the plaintiffs propose equitable relief in the form of restitution to prevent unjust enrichment 
nevertheless,such relief is not appropriate equitable relief within the meaning of erisa.a emphasis added.clarifying the holding in mertens,the supreme court has ruled that section a catchall provisions act as a safety net,offering appropriate equitable relief for injuries caused by violations that does not elsewhere adequately remedy.varity howe,d.varity circumscribes the applicability of section a w here congress elsewhere provided adequate relief for a beneficiary injury,there will likely be no need for further equitable relief id.at.
following this guidance,federal courts have uniformly concluded that,if a plaintiff can pursue benefits under the plan pursuant to section a,there is an adequate remedy under the plan which bars a further remedy under section a.see,turner fallon community health plan,cir holding that beneficiary denied benefits could not sue under section a since the claim was specifically addressed by section a forsyth humana,cir holding that e quitable relief under section a is not appropriate because section a provides an adequate remedy in this case.wald southwestern bell.customcare med.plan,cir katz comprehensive plan of group,cir holding that even the unrealized prospect of relief under section a renders relief under section a unavailable tolson avondale indus,cir because plaintiff has adequate relief available for the alleged improper denial of benefits through his right to sue the plans directly under section a,relief through the application of s ection a would be inappropriate.as the eighth circuit has stated,when the plaintiff can bring a claim for benefits under section a,equitable relief would not be appropriate and she does not have a cause of action under section a.wald,at.
challenging the import of these cases,the plaintiffs argue that equitable relief has been awarded pursuant to section a in a number of other cases.they point to jackson truck drivers union local health and welfare fund,united steelworkers of america steel,and ream frey,cir.the plaintiffs here,like those in jackson,united steelworkers,and ream,were not members of a plan and therefore were not eligible for relief under section a when they filed suit.however,the plaintiffs in jackson,united steelworkers,and ream were permanently ineligible for a remedy pursuant to section a because none of these cases involved a functioning plan.the plaintiffs here were only ineligible for a remedy pursuant to section a because they were not members of the plan when they filed suit.although some of the plaintiffs may not want prospective reinstatement in the plan because they distrust borden,none have disclaimed their interest in the opportunity for reinstatement.moreover,they have presented no evidence to demonstrate that the borden plan is not a viable plan that can pay them the benefits they are due under its terms.
here,the district court faced a situation similar to that presented in varity and adopted a comparable remedy.in varity,the supreme court affirmed a lower court reinstatement of plaintiffs who had been improperly terminated from their plan.at.the supreme court observed that t he plaintiffs in this case could not proceed under section a because they were no longer members of their plan and,therefore,had no benefits due them under the terms of the plan pursuant to section a,and that t hey must rely on section a or they have no remedy at all.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted here,once the district court mandated the plaintiffs constructive reinstatement and opportunity for actual reinstatement to the plan pursuant to section a,the plaintiffs claims were governed by the terms of the plan,as section a provides 
inapplicability of the collateral source rule 
recognizing the primacy of the plan in awarding benefits to plaintiffs after their reinstatement,the district court refused to order borden to pay for medical expenses already covered by alternative insurance coverage because of plan provisions coordinating coverage with other insurance to avoid double payments.plaintiffs invoke the collateral source rule to challenge this ruling.
the collateral source rule has traditionally provided that benefits received by the plaintiff from a source collateral to the defendant may not be used to reduce that defendant liability for damages.lussier runyon,cir quoting dan dobbs,law of remedies,at ed.the plaintiffs argue that the collateral source rule makes borden liable for all of their medical bills,even if alternative sources of insurance have already paid for them.however,erisa preempts state legislation designed to limit plans subrogation and coordination of benefits provisions.see fmc holliday,d travitz northeast ilgwu health and welfare fund,cir.such preemption applies a fortiori to state common law doctrines like the collateral source rule which purportedly alter the benefit limitation provisions of a plan.see pilot life ins.dedeaux,d precluding both state claims to recover benefits under an erisa plan and state claims to recover compensation for harms suffered because of i
