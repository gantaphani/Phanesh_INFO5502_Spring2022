david hurlic,susanna selesky,and others similarly situated plaintiffs appeal the district court dismissal of the entirety of their lawsuit against southern california gas company scgc and the scgc pension plan the plan.plaintiffs allege that scgc amendment of the plan violated both the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the california fair employment and housing act feha.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
this appeal requires our court to consider,for the first time,whether pension plans utilizing a cash balance formula cash balance plans violate various provisions of erisa and feha.we join four of our sister circuits and hold that cash balance plans do not violate b h,an discrimination provision of erisa.we also hold that cash balance plans do not violate b b,one of erisa provisions.we further hold that erisa preempts plaintiffs state law feha claim.thus,we affirm the district court dismissal of those claims.however,because plaintiffs complaint adequately alleged that scgc and the plan violated erisa notice requirement,we hold that the district court erred by dismissing that claim.
factual background 
the plan,an pension benefit plan,provides participating scgc employees with a defined benefit at retirement according to a benefit accrual formula set forth in the plan.prior to july,the plan required participants retirement benefits to be calculated according to a formula.under the formula,participants were entitled to a annuity,payable monthly,beginning at normal retirement age.the amount of the annuity was based on participants average compensation during the final years of their employment with scgc,which was then multiplied by a percentage that increased with years of service.
effective july,scgc amended the plan.as a result of the amendment,employees benefits are now calculated under a cash balance formula.the cash balance formula assigns each participant a retirement account.each retirement account is merely a bookkeeping entry used to calculate a participant accrued benefit.the account exists on paper but is hypothetical in the sense that no real money is ever deposited into individual accounts.
the initial balance of each participant retirement account is the actuarial equivalent of the participant accrued benefit under the plan prior to the july,amendment.thereafter,the cash balance formula credits,on a monthly basis,each participant retirement account with retirement credits.the annual total of a participant retirement credits equals percent of his or her annual earnings.the cash balance formula also credits each participant retirement account with interest credits,which are based on the treasury bond rate.a participant retirement account continues to accrue interest credits until normal retirement age regardless of whether the participant continues to work for scgc.
like the formula,a participant benefit under the cash balance formula is paid in the form of a annuity beginning at normal retirement age.the amount of a participant annuity is based on the actuarial equivalent of the participant retirement account balance at normal retirement age.however,unlike the formula,the cash balance formula allows participants to elect to receive their accrued benefits in a single lump sum payment.
the plan,as amended,also contained a grandfather provision.the grandfather provision allowed eligible participants to continue accruing benefits under the formula until june,at which time the participants accrued benefits under the formula were frozen.during this period,each participant retirement account was also credited as normal under the cash balance formula.a participant who began to receive benefit distributions during this period was entitled to receive the greater of the actuarial equivalent of the retirement account under the terms of the cash balance plan expressed in the form of an annuity or an annuity accrued under the formula through the individual termination date.
if a participant did not begin receiving a payout of benefits on or before june,the amount of his or her accrued benefit is determined by a provision.the provision provides that a participant accrued benefit is an age annuity equal to the greater of the actuarial equivalent of his or her retirement account under the cash balance formula or the actuarial equivalent of his or her frozen accrued benefit under the formula.
hurlic,who is years old,has been an scgc employee since and is a plan participant.selesky,who is years old,has been an scgc employee since and is also a plan participant.both hurlic and selesky were eligible under the plan grandfather provision and continued accruing benefits under the formula until june.under the provision,hurlic estimated annuity payments based on his frozen formula benefits will be greater than his estimated annuity payments based on the cash balance formula until.selesky estimated annuity payments based on her frozen formula benefits will be greater until.thus,hurlic and selesky will not accrue any additional benefits during these periods.
on july,hurlic and selesky filed suit against scgc and the plan on behalf of all similarly situated individuals.plaintiffs alleged that the plan,as amended,discriminates on the basis of age in violation of erisa b h,b h the plan,as amended,violates erisa rules the adoption and implementation of the provision of the plan amendment disproportionately affected scgc employees age and older in violation of feha and the plan violated erisa requirement that a pension plan may not be amended as to cause a significant reduction in the rate of benefit accrual unless advance notice of the effective date is provided the notice claim.
on october,the district court,without opinion,dismissed without leave to amend plaintiffs age discrimination,and feha claims for failure to state a claim.the district court also dismissed plaintiffs notice claim for failure to state a claim,but granted plaintiffs ten days to amend their complaint.on october,plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint.
on january,the district court dismissed plaintiffs amended notice claim for failure to state a claim and again gave plaintiffs ten days to further amend their complaint.after plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,the district court dismissed plaintiffs notice claim for a third time,this time without leave to amend.all three dismissal orders were adopted as proposed by defendants and did not include any explanation of the basis for the decision.

cash balance plans are defined benefit plans 
erisa provides for two types of pension contribution plans and defined benefit governed by different rules.a defined contribution plan provides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount contributed to the participant account.typically,in a defined contribution plan,the employer contributes a percentage of payroll or profits to participants accounts and,at retirement,a participant is entitled to whatever assets are dedicated to his or her individual account,subject to investment gains and losses.see hughes aircraft jacobson,d comm r keystone consol,d.a defined benefit plan is any qualified pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.a defined benefit plan promises to pay employees,upon retirement,a fixed benefit under a formula.pension benefit guar.ltv,d.a defined benefit plan consists of a general pool of assets rather than individual dedicated accounts.hughes aircraft,at.the asset pool may be funded by the employer,employee,or both,but the employer typically bears the entire investment risk and must cover any underfunding that might occur as a result of the plan investments.id.
we recognize,and the parties agree,that despite superficial resemblance to defined contribution plans,cash balance plans,including the plan at issue here,are defined benefit plans.see,berger xerox.ret.income guarantee plan,cir campbell,cir esden bank of boston,cir lyons.salaried employees ret.plan,cir all holding that cash balance plans are defined benefit plans.cash balance plans guarantee participants a defined benefit,determined by a formula,at retirement.the participants bear no risk that their accrued benefits will decrease due to investment risk.additionally,unlike defined contribution plans,the contributions made to individual accounts under cash balance plans merely reflect bookkeeping entries that track the growth of the participants accrued benefits.accordingly,cash balance plans must comply with erisa rules governing defined benefit plans.
cash balance plans do not reduce the rate of an employee benefit accrual because of the attainment of any age 
erisa b h i prohibits a defined benefit plan from ceasing an employee benefit accrual or reducing the rate of an employee benefit accrual because of the attainment of any age.b h i.plaintiffs argue that the plan violates this provision because it guarantees interest credits regardless of continued employment with scgc.thus,a younger participant who performs the same job and earns the same salary as an older participant will always have a greater accrued benefit at retirement age 
plaintiffs argument equates the phrase rate of an employee benefit accrual,as used in erisa b h i,with the term accrued benefit,which is defined elsewhere in erisa.for defined benefit plans,erisa defines a participant accrued benefit as the individual accrued benefit determined under the plan and expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.a.thus,plaintiffs argue that erisa b h i prohibits a plan from reducing a participant total accrued benefit because of the attainment of any age rather than prohibiting only a reduction in the rate at which the participant benefit accrues.we reject this argument for several reasons.
first,it is a basic principle of statutory construction that w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,d citation omitted.congress defined the term accrued benefit in erisa and used it throughout erisa b.however,congress omitted the term accrued benefit in erisa b h i and replaced it with the phrase rate of an employee benefit accrual.b h i.thus,we must presume that congress intended to do so.the phrase rate of an employee benefit accrual plainly refers to the rate at which a participant benefits increase rather than the participant total accrued benefit.interpreting erisa b h i in another context,the supreme court has held likewise.see lockheed spink,d a reduction in total benefits due is not the same thing as a reduction in the rate of benefit accrual the former is the final outcome of the calculation,whereas the latter is one of the factors in the equation.
plaintiffs argument also equates the phrase rate of an employee benefit accrual with the defined term accrued benefit,because congress used the words benefit accrual in erisa discrimination provision which pertains to defined benefit plans,but did not use those words in the discrimination provision which pertains to defined contribution plans.compare b h i with b a.defined contribution plans satisfy erisa discrimination provision as long as allocations to the employee account are not ceased,and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee account is not reduced,because of the attainment of any age.b a.plaintiffs do not,and could not,dispute the fact that the plan would be if it was a defined contribution plan.however,given that defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans are often governed by different rules,plaintiffs argue that something which is for a defined contribution plan must be discriminatory for a defined benefit plan,merely because congress chose to word the rule for defined benefit plans to describe prohibited conduct while wording the rule for defined contribution plans to describe permissible conduct.
this argument,however,ignores that defined benefit plans are not always governed by different rules than are defined contribution plans.the conference notes regarding erisa discrimination provisions strongly suggest that congress did not intend that different age discrimination rules should apply for defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.see,at conf,reprinted in,explaining that benefit accruals or continued allocations to an employee account under either a defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan may not be reduced or discontinued on account of the attainment of a specified age.additionally,both discrimination provisions explicitly reference the rate at which employee benefits accrue.thus,nothing demonstrates that congress intended a formula that is when used in a plan to become unlawful because the account balances are book entries rather than cash.cooper,at.
second,we agree with the seventh circuit that nothing suggests that congress set out to legislate against the fact that younger workers have statistically more time left before retirement,and thus a greater opportunity to earn interest on each year retirement savings.cooper,at.plaintiffs argument ignores the realities of the time value of money.under a cash balance plan,younger workers have more years in which to earn interest,but must wait longer until their benefit is paid out.however,if a participant elects to receive a payout before reaching age,the plan must distribute the actuarial equivalent of the annuity that would be available at normal retirement age.id.at citing c.this value is calculated by adding all the interest that the participant would accrue through age and discounting the resulting sum to its present value.id.
time value of money can be best illustrated using the example in footnote,above.assume that in years,when the older worker has reached retirement age,the younger worker decides to withdraw his benefits from the plan.the amount the younger worker receives will be calculated by adding up all of the interest he would have earned had he waited until he was to retire and discounting it to present value.depending on the factor used to discount to present value,he will receive substantially similar or possibly less benefit than the older worker.thus,although a younger worker total accrued benefit at retirement age will be greater under the cash balance formula than an older worker if both started working at the same time,the difference is due to the time value of money rather than age discrimination.see id.at citing hazen paper biggins,d holding that variables correlated with age must be kept analytically distinct from age when searching for discrimination.
finally,plaintiffs argument would require us to ignore congress use of the word attainment in erisa b h i.the phrase attainment of any age means the act of reaching a certain age.see webster third new international dictionary.the plan cash balance formula does not reduce an older worker accrued benefit when he or she attains a certain age.rather,the plan sets a lower ceiling for an older worker accrued benefit because he or she has less time to earn interest than a similarly situated younger worker.
the statute legislative history makes clear that the word attainment is important.as originally enacted,erisa did not require that a pension plan allow participants who worked beyond normal retirement age to continue earning benefits.see,at conf,reprinted in.in,congress enacted provisions to remedy that problem,explaining that benefit accruals or continued allocations to an employee account under either a defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan may not be reduced or discontinued on account of the attainment of a specified age.id.emphasis added.
this language clearly describes congress intent to prohibit pension plans from reducing or ceasing benefits when a participant reached age or any other specified age.for example,the plan would clearly be in violation of erisa b h i if it provided that when participants reached age,they stopped receiving benefits or began accruing benefits at a reduced rate.however,the plan does no such thing.it is not within our province to read out of the statute the requirement of its words.quarty united states,cir citing rand united states.
plaintiffs reading of the statute would allow every worker who does not begin employment with scgc at the minimum employment age to bring an age discrimination claim alternatively,it would force all employers to scale interest rates in a way that made the total benefit accrued equal for all employees regardless of time remaining until retirement.for example,plaintiffs seem to believe that a participant should earn as much interest in one year as an does in years.this reading of the statute completely ignores the time value of money.thus,not only does plaintiffs interpretation of erisa b h i read out important words,it would also lead to absurd results.see arizona state bd.for charter sch.of,cir noting that rules of statutory construction caution us that statutory interpretations which would produce absurd results are to be avoided citation omitted.
under the plan,a younger participant and older participant earning the same salary will both receive the same retirement credit and interest credit to their bookkeeping account every year.thus,their benefits will accrue at an equal rate.the only difference is that,based on the time value of money,a younger participant total accrued benefit at retirement will be greater because the younger participant has more time before retirement in which interest will compound.because the plan does not reduce a participant rate of benefit accrual due to the attainment of any age,the plan does not violate erisa b h i.plaintiffs can not prove any set of facts on which they would be entitled to relief.thus,the district court correctly dismissed plaintiffs claim.see stoner,at.
ii.cash balance plans do not violate b b 
plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred by dismissing their claim that the plan violates erisa provisions.erisa includes three provisions the three percent rule,the percent rule,and the fractional rule.b a c.all three are intended to prevent plans from providing inordinately low rates of accrual in the employee early years of service when he is most likely to leave the firm and concentrating the accrual of benefits in the employee later years of service when he is most likely to remain with the firm until retirement,reprinted in.a plan need only comply with one of the provisions.b a c.
plaintiffs argue that the plan violates the percent rule,which provides that benefits accrued in any one year may not exceed percent of the benefit accrued in any prior year b b.plaintiffs argue that they will not accrue any additional benefits until the year in which their cash balance formula benefits exceed their frozen formula benefits.thus,during the period,plaintiffs contend that they will accrue benefits at a rate of zero percent.according to plaintiffs theory,the benefits they accrue in the year in which their cash balance formula benefits become greater than their frozen formula benefits will thus,by definition,exceed percent of the benefits they accrued during the period.
plaintiffs argument is premised on the idea that treasury regulation section b a requires that we use two different formulas when applying the percent rule the formula while their frozen benefits are greater and the cash balance formula once their cash balance account exceeds their frozen benefits.treasury regulation section b a states 
a defined benefit plan may provide that accrued benefits for participants are determined under more than one plan formula.in such a case,the accrued benefits under all such formulas must be aggregated in order to determine whether or not the accrued benefits under the plan for participants satisfy one of the alternative methods.
in register,the third circuit addressed this argument and held that a similar plan did not violate the percent rule.at.the register court reasoned that because of the plan amendment provision to the percent rule,the plan did not,in fact,determine participants benefits under more than one formula.id.at.the plan amendment provision to the percent rule provides that any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years.b b i.thus,once there is an amendment to the prior plan,only the new plan formula is relevant when ascertaining if the plan satisfies the percent rule.register,at.
as in register,if the plan cash balance formula had been in effect for all other plan years,plaintiffs never would have accrued a benefit under the old plan and would have started to accrue benefits under the cash balance formula from the beginning of their employment.id.plaintiffs would always have had an annual accrual rate equal to percent of their salary plus their interest credit.thus,the plan would not violate the percent rule.
but the plan differs from the pension plan at issue in register in that,after scgc amended the plan,the plan grandfather provision allowed employees benefits to increase for five years before they were frozen.the pension plan in register froze employees benefits as of the date of amendment.id.at.however,this distinction does not change the result.to the extent that the internal revenue service irs revenue ruling suggests otherwise,we find its reasoning unpersuasive and decline to defer to the irs interpretation of the percent rule.see skidmore swift.holding that the weight afforded to an administrative agency interpretation of a statute contained in an informal depends on all those factors which give it power to persuade,including the validity of its reasoning omohundro united states,cir applying skidmore deference to a revenue ruling see generally mcdaniel chevron,cir though revenue rulings do not have the force of law,they do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which we may look for guidance.
in revenue ruling,the irs applied provisions of the internal revenue code which parallel erisa provisions to a pension plan which had converted to a cash balance formula.rul.the irs recognized that,due to the plan amendment provision of the percent rule,such plans do not violate the percent rule if,like in register,a participant benefits are frozen as of the date of the plan amendment.id.however,the irs indicated that a plan would violate the percent rule if it allowed participants to continue to accrue benefits under a formula for a period of time before they became frozen.the irs discussion of this issue provided little in the way of reasoning.the irs relied heavily on an example which seems to suggest that the irs believes that the aggregation rule of treasury regulation section b a trumps the plan amendment provision and requires aggregation of the two formulas whenever a plan contains a grandfather provision like the one at issue here 
we disagree.the fact that the plan allowed eligible participants formula benefits to accrue until june,before becoming frozen rather than simply freezing them on july,when scgc amended the plan does not implicate treasury regulation section b a.quite simply,the plan,as amended,does not determine a participant benefits by aggregating two formulas.the sections of the plan entitled reservation of prior plan accrued benefit and grandfather benefit amount both refer to a participant accrued benefit under the prior plan.because congress has directed us to treat the amended plan as if it was in effect for all other plan years,b b i,we must assume that,for purposes of applying the percent rule,there was never a prior plan under which plaintiffs accrued benefits.
this analysis does not change merely because scgc included a beneficial grandfather provision in the plan rather than simply freezing all participants benefits on july,as it clearly could have.the only difference is that scgc allowed eligible participants formula benefits to increase before they were frozen.it would be an odd result indeed to allow a pension plan which converts to a cash balance formula to freeze benefits immediately but forbid a plan from providing for a grace period in which participants can continue to accrue additional benefits before they are frozen 
additionally,we note that neither the plan conversion to the cash balance formula nor its grandfather provision conflict with the objective of erisa provisions,which is to prevent a plan from being unfairly weighted against employees.register,at internal quotation marks omitted.because the plan satisfies the percent rule,plaintiffs can prove no set of facts on which they would be entitled to relief on their claim that the plan violates erisa provisions.accordingly,the district court correctly dismissed this claim.see stoner,at.
iii.erisa preempts plaintiffs feha claim 
scgc argues that erisa preempts plaintiffs state law feha claim for age discrimination.erisa a contains a broad preemption provision stating that erisa 
shall supercede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section a of this title and not exempt under section b of this title 
a.plaintiffs concede that their feha claim relates to an employee benefit plan and thus falls within erisa general preemption provision.nevertheless,plaintiffs argue that their feha claim is saved from preemption by erisa d,which provides that erisa general preemption provision shall not be construed to alter,amend,modify,invalidate,impair,or supersede any law of the united states.d.specifically,plaintiffs argue that the joint enforcement scheme of the age discrimination in employment act adea would be impaired if we were to hold that erisa preempts their feha claim.
in shaw delta air lines,d,the supreme court addressed whether erisa d saved from preemption a state law which relate d to an employee benefit plan under erisa a.specifically,the court considered the appellants argument that preemption of the state law would impair the joint enforcement scheme of title vii.id.
the court recognized that title vii provides for a comprehensive joint enforcement scheme wherein both states and the federal government enact valid laws and work together to enforce them.id.at.given this interplay,the court held that preemption of a state law would impair title vii to the extent that the state law provides a means of enforcing title vii commands.id.at.thus,the court held that,as long as the state law does not prohibit something that title vii allows,preempting the state law would frustrate the goal of encouraging joint enforcement of title vii and thus impair federal law.id.in so holding,the court expressed concern that,if erisa were interpreted to entirely preempt state laws as they relate to employee benefit plans,states would be unable to prohibit or grant relief for discrimination in erisa plans and thus an employee only remedies for discrimination prohibited by title vii in erisa plans would be federal ones.id.
the court also noted that title vii does not itself prevent states from extending their nondiscrimination laws to areas not covered by title vii.id.however,enforcement of title vii does not depend on such extensions of state law.title vii would prohibit precisely the same employment practices,and be enforced in precisely the same manner,even if no state made additional employment practices unlawful.id.thus,the court held that i nsofar as state laws prohibit employment practices that are lawful under title vii,preemption would not impair title vii within the meaning of d.id.at.
the adea provides for a joint enforcement scheme that is nearly identical to that provided in title vii.compare b with c.however,feha does not merely parallel the adea,as plaintiffs allege.it is true that both statutes contain broad prohibitions against age discrimination.compare a with cal.gov t code.but unlike feha,the adea contains specific provisions relating to pension plans.see i.one of these,adea i a,mirrors erisa b h i,the section which forms the basis for plaintiffs first claim.those two provisions were enacted together as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act,stat,and congress has made clear that the provisions should be interpreted to have an identical meaning,at conf,reprinted in.because we have held that the plan does not violate erisa b h i,it follows that the plan does not violate adea i a.
plaintiffs argue,however,that adea i does not exclusively govern age discrimination claims relating to pension plans,and that their feha claim tracks adea a,not adea i a.in support of their position,they point out that their first and fourth claims are not identical.specifically,the first claim asserts that the cash balance formula as a whole discriminates on the basis of age,while the fourth claim challenges only the provision of the amended plan,under which many workers suffer a temporary cessation of benefit accrual.
although it is true that the two claims are not identical,the difference between them does not save the feha claim from preemption.the controlling provision in this case is adea i,which provides that c ompliance with the requirements of subsection i with respect to an employee benefit pension plan shall constitute compliance with the requirements of adea relating to benefit accrual under an employee pension benefit plan.i.thus,we must determine whether the provision of the plan relates to benefit accrual.if it does,the provision need satisfy only the requirements of adea i.see id.
the term accrue means to increase.webster third new international dictionary.benefit accrual thus refers to the process by which benefits increase.see id.in traditional defined benefit plans,such as scgc plan,benefits increased according to a formula that took into account the employee salary and years of service.under the cash balance plan,benefits increase as the employer credits the account with earnings and interest credits.plaintiffs claim protests the fact that under the greater of provision,actual benefits payable as compared to the hypothetical account balance do not increase until the amount payable under the cash balance formula exceeds that payable under the formula.this claim thus relates to benefit accrual because it challenges the fact that benefits do not increase for some period of time.
as such,it must be brought under adea i,not the generic provision of adea a.however,the claim is not cognizable under adea i because that subsection provides that,with respect to benefit accrual under a pension plan,a plan only engages in prohibited discrimination if it violates i a.see i see also,at conf,reprinted in,it is the intention of the conferees that the requirements contained in section i related to an employee rights to benefit accruals with respect to an employee benefit plan shall constitute the entire extent to which adea affects such benefit accrual.it follows that the provision is not prohibited by adea.
feha mirrors adea a,not adea i.plaintiffs thus seek to invalidate the provision under a broad,general discrimination they would not be allowed to do under the adea.with regard to erisa plans then,feha does not provide a means of enforcing the adea commands such that preemption would impair the joint enforcement scheme of the adea.see shaw,at.because feha prohibits practices which would be lawful under the adea,plaintiffs feha claim is preempted.see a shaw,at.thus,the district court correctly dismissed this claim.
iv.plaintiffs adequately stated a claim that scgc violated erisa notice requirement 
at the time scgc amended the plan,erisa
