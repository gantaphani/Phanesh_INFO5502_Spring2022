john layaou layaou appeals from a september,grant of summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the western district of new york david larimer,chief judge in favor of xerox corporation xerox and the retirement income guarantee plan the plan dismissing layaou claim for additional benefits under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et layaou xerox,d layaou ii.we hold that the summary plan description violated the disclosure requirements of erisa.for the reasons discussed below,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment on layaou erisa claim and remand for further proceedings.
background 
layaou began working for xerox in and voluntarily left the company in during a period of layoffs.at that time,xerox distributed to layaou the retirement benefits he had earned,amounting to a distribution of approximately in september,xerox rehired layaou as a employee,where he remained until he was laid off as part of a in january.layaou earned retirement benefits during this second period of employment with xerox.
xerox retirement plan provides that an employee will receive benefits upon retirement in an amount equal to the highest result of three alternative calculation methods.the first calculation method is the retirement plan formula rigp formula,which is a guaranteed annuity calculated by multiplying years of service up to thirty years by percent of the yearly pay if an employee retires early,defined as retiring after the age of but before the age of,that individual rigp formula benefit is reduced by five percent for each year that he or she receives retirement benefits before reaching the age of.for rehired employees,the number of years of service includes the total time they worked for xerox,not just the period of employment following rehire.
the second method for calculating retirement benefits under the plan is based on the employee cash balance retirement account cbra,which consists of yearly contributions by xerox of an amount equal to five percent of the employee salary,accruing interest at a yearly fixed rate of one percent above the treasury bill rate.for those employees having commenced their tenure with xerox prior to the end of,their cbra also includes the transferred balance of a profit sharing retirement account that xerox maintained for each employee up until december.
finally,the third calculation method under the plan is based on the employee transitional retirement account tra.the tra is only applicable to employees hired by xerox prior to.the tra consists of the employee transferred profit sharing retirement account balance as of december,increasing based on the investment results of the funds in which the employee profit sharing retirement account was invested as of that date.
each year xerox gave its employees a copy of a brochure entitled you and for salaried employees to fulfill its erisa obligation of providing employees with a summary plan description spd of the plan.xerox also gave its employees a yearly estimate of their individual benefits to date.xerox did not distribute a copy of the plan itself to its employees,but it was available to them at the company human resources office.
layaou received from xerox his yearly estimate of benefits prior to the effective date of his layoff.this form estimated his rigp formula benefit to be per month.it noted that the benefits under the rigp formula will grow as your length of service and your earnings increase and may be reduced if you receive amounts before age or receive amounts from another xerox retirement plan.the form listed the current value of his cbra as and of his tra as.
layaou retirement from xerox became effective on april.upon his retirement,the plan administrator recalculated his benefits to take into account xerox prior distribution of benefits upon the termination of his first period of employment.rather than simply subtracting out the value of the prior distribution,the plan administrator recalculated layaou benefits using what xerox terms a phantom account offset,an offset of an employee earned benefits by the value of a hypothetical account containing the original distributed sum plus the amount the distribution would have earned had it been invested as described in full below,this phantom account offset applies directly to the calculation of benefits under the tra and cbra and indirectly to the rigp formula benefit through comparison of the three calculations.
the plan administrator thus determined layaou retirement benefit as follows 
the administrator calculated plaintiff rigp formula benefit based on his total length of service including his time with xerox prior to his rehire in and his highest average yearly compensation.this amount was then reduced to account for layaou retiring prior to reaching the age of.his rigp formula benefit came out to approximately per month.
the administrator then determined plaintiff tra amount.the administrator first calculated the amount plaintiff first distribution would have grown had it remained in the profit sharing retirement account and the successor tra.the administrator then added this tra phantom account offset to the amount actually in plaintiff tra account.the value of the tra with the phantom account offset was approximately.
the administrator determined plaintiff cbra amount using this same phantom account offset.the value of the cbra with the phantom account offset was approximately.
because the cbra with the phantom account offset was larger than the tra with the phantom account offset,the plan administrator converted the cbra with the phantom account offset to a monthly annuity of approximately in order to compare it to the rigp formula benefit.
the administrator then compared the cbra monthly annuity with phantom account offset of,to the rigp formula monthly annuity of.the administrator chose the larger of the two amounts,the cbra,as the benefit payment method.
for payment purposes,the plan administrator then subtracted out the phantom account offset from the cbra and converted that value to a monthly annuity.the cbra benefit was recalculated to be approximately per month.
thus,the administrator informed layaou that he would receive a retirement benefit of per month,a payment significantly smaller than any of the three calculation amounts set forth in xerox yearly estimation of benefits for layaou.
layaou submitted a request to xerox for additional benefits,disputing the plan administrator use of the phantom account offset.xerox denied the request,and the plan administrator denied layaou subsequent appeal.after exhausting his remedies under the plan,layaou filed this action in federal court.
layaou original and amended complaints did not specify the legal theory for his claim for additional benefits.in a march,decision and order,the district court denied defendants motion for summary judgment on layaou benefit claim the district court found that the claim was governed by erisa and granted layaou thirty days to replead the erisa cause of action and to name and timely serve the proper defendants for that claim.layaou i.at.
layaou filed a second amended complaint,alleging a claim for additional benefits under erisa.defendants moved for summary judgment on the erisa claim.in a decision and order entered on september,the district court granted defendants motion.because layaou complaint did not specify under which subsection of his claim fell,the district court identified layaou claim as one for benefits under a b and not a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under a or for equitable relief under a layaou ii,d at.the court then determined that it should review the plan administrator calculation of benefits under an abuse of discretion standard,rather than conduct a de novo review id.at.the district court reviewed xerox spd and found that it did not conflict with the terms of the plan,was not ambiguous,contained sufficient details to give employees notice of situations in which their benefits might be reduced,and complied with the requirements for spds under erisa.id.at.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,concluding that plaintiff has not presented a basis upon which a factfinder could reasonably conclude that the spd precluded the plan administrator from reducing plaintiff benefit amount based on the appreciated amount of his prior distribution in accordance with the terms of the plan.not only was the administrator determination in that regard not arbitrary and capricious,it was plainly correct.id.at emphasis in original.
plaintiff now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on his erisa claim.after plaintiff filed his notice of appeal,paul frommert and thirteen other current and former xerox employees the frommert plaintiffs filed a motion to intervene as plaintiffs in this action.the frommert plaintiffs argued that this court should permit them to intervene because the disposition of layaou appeal could impair their ability to protect the erisa claims they had asserted against xerox and its plan administrators in a separate action.this court granted the frommert plaintiffs motion to intervene.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants de novo.see quinn green tree credit,cir.in doing so,we must consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.see id.at.a court may only grant summary judgment w hen no rational jury could find in favor of the nonmoving party because the evidence to support his case is so slight.gallo prudential residential,cir.reversal of the district court grant of summary judgment is required if there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.schonholz long island jewish med,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
adequacy of disclosure in the spd 
erisa requirements 
erisa requires that the participants and beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan be provided with a summary plan description spd,a thorough and easy to understand summary of the benefit plan.a.the spd must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and must be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.id.erisa contemplates that the summary plan description will be an employee primary source of information regarding employment benefits,and employees are entitled to rely on the descriptions contained in the summary.heidgerd olin,cir.
generally,for a spd to meet the disclosure requirements of,the limitation or elimination of technical jargon and of long,complex sentences and the use of clarifying examples is required.a.the spd must include,among other things,a description of the circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial or loss of benefits.b see also l an spd must contain a statement clearly identifying circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial,loss,forfeiture or suspension of any benefits that a participant or beneficiary might otherwise reasonably expect the plan to provide on the basis of the description of benefits emphasis added.regulations promulgated under erisa prescribe the format of a spd 
the format of the summary plan description must not have the effect of misleading,misinforming or failing to inform participants and beneficiaries.any description of exception s,limitations,reductions,or restrictions of plan benefits shall not be minimized,rendered obscure or otherwise made to appear unimportant and shall be described or summarized in a manner not less prominent than the style,captions,printing type,and prominence used to describe or summarize plan benefits.
b see also chambless masters,mates pilots pension plan,cir requiring spd to explain full import of provisions affecting employee pompano michael schiavone sons,cir stating that the plan at issue was written up in summary form in simple and unmistakable language easy enough for the average plan participant to be reasonably appraised of his rights and obligations under the plan.in analyzing layaou claim,we are mindful that congress intended that erisa function as a comprehensive remedial statute designed to safeguard pension benefits.see geller county line auto sales,cir citing statement of congressional purpose.
the district court determined that the essence of layaou erisa claim was that xerox spd did not provide him notice that his future benefits would be offset by an appreciated amount of his prior distributions.the district court held that the spd complied with the requirements of with respect to this reduction in benefits.layaou ii,d at.we disagree and find,as a matter of law,that the spd failed to provide notice to layaou and other similarly situated employees that their future benefits would be offset by an appreciated value of their prior benefits distributions 
the only relevant language in xerox spd states that t he amount you receive may also be reduced if you had previously left the company and received a distribution at that time.the spd does not mention the term phantom account,describe the phantom account offset concept,or even indicate that the choice among the three methods of calculating future benefits will be made by first adding on,and then later offsetting,not the amount of the prior distributions but instead an appreciated value of the prior distributions.nor does the spd offer any example of how to calculate benefits for individuals who had received prior distributions.
the confusion caused by the lack of notice as to how benefits would be calculated for employees who were rehired after receiving benefits distributions was compounded by the individualized yearly calculation of estimated benefits xerox sent to its employees.layaou yearly benefits statement informed him that xerox calculated his rigp formula benefit to be per month and his cbra and tra benefits to be of and respectively.this estimation of benefits,like the spd,makes no mention of the phantom account offset or the fact that the benefits of rehired employees would be offset by an appreciated amount of prior distributions.the sole reference to reductions based on prior distributions is under the rigp formula benefit,to which no phantom account offset applies in any event.that notation merely states that your rigp benefit may be reduced if you receive amounts from another xerox retirement plan.emphasis added.even this type of general statement does not appear under the estimations of the cbra or tra benefits.
in chambless masters,mates pilots pension plan,cir,this court set forth the standard that an spd must meet to satisfy erisa disclosure requirements under.the amendment to the plan at issue in chambless addressed how employees benefits would be affected if they accepted employment with companies that did not participate in the same plan.id.at.soon after the amendment was adopted,the plaintiff employee accepted employment with a company that did not participate in the plan,which caused his benefits to be reduced from approximately per month beginning at age to about per month beginning at age.id.at.in finding that the notice of the amendment failed to comply with,we stated that because neither of the publications regarding the amendment explained the full import of the interaction of the provision and the amendment for someone in the plaintiff position,the notice was insufficient to satisfy the requirements of erisa,a and b id.at emphasis added see also bowerman stores,cir holding that because the explanations provided in the spd did not provide the critical information needed by employees in plaintiff circumstances,the spd lacked the clarity and completeness required by.
likewise,we find that xerox spd did not describe the full import of the effect of receiving a prior distribution on the calculation of future retirement benefits upon rehire,and therefore,did not meet the requirements of.the spd fails to clearly identif y the loss of benefits caused by a prior distribution.l.the general language contained in the spd that the benefits of employees who received prior distributions m
