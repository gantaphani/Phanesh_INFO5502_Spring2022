callie guthrie guthrie was denied disability benefits ltd benefits by her employee benefit plan.she brought suit against cooperative benefit administrators,cba under the employee retirement income security act erisa,a b.cba moved for summary judgment.the district court granted cba motion for summary judgment and denied guthrie motion for summary judgment,holding that no genuine issue of fact supported guthrie disability claim.because we find that cba failed to consider all of guthrie medical ailments in denying her claim for disability benefits,we reverse and remand.
guthrie is a year old former employee of harkers island electric membership corporation hiemc where she worked as a custodian for years.hiemc is a member of the national rural electric cooperative association nreca.nreca,a corporation,is a national trade association for rural electric cooperatives.nreca sponsors a group benefits program which provides disability,life,accident,medical and other welfare benefits plans hiemc along with more than other rural electric cooperatives participates in the group benefits program.the group benefits program is administered by nreca subsidiary,cba.
on march,guthrie took disability leave from hiemc.shortly thereafter on may,she filed a claim for ltd benefits.guthrie claimed to have breathing problems which prevented her from working in an environment using cleaning products.she also claimed to suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome,arthritis in her knees,asthma,sores on her skin,depression and anxiety,unsteady gait,poor vision,obesity,high blood pressure,and high cholesterol.guthrie primary care physician,goodman goodman,confirmed her ailments.goodman concluded that guthrie was totally disabled because her breathing prevented her from working around dust,cleaners,and humidity.he noted,however,that guthrie was not totally disabled from other employment.
hiemc groups benefits program includes a disability plan ltd plan that provides benefits to employees.hiemc contributes to a trust fund held by nreca for the payment of administrative expenses,insurance company premiums,and benefits.under the terms of the ltd plan a participant is considered totally disabled if due to sickness or accidental bodily injury he or she is completely unable to perform any and every duty pertaining to his own occupation,and after two years,completely unable to engage in any and every gainful occupation for which he is reasonably fitted by education,training,or experience.on june,cba approved guthrie claim for benefits under the ltd plan own occupation standard.
after receipt of benefits,guthrie says her health continued to deteriorate.although she underwent surgery for carpal tunnel,the surgery did not completely relieve her pain.she continued to experience problems with her knees,left wrist,hand,and cholesterol.
in support of her disability claim,guthrie submitted medical records from her treating physicians to cba.goodman,hugh everhart,a pulmonologist,and matthew zettle,an orthopedist,all agreed that guthrie could not work as a custodian due to exposure to fumes,solvents and dust.but none concluded that she lacked the capacity to perform other work.
based on these medical reports,cba referred guthrie to intracorp,an employability assessment company.after interviewing guthrie and reviewing her medical files,intracorp concluded that guthrie faced several barriers to future employment including,the lack of a high school diploma and limited transferable skills.intracorp noted that guthrie would need to learn how to develop a resume and but could perform sedentary or light duty jobs 
intracorp provided a job list,with descriptions,to guthrie physicians and requested that they indicate which positions would be physically and mentally appropriate.zettle approved the list.everhart confirmed that all the jobs were appropriate so long as guthrie was not exposed to excessive dust or fumes.goodman claimed that none of the jobs were appropriate.because goodman previously agreed that guthrie could perform other work,intracorp asked goodman to explain his new diagnosis.in response,he stated that he previously failed to consider guthrie other medical conditions asthma,chronic nasal congestion,gastroesophageal reflux syndrome,obesity,hypertension,osteoarthritis,carpal tunnel syndrome,and iq.taking all this into account,goodman opined that while guthrie could physically perform some of the positions,she could not function in any of the jobs.
in january,intracorp reevaluated guthrie and determined that despite having below average math,reading,and language skills she could perform unskilled sedentary jobs such as ticket taker,cashier,hostess,textile tagger,and photo finishing lab worker.intracorp provided guthrie assessment to goodman.he agreed that guthrie could physically perform a few of the jobs.
from february to june,intracorp says it provided guthrie with numerous job leads and assured her that if a job was offered,goodman would be contacted to ensure she was physically able to perform the job duties.however,according to intracorp,guthrie often unnecessarily and negatively explained her medical conditions to potential employers.
during this same time,guthrie says her health deteriorated even further.goodman noted that guthrie continued to have very significant medical problems.he reported that she had rather significant musculoskeletal symptoms,very prominent anxiety,depression,is frequently tearful,and severe dermatological lesions that in some ways were making her unemployable.james lauve lauve,a clinical social worker,also evaluated guthrie.lauve diagnosed guthrie as suffering from major depression and anxiety and concluded that her physical and mental state precluded work areas commensurate with her experience,education and physical capabilities.
on january,cba informed guthrie that her benefits under the own occupation standard would expire on june,and that it was reviewing her disability status.goodman submitted another evaluation along with current medical records.he reiterated that guthrie could not perform any job due to her mental and physical constraints.
virginia parks parks,a cba nurse analyst,reviewed goodman report and the medical records and determined that guthrie medical problems remained relatively unchanged.
on may,cba informed guthrie that it would not renew her ltd benefits because her medical evidence demonstrated that she could obtain other gainful employment and,therefore,was not disabled under the any occupation standard.guthrie appealed and requested that cba consider her award of social security benefits.
on july,guthrie petitioned cba appeals committee.in support,she provided letters from goodman and james zechman zechman.goodman stated he continued to follow guthrie osteoarthritis,severe dermatitis,asthma with an occupational component,esophageal disease,hyperlipidemia,and hypertension and that these conditions rendered her disabled from any occupation.zechman,in allergy and immunology,also concluded that guthrie has occupational asthma,which he considered a permanent disability.
cba submitted zechman report to propeer for a second independent review.leonard sonne sonne,a pulmonologist,reviewed the report along with guthrie medical files.sonne agreed that guthrie had mild asthma,depression,and arthritis but that there was no documentation to substantiate any disability from sedentary work,light work,or medium work.
on september,the appeal committee denied guthrie claim for ltd benefits.guthrie then filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina.guthrie sought,inter alia,reinstatement of benefits under g.on for summary judgment,the district court found that cba did not abuse its discretion in denying guthrie ltd benefits under the any occupation standard because there was substantial evidence in the record demonstrating that guthrie could perform sedentary jobs.
guthrie challenges the district court finding on two grounds the district court failed to apply a modified abuse of discretion standard of review in determining whether the denial of her benefits was supported by substantial evidence and the district
