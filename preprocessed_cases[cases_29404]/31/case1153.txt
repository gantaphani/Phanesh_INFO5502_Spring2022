kenneth chuck appeals the district court grant of the summary judgment motion put forward by several hewlett packard company defendants collectively,hp.chuck principal claim is that the hewlett packard company deferred retirement plan the plan,which is governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,owes him additional retirement benefits arising from his employment at hp until.he also seeks relief for the plan alleged breach of its fiduciary duties and for its failure to provide him with documents as required by.
at the heart of this case,we are faced with an issue of first impression in this circuit whether erisa statute of limitations may bar a claim for benefits notwithstanding a plan failure to fulfill its disclosure and review obligations under erisa.we hold that a plan material violation of is a factor that militates strongly against a finding that the statute of limitations has begun to run against a claimant,but that a compelling showing of circumstances in this case nevertheless indicates that chuck benefits claim is.furthermore,because chuck benefits claim is on account of his own actions,we hold that chuck lacks statutory standing to bring his claims under erisa.
chuck worked for hp from to,and then again from to.in and,hp appears to have calculated chuck pension credit and provided him with annual benefit statements as though there had been no break in his service with hp.shortly before chuck resignation from hp in december,however,hp recalculated chuck accrual of pension benefits in light of the gap in his employment with hp.the result was a significant decrease in the benefits that had vested to chuck under the plan.chuck promptly brought to hp attention his dispute with the benefits recalculation.according to chuck,he was entitled to the original,higher benefits calculation as a condition of his agreement to return to hp in.
in late december,soon after chuck resignation,hp sent chuck a retirement benefit claim form with instructions regarding the election of a method for pension benefit payment.the option to receive a lump sum payment had been for chuck,and every other option had been crossed out.the form also noted that o nce a lump sum benefit payment has been elected or approval for lump sum payment obtained,the choice is irrevocable.chuck never returned the form,because,as chuck alleges,instructions on the form signaled that an annuity commencing at age would be the default method of payment to chuck if no timely election were made.chuck then wrote a letter to an hp administrator asking that the amount of his vesting as announced on that form be corrected to reflect his original hire date with hp in.
a plan administrator sent a letter to chuck dated january,in which she the decrease in chuck vested benefits and explained that the change was due to the fact that from september,to august,you were not an hp employee.this letter also declared that corrected trust statements for and were attached and that chuck would be receiving shortly his final trust statement for the october,quarter.chuck admits that he was aware at this time that hp was going to take the position that he was not eligible for any further pension benefits.soon afterward,chuck received a lump sum payment of,which in hp view constituted a full and complete distribution of chuck benefits under the plan.
in late and early,chuck sent a series of letters to hp seeking clarification of the benefits he could anticipate receiving when he retired.hp replied in a letter dated march,noting that chuck had been paid the in and that n o further retirement benefits are payable from our plans.for the next several years,and then again starting in early,chuck sent numerous letters to hp seeking to reestablish his entitlement to a benefits calculation based on continuous service with hp.some of these letters also requested basic plan documentation,which hp had never given chuck.hp did not respond to many of these letters and did not provide chuck with the plan documentation.
chuck filed his complaint in the district court on december.hp moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the motion.the district court held that erisa statute of limitations bars chuck benefits claim and related fiduciary duty claims,and that consequently he lacked standing under erisa to bring his claims for plan documents and information.
our jurisdiction arises under,and we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.wetzel lou ehlers cadillac,cir en banc.because this is a review of a grant of summary judgment,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine whether there are any issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.quoting robi reed,cir.the district court interpretation of erisa also receives de novo review.id.
we first address chuck claim that hp has wrongfully denied him benefits to which he is entitled.hp argues that this claim is because it was filed after the expiration of erisa statute of limitations.chuck contends that his cause of action never accrued,and therefore that the statute of limitations never began to run,because hp failed to provide him with adequate information regarding either his benefits denial or his rights to an internal review of that denial.we hold that a plan violation of its notification and review obligations under erisa is a highly significant factor,but not a dispositive one,in determining whether a claim has accrued for benefits under erisa.in this case,an unusual combination of circumstances indicates that chuck claim is notwithstanding hp failure to provide proper notification and review.
chuck brings his benefits claim under a b,which creates a cause of action for a benefit plan participant to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.because there is no specific federal statute of limitations governing claims for benefits under an erisa plan,we look to the most analogous state statute of limitations to determine the length of the limitations period.wetzel,at.in this case,which arose in oregon,there is no dispute that the most analogous state statute is oregon statute of limitations for breach of contract claims.see.once his cause of action accrued,chuck therefore had six years to bring his suit in federal court.
federal law,however,governs the issue of when a cause of action accrues and thereby triggers the start of the limitations period.wetzel,at.we have earlier established that an erisa cause of action accrues either at the time benefits are actually denied or when the insured has reason to know that the claim has been denied.id.at citations omitted.a participant need not file a formal application for benefits before having reason to know that his claim has been finally denied.see martin construction laborer pension trust,cir.instead,a cause of action accrues when a pension plan communicates a clear and continuing repudiation of a claimant rights under a plan,id.at,such that the claimant could not have reasonably believed but that his benefits had been finally denied.wetzel,at.
the central issue in this case,then,is whether chuck had reason to know of such a denial more than six years before he filed suit in.
chuck argues that there could not have been a clear and continuing repudiation of his claim for further benefits if the plan failed to provide chuck with proper notice of that denial or with an opportunity to exhaust the plan internal review procedures.martin,at relying on both the denial of a claim and the exhaustion of internal remedies to find a clear and continuing denial.we agree that the record demonstrates that the plan violated its erisa obligations to provide chuck with adequate justification for its denial of benefits and with a reasonable opportunity for review.we do not agree,however,that these failures necessarily mean that chuck lacked reason to know that the denial of his benefits claim was final.
as a preliminary matter,we hold that the plan clearly breached its duties of notification and review under erisa.under,all plans must provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.plans must also afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.by the time chuck resigned from hp,the department of labor had promulgated regulations requiring,more specifically,that plan administrators provide claimants with 
the specific reason or reasons for the denial 
specific reference to pertinent plan provisions on which the denial is based 
a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary and 
appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the participant or beneficiary wishes to submit his or her claim for review.
although we have held that substantial compliance with these requirements is sufficient,see brogan holland,cir,here we find it plain that hp came nowhere close to complying.the only evidence that hp met any of these obligations is its letter dated january,which informed chuck that his vested interest has been changed due to the fact that from september,to august,chuck was not an hp employee.this statement complies with the requirement that the plan communicate the specific reason for the denial,but it clearly does not meet the plan other obligations under either or f.
accepting that the plan clearly fell short of these obligations,we must now inquire into the effect of such a breach on the application of a time bar.in an earlier case,we have decided that a plan noncompliance with these obligations prevented a limitations period from beginning to run.see white jacobs eng g group long term disability benefit plan,cir.there,however,we addressed only whether the plan inadequate notice could prevent the start of a contractual limitations is,a limitations period defined in the benefit plan itself.see id.at when a benefits termination notice fails to explain the proper steps for appeal,the plan time bar is not triggered.emphasis added.it is a distinct issue,and one we have not previously addressed,whether such a failure also prevents the triggering of erisa statute of limitations.see also mogck unum life ins,cir holding a plan notice insufficient on grounds other than,but discussing statutory and contractual limitations periods separately.
although many considerations remain constant across both contexts,we are persuaded of three slight but relevant distinctions between statutory and contractual time bars in the erisa context.because of these distinctions,we hold that a plan violation of does not always prevent the triggering of erisa statutory limitations period.
first,as we have discussed above,the trigger for erisa statute of limitations on a claim for benefits unlike the trigger for the contractual limitations period in a given plan is by federal law,requiring in cases such as this one simply that we examine whether a claimant could have reasonably believed his benefits had not been finally denied,or whether instead he had reason to know of a clear and continuing repudiation of his claim.wetzel,at martin,at.
a plan failure to comply with its disclosure and review obligations under is highly relevant to this inquiry,to be sure.it is indisputable that the clarity and apparent finality of a benefits denial are easily affected by whether the plan discloses its justifications for the denial and by whether there has been a reasonable opportunity for full and fair review of that denial.in this vein,for example,it is clear that the statute of limitations does not begin to run if a plan disclosure was so inadequate that a claimant did not even have reason to know about the denial.see price provident life and acc.ins,cir.even where a claimant does have reason to believe that benefits might have been denied,a plan compliance with serves crucial and signaling functions that lend certainty to a claimant understanding whether a given denial is final or appealable.a plan failure to comply with,conversely,deprives claimants of a congressionally mandated means of knowing the proper import of,and response to,a benefits denial.even in cases in which a denial might otherwise seem final,a plan failure to comply with could deprive a claimant of reason to know that the denial was final.
nevertheless,in unusual circumstances,a claimant may well have reason for such knowledge notwithstanding a plan violation of its notification and review obligations under.in particular,a claimant own actions or knowledge might serve to obviate the need for information.a claimant with actual knowledge of his internal appeal rights under a plan,for example,could not contend that a benefits denial was simply because the plan did not remind him of those rights.veltri.serv.pension fund,cir noting that a plaintiff with actual knowledge of the right to bring a judicial action challenging the denial of her benefits may not rely on equitable tolling notwithstanding inadequate notice from her pension plan servs.of america,inn dev,cir refusing to equitably toll a contractual limitations period and finding critical the fact that the claimants had had actual knowledge of the accrual of their cause of action.although this class of cases may not be vast,its existence counsels us that a plan violation can not create a per se bar against application of erisa statute of limitations.
a second relevant distinction between the enforcement of contractual and statutory limitations periods relates to the policies underlying those limitations periods.with regard to a contractual limitations period,we have determined that holding that inadequate notice does not trigger a time bar will not create a significant problem of stale claims,for plan administrators would have just as much capacity and incentive to avoid the contingent liability of stale claims by ceasing to rely on benefit termination form letters and giving adequate,specific notice.white,at.to a large extent,this reasoning is applicable in the statutory context as well,for plans have the identical capacity and incentives to avoid stale claims.but it is also apparent that the ongoing passage of time elevates both the burden imposed by a stale claim and the difficulty of resolving it.this effect is why,despite erisa goal of providing ready access to courts,and despite the absence of any express statute of limitations for benefits claims under erisa,the federal courts have long applied a statute of limitations to such claims as a matter of federal common law.see,martin,at see also flanagan inland empire workers pension plan trust,cir collecting cases.we have found that the policy of finality and repose has particular traction against allowing erisa claims after potentially extreme delays,given their increased negative effects on the availability of witnesses and evidence.martin,at citation omitted.
thus,there is at least some difference between allowing a claim to be filed several years after the expiration of a plan time bar but before the expiration of erisa statute of limitations at least in cases in which erisa limitations period ends later,and allowing a claim to be filed in perpetuity.while plan administrators have the capacity and the incentive to avoid stale claims of either sort,perpetual liability opens a door more widely to claims whose underlying events have long passed,elevating concerns regarding the plan abilities to anticipate its financial obligations adequately.veltri,at we share the concern that to allow tolling of the statute of limitations in perpetuity,would thwart actuarial prediction of plan liability and thereby threaten the ability of pension plans to prepare in advance to meet financial obligations simultaneously to both beneficiaries and adverse litigants.most significant,such concerns are particularly elevated once a claimant has clear reason to know that a denial of benefits is final,for at that point there is diminished justification for indefinitely allowing the claimant to sit on the matter rather than bring his suit in federal court.
a third reason to differentiate statutory and contractual limitations periods involves claimants access to meaningful remedies.clearly,ensuring the availability of both administrative and judicial remedies is a central purpose of the erisa regime.we have previously noted that adequacy of notice is important to claimants ability to obtain full and fair reviews of their claims,and the statute and regulations reveal a purpose to aid claimants in avoiding the obstacles a plan may place in their paths to the appeals board.white,at.erisa likewise reveals a purpose of removing obstacles in claimants paths to the courts.indeed,congress expressly declared that a central policy goal in creating erisa was to protect participants interests by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto and by providing for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.b.in keeping with congress goal of providing ready access to the federal courts,we must remain mindful that erisa is remedial legislation which should be liberally construed in favor of protecting participants in employee benefit plans.batchelor oak hill med.group,cir see also shaw delta air lines,d determining that erisa is designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.
one of the most significant remedial concerns regarding the enforcement of contractual limitations periods,however,is somewhat mitigated in the context of enforcing erisa statute of limitations.if,despite a plan insufficient notification to the claimant,erisa limitations period is the enforcement of contractual limitations boards still would not be entirely capable of deter ring claimants from timely appealing by sending vague and inadequate appeal notices.white,at chappel lab.of america,cir noting that missing the deadline for invoking a plan administrative procedures would entirely foreclose judicial review.after all,a claimant could still potentially seek a remedy in federal district court by filing a timely claim under a to enforce the notification and review requirements of claim for which the exhaustion of internal dispute procedures would not be required.see graphic commc ns union,dist.council,retirement ben.plan,cir e xhaustion of internal dispute procedures is not required where the issue is whether a violation of the terms or provisions of the erisa statute has occurred.quotation marks and citations omitted chappel,at a n erisa plaintiff whose claim is governed by the contractual terms of the benefits plan,rather than by the statutory provisions of erisa itself,must first exhaust the administrative mechanisms of the benefit plan claims procedure.emphasis added.such a suit would remove the obstacles a plan may place in claimants paths to the appeals board,white,at,for the usual remedy for a violation of is to remand to the plan administrator so the claimant gets the benefit of a full and fair review.syed hercules,cir see also mckenzie.of,cir noting that the ordinary relief is not substantive for a claimant who suffers because of a fiduciary failure to comply with erisa procedural requirements quoting blau del monte,cir.
granted,the availability of federal courts to hear such suits provides only a very limited safety valve for claimants.after all,these suits effectively require claimants to learn independently of their internal appeal rights,when congress and the department of labor have,to the contrary,explicitly placed the burden on plans of informing claimants of those rights.see.nevertheless,it is a safety valve that is most likely to be meaningful for the occasional claimant who had no basis other than the erisa statute itself for learning of his internal appeal rights but who had received unmistakable notification from a plan that its decision was final 
we recognize that,as between the enforcement of contractual and statutory time bars,these distinctions are not great.nevertheless,we find it significant that they are all relatively salient in the case of a claimant who,despite the violation,still has clear reason to know that the plan denial of benefits is final.we are therefore persuaded that a plan noncompliance with does not prevent per se the triggering of erisa statute of limitations.instead,we hold that,while a great deal of caution is necessary before finding a claim barred by erisa statute of limitations notwithstanding a plan violation of,an investigation of the facts of each case is necessary to determine whether a plan nevertheless foreclosed a claimant from any reasonable belief that the plan had not finally denied benefits 
the facts of this case convince us that,despite the plan failure to notify chuck of his appeal rights or of the full justification for its denial of benefits,chuck nevertheless had reason to know of the plan final repudiation of his claim by no later than march,such that his claim is.in particular,we note a number of factors that,taken together,close off any possibility that chuck could have reasonably believed the denial of his benefits was not final,notwithstanding the plan violation of.
first,chuck admits that he knew even before resigning in that hp was going to take the position that he was not eligible for further pension benefits beyond those to which he was entitled at the decreased vesting rate.a claimant in such a position is clearly on heightened notice that communications from the plan may reflect a final denial of eligibility for the benefits claimed.
second,the plan then did consistently communicate to chuck that it was taking the position he expected.as early as january,a plan administrator sent chuck a letter affirming the decrease in his vesting credit,and hp did not subsequently waver in its position with respect to the benefits due to chuck under the pension plan at issue.
third,chuck had actual notice that a lump sum payment,if made,would constitute his only payment option.the retirement benefit claim form that chuck received in december can only be read as providing chuck with at most two options a lump sum payment payable soon after his termination,or a life annuity commencing at age in his own declaration,however,chuck acknowledges that he reads the instructions on this form as informing him that if he were to receive a life annuity at age,he would not be eligible for a lump sum payment.chuck therefore admits that receipt of a lump sum payment would preclude his eligibility for further benefits at age.
fourth,chuck had notice that his acceptance of payment by lump sum would be irrevocable.the same retirement benefit claim form prominently notified chuck that a fter termination,the options are restricted as follows once a lump sum benefit payment has been elected or approval for lump sum payment obtained,the choice is irrevocable.
fifth,chuck subsequently accepted the plan check constituting a lump sum payment in the amount set by hp,and there is no indication in the record that chuck acceptance of that check was in any way conditioned on the reservation of his claim to greater benefits.indeed,there is no evidence that chuck communicated further with hp regarding this dispute for over a decade after accepting the lump sum payment.
sixth,when chuck did raise the issue again with hp,a plan administrator sent chuck a letter in march noting that the plan had paid chuck in and unequivocally announcing that n o further retirement benefits are payable from our plans.hp offered no indication that further consideration of his claim was pending or could be invoked 
these six factors,in combination,convince us that chuck could not have reasonably believed but that his claim had been finally denied.to recap chuck had actual notice of the position hp was going to take regarding the amount of benefits owed chuck,hp then took that position,and chuck accepted a lump sum payment in that amount chuck also
