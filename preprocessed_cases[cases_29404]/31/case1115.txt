are former employees the employees of cnf cnf,a supply chain management company that underwent a substantial reorganization starting in the employees allege that as a result of cnf reorganization,which included a spinoff of an underperforming division of cnf in which the employees worked,their retirement benefits were substantially reduced.the spinoff created a new company,consolidated freightways corporation cfc.concurrent with the division spinoff,cnf also spun off part of the defined benefit pension plan in which the employees were participants,and the employees became members in a new plan sponsored by cfc.these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.in connection with the plan spinoff,cnf engaged the actuarial services of towers,perrin,forster crosby,towers perrin to value the benefit liabilities to be transferred to the plan and associated assets to be transferred to cover those liabilities.this was done to certify compliance with the requirement of erisa,that each participant in the plan would if the plan then terminated receive a benefit immediately after the spinoff equal to or greater than the benefit she would have been entitled to receive immediately before the spinoff if the plan had then terminated.towers perrin also provided actuarial services to the new plan and certified for several years after the spinoff that the new plan was adequately funded.
after the spinoff,cfc declared bankruptcy and distress terminated its pension plan,which was then determined to be by roughly million.the termination resulted in a government corporation,the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc,becoming trustee over the defunct plan.pbgc pays reduced benefits to participants of plans from assets pooled from all terminated plans.
the employees sued cnf,cnf service,the administrative committee of the cfc pension plan and its individual members committee defendants for breaches of their fiduciary duties in connection with the spinoff the employees also sued towers perrin for professional negligence under state law in valuing the plan liabilities to be transferred at spinoff and in repeatedly certifying that the new plan was adequately funded.finally,the employees sued pbgc,as trustee,for not pursuing claims against the other defendants in connection with the spinoff.the district court dismissed all of the employees claims on various grounds,and this appeal followed.
we affirm the district court in part,reverse it in part,and remand.we affirm the district court dismissal of the employees claims because the employees lack article iii standing to pursue several of those claims,and lack standing under erisa to pursue others.we also affirm the dismissal of the claim against pbgc because pbgc decisions are presumptively immune from judicial review,and the employees can not rebut that presumption.finally,however,we hold that the employees might be able to state a claim for professional negligence against towers perrin under california law and remand for further proceedings on a more developed factual record.
cnf is a supply chain management company that provides services including trucking and air freight transportation.cnf operated two trucking units that,over time,began directly competing with one another the unionized cf motorfreight and transportation services.in and,cf motorfreight posted operating income losses in the range of to million dollars,while posted operating income gains in the range of to million dollars.in december,cnf spun off cf motorfreight,and created a,unionized trucking company called consolidated freightways corporation,or cfc.
before the spinoff,the employees were in essence participants in a defined benefit plan sponsored by cnf called the cnf.retirement plan cnf plan.in connection with the spinoff,cnf created the consolidated freightways corporation pension plan cfc plan.cnf and cfc entered into an employee benefit matters agreement ebma,which provided that cnf employees who became cfc employees as a result of the corporate spinoff also would become participants in the cfc plan and that the cnf plan would transfer to the cfc plan all its obligations owing to those participants.five of the six employees who were active cnf employees at the time of the spinoff were transferred to cfc.the ebma also transferred the benefits obligations of certain named retirees receiving pension benefits under the cnf plan,including plaintiff frazee,to the cfc plan.
the ebma provided that the cnf would transfer a portion of the cnf plan liabilities to the cfc plan these transferred portions would be the initial liabilities of the cfc plan.it also required cnf to transfer assets to the cfc plan equal to the present value of the cnf plan accrued benefit liability for the transferred participants and retirees as of the date of the plan spinoff.
the committee defendants administered the cfc plan.the committee defendants consist of the administrative committee of the cfc plan and cfc officers who served on the committee.the committee duties included retention of an enrolled actuary for the cfc plan and establishment of a funding policy for the cfc plan in consultation with the actuary.
the employees allege that towers perrin,a consulting firm,provided actuarial services to the cnf plan and the cfc plan for the benefit of plan participants starting in at least november on november,cnf filed an irs form notice of plan merger or consolidation,spinoff,or transfer of plan assets or liabilities,which it was required to file days before the spinoff.as part of the filing,towers perrin certified that participants in and beneficiaries of the new cfc plan would be as well off on a termination basis in the cfc plan as in the cnf plan.in january,towers perrin filed an amended form certifying the transfer based on more optimistic assumptions about interest rates and expected retirement age,which would result in a lower amount of assets being transferred at spinoff.
towers perrin also provided actuarial services to the cfc plan,including valuing the plan on an annual basis.the employees allege that in each year from through,towers perrin determined that the cfc plan was fully funded and that cfc had no obligation to contribute to the plan.this resulted in cfc making no contributions to the cfc plan in these years.
in september,cfc filed petitions for chapter bankruptcy.in january,cfc informed the cfc plan participants that the plan administrator would terminate the cfc plan in a distress termination,effective march,due to,and that the plan would not have sufficient funds to pay all vested accrued benefits to all participants and beneficiaries upon termination specifically,cfc estimated that approximately of current retirees would have their benefit amounts reduced under pbgc maximum monthly benefit limits.
pbgc assumed trustee responsibility for the cfc plan in june,and estimated that the cfc plan had approximately million in assets to cover approximately million in vested accrued benefits.this represents an approximate shortfall in funding.under the benefit payment limits set by pbgc,the employees suffered dramatic reductions in their pension benefits.pbgc,however,declined to file a civil action against cnf,cnf service,the committee defendants,or towers perrin.
this case has a complicated and tortured procedural history,with several amended complaints and motions to dismiss.we recount the procedural history here to provide adequate background for this appeal.
in,the employees filed a complaint alleging seven claims for relief five claims against cnf,cnf service,and the committee defendants collectively,the fiduciary defendants and two claims for professional negligence under california law against towers perrin.the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss.
the district court granted cnf and cnf service motion to dismiss the entire complaint without prejudice as to all defendants on the ground that the employees lacked standing to pursue its claims because pbgc has the sole power to bring a lawsuit against the defendants to recover trust assets.
it also analyzed claims one through five the claims separately.the employees first claim alleged that the fiduciary defendants breached their fiduciary duties by a failing to provide adequate information to enable towers perrin to formulate reasonable assumptions for its actuarial valuation b failing to supervise,monitor,and investigate the basis for towers perrin actuarial valuation and c failing to make certain that sufficient assets were transferred to satisfy the accumulated benefit obligation purportedly transferred to the cfc plan.the district court dismissed the employees first claim with prejudice as to all defendants based on its factual findings that there was no breach of fiduciary duty because,consistent with erisa,the cfc plan participants received a benefit after the spinoff that was equal to or greater than the benefit they would have received immediately before the spinoff,and the cfc plan remained properly funded for the next five years until.
the employees second claim alleged that cnf breached its fiduciary duty to all cnf plan participants by purporting to transfer to the cfc plan the cnf plan obligations to plaintiffs and class members when cnf knew that the cfc plan was unlikely to be able to fulfill those obligations due to inadequate funding at its inception and inability of its sponsor,cfc,to survive as an independent corporation the district court dismissed the second claim with prejudice as to cnf because the spinoff was a business decision not undertaken by cnf in a fiduciary capacity.it also concluded that no defendant violated of erisa.
the employees third claim for relief alleged that the fiduciary defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the cfc plan and its participants for the same reasons as alleged in the employees first claim for relief,except that the third claim related to annual valuations.the district court dismissed the third claim as to cnf and cnf service with prejudice,concluding that neither was a fiduciary of the cfc plan 
the employees fourth claim for relief alleged that the fiduciary defendants breached their fiduciary duties by a failing to establish a funding policy as required by the terms of the cfc plan,b failing to establish a funding policy that was reasonable,including requiring that reasonable actuarial assumptions be used to value the cfc plan,and c failing to follow a reasonable funding policy the district court dismissed this claim with prejudice as to cnf and cnf service on the grounds that neither had a fiduciary duty to the cfc plan to follow a funding policy,and even if such a duty existed,the court factual finding regarding compliance with justified dismissal 
the employees fifth claim alleged that the fiduciary defendants breached their fiduciary duties at the time of the spinoff by failing to properly notify cnf plan participants that their rights under the cnf plan had been terminated and assumed by a new plan.the district court dismissed this claim with prejudice as to all defendants on the grounds that the employees failed to name a defendant that had notification responsibilities the court factual finding regarding compliance with resulted in no cognizable injury and alternatively,the claim was barred by the statute of limitations at erisa.
the employees sixth and seventh claims for relief alleged that towers perrin,acting as an actuary to the cnf plan,committed professional negligence in valuing the cfc plan at the time of spinoff sixth claim and in valuing the cfc plan in subsequent annual valuations after the spinoff seventh claim.the district court dismissed these claims with prejudice,finding that the employees were not towers perrin clients and holding that towers perrin,as an actuary to the plan,owed no duty to the employees under california law,relying on bily arthur young,cal th,d.
the employees filed a first amended complaint that the third and fourth claims for relief under erisa against the committee defendants,and added the eighth and ninth claims for professional negligence against towers perrin under oregon,washington,and any other applicable state law other than california.the district court granted the motions to dismiss filed by the committee defendants and towers perrin.the district court dismissed the third and fourth claims against the committee defendants without prejudice,concluding that the employees had not stated a claim for relief under erisa a,a,because they sought relief on behalf of themselves and purported class members totaling of the entire plan,and not on behalf of the entire plan.the court dismissed the eighth and ninth claims without prejudice on the grounds that the employees failed to provide towers perrin with adequate notice of which state law it allegedly violated.
the employees filed a second amended complaint,which amended the third and fourth claims to clarify the relief sought under erisa a,a,and added alternative allegations and relief sought under erisa a,a.they also amended the eighth and ninth claims to allege professional negligence against towers perrin under oregon law,and added six new claims for professional negligence against towers perrin under the laws of delaware,connecticut,and washington.
the district court dismissed nearly the entire second amended complaint.it dismissed the amended third and fourth prejudice on the grounds that the employees claims under a still improperly sought recovery on their own behalf and not on behalf of the plan as a whole and the employees new claims under a sought money damages,which is not appropriate equitable relief under the statute.in a separate order,the district court applied california choice of law rules,concluded that the second amended complaint arguably states a claim for professional negligence under oregon law,and dismissed the employees claims based on delaware law,connecticut law,and washington ten through prejudice on the grounds that those states had no interest in applying their respective laws to this case.the employees have not appealed the dismissal of claims ten through fifteen.
the district court ordered the employees to file a third amended complaint for the sole purpose of incorporating its prior holdings.the employees complied with that order,and towers perrin subsequently moved to dismiss the remaining state law claims.the district court granted the motion in part,holding that under california law the plaintiffs stated viable professional negligence claims to which oregon law would apply but that as a matter of law,the plaintiffs could not state claims under oregon law because neither california nor oregon had an interest in applying oregon law to them and,therefore,california law as expressed in bily applied.subsequently,the district court ordered the employees to file another amended complaint joining trustee pbgc as a party to the litigation because pbgc was an indispensable party.
the employees fourth amended complaint added a sixteenth claim for relief against pbgc,as trustee of the terminated cfc plan,for breach of fiduciary duty for failing to bring claims against the other named defendants on behalf of the cfc plan.in response,the district court issued an order to show cause why pbgc should not be dismissed from the fourth amended complaint and realigned as a plaintiff.after a hearing,the district court dismissed the fourth amended complaint with prejudice as to pbgc,holding that the breach of fiduciary duty claim was not actionable because pbgc determinations that erisa did not impose a requirement that pbgc file suit following the failure of the cfc plan and pbgc had no meritorious claims to assert against towers on behalf of the plan are entitled to judicial deference.
the district court also addressed,sua sponte,the question of subject matter jurisdiction over the employees state law claims against towers perrin.the court dismissed the employees remaining state law claims against towers perrin,concluding that the employees lacked constitutional standing to sue because any recovery would inure to the benefit of pbgc,thus negating the employees redressable injury and the employees claims under oregon law were because their attempt to recover directly from towers squarely conflicts with the erisa requirement that any recovery for a fiduciary breach inures to the benefit of the pension plan rather than the individual participants.
the district court entered a final judgment dismissing the entire action.the employees filed this timely appeal.

the employees claims for relief relevant to this appeal fall into three general categories claims brought pursuant to erisa against the fiduciary defendants alleging breaches of fiduciary duties claims one through five state law professional negligence claims against towers perrin claims six through nine and a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under erisa against pbgc claim sixteen.we address these claims in turn.
whether the employees may pursue their claims against the fiduciary defendants turns on issues of standing.there are two aspects of standing that are relevant here.first,the employees must satisfy the minimum requirements of constitutional standing 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal citations and footnotes omitted.
second,the employees must satisfy a standing requirement imposed by erisa.erisa provides for a federal cause of action for civil claims aimed at enforcing the provisions of an erisa plan.reynolds metals ellis,cir citing e.to state such a claim,a plaintiff must fall within one of erisa nine specific civil enforcement provisions,each of which details who may bring suit and what remedies are available.id.citing a.as discussed below,the employees have invoked the civil enforcement provisions stated in a and a.
the employees allege that their claims for breach of erisa fiduciary duties numbered one through five seek,in part,relief pursuant to a.section a authorizes a participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action for appropriate relief under,which in turn authorizes a claim for breach of fiduciary duties by an erisa fiduciary the employees claims one through five seek monetary relief for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties related to the spinoff and breaches.
although the parties argue over whether the employees have sought a proper form of relief under section a,which goes to statutory standing under erisa,we do not reach that issue because we hold that the employees have not satisfied the requirements of constitutional standing.specifically,we conclude that the employees can not demonstrate that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that any injury to the cfc plan participants will be redressed by a favorable decision on their section a claims.see lujan,at.
we reason as follows.the supreme court has held that recovery for a violation of for breach of fiduciary duty inures to the benefit of the plan as a whole,and not to an individual beneficiary.mut.life ins.russell,d see also horan kaiser steel ret.plan,cir any recovery for a violation of section and a must be on behalf of the plan as a whole,rather than inuring to individual beneficiaries.therefore,if the employees were to recover monetary relief,that recovery would inure to the benefit of the cfc plan here,however,the cfc plan was distress terminated and is now under pbgc control.accordingly,any possible recovery on behalf of the cfc plan must go to pbgc because the cfc plan does not exist,or only exists as one of many terminated plans pooled under the auspices of pbgc and funded through pbgc collective funds.due to the distress termination,pbgc pays reduced benefits to plan participants under the complex priority scheme stated in erisa a,a,and the amount of funds available for distribution is determined as of the date of termination.see b,b.erisa c also mandates that a increase or decrease in the cfc plan assets be credited or suffered by pbgc.c any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a plan occurring after the date on which the plan is terminated shall be credited to,or suffered by,the corporation.because the employees recovery would be paid to pbgc,and pbgc is under no obligation to pay any of the employees any money above the statutory minimum,the employees have no stake in the recovery and can not satisfy the redressability requirement of constitutional standing.
our reasoning is consistent with our decision in glanton ex.rel.alcoa prescription drug plan advancepcs,cir,cert.denied,d.the plaintiffs in glanton were prescription drug plan participants who sued a benefits management company pursuant to erisa a,alleging that it breached its erisa fiduciary duties by secretly keeping the spread between what it charged the plan for drugs and what it paid to drug suppliers.plaintiffs claimed that if their lawsuit were to succeed,the plan drug costs would decrease and contributions and might also decrease.in glanton,we held that although plaintiffs suffered a cognizable injury,it was not redressable because nothing would force the plan sponsors to reduce drug prices,contributions,or.at.we recognized that erisa plan beneficiaries may bring suits on behalf of the plan in a representative capacity,but that there is no redressability,and thus no standing,where any prospective benefits depend on an independent actor who retains broad and legitimate discretion the courts can not presume either to control or predict.id.at citations omitted.the employees are analogous to the plaintiffs in glanton because any recovery,which is payable to pbgc,would not necessarily compel pbgc to increase the benefits paid to the employees,and we can not presume to compel such payments.
our approach recognizes pbgc role as an insurer of guaranteed and benefits.upon distress termination,employers are liable to pbgc for any unfunded benefit liabilities.b a united steelworkers of,clc united eng g,cir.after recovery from the employer,pbgc must pay plan participants all guaranteed benefits and a portion of benefits based on a statutory formula.see,united steelworkers,at.in a way,then,there is a in which pbgc is permitted to receive the excess of benefits collected from an employer in return for guaranteeing certain benefits to the plan participant.despite the fact that pbgc could pass along such an additional recovery to the employees,the erisa statute does not compel pbgc to do so,and we have no mechanism to compel pbgc to pass along the recovery.therefore,the independent actor barrier to standing applies and the employees have not demonstrated that it is likely,and not merely speculative,that their injury will be redressed by a favorable decision in the district court.
we pause to consider the fourth circuit decision in wilmington shipping new england life insurance,cir.there,a plan participant in a terminated plan sued the plan sponsor under a for breach of fiduciary duty seeking recovery of losses to the plan as a result of the breach.addressing the issue of constitutional standing,and specifically redressability,the fourth circuit held that the plan participant had standing to sue on behalf of the plan,notwithstanding that pbgc served as trustee and that the recovered funds would go into pbgc pooled coffers.id.at.it reasoned that pbgc occupies two roles guarantor of unpaid,guaranteed benefits and statutory trustee if appointed under erisa.see id.at.the court stated 
pbgc,acting as trustee,must hold plan assets in trust for the benefit of plan participants and pay all plan benefits,if possible,in accordance with the statutory order of priorities.see d a ii.only after the pbgc as trustee has allocated plan assets and determined that the plan has insufficient funds to meet its obligations does the pbgc as guarantor chip in from erisa funds to cover the unpaid guaranteed benefits.
under this rationale,pbgc,as trustee,would be obligated to pay cfc plan benefits,if possible,out of the plan assets and any potential recovery in this lawsuit.not until those assets ran out would pbgc assume its role as guarantor.however,the authorities cited by the fourth d a ii and not compel or direct such a payment.moreover,wilmington shipping requirement that pbgc pay all benefits to plan participants in a distress terminated plan would contradict the superior power to pool and disperse assets given to pbgc in a 
notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter,the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration,investment,payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans,and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.
we decline to adopt the rule from wilmington shipping and hold that pbgc role as an independent actor negates redressability,and thus the employees article iii standing to bring claims pursuant to a and a.
we next address those portions of the employees claims two through five that allege claims for breach of fiduciary duties for which the employees seek relief under a.we hold that assuming the employees have article iii standing to pursue these claims,they nonetheless lack statutory standing to bring these claims under section a because they do not seek appropriate equitable relief within the meaning of that section.
relevant to this appeal,section a b of erisa permits a participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.a b.thus,the complaining party must seek equitable,rather than legal,relief.reynolds metals,at.in assessing whether a claim for equitable relief has been properly brought under erisa,we look to the substance of the remedy sought rather than the label placed on that remedy.mathews chevron,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.further,t o establish an action for equitable relief under a,the defendant must be an erisa fiduciary acting in its fiduciary capacity and must violate fiduciary obligations.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.unlike a,which requires that relief sought must be on behalf of the entire plan,the supreme court has held that a participant or beneficiary has standing pursuant to section a to seek individual recovery in the form of appropriate equitable relief.see varity howe,d.
the employees complaint requests several forms of relief in connection with claims two through five.the employees opening brief on appeal,however,asserts that only the following forms of relief are equitable,and thus properly sought under section a reinstatement into the cnf plan based on the second claim,alleged only against cnf and an order on the third and fourth claims that the fiduciary defendants make good to the cfc plan all losses to the cfc plan resulting from breaches of fiduciary duties,monetary relief.accordingly,we address only these forms of purported equitable relief greenwood faa,cir we review only issues which are argued specifically and distinctly in a party opening brief.
the employees second claim for relief,which seeks,in part,reinstatement into the cnf plan,does not seek relief provided in a because the relief sought is not related to a breach of a fiduciary duty by cnf.reinstatement into a plan has been recognized as appropriate equitable relief under section a.see generally varity.holding that section a supports a cause of action for individual beneficiaries who allege that a plan fiduciary made material misrepresentations about their benefits.mathews,at holding that instatement into a plan is an equitable remedy where it would return the plaintiffs to the position they would have occupied absent a plan fiduciary misrepresentation that induced them to opt out of an enhanced benefit scheme reynolds metals,at recognizing reinstatement as traditionally equitable relief.however,in order to be eligible for reinstatement into the cnf plan,which would return the employees to the position they occupied before the spinoff,the employees would have to establish that cnf breached a fiduciary duty in deciding to conduct the plan spinoff.the employees can not do this as they acknowledge that a decision to spin a plan off,as opposed to implementing the spinoff,is not a fiduciary act.see lockheed spink,d holding that when plan administrators adopt,modify,or terminate pension benefit plans,they are not acting as fiduciaries systems council,holding that decision to spin off division of company was not a fiduciary act waller blue cross of,cir stating that the decision to terminate a plan,as opposed to implementing that decision,is not a fiduciary act.therefore,the spinoff decision does not give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty that supports reinstatement into the cnf plan.
we also conclude that the employees third and fourth claims,which seek monetary relief under a,are foreclosed by supreme court precedent.the court has held that the term equitable relief in section a must refer to those categories of relief that were typically available in equity life annuity ins.knudson,d quoting mertens hewitt,d.in mertens,the court held that plaintiffs who sued their pension plan actuary for breach of its fiduciary duties could not seek relief pursuant to section a because their claims sought monetary relief for all losses their plan sustained as a result of the alleged breach of fiduciary duties,which is the classic form of legal relief.at.stating that a lthough they often dance around the word,what petitioners in fact seek is nothing more than compensatory damages.similarly,here,the employees request that the fiduciary defendants make them whole in the amounts by which their pension benefits have been reduced as a result of these breaches.as in mertens,the employees claim for monetary relief seeks money damages,which fall outside of the remedy provisions of a 
we conclude that the district court correctly dismissed the employees claims.the employees have not satisfied the requirements for article iii standing with respect to their claims brought pursuant to a.further,the employees do not seek appropriate equitable relief for fiduciary breaches within the meaning of a.
we next evaluate whether the employees have stated a cognizable claim for professional negligence against towers perrin based on towers perrin valuation work at the time of the spinoff and in subsequent years.the employees sixth and seventh claims allege that towers perrin owed them a duty of ordinary care under california law,and that towers perrin breached that duty.
under california law,t he threshold element of a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a duty to use due care toward the interest of another that enjoys legal protection against unintentional invasion.bily,d,at.whether a duty of ordinary care exists is a question of law.glenn jackson,at.
california law sharply limits the duty of ordinary care imposed on a supplier of information to.in bily,the california supreme court considered whether and to what extent an accountant duty of care in the preparation of an independent audit of a client financial statements extends to persons other than the client.d,at.the court held that an auditor owes no general duty of care regarding the conduct of an audit to persons other than the client.id.at see id.at w e hold that an auditor liability for general negligence in the conduct of an audit of its client financial statements is confined to the client,the person who contracts for or engages the audit services.other persons may not recover on a pure negligence theory.in declining to permit all merely foreseeable third party users of audit reports to sue the auditor on a theory of professional negligence,the bily court premised its holding on three central policy concerns 
given the secondary watchdog role of the auditor,the complexity of the professional opinions rendered in audit reports,and the difficult and potentially tenuous causal relationships between audit reports and economic losses from investment and credit decisions,the auditor exposed to negligence claims from all foreseeable third parties faces potential liability far out of proportion to its fault the generally more sophisticated class of plaintiffs in auditor liability cases permits the effective use of contract rather than tort liability to control and adjust the relevant risks through private ordering and the asserted advantages of more accurate auditing and more efficient loss spreading relied upon by those who advocate a pure foreseeability approach are unlikely to occur indeed,dislocations of resources,including increased expense and decreased availability of auditing services in some sectors of the economy,are more probable consequences of expanded liability.
we noted in glenn jackson that california and federal courts have applied the bily rationale to other suppliers and evaluators of information.at holding that accounting firm hired by client to audit law firm bills to client owed no duty to the law firm we have concluded that the limitations imposed by bily apply widely to those who supply or evaluate information to limit their liability to even foreseeable third parties who have an interest in their work product.id.at.
we hold that towers perrin does not owe a general duty to the employees in the context of this case because two of the policy concerns at issue in bily weigh against imposing a duty of ordinary care.first,imposing such a duty could lead to potential liability for an actuary that is far out of proportion with its fault.the actuarial work performed at the time of a spinoff and afterward involves the derivation of funding conclusions based on assumptions about the expected retirement age of plan participants and projected rates of return for plan funding.as was the case with the auditors in bily,the work of an actuary at issue here involves a professional opinion based on numerous and complex factors and can not be checked against uniform standards of indisputable accuracy.at stating that an audit report is not a simple statement of verifiable fact,like the weight of the load of beans.
second,the probability of increased expense and decreased availability of actuarial services outweighs the possible advantages of imposing a negligence duty on an actuary in connection with a spinoff,such as more accurate valuations and more efficient loss spreading.see id.at.the imposition of a duty of ordinary resulting potential liability exposure in the hundreds of millions of have the probable effect of decreasing the availability of actuarial services increasing the cost of actuarial services generally increasing clients indemnification obligations to retained actuaries and increasing insurance costs for both actuaries and clients.these factors weigh against the probability that increased liability exposure would increase the accuracy of actuarial services,especially when such services do not involve precise,verifiable science.
for these reasons,we decline to impose a duty of ordinary care on actuaries in connection with valuation work absent a california statute or supporting case law.finding such a duty as a general matter would be inconsistent with the decisions of the california supreme court interpreting california law.
however,our inquiry into whether towers perrin owed a duty of ordinary care to the employees does not end here.despite the bily court holding that an auditor liability for general negligence is confined to the client,it recognized the possibility that intended third party beneficiaries could recover for an auditor professional negligence 
in theory,there is an additional class of persons who may be the practical and legal equivalent of clients.it is possible the audit engagement contract might expressly identify a particular third party or parties so as to make them express third party beneficiaries of the contract.third party beneficiaries may under appropriate circumstances possess the rights of parties to the contract.
id.at citations omitted see also glenn jackson,at recognizing the third party beneficiary exception to the bily rule mariani price waterhouse,th,d,same.the bily court stated that it was not presented with a third party beneficiary issue because n o third party is identified in the engagement contract.bily,d,at.although bily might be read to require that a third party beneficiary name appear in the engagement agreement in order to give rise to a duty,california decisions bily indicate that i t is not necessary that an express beneficiary be specifically identified in the relevant contract he or she may enforce it if he or she is a member of a class for whose benefit the contract was created.outdoor,pabagold,d,see also mariani,d at noting that despite bily use of the term express third party beneficiaries,it does not appear bily meant to create a new category of specifically designated beneficiaries,whether for tort or breach of contract purposes.
we reverse the district court dismissal of claims six and seven based on the intended third party beneficiary exception to the general rule announced in bily.the employees have alleged that towers perrin provided actuarial services to the cnf plan and the cfc plan for the benefit of plan participants,including plaintiffs,from at least november forward they have also alleged that they were intended beneficiaries of the professional services rendered by towers perrin.towers perrin filed its motion to dismiss before the parties conducted discovery,and towers perrin engagement agreement is not in the record.in the present procedural posture,we take the employees allegations as true.med,at.given bily recognition that intended third party beneficiaries might be able to recover from an auditor,combined with the employees allegations regarding the benefits towers perrin purportedly intended to provide to the plan beneficiaries at the time of the spinoff and,we conclude that the employees sixth and seventh claims potentially state a claim upon which relief might be granted the employees might be unable to ultimately prevail on a third party beneficiary theory,but we can not conclude that they have not brought themselves within the third party beneficiary exception insofar as a motion to dismiss is concerned.
we hold that towers perrin does not generally owe a duty of ordinary care to the employees,who are not towers perrin clients.however,we hold that towers perrin may owe a duty to the employees if they can be considered intended third party beneficiaries of towers perrin service agreement.because the record on appeal is insufficient to allow us to evaluate whether the employees are indeed intended third party beneficiaries,we remand this question to the district court so that it may make the determination on a more complete factual record.
because we disagree with the employees broad reading of towers perrin tort duties under california law,we must also consider the employees eighth and ninth claims for relief,which allege that towers perrin also breached its duty of ordinary care under oregon law.we need not address the merits of these claims because,applying california choice of law principles,we hold that california law applies to the employees negligence claims against towers perrin.
in a federal question action that involves supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims,we apply the choice of law rules of the forum,california.see patton cox,cir when a federal court sits in diversity,it must look to the forum state choice of law rules to determine the controlling substantive law.bass first pac.networks,cir a federal court exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims is bound to apply the law of the forum state to the same extent as if it were exercising its diversity jurisdiction.
under california choice of law rules,california will apply its own rule of decision unless a party invokes the law of a foreign state that will further the interest of the foreign state and therefore that it is an appropriate one for the forum to apply to the case before it.hurtado superior court,cal d.california courts employ a governmental interest analysis to assess whether california law or law should apply 
to determine the correct choice of law,we apply a analysis.first,we determine whether the two concerned states have different laws.second,we consider whether each state has an interest in having its law applied to this case.finally,if the laws are different and each state has an interest in having its own law applied,we apply the law of the state whose interests would be more impaired if its policy were subordinated to the policy of the other state.

here,the choice of law inquiry ends at step one of the governmental interest analysis because california law and oregon law do not differ.as stated above,california law generally states that the duty of ordinary care owed by a supplier of information,accountant,auditor,does not run to.see bily,d,at.however,california law recognizes an exception to the general rule,that such a supplier of information does owe a duty to intended third party beneficiaries.see id.at.
similarly,under oregon law,a negligence claim for the recovery of economic losses caused by another must be predicated on some duty of the negligent actor to the injured party beyond the common law duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm.onita pac.trs.of bronson,or,footnote omitted.the oregon supreme court has held,however,that in a negligence action to recover economic losses,nongratuitous suppliers of information owe a duty to their clients or employers or to intended beneficiaries of their contractual,professional,or employment relationship to exercise reasonable care to avoid misrepresenting facts.id.at.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that there is no conflict between california law and oregon law regarding an information supplier duty to,users of information.both states laws dictate that,as a general matter,an ordinary negligence duty does not run from a provider of information to a.both states laws,however,make an exception for intended beneficiaries.because the employees have not demonstrated a conflict between the states respective laws,we hold that the law of the to the employees negligence claims against towers perrin.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of the employees eighth and ninth claims for relief.
we next consider towers perrin assertion that even if california law provides for a claim by intended third party beneficiaries,it is preempted by erisa.there are two strands of erisa preemption express preemption under erisa a,a and preemption due to a conflict with erisa exclusive remedial scheme set forth in a,notwithstanding the lack of express preemption.cleghorn blue shield of,cir.we address both types of preemption and conclude that erisa does not preempt the employees state law claims.
erisa preemption provision,a,expressly preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan see also cleghorn,at.the supreme court has criticized the unhelpful text of this erisa provision,cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d dillingham,and we have similarly remarked that the relate to language has been the source of great confusion and multiple and slightly differing analyses.abraham norcal waste,cir,cert denied,d and,d in any event,the supreme court has instructed that a law relates to an employee benefit plan if it has either a connection with or reference to such a plan.mcclendon,d.this is a inquiry.dillingham,at.
we first address the reference to preemption inquiry.to determine whether a law has a forbidden reference to erisa plans,we ask whether the law acts immediately and exclusively upon erisa plans,or the existence of erisa plans is essential to the law operation.golden gate rest.ass city county of san francisco,cir quoting dillingham,at.in abraham norcal waste,we held that the plaintiffs claim of negligence based on state law was not under the reference to step of the preemption analysis,explaining that the relevant state law certainly does not act immediately and exclusively on an erisa plan,nor is such a plan essential to the operation of the law.at see also.state carpenters pension trust fund citibank,cir holding that state law negligence claims were not preempted under the refers to prong.our case law directs a conclusion that the employees state law negligence claims are not preempted under the reference to prong of the preemption test.the employees professional negligence claims are based on common law negligence principles and california civil code and a.these laws do not act immediately and exclusively on erisa plans,and the existence of an erisa plan is not essential to these laws operation.
turning to preemption under the connection with language,we note that the supreme court has not provided a succinct definition of,or analytical framework for,evaluating the phrase connection with.see rutledge seyfarth,shaw,fairweather geraldson,cir,cert.denied,d.instead,to determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection,we look both to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive,as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans.dillingham,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also golden gate rest.ass n,at employing a holistic analysis guided by congressional intent citation omitted.we have recognized that t he basic thrust of the clause is to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.rutledge,at quoting travelers,at.modification in original.we have also noted that the court has established a presumption that congress did not intend erisa to preempt areas of traditional state regulation that are quite remote from the areas with which erisa is expressly,disclosure,fiduciary responsibility,and the like.id.quoting dillingham,at.
we have employed a relationship test in analyzing connection with preemption,under which a state law claim is preempted when the claim bears on an relationship,the relationship between plan and plan member,between plan and employer,between employer and employee.providence health plan mcdowell,cir see also am.life ins.castonguay,cir the key to distinguishing between what erisa preempts and what it does not lies in recognizing that the statute comprehensively regulates certain relationships for instance,the relationship between plan and plan member,between plan and employer,between employer and employee to the extent an employee benefit plan is involved,and between plan and trustee.abraham,at same accord gerosa savasta,cir.
under the relationship test,the employees state law claims do not encroach on relationships.the duty giving rise to the negligence claim runs from a actuary,a service provider,to the plan participants as intended third party beneficiaries of the actuary service contract.the employees claims against towers perrin do not interfere with relationships between the plans and a participant,between the plans and cnf or cfc,or between those companies and their employees.at most they might interfere with a relationship between the plan and its service provider.but as we stated in castonguay,erisa does purport to regulate those relationships where a plan operates just like any other commercial instance,the relationship between the plan and its own employees,or the plan and its insurers or creditors,or the plan and the landlords from whom it leases office space.at here,erisa does not regulate the relationship at issue and,therefore,there is no express preemption under the connection with prong.moreover,there is no indication that the negligence would result in a multiplicity of regulation,congress chief concern in enacting the erisa statute.
towers perrin reliance on united steelworkers of america,clc united engineering,is unpersuasive.in united steelworkers,the sixth circuit held that plan participants in a plan where pbgc was the designated trustee could not bring a direct claim against the plan sponsor under the labor management relations act to recover pension benefits because that claim was preempted by erisa.first,united steelworkers is inapposite because it involved displacement of federal common law,which is analyzed under a different framework than the question of preemption of state law claims under a.see id.at.second,as the district court noted here,united steelworkers is distinguishable because the plaintiffs there brought their claims against the plan sponsor,not a service provider.although a state law negligence claim such as this one might encroach on an relationship were it made against a plan sponsor,it does not encroach on any relationship governed by erisa when asserted against a actuary.
having determined that the employees state law negligence claims are not expressly preempted under erisa,we next address towers perrin argument that the employees negligence claims are conflict preempted by erisa exclusive civil enforcement scheme.
erisa section a contains a comprehensive scheme of civil remedies to enforce erisa provisions.cleghorn,at.a state cause of action that would fall within the scope of this scheme of remedies is preempted as conflicting with the intended exclusivity of the erisa remedial scheme,even if those causes of action would not necessarily be preempted by section a.id.citing aetna health davila,d.in,the supreme court held that a plan participant state law claim for wrongful discharge was conflict preempted because that claim fell squarely within the ambit of erisa and erisa a provided a remedy for violations of section.at.unquestionably,the texas cause of action purports to provide a remedy for the violation of a right expressly guaranteed by and exclusively enforced by a.the court also noted that it is no answer to a argument that a particular plaintiff is not seeking recovery of pension benefits.id.at.
as discussed above,erisa civil enforcement provision outlines a participant possible claims,which include an action to recover benefits due under the plan,erisa a b an action for breach of fiduciary duties,erisa a and a suit to enjoin violations of erisa or the plan,or to obtain other equitable relief.bast prudential ins.of,cir.here,the employees sued towers perrin under state law for damages as a result of its professional negligence in valuing the benefit liabilities of the prospective cfc plan certifying that the cfc plan would deliver benefits to the cfc plan participants equal to or greater than were due under the cnf plan as is required by erisa,and annually certifying adequate funding of the cfc plan.it is true that erisa adequate funding requirement provides the standard by which towers perrin valuation and certifications would be judged with respect to the state law negligence claims.however,the employees negligence claim against towers perrin does not seek damages based on a breach of fiduciary duty and does not seek to enjoin towers perrin in any way.one could,however,analogize the employees claim as one to recover benefits due under the terms of the plan.a b.if so,then the claim would likely be conflict preempted because erisa would provide both a cause of action and an enforcement remedy.however,the employees are not suing for benefits based on plan are suing for state law negligence damages 
towers perrin argues that the employees claims would interfere with the statutory scheme in title iv of erisa,which governs pbgc payment of reduced benefits to plan participants of plans that have been distress terminated.see a.as the fiduciary defendants argued with respect to article iii standing on the employees claims,towers perrin argues that recovery from towers perrin on state law negligence claims would result in an increase in the value of plan assets under section c and would alter,and thus interfere with,the prioritized payment scheme under section a.
this argument is unpersuasive.the employees are suing towers perrin for tort damages payable to the class of aggrieved plaintiffs based on a duty owed them by towers perrin under state law,not for damages for breach of fiduciary duty payable to the plan and thus pbgc moreover,in this case the class the employees seek to represent all participants whose benefits were reduced under pbgc trusteeship.therefore,there is no encroachment on the section a allocation scheme.the employees negligence claims are not conflict preempted,and,as discussed above,are not expressly preempted.
finally,we address the employees sixteenth claim for relief,which alleges that pbgc breached its fiduciary duties under a and a by choosing not to pursue claims against the fiduciary defendants or towers perrin.based on the presumption in heckler chaney,d,we hold that pbgc discretionary decision not to pursue such claims is not subject to judicial review.
in heckler,the united states supreme court held that a government agency discretionary decision not to pursue an enforcement action should be presumed immune from judicial review under the administrative procedures act.see at.the court decision was animated by the general unsuitability for judicial review of agency decisions to refuse enforcement,which the court explained 
a n agency decision not to enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise.thus,the agency must not only assess whether a violation has occurred,but whether agency resources are best spent on this violation or another,whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts,whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits the agency overall policies,and,indeed,whether the agency has enough resources to undertake the action at all.an agency generally can not act against each technical violation of the statute it is charged with enforcing.the agency is far better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.
at.this jurisdictional bar applies where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.pac.gas ferc,cir quoting heckler,at.see also port of seattle,ferc,cir t he concern is that courts should not intrude upon an agency prerogative to pick and choose its priorities,and allocate its resources accordingly,by demanding that an agency prosecute or enforce.t he presumption may be rebutted where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.heckler,at.
this presumption often arises in the context of a challenge to agency action under the apa.see,franklin massachusetts,d serrato clark,cir.as a result,the employees suggests that the presumption does not apply to claims not brought under the apa.however,as we stated in sierra club whitman,t he presumption has a long history and is not limited to cases brought under the apa,cir holding that a challenge to the epa administrator decision not to initiate enforcement brought under was not subject to review,and recognizing that the heckler presumption was based on the court review of four cases.
turning to the applicability of the heckler pres
