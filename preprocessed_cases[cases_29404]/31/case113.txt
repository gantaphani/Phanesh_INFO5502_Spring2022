this case requires us to revisit the criteria that bring an early retirement incentive plan within the coverage of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,codified as amended at and in scattered sections of title.appellants and horning,retirees of appellee commonwealth gas company cgc,appeal from an adverse summary judgment in which the district court held that cgc personnel reduction program prp,an early retirement incentive,was an erisa plan that preempted various state law claims we conclude that,because the prp was little more than a severance package,it was not an plan.consequently,we reverse and remand so that the district court may consider whether to assert supplemental jurisdiction and address the state claims.
background 
because our determination turns on a pure question of law,we chronicle the underlying dispute briefly and refer readers to the district court published ruling for a more detailed recitation of the facts.see commonwealth gas,d.
in january,cgc decided to merge with its counterpart utility,the commonwealth electric company,which along with cgc was a subsidiary of a common holding company,commonwealth energy systems ces.the pending consolidation was first disclosed to senior officers of ces and later discussed at a meeting of the ces board as a means of reducing the total workforce.by a letter to employees dated february,the merger was publicly announced,as was ces intention to eliminate percent of the workforce,which it hoped to accomplish through attrition and a personnel reduction program it plan ned to offer to certain employees.the first meeting to develop that plan occurred in february a draft was created by and finalized on may,the effective date of the prp.
the prp contained several benefits for employees who opted to retire a severance bonus,pension credit,payment of cobra premiums,and reimbursement for educational assistance and outplacement services.in exchange,employees who elected to step down early were required to sign releases,and confidentiality agreements,and to forego their annual bonus for the year in which they opted to retire.this deal was offered to all employees during a period in the summer of.cgc reserved the right to limit participation to employees,and to delay the retirement of any employee who elected to participate for up to one year.further details of the plan pertinent to our analysis will be outlined in the discussion.
appellants and horning,both employees of cgc,were denied benefits under the prp after retiring on february and january,respectively they brought this action claiming that material misrepresentations made by agents of cgc misled them into retiring before the effective date of the prp.the district court found most of the alleged misstatements to be immaterial because they were made before the prp was under serious consideration see,d at.we need not address the timing or materiality of the alleged misrepresentations because our holding that the prp was not an erisa plan moots those issues absent an erisa plan,cgc owed no fiduciary obligations to appellants under federal law 
after initially dismissing appellants state common law claims as preempted because both parties agreed at that time the prp was an erisa plan,the district court reconsidered that issue at length in its summary judgment ruling,responding to appellants opposition.see,d at.recognizing that the severance bonus did not implicate erisa,the court nevertheless held that the composite constructed from the other elements of the prp coupled with cgc intent made the prp a covered plan.id.at.our review leads us to the opposite conclusion.

discussion 
before dissecting the constituent elements of the prp,we review the legal framework.since the statutory language has proven to be unhelpful we have relied on case law to discern when a benefit program constitutes an erisa plan.in fort halifax,the court made clear that a given plan must be evaluated in light of congress purposes in enacting erisa.at.paramount among those aims was to safeguard employee interests by reducing the threat of abuse or mismanagement of funds.massachusetts morash,d in enacting erisa,congress primary concern was with the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.see also demars,at congress wanted to safeguard employee interests by reducing the threat of abuse or mismanagement of funds that had been accumulated to finance employee benefits belanger,at erisa substantive protections are intended to safeguard the financial integrity of employee benefit funds,to permit employee monitoring of earmarked assets,and to ensure that employers promises are kept.accord baig,at.it is by gauging the level of employer oversight over pension funds that the plan determination must be made.
in evaluating whether a given program falls under erisa,we have looked to the nature and extent of an employer benefit obligations.rodowicz,at quoting belanger,at.those obligations are the touchstone of the determination if they require an ongoing administrative scheme that is subject to mismanagement,then they will more likely constitute an erisa plan but if the benefit obligations are merely a,incentive,they are less likely to be covered.particularly germane to assessing an employer obligations is the amount of discretion wielded in implementing them.where subjective judgments would call upon the integrity of an employer administration,the fiduciary duty imposed by erisa is vital.but where benefit obligations are administered by a mechanical formula that contemplates no exercise of discretion,the need for erisa protections is diminished.
the purported plan at issue in fort halifax is illustrative.it was a,severance benefit,which the court held did not constitute an erisa plan because it did not implicate the employer administrative integrity.id.at.the focus of erisa is on the administrative integrity of benefit presumes that some type of administrative activity is taking place.see also baig,at w e will be inclined to find a plan where there are elements that involve administrative activity potentially subject to employer abuse.quoting fort halifax,at.belanger,at o ngoing investments and obligations are uniquely vulnerable to employer abuse or employer carelessness,and thus require erisa special prophylaxis.
the fort halifax court also emphasized that congress state laws relating to plans,rather than simply to benefits.id.at.emphasis in original.it distinguished between plans,under which benefits are distributed,and benefits because o nly plans involve administrative activity potentially subject to employer abuse.id.at.we must therefore evaluate a purported plan like the prp as a unified whole.
the determination of what constitutes an erisa plan thus turns most often on the degree of an employer discretion in administering the plan.our cases have noted that such determinations are not clear cut and necessarily require line drawing.see simas quaker fabric,cir it is a matter of degrees but under fort halifax degrees are crucial.accord rodowicz,at belanger,at.for this reason,our precedents addressing benefits similar to those in the prp are particularly instructive,and we discuss those cases in the context of detailing the four enhanced retirement benefits offered in the program here.our examination of the prp benefits leads us to conclude that the severance provision,which was the primary component of the prp,does not fall under erisa.although other provisions might tend to implicate erisa,we hold that these bear little weight compared to the nature of the prp central severance benefit.nor does cgc intent,which was far from unequivocal,factor significantly in the balance in this case.
severance bonus 
the severance bonus was the meat and potatoes of the prp.like the severance at issue in fort halifax,it provided for a,payment.the severance bonus was based on tenure,calculated at the rate of weeks pay for each of the first ten years of service plus two weeks for each additional year,up to a maximum of weeks salary for years of service the method of calculation was explained in the prp calculations for severance payments under this program will be based on the employee authorized rate of pay and each full year of system service at the time of separation.simple arithmetic thus dictated the amount of the bonus.
the prp severance provision fits comfortably within the category of benefits we have deemed not subject to erisa coverage because of their limited,nature.in belanger,for example,we held that a series of increasingly more lucrative severance incentives,also based on years of service,did not an erisa plan make because those bonuses required no complicated administrative apparatus either to calculate or to distribute the promised benefit.at.more recently,in rodowicz,we held that a voluntary termination program,which included a severance remarkably similar to the prp,was not an erisa plan.at.like the prp,the rodowicz severance was calculated by multiplying some number of weeks salary by years of service it too was capped at weeks it too was offered to most employees during a narrow window of opportunity five weeks and it too conditioned the enhanced benefit on the employer ability to defer retirement for up to six months.id.at.although the prp election window and deferral period were longer,we agree with the district court that those differences are immaterial.see,d at.
in some ways,the rodowicz incentive involved even more discretion than the prp or the severance packages in belanger.it authorized certain exclusions for those terminated involuntarily and provided an appeals process for aggrieved employees to challenge that determination,which made it somewhat less mechanical and unthinking.rodowicz,at.despite these more discretionary elements,the rodowicz severance was not an erisa plan because it did not require that the company make a financial commitment to any employee who chose to participate.id.at.
unlike the rodowicz program,the prp limited the number of employees who could enroll,but this provision does not demand the protections of erisa.as stated in the prp,cgc reserved the right to limit its incentive offer to employees,a sizable portion of the eligible workforce.if demand exceeded that number,the choice of eligible employees would not be random it would be based on years of service.though a years of service standard necessarily requires individualized determinations,d at,such assessments do not implicate erisa unless they are based on,subjective criteria that could in their application be subject to employer abuse.see rodowicz,at belanger,at.as the district court pointed out,there was no evidence that this contingent exclusion had actually been invoked,d at,but even if it had,limiting incentive offers to the most senior employees based on tenure could hardly be more objective,or the application of years of service more mechanical.
that the severance bonus of the prp falls on the side of the line is reinforced by comparison to plans we and other courts have deemed covered by erisa.in simas,for example,we found that a severance bonus for which employees were eligible during a month election period,if not fired for cause,implicated the protections of erisa because the time period wa s prolonged,individualized decisions we re required,and at least one of the criteria wa s far from mechanical.at.in contrast to both belanger and rodowicz,simas criterion involved the type of discretionary determination subject to abuse that triggers an employer fiduciary obligation to its beneficiaries.emmenegger bull moose tube,cir finding erisa plan where eligibility for severance required employer to make an ad hoc judgment about the reason for the employee termination and evaluate the quality of that person service collins ralston purina,cir relying in part on simas to hold that retention contract that called for payment of severance in the event of a substantial reduction of duties or responsibilities was an erisa plan because employer was required to exercise discretion on an ongoing basis and to make nonclerical judgment calls schonholz long island jewish med,cir concluding that a severance conditioned on involuntarily terminated employee good faith effort to obtain commensurate employment elsewhere implicated erisa because it necessitated managerial discretion.in sum,the severance provision is a classic benefit.
other benefits 
the three other elements of the assistance,pension credit,and cobra to be little more than afterthoughts to the severance bonus.compared to the severance,they would not likely have factored significantly into an employee decision to retire early.we review briefly each of these other benefits.
the first such benefit was education and outplacement assistance through which an employee would be reimbursed up to for a course of study related to occupational or professional skill development or for services such as counseling,resume preparation or interview practice.the district court held this benefit to be within erisa purview,d at but kemp int l bus.mach,cir where parties agreed that retirement education assistance program was not an erisa benefit.even if the assessment of whether a course of study was related to skill development is the kind of subjective determination employers might be apt to abuse,the degree of discretion exercised would be negligible because the educational assistance benefit,like the severance bonus,was a payment and was available only within a year of retirement.that minimal amount of discretion attendant to the education assistance benefit was wholly absent from the outplacement services benefit.
employees who opted for the prp also received a pension credit equal to the number of weeks represented by the severance.that is,employees like horning and with over years service who received the maximum severance bonus would be credited with an additional weeks of service,enabling them to collect their pension benefits sooner.the district court,relying on an case that did not directly address the question of what constitutes an erisa plan,held that the pension credit implicated erisa because cgc would be obligated to pay a s long as pension eligible participants in the prp are alive,d at.this connotes a more significant undertaking than the facts justify.cgc obligation to pay its employees a pension arose under a different retirement plan undoubtedly covered by erisa that antedated the prp.the only change made by the prp to that defined pension benefit plan was to start disbursements sooner.once an employee elected to retire under the prp,the credit enhancement would simply be added to his accrued time in service.as with the severance,the amount of that acceleration was calculated according to a simple arithmetic formula.the pension credit,like the severance bonus,was a instead of left no discretion to cgc in calculating how much sooner retirees who opted for the prp would begin receiving disbursements from their pensions.as such,it did not implicate erisa.but see fischer philadelphia,cir assuming without analysis that a severance package that included pension credit of five years for and five years for age was an erisa plan 
the last prp benefit,the payment of cobra premiums for at least one year after separation,probably falls within erisa protections.we have stated,albeit in dicta,that cobra continuation coverage implicates erisa,demars,at,but that an employer reimbursement of insurance premiums paid directly by an employee does not,baig,at.relying on baig,the district court held that cgc payment of cobra premiums would not implicate erisa because it required cgc to do nothing more than write a series of checks over a year a mechanical process that would not require erisa protections d at.the court reliance on baig was misplaced.in that case,the employee had arranged for disability insurance himself,paid the premiums directly to the insurer,and was reimbursed by his employer.baig,at.here,by contrast,the cobra benefit was for a group
