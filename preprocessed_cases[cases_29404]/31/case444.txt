in this case an insurer issued its insured a policy that covered claims based on violations of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.west,but that did not apply to claims for violations of wage and hour laws.the insurer defended the insured in a class action suit seeking relief under both erisa and wage and hour statutes,but refused to indemnify the insured for the subsequent million settlement.the insurer contended that the settlement was based predominately,if not completely,on wage and hour claims.in the ensuing coverage suit,the district court held that the insured was entitled to indemnification for the settlement,and that the insurer could not obtain a partial reimbursement of defense costs.
we hold that the district court properly denied the insurer reimbursement for defense costs,but that a remand is necessary on settlement indemnification because the district court conflated the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify under maryland law.on remand,aside from limited amounts paid to class action plaintiffs asserting only covered erisa claims,the district court must determine how apportionment between covered erisa claims and wage and hour claims should proceed.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
plaintiffs in this case are perdue farms,a maryland corporation that operates poultry processing facilities in numerous states,and the retirement benefits committee of the perdue savings plan collectively perdue.defendant travelers casualty and surety company issued perdue a million pension and welfare fund fiduciary responsibility insurance policy,effective october to october the policy covered damages to third parties arising out of any wrongful act,defined as a breach of fiduciary duty by the insured in the discharge of duties as respects the trust or employee benefit plan.the parties agree that the policy covers claims for relief under erisa,but that it does not extend to claims for violations of wage and hour laws.under the policy,travelers had the right and duty to defend perdue in any suit seeking relief for a wrongful act,even if any of the allegations of the claim are groundless,false or fraudulent.
in december,leona trotter and several other current and former perdue employees filed suit against perdue in federal court,challenging as unlawful perdue compensation and practices.according to the district court 
t he plaintiffs in the underlying suit the trotter plaintiffs alleged that perdue statutory violations stemmed from its practices of not paying hourly line workers for time spent putting on,taking off,and cleaning protective sanitary clothing and equipment not paying some line workers for some work after the line card for their department had been clocked out not keeping a record of hours worked but not paid for,preventing some employees from becoming eligible for retirement benefits and not contributing to the perdue supplemental retirement plan two percent of the pay that employees would have earned if they had been paid for the work time reference d in and above.
the trotter plaintiffs amended complaint alleged three counts under erisa,one count under the fair labor standards act flsa,et.west,and five counts under the wage and hour laws of delaware,kentucky,maryland,north carolina,and south carolina.
perdue notified travelers of the trotter suit shortly after it was filed.travelers thereafter determined that the erisa claims created a potentiality of coverage that triggered its duty to defend perdue.travelers did,however,reserve its rights to refuse to pay any settlement or judgment,to decline to defend wage and hour claims,and to seek reimbursement for defense costs expended on claims during the next several years,travelers paid for perdue defense.at the present time,it has spent over million defending perdue in the trotter matter.
on august,the trotter litigation was certified as a class action.see trotter perdue farms,no,wl,at.the class was defined as a ll persons who at any time from december,to the present have worked or continue to work as hourly production employees of perdue farms,in any one or more of the chicken processing facilities operated by perdue,and who were or are participating in the perdue supplemental retirement plan.id.at.additional subclasses were also certified,including one for each state whose wage and hour laws were allegedly violated.id.at.membership in these subclasses did not require participation in perdue supplemental retirement plan.id.collectively,the primary class and state subclasses requested backpay,overtime pay,and liquidated damages under the flsa and state wage and hour laws erisa plan contributions,injunctive relief,and back pay incidental to such injunctive relief under erisa,see a,and attorneys fees.
in june,perdue settled with the trotter plaintiffs for million and limited injunctive relief.neither party admitted the validity of the other side claims or defenses,but the trotter plaintiffs did withdraw any allegation that perdue engaged in willful misconduct.the settlement agreement did not indicate how much of the million was attributable to covered erisa claims.however,relying on findings by the magistrate judge overseeing the trotter settlement,the district court determined,and the parties do not dispute,that approximately million was assigned to the trotter plaintiffs class counsel for fees and costs,compensated plaintiffs asserting only wage and hour claims,and was distributed to plaintiffs asserting only erisa claims.the remainder was remitted to plaintiffs asserting both erisa and wage and hour claims.
perdue requested that travelers indemnify it for the trotter settlement.travelers refused,contending that the settlement was based primarily,if not entirely,upon wage and hour claims.perdue thereafter filed suit in maryland state court,and travelers removed the case to federal court.perdue sought as indemnification for the trotter settlement,plus prejudgment interest.this figure includes the entirety of the trotter settlement,except the paid to those trotter plaintiffs asserting only wage and hour claims and in attorneys fees related solely to those claims.perdue conceded that these sums were unrelated to any erisa claims,and therefore not covered by the insurance policy.the figure also includes perdue additional expenditures of in settlement costs and in legal services.travelers filed a counterclaim seeking reimbursement from perdue of that portion of the approximately million in defense costs attributable to wage and hour claims.both parties moved for summary judgment.
the district court held that travelers could not obtain reimbursement for defense costs,and that perdue was entitled to indemnification for the trotter settlement.with respect to indemnification,travelers argued in the court below that erisa does not contain a remedy for backpay and that the thrust of the trotter plaintiffs allegations amounted to claims for violations of wage and hour laws,not erisa.the district court disagreed,reasoning that travelers was required to compensate perdue for the trotter settlement because perdue was potentially liable under erisa.according to the district court,perdue faced potential liability for this covered claim because the supreme court had yet to determine whether backpay constitutes an appropriate remedy under erisa,and because the record provided a sufficient factual basis to conclude that the trotter settlement was based,at least in part,on potential erisa liability.the district court further held that travelers was liable for the entire amount perdue requested because the wage and hour claims were reasonably related to the covered erisa ones with respect to travelers counterclaim for defense costs,the district court held that no such right of partial reimbursement existed under maryland law.travelers appeals.
this case involves two separate concepts in the law of insurance the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify.we begin with a brief discussion of these duties and their differences,and then proceed to travelers request for defense costs and perdue request for indemnification of the trotter settlement.
in maryland,it is axiomatic that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.see,provident bank of travelers prop.cas,cir bge home prods,owens,litz state farm fire cas.these obligations are conceptually distinct,and are triggered by different circumstances.
the duty to defend refers to an insurer obligation to defend its insured when a third party files suit.this duty arises at the outset of litigation against the insured,whenever the underlying complaint and other appropriate extrinsic evidence reveal claims that are even potentially covered under the insurance policy.see,walk hartford cas.ins,chantel assocs.mount vernon fire ins.in order for an insurer to be obligated to defend an insured,the underlying tort suit need only allege action that is potentially covered by the policy,no matter how attenuated,frivolous,or illogical that allegation may be.sheets brethren mut.ins,see also litz,at.doubts as to potential liability are resolved against the insurer.see clendenin fire ins.and in most circumstances,if any claims potentially come within the policy coverage,the insurer is obligated to defend all claims,notwithstanding alternative allegations outside the policy coverage,utica mut.ins.miller,internal quotation marks omitted see also montgomery county bd.of educ.horace mann ins,same.
the duty to indemnify,by contrast,refers to an insurer responsibility to pay a monetary award when its insured has become liable for a covered claim.t he duty to indemnify depends upon liability,an insurer obligation to pay a judgment or settlement.walk,at see jones hyatt ins.agency,mesmer.auto.ins.fund.this duty is thus narrower than the duty to defend.while an insurer must frequently defend both potentially covered claims and claims that are not covered under its policy,it is only required to indemnify covered claims for which liability is incurred.see,mesmer,at utica mut.ins,at.with the parameters of the duties to defend and indemnify set forth,we turn first to travelers request for reimbursement of defense costs.
after concluding that the erisa claims in the trotter complaint created a potentiality of coverage,travelers expended more than million defending perdue in the trotter litigation.travelers now contends that it is entitled to a partial reimbursement of defense costs for those funds allocated to the defense of wage and hour claims.the district court disagreed,as do we.
while jurisdictions differ on the soundness of an insurer right to reimbursement of defense costs,compare buss superior court,cal th,d,approving of the right,with agents ins.of am.midwest sporting goods,disapproving of the right,and shoshone first bank pac.employers ins,same,travelers has not identified a single maryland case that extends this right to insurers.under maryland comprehensive duty to defend,if an insurance policy potentially covers any claim in an underlying complaint,the insurer,as travelers did here,must typically defend the entire suit,including claims.see,montgomery county bd.of,at utica mut.ins,at.properly considered,a partial right of reimbursement would thus serve only as a backdoor narrowing of the duty to defend,and would appreciably erode maryland view that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,see,walk,at.
a partial right to reimbursement of defense costs would moreover undermine the bargain that maryland courts describe insurers reaching with their insureds.the usual commercial liability policy,including the policy that travelers issued to perdue,states that the insurer has both the duty and the right to defend its insured.see,sherwood brands,hartford accident indem.under maryland law,t hese are,essentially,reciprocal or correlative provisions.id.
the arrangement is beneficial to both parties.the duty to defend is primarily,of course,for the benefit of the insured,sherwood brands,at,and for its part,the insured receives a full defense,see,utica mut.ins,at.as maryland courts have long explained,a lthough the type of policy here considered is most often referred to as liability insurance,it is litigation insurance as well,protecting the insured from the expense of defending suits brought against him.brohawn transamerica ins,see also sherwood brands,at noting that defense costs will often exceed the amount of any liability in an underlying action.
the insurer,in turn,secures the right to defend as a mechanism for protecting and minimizing its duty of indemnification.sherwood brands,at.faced with uncertainty as to its duty to indemnify,an insurer offers a defense under reservation of rights to avoid the risks that an inept or lackadaisical defense of the underlying action may expose it to if it turns out there is a duty to indemnify.applied signal image,harleysville mut.ins,d,quoting terra nova ins.bar,cir see also sherwood brands,at.taking the arrangement as maryland has thus characterized it,allowing a partial recoupment of defense costs would significantly tip the scales in favor of the insurer.under travelers proposed rule,liability insurance would all but cease to function as litigation insurance,brohawn,at,instead merely providing insureds with an defense whose costs would then be the subject of subsequent litigation.
in the absence of any contrary indication from the maryland courts,we are unwilling to grant insurers a substantial rebate on their duty to defend.and even if maryland might at some point look favorably on a right of partial reimbursement,in this case the defense costs for covered and claims may have significantly overlapped,as the district court found.we thus affirm the judgment of the district court that travelers is not entitled to recover defense costs attributable to claims.
we next turn to travelers duty to indemnify the trotter settlement.the district court held that perdue was entitled to virtually full indemnification because it was,as a legal and factual matter,potentially liable under erisa,and because the wage and hour claims were reasonably related to the covered erisa claims.both of these determinations were misstatements of maryland law,and can not support the conclusion that travelers was required to indemnify perdue for the entire sum it was seeking.
first,in relying on the potentiality rule in the context of indemnification,the district court conflated the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify.the potentiality rule applies only to the duty to defend.see ins.it does not govern the duty to indemnify,because an insurer has no obligation to remunerate its insured for claims not covered under its policy.see employers mut.liab.ins.of hendrix,cir see also balt.gas commercial union ins.as maryland highest court has stated 
under the typical liability insurance policy,the insurer has a duty to indemnify the insured,up to the limits of the policy,for the payment of a judgment based on a liability claim which is covered.the insurer also has a duty to defend the insured against a liability claim which is covered or which is potentially covered.
mesmer,at emphasis added.thus,a major distinction between the duties to defend and indemnify is that the duty to defend depends only upon the facts as alleged,and the duty to indemnify depends upon liability.walk,at.for this reason,courts applying maryland law may conclude that an insurer has a duty to defend,but commonly withhold judgment on the scope of the duty to indemnify until the insured is found liable and the basis of any settlement or judgment is determined.see,sheets,at,mut.benefit group wise bolt,d.
neither perdue nor the district court cite a single maryland case applying the potentiality rule to indemnification,and this is understandable.under the potentiality rule,the insurer will be obligated to defend more cases than it will be required to indemnify.litz,at.under perdue rule,by contrast,an insurer must indemnify in every instance in which it is required to defend.the district court improperly indulged this theory,which would undermine maryland longstanding view that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify 
the district court also erred in concluding that travelers had a duty to indemnify all claims reasonably related to tho
