because of a debilitating back condition,linda myers,an employee of hercules incorporated,was awarded disability ltd benefits under the company income protection plan the plan.after myers had received benefits for over seven years,provident life and accident insurance company,the claims fiduciary under the plan,terminated her benefits,deciding that she was no longer disabled.myers sued provident and hercules under erisa a b,a b,alleging that provident had wrongfully terminated her benefits.after a bench trial the district court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support provident determination that myers was no longer disabled.as a result,the district court held that provident did not abuse its discretion in terminating myers benefits.after reviewing the record,we conclude that provident decision was neither reasoned nor supported by the evidence all three doctors who examined myers opined that she remained totally disabled.we therefore reverse.
the facts are settled.myers worked as a radiology technician for hercules at an ammunition plant in radford,virginia,from to.in her position myers performed and lung capacity examinations,maintained radiology files,and conducted certain laboratory examinations.the physical demands of the job required myers,among other things,to lift and carry film materials and gallon quantities of chemicals,to pull and push equipment into position,and to bend or squat in retrieving and storing film files.in addition,myers regularly carried film files up and down a flight of stairs that led to the basement storage area.
myers,who was born in,has a long history of severe back trouble.she had surgeries laminectomies in and to alleviate the pain.during the three years myers worked at hercules,she had three more back surgeries all laminectomies.after the fifth laminectomy in february myers did not return to work at hercules because she could not handle the physical demands of her job.in october she applied for ltd benefits under the hercules plan.under the plan a participant who is not able to perform her job is considered totally disabled and is eligible for ltd benefits for two years.after this initial period a participant is considered totally disabled and entitled to continuing benefits until age if she is not able to engage in any employment for wage or profit for which she is reasonably qualified by training,education,or experience.
in her application for ltd benefits myers stated that she could not do her job because back pain and lack of strength impaired her ability to walk,change positions for example,bend or squat,lift objects,and position the equipment.in support of her application myers submitted medical reports and opinions from her attending physician,donald yoder,and her neurosurgeon,harold young,both doctors concluded that myers back condition,which was marked by severe pain,rendered her totally disabled from performing any job.young and yoder both noted that myers could not sit,stand,or walk,or alternate sitting and standing,for even an hour at a time.finally,the ltd application form asked myers to list any skills that she had as a result of prior employment,training,or education.she listed typing,operations,operation manuals writing,and research technician.
myers was awarded ltd benefits the same month she applied,october.the following month myers,as required by the plan,applied for disability benefits under the social security act.her ltd benefits would be reduced by the amount of any social security award.on may,an administrative law judge awarded myers social security disability benefits,concluding that myers severe back impairment prevented her from perform ing sustained work activity at any exertional level.in the meantime,in april,myers had back surgery for a sixth time.this last operation included a lower back arthrodesis procedure a fusion and major instrumentation.
in,the year following the award of plan benefits to myers,hercules entered into a contract with provident under which provident would administer the plan and provide insurance coverage for disability benefits awarded under the plan.hercules,however,remained liable to pay the disability benefits for participants,such as myers,who became disabled before july.the contract named provident claims fiduciary under the plan.the plan gives the claims fiduciary the following authority with respect to claims decisions 
the claims fiduciary shall have the sole and exclusive discretion and power to grant deny any and all claims for benefits,and construe any and all issues relating to eligibility for benefits.all findings,decisions,determinations of any type made by the claims fiduciary shall not be disturbed unless the claims fiduciary has acted in an arbitrary capricious manner.
under the plan,ltd benefits end once a participant is no longer disabled.thus,a participant who receives benefits must periodically submit statements of proof of continuance of disability to the claims fiduciary.myers submitted these statements,which included reports from young,to provident on a yearly basis.from through young stated in his reports that while myers pain problem was improving,she remained totally disabled from performing any job.in young noted that myers had some leg pain and numbness and that she could not sit or stand for more than two hours total during a work day.in young reconfirmed that myers was totally disabled from performing any job.in her statement myers said for the first time that her condition allowed her to do light activities,specifically,to use a stationary exercise bike and swim.in young said once again that myers was totally disabled.in his diagnosis the doctor noted that myers had chronic back pain however,in reporting her subjective symptoms,the doctor said that she had no pain at this time.in describing the extent of myers disability,the doctor said that she was completely incapable of lifting,stooping,bending,crawling,and prolonged standing.
the report from young led provident to reevaluate whether myers was still totally disabled.in november provident sent myers a rehabilitation survey form.the information provident sought would assist it in determining whether myers was an appropriate candidate for the plan rehabilitation program,which is aimed at returning eligible participants to the workplace.myers responded to the rehabilitation survey in march.with respect to her tolerance for physical activity,myers reported that she could sit or stand for only one hour at a time.she could,however,walk two miles and lift six to ten pounds.according to myers,she could not return to her old job at hercules because she was unable to do the standing,lifting,carrying and reaching that was necessary.indeed,myers felt that she could not work at any job because considera ble time is needed daily for rest of my back.moreover,myers reported that extended activity or overexertion caused pain and numbness in one leg.after receiving the completed survey from myers,provident did not suggest rehabilitation.
provident next arranged for myers to have an independent medical examination.the examination was conducted by kerry donnelly on april.donnelly examined myers and concluded that she suffered from f ailed back syndrome,with good result from to sacrum anthrodesis,but with persistent pain and functional limitations.myers was otherwise in excellent health,according to this doctor.in a form assessing myers physical capacities,donnelly noted that in a single work day myers could stand for five hours,walk for six hours,sit for four hours,or drive for four hours.donnelly concluded his report as follows 
it is my opinion that this patient remains disabled from her work as an technician.she has no other training or education that would enable her to easily perform any type of work outside of this field.i think that given the fact that she has recurrent back and leg symptoms,with prolonged walking,sitting or strenuous activity,that this patient should continue to be considered permanently disabled from this problem.
in the final step of reevaluating myers disability,a provident representative interviewed her over the telephone on may.when the rep
