introduction 
timothy dupree dupree and alexandra martini alexandra,father and,bring this erisa appeal concerning whether or not dupree employee health plan covers alexandra stay at a residential treatment center rtc that had no contract with insurer holman professional counseling centers holman.the district court found that the stay was not covered.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
ii.background 
a.the behavioral health insurance plan 
dupree employer,beverly hills hotel,contracted with holman for behavioral health insurance coverage.holman agreed to provide behavioral health services through providers pursuant to the schedule of benefits,allowing that,if enrollees chose to instead use providers,they would do so at their own expense,except as otherwise provided in this group plan contract.this language is echoed in other contract provisions declining to provide reimbursement except in emergency cases or as outlined in this group plan contract,and declining to cover treatment by providers unless otherwise stated in the agreement.it also appears in the exclusions section,which denies coverage for services performed by providers except in emergency cases or as otherwise authorized by the plan.however,the plan also excludes coverage for a ny service that is not specifically listed as a covered benefit.
the plan defines providers as licensed,experienced persons working individually or within a clinic who are employed or under contract with holman to deliver behavioral health services to enrollees.the definition section then distinguishes between contracted providers those who have contracted with holman to deliver specified services and providers those without such a contract,while cautioning that enrollees may be liable for the cost of services provided by providers.
most relevant to this appeal,the holman plan includes care at a care facility,which is any rtc that has entered into a provider agreement with holman.in the benefit schedule,category iii,section c entitled residential treatment,transitional care,day treatment,partial hospitalization constitutes the rtc benefit provided for drug and alcohol treatment category iii also includes other sections detailing additional drug and alcohol treatment benefits a outpatient,b contracted hospital,d hospital,and e services.section d only covers care in an emergency situation.section e is not limited to emergencies,but has written below its description not a covered benefit.
alexandra treatment 
in the fall of,alexandra mother dupree approached holman to get help for her daughter.alexandra was years old.one year earlier she had been diagnosed with diabetes and prescribed insulin,but failed to follow through with the treatment.she had already blacked out from drinking on multiple occasions and been using illegal drugs for two years.
between august,and september,dupree spoke with holman representatives about finding an rtc for alexandra.after being apprised of alexandra substance abuse and diabetes,holman provided dupree with contact information for two contracted rtcs.dupree said she would let holman know if she was interested in them.to alexandra therapist and ucla doctors,dupree instead indicated her preference for a third option visions adolescent treatment program visions,an rtc in malibu providing diabetes treatment.the ucla doctors wrote to holman,recommending alexandra be sent to visions,even though it was not currently covered by dupree plan,because,according to dupree,it was the only facility that could manage alexandra substance abuse and diabetic needs.in response to this letter and to dupree statement that she was interested in visions rather than the two contracted rtcs holman cautioned that visions is not and that dupree insurance did not carry an benefit.
alexandra was admitted to visions on september,for alcohol poisoning following a blackout.she stayed there until october.
administrative and district court proceedings 
in november,dupree submitted a claim to holman requesting reimbursement for alexandra treatment at visions.holman denied the claim as an uncovered benefit.dupree appealed,and holman reiterated its denial.dupree tried two more times,and holman conducted two medical review summaries in response,determining that alexandra was admitted to the provider without authorization when contracted facilities were recommended and appropriate,and alexandra condition did not constitute an emergency.
dupree then filed a complaint in district court.after a bench trial,that court found for holman,determining that the insurer properly denied benefits for alexandra use of the provider.this timely appeal followed.

iv.discussion 
the question before us is a narrow one does dupree plan cover treatment at a rtc we find that it unambiguously does not.
when reviewing an erisa policy,we apply contract principles derived from state law guided by the policies expressed in erisa and other federal labor laws.gilliam nevada power,cir internal quotation marks omitted.those direct us to look to the agreement language in context and construe each provision in a manner consistent with the whole such that none is rendered nugatory.see see also cal.requiring contracts to be read as a whole,giving effect to every part.we will not artificially create ambiguity where none exists.if a reasonable interpretation favors the insurer and any other interpretation would be strained,no compulsion exists to torture or twist the language of the policy.evans safeco life ins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
dupree argument hinges on two aspects of the in the group contract itself and one in the benefits he claims together create an ambiguity that should lead us to find coverage due.see barnes indep.auto.dealers ass of cal.health welfare benefit plan,cir construing ambiguities in favor of the insured.first,dupree points to the contract language indicating that provider services,while not usually covered,are covered in cases of emergency or significantly as otherwise provided in this group plan contract.in order to give this latter clause meaning,dupree contends that the plan must somewhere cover,rtc treatment.for that somewhere,he would have us look to the benefits schedule and compare section c the residential treatment benefit with the other sections in the category.since those other sections distinguish between and contracted providers and section c does not,dupree argues that section c covers both contracted and providers,thus giving meaning to the as otherwise provided language.
we find this argument unpersuasive.
first,the policy repeated assertion that provider services are not generally covered establishes a default presumption of no coverage that must then be overcome by a showing of emergency not at issue here or some statement in the plan granting coverage.the policy exclusions section reinforces this presumption,denying coverage for any benefit not specifically listed as a covered benefit.as discussed below,several provider services are specifically listed as covered.rtc services,however,are not.dupree argument would have us elevate what they claim is a suggestive omission in the benefits schedule to a specific grant of coverage.to do so would twist the policy language.
furthermore,the acknowledgment of this default presumption does not give short shrift to the presumption exceptions.finding that only contracted residential treatment was covered does not render the unless otherwise stated exception surplusage.to the contrary,the plan includes several places where,services might have been covered.for example,the plan describes coverage for any,transitional mental illness treatment which follows initial emergency treatment,as well as coverage for,outpatient mental illness and drug and alcohol treatment services.the plan general language includes the unless otherwise stated exception to encompass these benefits.ultimately,these three benefits were not purchased by dupree employer,and not a covered benefit was inserted und
