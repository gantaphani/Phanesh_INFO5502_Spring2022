carmine pepe brought this suit to challenge the decision by an erisa plan administrator to deny his claim for a disability retirement pension.pepe appeals from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york cogan,dismissing his complaint.
pepe is covered for disability under the newspaper and mail deliverers publishers pension plan the plan,which is administered by the defendant,the newspaper and mail deliverers publishers pension fund the fund.the fund denied pepe claim on the ground that pepe did not meet the plan requirement of having accrued a year of vesting service in the accrual year immediately prior to the annuity starting date.the fund construed this language as requiring pepe to have submitted an application within one accrual year following the last accrual year in which he was credited with a year of vesting service.pepe last year of vesting service was apparently the year ending january,and,according to the fund,pepe did not apply for a disability retirement pension until at the earliest.
as discussed below,however,the plan nowhere provides that a participant must apply within any time frame and such a requirement would conflict with other provisions of the plan.additionally,pepe alleges that he called the fund in,and was advised that he had to secure federal disability benefits before he could submit an application to the fund.pepe won a federal disability award in.his call to the fund promptly thereafter was treated as an denied as untimely.the fund does not explain why pepe phone call was sufficient to constitute an application,whereas the alleged phone call was insufficient.
background 
from to,pepe worked as a newspaper deliverer for several employers that had entered into collective bargaining agreements with the newspaper and mail deliverers union the union.the employers made regular contributions to the fund on pepe behalf.
the fund is an employee benefit pension plan within the meaning of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.a.the fund board of trustees has sole authority to interpret and apply the plan,and resolve all disputes concerning its operation.
while employed by the new york post in june,pepe was allegedly rendered unable to work by an accident.he began receiving new york state workers compensation benefits on an interim basis.under the terms of the plan,so long as he received such interim benefits,he was still considered employed,and the new york post continued to make contributions to the fund on his behalf.that arrangement lasted for about five years,during which time pepe was credited with shifts of service and years of credited of service as defined in the plan.by the end of,pepe had accumulated years of credited service.
on february,the workers compensation board issued a final determination classifying pepe as permanently partially disabled,and settled his claim for a lump sum.accordingly,the new york post ceased making contributions to the fund on pepe behalf and he accumulated no further shifts of service or years of credited service.
pepe alleges that in early,shortly after the decision of the workers compensation board,he telephoned the fund and spoke with someone named cathy,presumably the fund office manager,catherine revy.pepe claims that he asked her what he had to do to receive a disability retirement pension that she told him he would first have to apply for and receive a social security disability award ssda,and that he followed her advice and applied for an ssda.
revy testified that she does not remember receiving a phone call from pepe in,but that,if pepe had called,she would not have told him to get an ssda first.under the terms of the plan,as we explain below,pepe did not need to obtain an ssda prior to applying for a disability retirement pension from the fund.
eligibility for various types of pensions depends on a member shifts of service per accrual year.the accrual year is defined as the year from february to the following january.an employee who works one hundred shifts of service within any accrual year is credited with a year of vesting service for that year.an employee who works or more shifts of service earns a year of credited service.
once an application for a pension is submitted to the trustees,and approved,payments begin.the annuity starting date is defined,for relevant purposes,as the first day on which all events have occurred which entitle the member to such benefit.
the specific requirements for a disability retirement pension are set forth in section of the plan under subsection,permanently disabled employees who have at least fifteen years of credited service are eligible to apply for a disability retirement pension if,inter alia,they have accrued a year of vesting service in the accrual year immediately prior to the annuity starting date under subsection,members who have as few as ten years of credited service are also eligible to apply for a disability retirement pension,if they meet additional criteria inter alia,they must be injured receive a social security retirement award and have accrued a year or vesting service in the accrual year immediately prior to the annuity starting date.
since pepe had more than fifteen years of credited service in,he could have applied for a disability retirement pension under subsection,without first obtaining any social security award.
after five years of litigation,pepe received a social security disability award in january on february,pepe called the fund and spoke to revy.the contents of this phone call are not in dispute.pepe told revy that he had received a social security award,and now wanted to apply for a disability retirement pension from the fund.revy responded that he was no longer eligible for a disability retirement pension because the last time he was credited with shifts was in the year,and,o ne of the requirements for a disability pension is that a plan participant must have accrued a year of vesting service in the accrual year preceding retirement.catherine revy memo to file.
subsequently,on april,counsel to the fund advised pepe that the fund was treating his february,phone call as a request for a disability retirement pension and denying it.the letter explained that,since the fund did not receive contributions on your behalf since january,it can not credit you with any additional credited shifts therefore,you have not met the requirements for a disability retirement pension.
pepe appealed to the board of trustees by letter dated september.he argued that he had not applied in because he had been told by catherine revy that he needed to get a social security award first.the fund board of trustees were deadlocked as to whether to grant pepe appeal,and so,as per the terms of the plan,pepe appeal was referred to an arbitrator the neutral trustee.
the neutral trustee held an initial hearing on april,at which pepe testified,inter alia,about his conversations in and with catherine revy.at the end of the hearing,the neutral trustee directed the fund to send pepe an application form for a disability retirement pension.a second hearing took place on december,at which catherine revy testified that she had no recollection of any conversation with pepe concerning his application for a disability pension.moreover,she said that if pepe had called in,she would not have told him to apply for an ssda since he had more than fifteen years of credited service.instead,she would have told him to make an appointment with one of the fund doctors.
the neutral trustee upheld the fund denial of pepe disability retirement pension by written decision dated april.the neutral trustee wrote that although pepe had more than fifteen years of credited service,and it appear ed that he was totally and permanently disabled,he had failed to accrue a year of vesting service in the accrual year immediately prior to the annuity starting date the critical test here is whether pepe accrued a y ear of v esting s ervice in the a ccrual y ear immediately prior to the a nnuity s tarting d ate.that is,in.the record clearly reflects that he did not.for the new york post made no contributions on his behalf in.or,for that matter,since.
the neutral trustee considered pepe argument that he had relied detrimentally on advice from catherine revy,but held that,even if revy had given pepe such advice,pepe should not have relied on it in light of the clear terms of the plan under the clear terms of the plan,pepe claim falls short i have no reason to question pepe testimony or his credibility.it matters not.even if pepe was misled,or misinterpreted what he was told,the fact remains that the terms of the plan govern.
pepe filed this suit against the fund and its trustees collectively defendants on october.he alleges that the denial of his claim was arbitrary and capricious,under a b and that the trustees breached their fiduciary duties to him by misinforming him of the procedures to obtain a disability retirement pension,in violation of,and by depriving him of a full and fair review of his claim,in violation of 
by order entered february,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to pepe full and fair hearing claim and his claim challenging the denial of his disability retirement pension.as the court later explained it found nothing arbitrary or capricious about the neutral trustee interpretation of the plan because an application deadline was implied in subsection the key language requires that pepe be deemed to have ceased work within one year of the date he applied for benefits.although the provision does not say that failure to apply within that period will effect a forfeiture of pension rights,it seems quite obvious that anyone applying outside the defined period would not fall within the requirement emphasis added.
after additional limited discovery relating to catherine revy position at the fund,the district court dismissed pepe remaining breach of fiduciary duty claim by memorandum decision and order entered september,pepe timely appealed.

it is undisputed that pepe accrued no shifts of service or years of vesting service after january.the neutral trustee denied pepe claim because he determined that pepe had not accrued a year of vesting service in the accrual year immediately prior to the annuity starting date.the neutral trustee decision rests on one,or both,of two assumptions the annuity starting date can not be made retroactive to some appropriate date in and pepe did not actually apply to the fund until or.neither assumption is warranted on this record.
the requirement that a member must accrue a year of vesting service in the accrual year immediately prior to the annuity starting date means that the annuity starting date may not incept more than one accrual year after the last year of vesting service.but it does not follow that a member must submit an application within that timeframe,nor does the plan or spd state that an annuity starting date can not be made retroactive the starting date of an annuity can the decision granting the award,or even the application,by the common expedient of a retroactive payment.
the by the neutral trustee and the district an annuity starting date may not be made retroactive is incompatible with the structure of the plan.absent retroactivity,a member would have to apply within the accrual year and the fund would have to act on the application within the accrual year.if the ruling below were sound,the fund could deny a timely application simply by delaying consideration beyond the last possible annuity starting date.at oral argument,counsel for the defendants acknowledged that in practice the fund does make the annuity starting date retroactive,so long as an application is submitted within the accrual year following his last year of vesting service but this sensible accommodation confirms that the plan and spd do not require an application be submitted by any particular date.and any such requirement would have to be express in order to comply with b,which requires an spd to contain,among other things,circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial or loss of benefits.
further,retroactivity is positively necessary to the administration of some features of the plan.subsection allows members with only ten or more years of credited service to be eligible to apply for a disability retirement pension if they are injured in an accident resulting in a social security retirement award,and they have accrued a year of vesting service in the accrual year immediately prior to the annuity starting date.to be eligible for a pension under this subsection,a member would have to apply for and receive a social security award and then submit an application to the fund.under the fund interpretation of the plan,all this would have to be accomplished within one accrual year of the last year of vesting service.yet it took pepe five years to apply for and receive his ssda,and his experience is not unheard of it would be arbitrary to condition pension eligibility on prompt action by the social security administration.
the relevance of subsection is by no means hypothetical.the neutral trustee considered pepe eligibility for a disability retirement pension only under subsection but there is no indication in the plan that a member with more than fifteen years of credited service must be considered under subsection,and can not instead apply under subsection.if pepe application is considered as arising under subsection there seems to be no reason not to,he would meet the requirement that his injury resulted in a social security award,and he would have done precisely what subsection demands prior to submitting his application to the fund apply for and receive a social security award.but under the interpretation of the plan adopted below,his disability retirement pension would be denied on the ground that the social security administration took more than a year to decide his case.
in light of these considerations,particularly the lack of an explicit provision in the plan or spd that sets forth a particular timeframe in which members must apply,the denial of pepe disability retirement pension claim was arbitrary and capricious.
the fund failure to explain its treatment of the alleged phone call also renders its denial arbitrary and capricious.to apply for a disability retirement pension under either subsection or,a member must fil e the application prescribed by the trustees.but pepe phone call was treated as an application,which was formally denied by a letter from the fund outside counsel.it is not clear why pepe phone call to the fund would not be trea
