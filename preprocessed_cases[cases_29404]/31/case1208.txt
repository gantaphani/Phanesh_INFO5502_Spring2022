we must decide,in an action under the employment retirement income security act erisa,whether trustees of employee benefit plans produced sufficient evidence of employer liability on summary judgment to shift the burden of production.
audio,a corporation engaged in the business of creating optical sound negatives,employs approximately eighteen local union members.audio is a party to collective bargaining agreements with the international alliance of theatrical state employees and motion picture operators iatse and the alliance of motion picture and television producers amptp.pursuant to these agreements,audio was obligated to make contributions on behalf of its employees who were performing work covered under those agreements to two pension and employee benefits plans the motion picture industry health plan and the motion picture industry pension plan collectively,the plans.the collective bargaining agreements also called for audio to report to the plans every hour worked by or guaranteed to their employees covered by those agreements.
the collective bargaining agreements provided remedies of liquidated damages and interest in the event of audio default in payment.furthermore,trustees of the plans were authorized to audit the employment and payroll records of audio to ensure that it complied with its contribution responsibilities.
in due course,trustees of the plans initiated an audit of audio records,covering the period from january,through march.at the conclusion of the audit,in december,they informed audio that it owed the plans approximately.audio objected to the auditors findings in a letter dated january.
on may,the plans filed suit in the central district of california under erisa provisions and,alleging that audio had failed to pay the delinquent contributions identified in the audit.the plans filed a motion for summary judgment on december,to which they attached a declaration of their chief auditor,teri goldstein,reciting that audio had failed to keep adequate records and that the plans auditors had raised serious questions as to whether audio employees had performed covered work for which contributions were not paid.goldstein stated by declaration that often,the absence of detailed records made it impossible to determine the precise number of hours or type of work performed by the employees.
audio filed its opposition to the motion for summary judgment on december,responding that the plans motion should fail because they have not identified what work these individuals have done.on february,the district court entered judgment in favor of the plans.audio timely filed this appeal 
both sides agree that the controlling case on appeal is brick masons pension trust industrial fence supply,cir.brick masons establishes that a trustee in an erisa contribution case can make a showing that will shift the burden to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of covered work performed by its employees.id.at.the dispute between the trustees and audio is focused primarily on the quantum of the showing that the trustees must make in order to effect such a shift in the burden of production.
in brick masons,union fringe benefit funds brought an action against an employer to recover contributions for certain masons employed by one of the employer nonunion subsidiaries,who performed covered work for that same employer unionized subsidiary.brick masons,at.there,the district court expressly found that while there was evidence that some covered work had been performed by the nonunion masons,there was no evidence of the extent of that work.id.the district court concluded,therefore,that any damage award would be too speculative.id.
on appeal,we reversed the district court and held that a of erisa imposes a duty on employers to maintain records of the number of hours worked by employees.id.at.consequently,we held that once the trustees produce evidence raising genuine questions about the accuracy of the employer records and the number of hours worked by the employees,the burden shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed.id.at.that is,once the trust funds proved the fact of damage and the employer failure to keep adequate records,the burden shifted to the employer to come forward with evidence of the extent of the damage.id.at.the fact of damage was certain in brick masons because i t was undisputed that the trust funds received no contributions for work performed by masons even though they did some covered work during the relevant time period.id.at emphasis added.the only uncertainty was in the amount of damages arising from the statutory violation by the employer.id.at quoting anderson clemens pottery.it was on this question that the burden shifted to the employer to come forward with evidence of the extend of the covered work performed id.at.
thus,under brick masons,once the trustees show that audio failed to keep adequate records,and that there exist some employees who a performed covered work that was b unreported to the trust funds,then the burden shifts to the audio to show the extent of the unreported covered work for those employees 
there is little doubt that the trustees met their first threshold burden,proving that audio failed to keep adequate records.the plans submitted in support of their motion for summary judgment declarations of the auditors who examined those records.both auditors testified that audio records were insufficiently clear to determine precisely how many hours of covered work were performed by audio employees.specifically,the plans senior auditor,teri goldstein,declared that she examined the available payroll records,timecards,and of all employees who had hours reported to the plans during the audit period,and found some of them were compensated for more hours of work than had been reported.goldstein further noted that while the documents occasionally revealed the nature of the services for which employees were being paid,they more frequently failed to identify the type of work performed.a second auditor,steven smith,confirmed these declarations,stating that he found audio records to be insufficiently detailed to allow him to identify the type of work performed.the affirmative declarations of the plans auditors are sufficient to meet the trustees first threshold burden.
moreover,audio effectively admitted the inadequacy of its own records when,in responding to a discovery request for all documents identifying the duties of employees,it responded that it did not have such documents.if the records did,in fact,exist,audio could simply have produced them,thereby refuting the trustees threshold showing.but it did not.this admission can constitute a basis for summary judgment.in re pacific express,cir.
the trustees did not,however,produce evidence meeting their other threshold burdens,proving that there existed some employees who a performed covered work that was b unreported to the plans.although the trustees produced evidence to establish that audio failed to report some of the hours worked by its employees,it did not produce evidence establishing that those unreported hours corresponded to covered work.
in previous cases,employee benefit plans have made the requisite showing that some of the unreported hours corresponded to covered work by submitting testimony by employees who performed the unreported work,brick masons,at combs king,cir.in this case,the plans did not submit any employee testimony along with their motion for summary judgment,and,instead,offered only the testimony of their auditors.a close reading of this testimony,however,reveals that the plans auditors failed to show that any of the unreported hours corresponded to covered work.
there were two categories of unreported hours identified by the auditors.the first category was based on discrepancies between payroll records,timecards,and and the data reported by audio to the plans.rather than establish that any of these discrepancies corresponded to covered work,however,the auditors appeared to presume without any basis that all of these hours were for covered work,concluding since no documents
