this case presents the issue of whether portions of the minnesota sprinkler fitter statute and rules which require contractors to adopt approved apprenticeship programs is preempted by the employee retirement income security act of,et.erisa.the district court held that the statute and rules were preempted and issued a permanent injunction preventing enforcement of the apprenticeship regulations.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and a and affirm.
background 
in,the minnesota legislature passed the sprinkler fitter licensing law which comprehensively regulated the fire protection industry in minnesota.see,minnesota laws,chap.the statute was codified as.chap.section gave statutory authority to the minnesota department of public safety to promulgate rules governing chap.one of the statutory provisions of the sprinkler fitter licensing statute was the requirement that only licensed journeymen and registered apprentices could perform fire protection work.the law required apprentices to be actively enrolled in a registered apprenticeship program and registered with a federal or state agency that approved apprenticeship programs.
in,the minnesota department of public safety issued rules putting into effect the statutory provisions of.chap.the rules defined federal approval agency as the united states department of labor,bureau of apprenticeship and training and the state approval agency was defined as the department of labor and industry or a state agency in minnesota or another state if the commissioner determines that the state agency approves training programs and monitors apprentice or trainee progress in a manner comparable to that done by the department of labor and industry or by the united states department of labor,bureau of apprenticeship and training,subps.
the statute and rules require all minnesota sprinkler contractors to maintain an apprenticeship program approved by the minnesota department of labor and industry and to register all of their apprentices in the approved apprenticeship program,subps,subp.contractors without an approved program could not employ apprentices in the state.
to obtain an approved apprenticeship program,contractors had to meet a number of requirements the apprenticeship program had to be of the same duration as the majority of apprenticeship programs on file with the department of labor and industry,subp,subp.the apprentice wage structure had to be based on the prevailing wage for sprinkler fitters in the county in which the contractor was headquartered,subp.contractors had to adopt the same graduated pay scale for apprentices as was found in the majority of apprenticeship programs on file with the department of labor and industry,subp,subp.apprenticeship programs had to provide for at least hours of related or classroom instruction per year,subp.and contractors had to register apprentices in accordance with the ratios established by the department of labor and industry 
in,plaintiffs,the minnesota chapter of associated builders and contractors abc and certain affiliated contractors,brought suit in the district court seeking to enjoin portions of the minnesota statute and rules governing the apprenticeship programs.the parties stipulated to a temporary injunction barring enforcement of the statute and rules while the court determined the issues raised in the complaint.in early,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment and in march,the district court issued an order finding that the statute and rules were preempted by erisa and permanently enjoined the state department of public safety from enforcing those provisions of the statute and rules.that order and permanent injunction were not appealed and remain in effect.the statute and rules have not been repealed or changed since the injunction was issued.
on february,sprinkler fitters local,a labor organization representing journeyman and registered apprentice sprinkler fitters in the state of minnesota,moved to intervene in the case and to have the injunction dissolved due to an intervening change in the law.the union claimed that the supreme court decision in california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham construction,d,made the injunction inappropriate,in light of new criteria established by the court for determining whether erisa preempted state law.abc opposed the motion.the district court granted the union motion to intervene,but denied the motion to dissolve the injunction.the union filed the instant appeal.
the district court in its order denying the motion to dissolve the injunction noted that the supreme court in dillingham recognized a distinction between laws which created incentives for the adoption of an approved apprenticeship plans or created indirect economic incentives,and those laws such as the minnesota statute and rules,which required the adoption of an approved apprenticeship plans.the district court also found that the supreme court had not specifically overruled its earlier erisa precedents,including those on which boise cascade peterson,cir,cert.denied,d were based.the district court thus found that minnesota statute and rules related to an erisa plan under the connection with prong and were therefore preempted by erisa.
the issue of whether the injunction issued by the district court has any continued legal basis is purely a question of law which we review de novo.
ii.discussion 
erisa preemption 
erisa,codified at is a comprehensive statute that sets certain uniform standards and requirements for employee benefit plans.wilson zoellner,cir,quoting,arkansas blue cross blue shield mary,cir,cert.denied,d.it was enacted in response to growing concerns about the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.carpenters local union fidelity guar,cir,quoting,massachusetts morash,d.
to meet the goals of a comprehensive and pervasive federal interest and the interests of uniformity with respect to interstate plans,congress included an express preemption clause in erisa for the displacement of state action in the field of private employee benefit programs.wilson,at internal citations and quotations omitted.in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d,the court stated 
w e have found that in passing a,congress intended to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among states or between states and the federal government,and to prevent the potential for conflict in substantive law requiring the tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction.

erisa preemption clause states

b.the dillingham decision.
local notes that the issue of whether erisa preempts a particular state law has caused a great deal of confusion over the last twenty years.local argues that because the supreme court in dillingham significantly changed the way in which preemption questions are analyzed,there is no longer any basis for the injunction and it should be dissolved.
in carpenters local union,the court explained 
as the language of section a makes plain,the incidence of erisa preemption turns on the parameters of the phrase relate to.see california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d.that locution is not,and the justices have been at least mildly schizophrenic in mapping its contours.the court initially glossed the phrase by portraying the scope of erisa preemption as deliberately expansive.pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.as time passed,it grew more guarded,emphasizing the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law,new york state conf.of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d accord,de buono medical clinical services fund,d,and warning that,unless congressional intent to preempt clearly appears,erisa will not be deemed to supplant state law in areas traditionally regulated by the states,see dillingham,at,d travelers,at,d.
importantly,these variations in emphasis have led the court to conclude in recent years that the phrase relate to,as used in erisa preemption provision,can not be read literally to scale the phrase down to size,the court has devised a disjunctive test a law relate s to a covered employee benefit plan for purposes of a if it has a connection with or a reference to such a plan.dillingham,at,d citations and internal quotations omitted alternations in original 
travelers plainly signaled a significant analytic shift in regard to the connection with portion of the erisa preemption inquiry,abandoning strict textualism in favor of a more nuanced approach 
for the same reasons that infinite relations can not be the measure of,neither can infinite connections.we simply must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term,and look instead to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive.
carpenters local union,at,quoting,travelers,at,d accord,dillingham,at,d.
local states that in light of this shift in the law,courts must now take a more practical view and look at the scope of the state statutes that congress intended would survive erisa and not presume that the statutes were preempted unless there was a clear indication.erisa is concerned with the segregation and investment of funds and ensuring that funds are not depleted and that fiduciaries utilize the funds in the manner in which they were intended.local states that erisa is concerned that funds set aside for apprenticeship and training programs are properly handled and accounted for,but is not concerned with the substantive requirements for these apprenticeship and training programs.the union argues that erisa places no substantive regulations on any apprentice program and states that if congress had intended that states would no longer be able to place any substantive requirement on apprentices it certainly would have stated so.as such local states there is no mention in the statute or its legislative history of an intention to supersede all state regulation of apprentices.the union asserts that state regulation of apprenticeship standards is pervasive and was pervasive when erisa was passed.in light of this,the union states that there is no mention by congress of its attempt to preempt state regulation of substantive apprenticeship standards.local argues that this is persuasive evidence that congress did not intend to preempt state laws regulating apprenticeship standards.
in dillingham,the supreme court considered whether california prevailing wage law was related to an employee benefit plan and thus preempted under erisa.the court found that it was not.in that case,california required contractors on public works projects to pay workers the prevailing wage in the project location.contractors could pay lower wages to apprentices who were participating in an approved apprenticeship program.however,if a contractor employed apprentices who were participating in apprenticeship programs which were not approved,they were required to be paid the prevailing journeyman wage.in considering whether the california statute had a connection with erisa plans,the court first noted that apprenticeship standards and wages paid on state public works have long been regulated by the states.id.at.at.the court stated 
that the states traditionally regulated these areas would not alone immunize their efforts erisa certainly contemplated the of substantial areas of traditional state regulation.the wages to be paid on public works projects and the substantive standards to be applied to apprenticeship training programs are,however,quite remote from the areas with which erisa is expressly,disclosure,fiduciary responsibility,and the like given the paucity of indication in erisa and its legislative history of any intent on the part of congress to state apprenticeship training standards,or state prevailing wage laws that incorporate them,we are reluctant to alter our ordinary assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by the federal act accordingly,as in travelers,we address the substance of the california statute with the presumption that erisa did not intend to supplant it.
id.at.at internal quotations and citations omitted.
however,in analyzing the statute,the supreme court found 
the apprenticeship portion of the prevailing wage statute does not bind erisa plans to anything.no apprenticeship program is required by california law to meet california standards if a contractor chooses to hire apprentices for a public works project,it need not hire them from an approved program although if it does not,it must pay these apprentices journeyman wages.so apprenticeship programs that have not gained cac approval may still supply public works contractors with apprentices.unapproved apprenticeship programs also may supply apprentices to private contractors.the effect of the california statute on erisa apprenticeship programs,therefore,is merely to provide some measure of economic incentive to comport with the state requirements,at least to the extent that those programs seek to provide apprentices who can work on public works projects at a lower wage.
the court found that the california statute 
has the effect of encouraging apprenticeship erisa meet the standards set out by california,but it has not been demonstrated here that the added inducement created by the wage break available on state public works projects is tantamount to a compulsion upon apprenticeship programs the prevailing wage statute alters the incentives,but does not dictate the choices,facing erisa plans.in this regard,it is no different from myriad state laws in areas traditionally subject to local regulation,which congress could not possibly have intended to eliminate.travelers,at.at we thus conclude that california prevailing wage laws and apprenticeship standards do not have a connection with,and therefore do not relate to,erisa plans.
local argues that the injunction issued by the district court should be dissolved because of the change signaled by the supreme court in dillingham.the union also argues that previous caselaw relied on by the district court when it issued the injunction,boise cascade peterson,cir,cert.denied,d is no longer valid however,there are important distinctions between the california prevailing wage law and the minnesota statute and rules,which do not mandate dissolution of the injunction.
the minnesota rule relating to contractor operating requirements states a fire protection contractor may not employ a person to perform fire work unless the person is a managing employee,certified journeyman,or registered apprentice,subp.the minnesota statute defines apprentice sprinkler fitter as a person,other than a fire protection contractor or journeyman sprinkler fitter,who is regularly engaged in learning the trade under the direct supervision of a licensed fire protection contractor or journeyman sprinkler fitter and is registered with a state or federal approval agency,subd.as previously noted,a state approval agency is defined as the department of labor and industry or a state agency in minnesota or another state if the commission determines that the state agency approves training programs and monitors apprentice training progress in a manner comparable to that done by the department of labor and industry or by the united states department of labor,bureau of apprenticeship and training.a federal approval agency is defined as the bureau of apprenticeship and training,subps.
the minnesota rules relating to apprenticeship programs and agreements states t he minimum training standards to be met in an apprenticeship agreement must be the standards for the apprenticeship program registered with the division but must be no less than the minnesota minimum standards listed in part.the minnesota minimum standards state it must be the policy of the employer that all apprentices employed in a trade covered under parts to must be governed by the terms of these standards and by the minnesota voluntary apprenticeship law subp.the rules governing apprenticeship programs set out in very specific detail the length of an apprenticeship program,responsibilities of the apprentice,how an apprentice should be supervised,schedule of work processes,wage schedules,the amount of hours of related instruction required and the hours of work required.see,subp.
thus,it is quite clear that the minnesota statutes and rules,unlike the california law,require apprentice programs to comply with the minnesota specifications.the minnesota statute and rules do more than merely encourage or provide economic incentives to contractors to hire apprentices who are registered in approved programs,the minnesota statutes and rules absolutely demand it.the statute unequivocally states that a fire protection contractor may not employ a person to perform fire work unless the person is a managing employee,certified journeyman,or registered apprentice,subp.thus,the minnesota statute,unlike the california statute,dictate s the choices facing erisa plans.dillingham,at.at.
local argues that the statute does not require contractors to use apprentices and even if a contractor were to use apprentices,the statute does not prevent a contractor from using apprentices who are not part of an approved program,so long as they do not install,connect,alter,repair,or add to a fire protection system.local argues that apprentices can learn by observation and by handing tools to a journeyman and by practicing at a training center.the union states that the statute simply gives a substantial economic advantage to contractors to have their apprenticeship programs approved and to register their apprentices in approved programs.
however,the court does not find this argument persuasive.the purpose of an apprenticeship program is to teach individuals through training.to say that an apprentice can still learn by simply observing and handing tools to a journeyman would turn an apprentice into simply a laborer and provide no useful instruction in how to actually install a fire protection system.the statute does more than simply provide a powerful economic incentive,it prevents the use of apprentices who are not registered in approved programs.it is for this reason that the court finds that the minnesota statute differs from the california statute in dillingham and why the court finds that the supreme court decision does not necessitate dissolution of the injunction.
appellant also argues that a recent decision by the tenth circuit in willmar service cooke,cir,cert.denied,d,indicates that the minnesota statute is not preempted by erisa.in willmar,the court considered whether a colorado statute which required supervision of apprentices in a ratio by licensed journeymen was preempted by erisa.the court found that the statute was not preempted stating 
t here is no direct restraint in the colorado law on the number of apprentices that may be trained.rather,the limit to which willmar refers is the economic burden of requiring supervision of apprentices.the supreme court has recognized that laws of general applicability inevitably affect erisa plans,sometimes by increasing costs,but that fact alone does not warrant a finding that congress necessarily intended to displace regulation of an area traditionally regulated by the states.
id.at.the court in willmar found that the effect of the supervision ratio requirement was to indirectly increase the cost of the apprenticeship training and thus was directly analogous to the apprentice wage law in dillingham.the court stated i n dillingham,if the contractor chose to hire an apprentice from a program,it was compelled by state law to pay journeyman wages.in our view this is comparable to the manner in which the colorado law affects the willmar training does not prevent training,but it increases the cost associated with doing so.id.at.this is the key distinction between the california and colorado statutes and minnesota statute.minnesota statute acts to actually prevent training.a fire protection contractor working in minnesota simply can not hire an apprentice from an unapproved program to install,connect,alter,repair,or add to a fire protection system.there is no provision whereby a contractor can pay a higher wage if it wishes to do so,or hire more journeymen to supervise an apprentice.the statute simply does not allow apprentices who are not registered or who are not registered in approved programs to work as apprentice sprinkler fitters.
thus,because the dillingham and willmar decisions are distinguishable,the court does not find that these decisions dictate dissolution of the injunction issued by the district court in.however,because the dillingham decision was handed down after the injunction was issued,the court will consider whether the minnesota statute and rules have a connection with an employee benefit plan under the criteria set out in dillingham and other eighth circuit cases.
c.the connection with test.
in applying,the supreme court has utilized a test to determine whether a state law is preempted.a law relates to an employee benefit plan,in the normal sense of the phrase,if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.shaw delta air lines,d.see also,dillingham,at.at de buono,at.at.
in the district court,abc did not challenge the union argument that the statute was not preempted under the refers to prong of the dillingham test,therefore the district court did not analyze this issue.thus,our consideration will similarly be limited to analyzing whether the minnesota statute and rules are preempted under the connection with prong of the test.
in dillingham,the court stated to determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection,we look both to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive,as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans.id.at.at internal quotations and citations omitted.
in analyzing the effect of a state law on an erisa plan,courts have considered a variety of factors 
whether the state law negates an erisa plan provision,whether the state law affects relations between primary erisa entities,whether the state law impacts the structure of erisa plans,whether the state law impacts the administration of erisa plans,whether the state law has an economic impact on erisa plans,whether preemption of the state law is consistent with other erisa provisions,and whether the state law is an exercise of traditional state power.arkansas blue cross blue shield mary hospital,cir citations omitted.in conducting this analysis,t he court must still look to the totality of the state statute impact on the erisa how many of the factors favor preemption and how heavily each individual factor favors preemption are relevant.id.at.
prudential ins.of america doe,d,quoting,wilson,at.
do the minnesota statute and rules negate a plan provision 
abc argues that the minnesota statute and rules negate erisa plan provisions by substituting the state requirements for the range of terms found in erisa apprenticeship plans.the union argues that nothing about the minnesota statute negates any provision as to how an apprenticeship program will be funded,and therefore does not negate any erisa plan provision.the court finds that because the statute and rules dictate the terms of what constitutes an approved apprenticeship program,it negates plan provisions.
do the minnesota statute and rules affect relations between primary erisa entities or impact the structure of erisa plans 
the primary erisa entities include the employer,the plan,the plan fiduciaries,and the beneficiaries.wilson,at internal quotations and citation omitted.abc argues that the statute and rules affect relations between the employer,the plan administra
