until,sgsm operated a chain of over forty grocery stores,employing over employees,primarily in the new orleans,louisiana area.sgsm is a partnership comprised of sgsm,schwegmann,and schwegmann trust.sgsm,owned a seventy percent interest in the partnership and was its managing partner.schwegmann was the majority stockholder of sgsm,and its chief executive officer.as such,schwegmann was responsible for the daily operations of sgsm and was the primary policy maker for the partnership.
schwegmann conceived a plan for sgsm to give its retirees groceries and other goods free of charge.schwegmann then worked with sam levy,president of sgsm,and joe warnke,sgsm director of human resources,to create a voucher program for sgsm employees at their retirement.in,sgsm implemented this grocery voucher plan the voucher plan designed to supply sgsm retirees with a portion of their monthly food needs.under this plan,sgsm issued vouchers to retirees,and these vouchers could then be used in lieu of cash to purchase goods in sgsm stores.it is this voucher plan which is the subject of this lawsuit 
in,joe warnke prepared a memorandum memorializing the eligibility requirements for participation in the voucher plan to qualify for the vouchers,an employee must have completed twenty years of service with sgsm,have reached the age of sixty,and have been employed in a supervisory position for at least one year at the time of retirement.sgsm informed qualifying employees of the program at the time of their retirement.each month,sgsm sent qualifying employees a set of four vouchers worth a total of.these vouchers were valid for a period of thirty days,redeemable only at sgsm stores and could not be transferred.although sgsm intended the vouchers to be used only for purchases with no cash redemption,store personnel,including managers,were largely unaware of this proscription,and retirees were often given change in cash when using the vouchers for grocery purchases.
sgsm had no written procedures for administering the voucher plan.the voucher plan was nonetheless run in a systematic manner.when a manager or supervisor retired,the sgsm human resources department prepared a form with information used to determine whether the employee qualified for the voucher plan.the form was then sent to sam levy who reviewed the form and decided whether a retiree qualified for the program.levy would sign the forms of qualified retirees and forward the forms to the sgsm controller,gene lemoine,who issued the vouchers.lemoine performed this task two to three days before the month in which they were to be used.once used,the vouchers were routed back to lemoine who retained them for five years.
sgsm did not set up a trust to fund the voucher plan.rather,the voucher plan was funded out of the partnership general revenue.each year,sgsm deducted the total face value of the vouchers as a business expense on its tax returns under the category of retirement plans,sgsm also issued an internal revenue service form to every retiree receiving vouchers,reflecting the face value of the vouchers received by the retiree that year.
by the early,sgsm experienced declining profits due to competition from national supermarket chains.in,schwegmann decided to aggressively expand sgsm to compete with these stores.sgsm acquired the national tea company chain and,in doing so,undertook a sizable debt.after this acquisition,sgsm continued to suffer from financial losses,and in,it sold the business.a week before the sale,schwegmann sent a letter to all voucher recipients informing them that they would no longer receive vouchers because of the sale of the business.because schwegmann considered the voucher plan a gratuity subject to termination at will,he made no provision for the continuation of the voucher plan after the sale.
when schwegmann sent the letter to the retirees,sgsm was insured under a excess general liability policy with a retention sir of million per claim and a premium of.the policy included excess employee benefits liability coverage.this policy was not due to expire until july however,because of the impending sale,the policy was cancelled.in its place,a similar policy was issued to cover sgsm remaining liability while it was winding up its business.this policy had a lower premium of and a lower sir of for each claim.both policies were claims made policies rather than occurrence policies.
after being informed of the termination of the voucher plan,plaintiffs filed this suit on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated individuals under erisa and louisiana state law claiming that they were vested in a pension benefit plan.plaintiffs are former employees of sgsm who were adversely affected by the termination of the grocery voucher plan when sgsm sold its business in february.the matter was certified as a class action,defining the plaintiff class as 
those individuals who were sgsm employees and who were retired and receiving grocery vouchers when sgsm stopped the program,or who,although not retired or receiving grocery vouchers at the time sgsm stopped the grocery program,were i supervisors for at least one year before retirement,and ii had at least years experience with sgsm.
after a bench trial,the court dismissed the plaintiffs state law claims.after taking the remaining claims under advisement,the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law,ruling that the grocery voucher plan was a pension benefit plan under erisa,that sgsm breached its fiduciary duty under erisa,that schwegmann was liable as a fiduciary to the plan,that the plaintiffs were entitled to monetary relief for benefits denied after sgsm sale,that policy covered sgsm liability,and that the policy sir applies once to the plaintiffs claims collectively.however,the court requested additional briefing on the issue of class membership.based on the stipulations of the parties and the evidence presented at the hearing,the district court determined that all but seven individuals filing a notice of claim qualified for class membership.thereafter,the district court issued a final judgment consistent with its findings.
the defendants lodged a timely appeal,urging various grounds for reversal.we address each of the defendants arguments in turn.
while not disputing the underlying facts,first argues that the district court committed legal error in concluding that the voucher plan constituted a pension benefit plan under erisa.the schwegmann defendants have adopted argument by reference.specifically,the defendants contend that erisa does not apply to any program providing a benefit.this court reviews legal challenges de novo.brittan communications intern.southwestern bell telephone,cir.
erisa does not regulate all benefits paid by an employer,but only those paid pursuant to an employee benefit plan.fort halifax packing coyne,d.two different types of benefit programs are regulated by erisa welfare plans and pension plans.the district court determined that the voucher plan was a pension benefit plan and not a welfare benefit plan.the plaintiffs have not challenged this ruling.the defendants,however,challenge the district court determination that it is a pension benefit plan.
to determine whether erisa applies to the voucher plan,we begin our analysis with an examination of the language of the statute itself.erisa defines an employee pension benefit plan as 
any plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that by its express terms or as a result of surrounding circumstances such plan,fund,or program provides retirement income to employees a i.
the parties agree that sgsm established a program.thus,the primary issue this court must resolve is whether the vouchers issued pursuant to sgsm voucher plan provided the plaintiffs with retirement income.
neither erisa statutory provisions nor the federal regulations define the term income.however,they do not affirmatively require that the pension benefit be paid in cash.moreover,the department of labor dol refused to declare as a general policy whether benefits are regulated by erisa.see erisa advisory op.march,erisa lexis.we have likewise found no controlling case law directly addressing the issue.
relying on the definition of income used for the purposes of determining taxable income under the internal revenue code irc,et,the district court found that the grocery vouchers constituted retirement income.we believe that the district court analysis is sound given the close connection between erisa and the irc.
congress dedicated title ii of erisa entitled amendments to the internal revenue code relating to retirement plan,title ii,to addressing taxation of retirement plans,stat,et.title ii amends provisions of the irc and sets forth guidelines and standards governing the establishment and operation of pension plans qualified for favorable tax treatment,stat,et.cafee,halter griswold,et commissioner of internal revenue,wl.title i sets out guidelines and standards governing the establishment and operation of pension plans.title i,which defines employee benefit plan,was drafted in concert with title ii,stat,et.seq cafee,halter griswold,et commissioner of internal revenue,wl.much of title i of erisa was duplicated in title ii,indicating that overlapping terms should be consistently defined in both.esden bank of boston,cir see a and same definition of accrued benefit a and same definition of normal retirement age a and same definition of normal retirement benefit.
we acknowledge that courts generally do not look to other statutes to determine the meaning of a term where an act has left that term undefined.see lukhard reed,d relying on the general meaning of income for the purposes of determining whether personal injury awards were included as income under the aid to families with dependant children program.in such instances,courts rely on common usage to give the term meaning.however,in this instance,we believe that the interconnection between erisa and the irc reflects an intent to use common terminology.
this court has interpreted the term income broadly under the irc to include anything that can be valued in terms of currency.united states parr,cir citing commissioner john smith.the district court was entitled to infer that when sgsm deducted the vouchers face value as a business expense on its tax returns under the category of retirement plans and issued internal revenue service form to the recipients of the vouchers,sgsm considered the vouchers as income under the irc.the cash value of the grocery vouchers is readily ascertainable from the face of the vouchers.the district court correctly concluded that the vouchers constitute income and the voucher plan is governed by erisa.
even if we were to adopt the plain or ordinary meaning of income,our conclusion would be the same.as noted by the supreme court in lukhard reed,the term income is commonly understood to mean a gain or recurrent benefit usually measured in money.lukhard reed,d citing webster third international dictionary.because the vouchers provided a gain or benefit to sgsm employees and could readily be measured in money,they would constitute income as the term is generally understood.
we are not persuaded that any of the authorities cited by the defendants would dictate a contrary result.the defendants contend that the voucher plan is not an employee pension plan because it constitutes a sale to an employee which is excluded from the scope of erisa under dol regulations.the regulation to which the defendants refer provides 
e sales to employees.for purposes of title i of the act and this chapter,the terms employee welfare benefit plan and welfare plan shall not include the sale by an employer to employees of an employer,whether or not at prevailing market prices,of articles or commodities of the kind which the employer offers for sale in the regular course of business.e.
as the defendants point out,the regulation does not impose any limitation on the price at which the merchandise is sold,whether at prevailing market price or at a deeply discounted price.however,we agree with the district court that sgsm transfer of vouchers to its employees bear none of the hallmarks of a sale sgsm received no money or anything else of value in exchange for the vouchers or for the groceries.the parties never intended for the retiree to pay for the vouchers.the transactions are much closer to gifts by sgsm.this comports with the gratuitous intent expressed by schwegmann in his testimony.as noted by the district court the voucher plan did not just offer goods for sale to its provided them with a means to pay for them.musmeci schwegmann giant super markets,d.the district court equated this to conferring cash spending power,distinguishable from a program that simply allowed retirees to use their own funds to purchase groceries from sgsm stores.id.we agree with the district court that these transactions were not sales by an employer to an employee.thus,we find defendant argument on this point unpersuasive.
the defendants next argue that the case law dictates that no benefit can ever be covered by erisa.the cases relied on by the defendants are district court cases,several of which are unpublished,involving airline programs allowing their employees and retirees to fly free or at reduced rates see constantine american airlines pension benefit plan,d preuc continental micronesia,wl dist.guam,prince american airlines,wl,eaton delta airlines,dist.lexis.may.significantly,these cases involve travel benefits in what would otherwise be an empty seat.
treating the issue in a summary fashion,each court concluded with little or no analysis that travel benefits were not erisa pension benefit plans because they did not provide income to the retiree.had the courts looked to the irc to determine whether the travel benefits were income,they would have answered this question in the negative because these benefits provided a.see a.
finally,the defendants relying on preuc continental micronesia,supra,argue that programs are not the sort of plans with which erisa is concerned.the district court in preuc concluded that unfunded,programs permitting employees a free standby seat on the employer airplane paid out of the general assets of the employer are generally not erisa benefit plans.
the preuc court relied in part on the general purpose behind erisa as expressed by the united states supreme court in california division of labor standards enforcement dillingham construction,d.the dillingham court noted that the primary purpose of erisa was to prevent the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.id.at.citing massachusetts morash,d.the dillingham court concluded that it is only when money is included in a special fund to finance the benefit that erisa coverage is triggered.id.at.however,the facts and legal issues presented in dillingham bear no resemblance to this case.
dillingham is a preemption case.the court examined whether a california wage statute california statute was preempted by erisa.the california statute allowed contractors to pay a lower apprentice wage,rather than a higher journeyman wage,only if the apprentice was trained in an approved apprenticeship program as defined by the california statute.under erisa,certain apprenticeship programs as defined by erisa are considered welfare benefit plans.the qualifying apprenticeship programs,however,are defined differently by the federal and state statutes.the court declined to hold that the california statute was preempted by erisa because california had different standards than erisa for apprenticeship programs.specifically,the court held that an apprenticeship program maintained by a single employer under the california statute and paid through the employer general assets was not an erisa plan.rather,the benefits of these programs are part of the employee wages.the court observed that the risk involved in failing to fund an apprentice wage program is indistinguishable from the danger of defeated expectations of wages for services performed,a hazard with which erisa in unconcerned.id.at.citing massachusetts morash,d.
we are satisfied the preuc court read dillingham much too broadly.the supreme court was concerned with distinguishing programs where employers fund erisa plans from programs where employers provide funds to pay wages.the court did not purport to impose a general limitation on the application of erisa to plans in which the employer had accumulated funds.
our interpretation of dillingham is consistent with massachusetts morash which,likewise,addressed an issue related to the payment of wages.like dillingham,massachusetts morash is a preemption case.the case involved a massachusetts statute requiring employers to pay discharged employees their wages in full on the day of their discharge.massachusetts morash,d.the massachusetts statute defined wages to include holiday or vacation pay.id.under erisa,certain programs providing vacation benefits are welfare benefit plans.however,the court declined to hold that the massachusetts statute requiring the employer to pay for unused vacation time constituted an erisa welfare benefit plan.massachusetts morash,d.
the court found that,when a single employer paid an employee vacation pay out of the company general assets,this practice was similar to other payroll practices outside of the scope of erisa.id.at.citing b providing that overtime,shift premiums,holiday premiums and weekend premiums paid as compensation for work performed are not welfare benefit plans under erisa.e xcept for the fact that the payment has been deferred,such payments are as much a part of the employees regular basic compensation as overtime pay or the payment of salary while the employee is absent on vacation.id.at.states have traditionally regulated the payment of wages,including vacation pay.id.at.the court reasoned that the fact that payments for unused vacation were due at termination did not affect their character as regular compensation.id.at.
because the sgsm voucher plan,designed to benefit retired employees,is unrelated to the payment of wages,dillingham and massachusetts morash are inapplicable.accordingly,the defendants arguments that a plan to pay benefits from current earnings can not constitute an erisa plan is not supported by the holdings or reasoning of these cases.
next argues that even if the voucher plan is governed by erisa,the plaintiffs are not entitled to relief.the schwegmann defendants have again adopted argument by reference.
specifically,the defendants contend that,because section a b allows only the recovery of plan benefits,plaintiffs may recover only grocery vouchers which are now worthless under erisa and not their cash equivalent.a b.
section a b reads 
a persons empowered to bring a civil action.a civil action may be brought 
by a participant or beneficiary 
b to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.
while we have found no case law considering the measure of damages where a plaintiff has been denied an benefit under a pension plan,section a b also applies to welfare benefit plans.welfare benefit plans offering healthcare benefits typically provide for medical treatment,an benefit.participants are clearly entitled to the value of health care benefits when the participant personally pays for treatment which has been wrongfully denied.see roark humana,cir dowden blue cross blue shield,cir per curiam.to hold otherwise would put a participant in a medical benefit plan in the untenable position of either foregoing potentially medical treatment until the right to the treatment is conclusively litigated or personally paying for the treatment without the right to recover its cost.
citing case law rejecting recovery of tort and punitive damages under erisa,the defendants argue that the district court award of monetary damages is a prohibited extracontractual remedy.see corcoran united healthcare,cir rejecting a claim for emotional distress under erisa.these cases are not helpful to defendants because they do not address whether plan have been be measured in terms of a monetary award.we see no good reason why the district court was prohibited from making a monetary award.the classic measure of contract damages is the value of the thing of which the plaintiff has been deprived by the breach.liberty bank talman home mortg,cir.we are satisfied that the same measure of damages,the value of the benefit denied,is the appropriate measure of damages in this case accordingly,monetary relief in the amount of the benefit denied is the appropriate remedy.
while acknowledging that the issue has never been addressed by the fifth circuit,contends that section limits the source of recovery to the amounts of the plan so that the pension plan itself is the only party properly named as a defendant.the schwegmann defendants have also adopted this argument.
the defendants rely primarily on the language of section d,which reads as follows 
any money judgment under this subchapter against an employee benefit plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in his individual capacity under this subchapter.d.
while the language suggests that the plan is the only proper party defendant,other circuits have allowed employees to maintain actions against their employers for the denial of benefits under facts similar to those in this case.see mein carus corporation,cir garren john hancock life insurance,cir layes mead corporation,cir sweet consolidated aluminum corporation,cir.these cases hold that the plan beneficiaries can sue the employer when it was the employer decision to deny benefits.sweet consolidated aluminum corporation,cir and when the employer is the plan administrator or sponsor.garren john hancock life insurance,cir layes mead corporation,cir 
in this case,plaintiffs named both the sgsm pension plan and sgsm as defendants in this lawsuit.sgsm is both the plan administrator and plan sponsor.the sgsm pension plan has no meaningful existence separate from sgsm because the voucher plan is funded by the general assets of the partnership.moreover,it was indisputably sgsm decision to deny further vouchers or their cash equivalent to the plaintiffs.under these facts,the district court correctly held that sgsm was properly named as a defendant.
next,the schwegmann defendants argue that the district court erred in casting john schwegmann,in judgment as a fiduciary to the voucher plan.relying on rockney blohorn,cir,the schwegmann defendants contend that schwegmann has no personal liability because the district court rejected plaintiffs attempt to pierce the corporate veil.however,rockney blohorn is inapposite.
rockney addressed the liability of a corporate officer who was sued under the theory that he was the employer and plan administrator for the purposes of erisa.here,the district court predicated schwegmann liability on a finding that schwegmann was a plan fiduciary,not that he was plaintiffs employer or the plan administrator.this is an independent basis for liability unrelated to whether he was also the plaintiffs employer under a veil piercing theory.
under erisa,a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent 
i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,ii he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation,direct or indirect,with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan,or has any authority or responsibility to do so,or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.such term includes any person designated under section c b uscs c b.
in concluding that schwegmann was a plan fiduciary,the district court relied on kayes pacific lumber company,cir.in kayes,the ninth circuit acknowledged that erisa adopted a functional approach to determining whether an individual was liable as a fiduciary.the court held two corporate officers personally liable as plan fiduciaries because of the role they played in the management of the plan assets,despite the fact that the erisa plan designated the corporate employer as the plan fiduciary the kayes court noted that to hold otherwise would allow a corporation to shield its officers from liability under erisa and relieve them of their fiduciary duty.id.at.in bannistor ullman,cir,we confirmed that this circuit uses the same functional approach as the ninth circuit in kayes,stating 
the term fiduciary is liberally construed in keeping with the remedial purpose of erisa.am.fed.of unions local health welfare fund equitable life assurance soc y of the united states,cir.the phrase to the extent indicates that a person is a fiduciary only with respect to those aspects of the plan over which he exercises authority or control.sommers drug stores.employee profit sharing trust corrigan,cir,cert.denied,d,d.however,fiduciary should be defined not only by reference to particular titles,but also by considering the authority which a particular person has or exercises over an employee benefit plan.donovan mercer,cir.
thus,the district court correctly held that schwegmann could be liable as a fiduciary even if he is not the plaintiffs employer under a veil piercing theory.
rather than contesting whether schwegmann exercised the requisite control or authority over the plan sufficient to establish a fiduciary duty,the schwegmann defendants next argue that the decision to liquidate sgsm and end the voucher plan was not a fiduciary action.the schwegmann defendants are correct that the decision to terminate a plan under erisa does not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.see izzarelli rexene prods,cir.the court,however,did not impose liability against schwegmann because he terminated the plan.instead,the district court predicated schwegmann fiduciary liability on acts that took place before sgsm terminated the voucher plan.
the district court found that schwegmann and the other schwegmann defendants failed to fulfill many of their fiduciary duties under erisa including their disclosure and reporting obligations,erisa minimum funding requirements,and the requirement that the plans assets be held in trust.the schwegmann defendants do not challenge the correctness of this list of statutory breaches.as noted by the district court,it was not the decision to terminate the plan which denied the plaintiffs their benefits but the longstanding failure to provide an independent source of funding which caused the plaintiffs to lose their benefits when sgsm business folded.if the plan had been properly funded,the plaintiffs would not have been deprived of benefits upon the plan termination.
because fiduciary liability was predicated on statutory violations,such as failing to fund the plan,which took place prior to sgsm decision to end the voucher plan,the district court did not err in finding that the schwegmann and the other schwegmann defendants breached their fiduciary duty under erisa.thus,the district court correctly awarded judgment against the schwegmann defendants and in favor of the plaintiffs in their capacity as representatives of the plan under section of erisa.
the schwegmann defendants summarily argue that none of the plaintiffs are vested.while defendants contested in the district court whether certain individual plaintiffs met the requirements for participation in the voucher plan,the schwegmann defendants failed to raise any general argument that no plaintiffs had vested.likewise,plaintiffs contend that argues for the first time on appeal that the only party which can bring this suit is the pension benefits guaranty corporation.has failed to direct us to any record citation in which it raised the issue below.as a general rule,a party may not allude to an issue in the district court,abandon it at the crucial time when the district court might have been called to rule upon it,and then resurrect the issue on appeal.louque allstate ins,cir.accordingly,we decline to consider these issues on appeal.
finally,argues that,assuming the voucher plan is covered by erisa,the retention sir of in its excess liability policy applies to each individual plaintiff claim.thus,contends that it is not responsible for any part of the judgment because each claim falls below the sir.
the sir provision contains only one line reading each claim.neither the sir nor any other section of the policy defines the term claim.the district court ruled that the failure to define this term rendered the policy ambiguous as a matter of law.construing the policy against,the district court concluded that the term claim refers to a demand for coverage by the insured,sgsm,rather than the claims made against sgsm.
however,the absence of an express definition does not automatically render a policy term ambiguous.norfolk shipbuilding drydock corporation seabulk transmarine partnership,cir.under the basic tenets of contract interpretation,each of the policy provision must be read in light of the others.here,the meaning of claim for the purposes of the sir provision can be gleaned by reference to the use of the word in numerous other provisions of the policy.
the policy includes three coverage forms excess general liability coverage,excess employee benefits coverage and excess liquor coverage.plaintiffs assert their claims under the excess employee benefits coverage form.the policy has a number of definitions and other provisions that apply to all coverages and provisions that apply only to excess employee benefits coverage.the provisions of the policy that apply both to all coverages and those that apply to the specific coverage at issue here consistently refer to claims made against the insured or claims by the employee.the term claim in the sir provision,when read in light of these other provisions of the policy,is clear and unambiguous and provides that a claim is the assertion of a legal right against the insured by a third party.
one of the foremost authorities on insurance law states that g enerally speaking,a claim in a liability policy is considered to be an assertion by a to the effect that the insured has caused the claimant damages through some acts or omissions and that the claimant intends to hold the insured responsible for all or a portion of the damages so caused.eric mills holmes,holmes appleman on insurance.our conclusion that the term claim in the sir provision means the assertion of a right by a third person against the insured is,thus,consistent with the generally understood meaning of this term.
our conclusion is likewise consistent with that of other courts.for example,in national state bank,elizabeth american home assurance,the district court held that the undefined term claim referred to claims by third parties against the insured.in national state bank,several lawsuits were filed against the insured,each of which sought recovery for the insured negligent failure to report misstatements contained in financial records the insured was charged with auditing.the lawsuits were consolidated and later settled.under the terms of the settlement,the insured assigned the plaintiffs its rights under a liability policy issued by american home i
