thomas abbott abbott,larry arthur ormsby ormsby,antonio mendoza mendoza,and edsol stanley stanley appeal from the district court judgment dismissing their claims.the plaintiffs filed a putative class action alleging that defendants state of michigan,the michigan department of treasury,and the michigan department of corrections together with governor jennifer granholm,treasurer jay rising and department of corrections director patricia caruso,converted their pension benefits in violation of the due process clause,erisa,and state law.the district court concluded that the doctrine and res judicata required dismissal of the plaintiffs claims.for those same reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
abbott,mendoza,ormsby,and stanley are inmates at michigan correctional facilities.pursuant to the state correctional facility reimbursement act scfra.comp.laws,the state sought reimbursement for the costs of incarceration from each plaintiff assets,including pension benefits.scfra sets forth the following procedures by which the state may seek reimbursement for the costs of incarceration 
the attorney general may file a complaint in the circuit court for the county from which a prisoner was sentenced,stating that the person is or has been a prisoner in a state correctional facility,that there is good cause to believe that the prisoner has assets,and praying that the assets be used to reimburse the state for the expenses incurred or to be incurred,or both,by the state for the cost of care of the person as a prisoner.
upon the filing of the complaint under subsection,the court shall issue an order to show cause why the prayer of the complainant should not be granted.the complaint and order shall be served upon the prisoner personally or,if the prisoner is confined in a state correctional facility,by registered mail addressed to the prisoner in care of the chief administrator of the state correctional facility where the prisoner is housed,at least days before the date of hearing on the complaint and order.
at the time of the hearing on the complaint and order,if it appears that the prisoner has any assets which ought to be subjected to the claim of the state under this act,the court shall issue an order requiring any person,corporation,or other legal entity possessed or having custody of those assets to appropriate and apply the assets or a portion thereof toward reimbursing the state as provided for under this act.
on march,the clinton county circuit court entered an order against abbott stating,in part 
defendant thomas abbott shall immediately direct general motors corporation,it sic subsidiary or designee,to cause any pension payments due defendant thomas abbott to be made payable to thomas abbott,at prison address,or thomas abbott then current prison address.if defendant should refuse to so direct,this order shall be treated as the direction of the defendant to general motors that the pension payments shall be made as directed above.payments shall be made in this manner until defendant thomas abbott is released from the physical custody of the department of corrections,or until further order of this court.
joint appendix at.the order required the warden in the continuing capacity as receiver to deposit pension checks into abbott prison account,with of the funds disbursed to the state of michigan and the remainder to abbott family.at.
abbott appealed the circuit court order,arguing that the scfra order was an assignment of his pension payments in violation of provisions of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.the michigan court of appeals concluded that the scfra order violated the provisions of erisa,state treasurer abbott,but the michigan supreme court granted leave to appeal and held that the scfra order did not violate erisa,state treasurer abbott,abbott filed a petition for certiorari in the united states supreme court,which was denied.abbott rising,d.
the oakland county circuit court entered similar orders against mendoza on december,granting of any pension payments to the state,and against stanley on june,granting to the state.the ogemaw county circuit court entered an order against ormsby on august,granting of his assets and the funds then in his prison account to the state but making no specific mention of pension payments.
on july,abbott,ormsby,mendoza,and stanley filed a complaint in federal district court alleging that the scfra orders violated the due process clause,erisa,and state law and seeking to establish a class action on behalf of all other prisoners,past and present,who have had any pension benefits diverted in violation of erisa.at compl.at.on october,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment arguing,inter alia,that the district court did not have jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims because of the doctrine and that the claims were barred by res judicata.the district court granted the motion on those two grounds on january,the plaintiffs timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a rule b motion can either attack the claim of jurisdiction on its face,in which case all allegations of the plaintiff must be considered as true,or it can attack the factual basis for jurisdiction,in which case the trial court must weigh the evidence and the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction exists.dlx,kentucky,cir,cert.denied,d.because the district court made essentially no factual findings in deciding that it lacked jurisdiction,the defendants motion on this issue is properly treated as an attack on the claim of jurisdiction on its face.id.accordingly,we review the district court decision de novo.id.
the supreme court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments.lance dennis,d.thus,t he prevents the lower federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases brought by losers challenging judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced.id.at quoting exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.the doctrine applies only when a plaintiff complains of injury from the state court judgment itself.coles granville,cir.if the source of the injury is the state court decision,then the doctrine would prevent the district court from asserting jurisdiction.if there is some other source of injury,such as a third party actions,then the plaintiff asserts an independent claim.mccormick braverman,cir.additionally,the doctrine does not prohibit federal district courts from exercising jurisdiction where the plaintiff claim is merely a general challenge to the constitutionality of the state law applied in the state action,rather than a challenge to the law application in a particular state case.hood keller,cir.
the plaintiffs have complained of specific injuries that they have suffered,but have also requested,among other relief,that the district court permanently enjoin the defendants from enforcing of sic the scfra as it applies to pension benefits.at compl.at.broadly construed,the plaintiffs complaint could be read as bringing a general challenge that scfra violates erisa and the supremacy clause.the doctrine does not deprive the federal courts of this general challenge to scfra.hood,at.
regarding whether plaintiffs claims of specific injuries that they have suffered implicate the doctrine,we have found the second circuit guidance particularly instructive 
suppose a state court,based purely on state law,terminates a father parental rights and orders the state to take custody of his son.if the father sues in federal court for the return of his son on grounds that the state judgment violates his federal substantive rights as a parent,he is complaining of an injury caused by the state judgment and seeking its reversal.this he may not do,regardless of whether he raised any constitutional claims in state court,because only the supreme court may hear appeals from judgments.
suppose a plaintiff sues his employer in state court for violating both state law and title vii and loses.if the plaintiff then brings the same suit in federal court,he will be seeking a decision from the federal court that denies the state court conclusion that the employer
