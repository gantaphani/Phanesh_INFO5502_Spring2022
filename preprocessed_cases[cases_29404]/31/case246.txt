background 
the material facts are not in dispute.the pension plan at issue is a joint trust fund that administers a,pension plan for longshoremen such as mcdonald.this fund trustees are the administrators of the plan.
the ptf has modified the plan several times since its creation in.initially,the plan provided only a single flat,monthly sum called a service retirement pension srp to retired participants.eligibility for the srp originally was limited to those employees years or older who had been employed in the industry for a continuous period of at least years and who were actively employed in the industry at the time of their retirement.the plan gave pension credit for any year in which an individual worked a minimum of hours a year of credited service,but to satisfy the plan minimum service requirement,an individual needed an average annual employment of at least hours.
following the enactment of erisa,the ptf modified the plan to provide an additional vested rights pension vrp for employees who failed to satisfy the srp more rigid eligibility requirements.the vrp contains the following formula for benefits 
a for years of credited service in the industry prior to january,a plan participant shall receive of the maximum monthly benefit in effect at the time he ceased employment in the industry,multiplied by years of credited service earned prior to january,and 
b for years of credited service after january,he shall receive of the maximum monthly benefit in effect at the time he ceased employment in the industry,multiplied by the number of years of credited service earned on or after january,plus of a above multiplied by the number of years of credited service after january.
c i n no event shall a participant receive more than of the maximum monthly benefit in effect at the time he ceased employment in the industry.
plan.in november,the ptf again amended the plan,retroactive to january,to provide that all vested participants would accrue benefits in accordance with the vrp benefit formula and that those participants eligible for both the srp and the vrp would receive the greater of the two benefits.
mcdonald started working under the plan in and earned years of credited service,under the plan definition,between and.for the following three consecutive years,however,he failed to earn any years of credited service.under the plan provisions then in effect,as a consequence of this break in service,mcdonald first years of credited service no longer counted toward the benefits that he would receive on retirement.between and,mcdonald earned years of credited service.when mcdonald turned,the ptf awarded him a monthly pension of approximately based on these years of credited service.in calculating mcdonald pension,the ptf used the vrp formula but did not count any years of service prior to.
in mcdonald sued,contending that the ptf calculations violated erisa.he asserted a variety of claims seeking individual as well as class relief.in one claim for individual relief,he argued that erisa requirement that,with certain exceptions,all years of service shall be taken into account for benefit accrual purposes nullified the plan provision and entitled him to additional years of service towards the calculation of his pension.the ptf argued,in contrast,that since allowed provisions to survive for purposes of vesting,these provisions would also survive for purposes of benefit accrual,and,consequently,permit the ptf to disregard mcdonald years of credited service prior to his break in service.
in response to cross motions for summary judgment,the district court naomi reice buchwald,judge agreed with mcdonald on this claim.in a thorough opinion the court concluded that,for purposes of determining an employee participation in a plan,erisa b,with certain enumerated exceptions,required that all years of service under the plan must be taken into account.based on this reading of the statute,the court found that erisa invalidated the plan provisions that limited accrued benefits arising from employment,and the court held that mcdonald was entitled to credit for years of service.specifically,the court concluded that erisa b f,b f,which permits plans to exclude,for vesting purposes,years of service that would have been disregarded under a plan break in service rules,is not applicable in determining the accrued benefit payable to an employee who has satisfied the vesting requirements.mcdonald i,d at.the court emphasized that the text of erisa was dispositive.although the court reviewed secondary sources,it concluded that referencing legislative history and administrative commentary was unnecessary because congress has addressed the precise question at issue here and answered it in mcdonald favor.id.at.in addition,the court determined that the plan pre and accrual provisions complied with erisa.finally,the court concluded that a photocopying bill at cents per page from the plan was reasonable,that plaintiff counsel claim to the contrary border ed on the frivolous,and that his pursuit of a claim of that size was vexatious and unprofessional.id.at.
following this decision,the ptf agreed to credit mcdonald for years of service under a plan provision that authorized the award of two additional years of service to plan participants who had earned years of credited service.although mcdonald was therefore eligible for pension benefits of per month,the ptf refused to award him interest for any period before the district court march,decision.
in october,the district court issued its second decision.mcdonald pension plan of the pension trust fund,civ,wl,dist.lexis,mcdonald ii.it denied mcdonald request for relief but held that mcdonald was entitled to an immediate lump sum payment of past due pension benefits with interest from january,and that the ptf must retroactively amend its plan to january.finally,the district court awarded mcdonald pursuant to erisa c because of the ptf failure to furnish various documents but declined to find the ptf calculation of photocopying expenses unreasonable.
the ptf appealed the district court award of increased pension benefits and mcdonald,challenging the district court refusal to grant relief,determination that the plan does not violate erisa minimal accrual standards,calculation of penalties,and dismissal of his claim that he was overcharged for document reproduction.

discussion 
accrued and vested benefits under erisa 
we first consider whether erisa nullified the plan provisions regarding benefits accrued during employment.under erisa,breaks in service impact the related concepts of accrued and vested benefits.accrued benefits refer to those normal retirement benefits that an employee has earned at any given time during the course of employment.a see generally esden bank of boston,cir.vested benefits,on the other hand,refer to those normal retirement benefits to which an employee has a nonforfeitable claim in other words,those accrued benefits he is entitled to keep.the court below explained the relationship between the concepts as follows 
an employee becomes fully vested when he has a nonforfeitable right to his entire accrued benefit.an employee accrues benefits both before and after he becomes vested in a portion of his accrued benefit.
mcdonald i,d at.
erisa b d provides for the accrual of benefits based upon an employee years of participation in a plan.moreover,b starts the clock for participation at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and notes that such participation is included in the period of service required to be taken into account under b.in turn,with regard to the computation of years relevant for accrual purposes,b provides 
except as otherwise provided in paragraphs,and,all years of service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan shall be taken into account in computing the period of service for purposes of subsection a.
b emphasis added.
this combination of the earliest date and all years of service on its face does not allow for any break in a participating employee service to negate previously accrued benefits by contrast,erisa b treats breaks in service differently for vesting purposes.section b explicitly allows pension plans to apply provisions to the calculation of vested benefits arising from service 
in computing the period of service under the plan for purposes of determining the nonforfeitable percentage under subsection a of this section,all of an employee years of service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan shall be taken into account,except that the following may be disregarded 
f years of service before this part first applies to the plan if such service would have been disregarded under the rules of the plan with regard to breaks in service,as in effect on the applicable date 
both before and after the application of erisa,the plan deemed that an employee employment had terminated and was no longer continuous when the employee had worked fewer than hours a year for more than two consecutive calendar years.as a result of such a break in service,the ptf would not count an employee years of service prior to the break toward either the vesting or accrual of benefits.
given that erisa first applied on january,mcdonald break in service during,and would,for vesting purposes,fall under the plan provisions erisa b,b f,would apply,and the ptf,in determining mcdonald vested benefits,could ignore his years of service.under erisa b,however,there is no congruent allowance for provisions that deal with the calculation of accrued benefits arising from service.
at the heart of this appeal lies the question of what to make of the absence of such explicit statutory language.mcdonald argues that congress specific inclusion of language in erisa b giving effect to provisions with regard to vested benefits,coupled with its failure to include a parallel section in b for accrued benefits,indicates that congress intended for accrued and vested benefits to be treated differently.the ptf argues that this asymmetrical treatment of breaks in service is inconclusive and that reference to the treatment of vesting and accrual elsewhere in erisa is required.specifically,the ptf points to congress nearly identical treatment of accrued and vested benefits in erisa,which governs the transitional period between erisa passage on january,and its effective date of january.this similarity,the ptf argues,means that congress wanted accrued and vested benefits treated the same under other erisa provisions.the district court agreed with mcdonald,as do we.
implicitly conceding that the text of the statute authorizes the conclusion that,for accrual purposes,an employer may not exclude years of service based on a plan break in service rules,the ptf criticizes this reading as dangerous literalism based upon a lacuna in a complex and highly reticulated statute.brief.the ptf contends that this reading renders superfluous e,which contains transitional rules relating to both the vesting and accrual of benefits.the ptf also argues that this conclusion is inconsistent with that of other courts that have considered the question.
the ptf arguments relating to erisa e,e,do not convince us.the ptf points to two separate subsections of e a and e a that treat accrued and vested benefits the same.section e prohibits the modification of provisions as follows 
no pension plan to which section of this title applies may make effective any plan amendment with respect to breaks in service which amendment is made or becomes effective after january,and before the date on which section of this title first becomes effective with respect to such plan which provides that any employee participation in the plan would commence at any date later than the later of 
a the date on which his participation would commence under the break in service rules of section b of this title,or 
b the date on which his participation would commence under the plan as in effect on january.
erisa e,e.given that the language of e a,which by its specific reference to pertains to accrued benefits,is virtually identical to e a,which specifically pertains to vested benefits,the ptf contends that,with regard to provisions,congress meant to treat accrual and vesting the same way throughout erisa.if accrued benefits were not subject to provisions,the ptf argues,then there would be no need for congress to prohibit changes of these provisions during the transitional period.
we are not persuaded.while erisa b may have required mcdonald break in service to be disregarded for accrual purposes,the section did not require all such breaks in service to be disregarded.erisa b a,b a.in any event,e did not prohibit amendments to the provisions of the sort that would nullify as of its effective date in.rather,e merely prohibited plans from amending their rules during the transitional period to make provisions less favorable to participants,unless the provisions were already more generous than would require.in other words,e was a narrow subsection that,for the purposes of accrued benefits,merely froze the provisions that were in effect on january,by allowing only those amendments during the transitional period that would bring the provisions into compliance with in advance of its effective date in.by instructing that a pension plan generally could not change its provisions for accrual purposes during this period,congress prevented pension plans from enacting amendments during this period that would make deep cuts in accrued benefits.at the same time,by not immediately nullifying the provisions for accrual purposes,congress afforded pension plans two years to effect a transition to the new standards of.
we conclude that erisa b is clear.congress has treated accrued benefits and vested benefits differently.the supreme court has found erisa to be an intricate,comprehensive statute.boggs boggs,d.erisa is a complicated enough statute without the courts soldering new sections onto it had congress intended to permit provisions to apply when calculating accrued benefits,it could have done so.see erisa b f,b f.consequently,we respectfully decline to join the seventh circuit refusal to treat vesting and accrual of benefits differently with respect to breaks in service.jones uop,cir.nor do we agree with that same conclusion implicit in the third circuit decision in haas cass boeing,no.ca,wl,dist.lexis,aff without,cir.see also redmond burlington northern.pension plan,cir.
finally,we share the ptf belief that the reference to the secondary sources letters from the department of justice and internal revenue service and regulations from the department of treasury and department of mcdonald invites is unnecessary.our conclusion that congress intended to treat accrued benefits and vested benefits differently with regard to breaks in service is grounded in text we find to be unambiguous.accordingly,we affirm the district court decision that the ptf could not use the plan provision to limit mcdonald accrued benefits.
calculating years of service 
section b a requires plans,for purposes of determining accrued benefits,to include all years that erisa b counts for participation purposes.and b requires that all years of service be taken into account.section a a defines a year of service as follows 
for purposes of this section,the term year of service means a period during which the employee has not less than hours of service.for purposes of this paragraph,computation of any period shall be made with reference to the date on which the employee employment commenced,except that,in accordance with regulations prescribed by the secretary of labor,such computation may be made by reference to the first day of a plan year in the case of an employee who does not complete hours of service during the period beginning on the date his employment commenced.
by contrast,the plan defines a year of credited service as follows 
for years prior to october,any year in which a participant had at least hours of employment in the industry provided that such participant had an average of hours employment per year during such years prior to october,and provided further no credit shall be given for any year s of employment occurring prior to a break in service which break in service occurred prior to january,and 
commencing october,any year in which a participant has at least hours of service.
although,as we have discussed above,the plan provision does not apply to accrued benefits,there remains the question of whether erisa requires the ptf to credit mcdonald with any years of service prior to,given that erisa only requires that benefits accrue for years in which an employee works at least hours.the ptf argues on appeal,although it did not do so before the district court,that the district court should have applied erisa stricter definition of year of service rather than the plan more lenient year of credited service analyzing whether mcdonald is entitled to additional benefits.specifically,the ptf contends that only three of mcdonald years of employment were years,and each directly preceded a greater number of hour years.under erisa b rule of parity,applicable to mcdonald years of service 
years of service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan before a break in service shall not be required to be taken into account in computing the period of service if the number of consecutive breaks in service equals or exceeds the aggregate number of such years of service before such break.such aggregate number of years of service before such break shall be deemed not to include any years of service not required to be taken into account under this paragraph by reason of any prior break in service.
see,stat.thus,the ptf argues,none of mcdonald years of employment counted as years of service under erisa rule of parity,and,consequently,mcdonald is not entitled to relief the question,then,is whether,when we have invalidated the plan provision for accrual purposes,we must enforce all of the remaining plan provisions or merely ensure that erisa minimum standards have been met.
although the ptf arguments on this issue were not made to the district court,an appellate court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.kamen kemper fin,d.in kamen,the supreme court found that while the appellant failed to advert to the governing state law until her reply brief at the level,the appellant did not waive her right to have the applicable law applied to her case.see also arcadia ohio power,d addressing a legal question that the parties had not argued baker dorfman,cir.similarly,the parties here are entitled to a resolution in this case that accommodates all relevant portions of erisa.
neither party disputes that a plan terms may define a year of service more generously than erisa a a does.we are concerned,however,with the effects of nullifying the plan provision with regard to benefit accrual and leaving the plan year of credited service definition to stand on its own,when under the terms of erisa itself the ptf was not required to recognize any of mcdonald service.the ptf argues that its provision was inextricably intertwined with its definition of a year of credited service.because longshoremen work is somewhat transient,the ptf contends that its objective under the plan was to reward those who worked steadily over the course of many years by permitting such workers to qualify for a year of credited service by working only hours.if the plan had not included a provision concerning benefit accrual,the ptf contends that it never would have adopted such a low threshold.
given this argument,the propriety of the enforcement of the year of credited service definition in the absence of the plan provision may involve the consideration of factual the relationship of these two plan provisions.because such issues can not be fully explored based upon the record before us,however,we conclude that this question is best addressed in the first instance by the district court.we therefore vacate the district court order for the ptf to retroactively amend the plan and award of additional benefits to mcdonald.we remand the issue of the applicability of the standard for its consideration,in light of erisa nullification of the provision with regard to accrued benefits.
plan participants 
when the district court granted relief under erisa a and ordered the trustees to reform the plan retroactively to,mcdonald requested that the court also order the recalculation of the pensions of a class of purportedly similarly situated participants.with regard to mcdonald successful claim that erisa invalidated provisions for the purposes of benefit accrual,however,the complaint expressly sought only individual relief.the district court denied mcdonald motion for class certification for the reason that while plaintiff might have brought such a claim,he did not.mcdonald ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
mcdonald,however,contends that relief is essentially automatic under erisa a,which provides that a civil action may be brought 
by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
a.mcdonald argues that because a pertains to a general category of wrongs,the redress also must be general and must remedy the injuries suffered by all participants affected by the wrongful act or practice,at emphasis in original.
mcdonald reads too much into a.it does not require district courts to grant particular relief rather,it affords district courts the discretion to fashion appropriate equitable that may or may not benefit beneficiaries.nothing in this section requires relief or expressly supersedes the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure.see,yoon fordham univ,faculty admin.ret.plan,cir.the district court recognized the tension generated by mcdonald late request,finding his attempt to transform what was clearly an individual claim into a class claim after a favorable decision on th
