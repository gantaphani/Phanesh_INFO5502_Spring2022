background 
appellant was an employee of the rhode island group health association,righa and was covered under a group disability insurance plan issued to righa by appellee itt hartford.while employed at righa,appellant began to suffer from degenerative cervical disc disease and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome,which caused her a great deal of pain and sometimes prevented her from sleeping.in,appellant successfully applied for disability benefits under righa insurance plan,and she received those benefits continuously until february of.
in january of,appellant claim was submitted for periodic review by a physician at appellee request.the reviewing physician determined that,although appellant disability was well documented between and,the data did not support a finding of ongoing total disability as of february of.based on that preliminary determination and on a suggestion by appellant own treating physician that an independent medical examination ime be scheduled,appellee arranged for an ime to be conducted through an independent group called first choice solutions.appellee contacted appellant by telephone on january,and informed her of the need to undergo an ime.
however,on january,appellee was informed by first choice solutions that appellant had declined to undergo the ime.appellee immediately sent a letter to the appellant explaining that her benefits would be terminated if she did not schedule an ime within thirty days.
a note in appellee files dated march,indicates that appellant had not yet scheduled an ime as of that date.a letter dated march,was then sent to appellant informing her that her benefits were being terminated retroactively as of february.the letter set forth appellant right to pursue an internal appeal,which she did by means of a may,letter in which she denied having refused to undergo an ime.
appellant did eventually submit to an ime on july,which was conducted by jerrold rosenberg.rosenberg concluded that there was little clinical evidence to support a physical disability from her job at this point physically i believe that the only limitations required for her to return to work would be on lifting more than pounds.rosenberg report was sent to appellant treating physician,calvo,with a request for comments,on september,no response was received.a second request was sent in december of.when calvo responded to that second request on january,he disagreed with rosenberg conclusions,contending primarily that they were not credible absent a physical examination.appellee requested elaboration,but none was forthcoming.
appellee declined to overturn its termination of appellant benefits,and appellant filed this action on november,alleging that the termination of her benefits violated erisa,a b.during the ensuing litigation,the parties agreed to resubmit appellant claim to a claims examiner for reconsideration of whether termination was appropriate.this reconsideration included a review by an orthopedic surgeon who concluded that appellant could have returned to work in february of with the restrictions that her job not require prolonged repetitive neck movements nor that she lift more than fifteen pounds.in a december,letter to appellant counsel,the claims examiner concluded that the evidence did not support a finding that appellant continued to be totally disabled under the plan.appellant again availed herself of appellee internal appeal process,but her appeal was denied by letter on january.
the parties then resumed litigation.a magistrate judge,upon consideration of the parties for summary judgment,recommended to the district court that summary judgment be granted in favor of itt hartford.the district court adopted that recommendation,and appellant now challenges the entry of summary judgment dismissing her erisa claim.
ii.law and application 
standard of review of an insurer benefits eligibility determination 
the first issue disputed by the parties is whether the lower court applied the correct standard in its review of itt hartford decision to terminate appellant disability benefits.appellant argues that the applicable standard is one of reasonableness,rather than the arbitrary and capricious standard applied by the lower court and advocated on appeal by the appellee.
as the magistrate recommendation correctly noted,the supreme court held in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,that an insurer termination decision will be reviewed under a deferential arbitrary and capricious standard where,as here,the language of the underlying plan reserves discretion to the insurer in determining eligibility for benefits.see also doe travelers ins,cir.however,the court in firestone also suggested that,where a plan fiduciary operates under a conflict of interest,the reviewing court should consider that conflict in its determination of whether the fiduciary abused the discretion vested in it by the plan.see firestone,at.doe,at.the courts of appeals have since differed somewhat in their interpretation of that suggestion.see doe,at collecting cases.
this circuit first addressed the level of review appropriate for an insurer benefit eligibility determination under these circumstances in doyle paul revere life insurance,cir.there we noted that an insurer does have a conflict of sorts when a finding of eligibility means that the insurer will have to pay benefits out of its own pocket,although we also noted that the market presents competing incentives to the insurer that substantially minimize the apparent conflict.see id.at.noting the divergence of approaches taken by the other courts of appeals,we announced that our own standard under such circumstances would adher e to the arbitrary and capricious principle,with special emphasis on reasonableness,but with the burden on the claimant to show that the insurer decision was improperly motivated.id.
in doe travelers insurance,cir,we reiterated much of what was stated in doyle.however,we expressed some skepticism about the helpfulness of a formulaic approach to this standard of review question,stating 
it seems to us that the requirement that travelers decision be reasonable is the basic touchstone in a case of this kind and that fine gradations in phrasing are as likely to complicate as to refine the standard.the essential requirement of reasonableness has substantial bite itself where,as here,we are concerned with a specific treatment decision based on medical criteria and not some broad issue of public policy.
id.at.it is doe emphasis on reasonableness that the appellant argues supports a less deferential review of the termination decision than the arbitrary and capricious standard applied by the lower court.
we conclude that the district court applied the proper standard in rejecting appellant erisa claim.the supreme court made clear in firestone that,where an insurance plan grants discretion to the insurer to determine eligibility for benefits,the insurer decisions will generally be reviewed only for an abuse of that discretion.see firestone,at.we have since referred to such abuse of discretion review in this context as applying an arbitrary and capricious standard,see doyle,at,which may have created some confusion despite the functional equivalence of the two standards.we did not intend such reference to alter the standard of review prescribed by the supreme court in firestone.nor did we intend such an alteration in doe when we focused on the reasonableness aspect of our review when potential conflicts of the sort involved here are present.see doe,at.rather,we intended merely to recognize that,in order
