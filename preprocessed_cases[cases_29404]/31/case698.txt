these two interlocutory appeals arise out of a single case,and we have therefore consolidated them for purposes of this appeal.northwestern ohio administrators,noa a corporation that administers employee benefit plans under the employment retirement income security act erisa and the labor management relations act lmra,sued walcher fox w f,an ohio corporation engaged in the construction business,claiming that w f owed fringe benefit and pension fund contributions for all of its employees pursuant to project agreements entered into by w f and the international association of bridge,structural,and ornamental ironworkers local union the union.noa moved for partial summary judgment and the district court denied the motion,holding that the project agreements were ambiguous because notations on some of those agreements indicated that the parties may have intended the agreements to cover only the few union members hired by w f at the behest of the union representative val helldobler.w f impleaded the union and helldobler,alleging that they had fraudulently misrepresented the scope of the project agreements and that they were therefore liable for contribution and indemnification for any monies owed by w f to noa.the union and helldobler moved to dismiss w f complaint.
the district court then trifurcated the case to determine the scope of the agreements,liability under the agreements,and liability of the union and helldobler.after a bench trial on the scope of coverage issue,the court concluded that noa was entitled to rely on the language of the agreements,and that the notations on those agreements were not sufficient to put noa on notice of the modification envisioned by the parties.accordingly,the court held,noa was entitled to collect contributions for all of the company employees who worked under the project agreements regardless of whether the parties intended to limit the benefits available under the project agreements to a handful of union employees.the court certified the issue for interlocutory appeal.
in their motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and,helldobler and the union claimed that the federal court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the action and that the claims were preempted.the district court denied the motion to dismiss and certified the issue for interlocutory review.
we accepted both interlocutory appeals,and we affirm both of the district court orders.
factual background 
this case arises out of an employment dispute between the union and w w f is a construction subcontractor primarily engaged in the erection of steel buildings it contracts with employees on a basis.for most of its existence,w f used exclusively labor.val helldobler,an organizer for the union,approached the owners of w f in september of,requesting that w f unionize its workforce.the owners declined,claiming that w f could not afford to pay union wages and benefits to all its employees.helldobler suggested that w f ease into unionization by hiring one or two union workers per job.it was helldobler hope that this incremental approach would demonstrate to w f the advantages of a union workforce.
w f and the union negotiated a compromise,and helldobler made notations on two of the printed project agreement forms.one of those agreements bears the notation arkam steel job only the other bears the handwritten note journeyman apprentice man weekly benefit pay.these markings appear near the signature line of the agreements and no reference to them appears anywhere in the body of the agreement.the three remaining agreements that are the subject of this action contain no such notations,but w f alleges that they were entered into on similar terms.helldobler denies that the parties agreed to limit union participation on any project,and states that the handwritten notations indicate a floor for union participation,rather than a ceiling.
each of the project employer participation agreements at issue in this case incorporates the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement cba entered into by the labor relations division of the associated general contractors of northwest ohio and the union.those employer participation agreements provide 
the company hereby recognizes the union as the representative of a majority of its employees designated,acknowledges receipt of a copy of the current bargaining agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions contained therein 
the company agrees to make the contributions and deductions to the said plans at the times and in the amounts specified in the bargaining agreement,for all its employees performing the work specified in the bargaining agreement.
the cba provides that each participating employer shall 
make payments of fringe contributions and deductions to each and every employee benefit plan for all employees of each such participating employer who are members of the collective bargaining unit represented by the union whether or not the employees are members of the union.
cba,art.xxvi b par.
w f presented testimony that the agreements were intended to cover the union workers only,and not all employees.between september and september,w f paid fringe benefit and pension contributions for the union employees,and administered its own benefit plan for the employees.helldobler picked up the weekly benefit checks for the union members.in september of,helldobler attempted to organize the workers at the job site but they universally declined to join.despite the apparent lack of interest on the part of w f employees,helldobler demanded that w f employ only union workers for two projects in the toledo,ohio,area.w f refused to accept helldobler ultimatum,and the dispute soon escalated to include union picketing of w shortly thereafter,helldobler notified noa that w f had failed to make the fringe benefit and pension contributions that helldobler claimed the cba provisions incorporated into the project agreements required for all of w f employees.
in october of,noa requested that w f allow a payroll audit for all employees working on the projects covered by the five agreements to determine whether w f was properly paying the fringe benefit contributions for its employees.w f refused,claiming that noa had the right to audit only the records of the handful of union employees performing work under the project agreements.this lawsuit ensued.
ii.standard of review 
because this is an interlocutory appeal,we have no authority to review the district court findings of fact,but must confine our review to pure questions of law.see foster wheeler energy metro.know solid waste,cir.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.barnes winchell,cir.
iii.noa right to collect contributions 
w f claims that the district court determination on the motion for partial summary judgment,in which the court found the handwritten notations on the agreements ambiguous,contradicts the court later conclusion that w f is required to remit to noa contributions for all of w f employees.noa counters that following the bench trial,the district court found that the agreements were not ambiguous that the written terms of those agreements required w f to make contributions for all of its employees and that established erisa law entitled noa to rely only on the printed terms of those agreements.
it is true that in denying noa motion for partial summary judgment,the district court found that because of ambiguity in the agreements,the court could not determine the intent of the parties.but following the bench trial on the sole issue of whether w f was obligated under the agreements to make contributions on behalf of all of its employees,the district court held as a matter of law that the intent of the parties is not relevant to this issue.citing central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund gerber truck,cir,the district court held that section of erisa permits plans to enforce the plain terms of the written agreement regardless of contractual defenses applicable to the original parties,so long as the written document does not place the plan on notice of any modifications.further,citing bakery and confectionary union and indus.int l health benefits and pension funds new bakery of ohio,cir,the court held that the actual intentions of the contracting parties,and hence the factual dispute between helldobler and w f,are immaterial to this issue.
as we have already pointed out,this matter is before us on an interlocutory appeal,and we are without authority to inquire into the correctness of the district court findings of fact with regard to the intentions of the parties and whether the notations on the agreements reflected those intentions.rather,we must decide whether the district court erred in holding that,as a matter of law,the intentions of the contracting parties are immaterial to the determination of w f obligation to make the contributions,and that the written notations made by w f and the union were not sufficient to place noa on notice that it could not rely solely on the typed language of the project agreements and the cba.
w f argues that beneficiary noa right to collect contributions flows from the cba and therefore can not be superior to the rights of the primary parties.for this proposition,it cites a district court opinion,central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund kroger,c,wl,dist.lexis.march.in that case,the district court denied the plaintiff motion for summary judgment because the plaintiff sought to rely on past practices and oral understandings of the contract not reduced to writing.although it makes clear that a pension fund rights to collect are bounded by the written cba,kroger does not address the situation before us here,in which the parties memorialized their modifications on the face of a contract,albeit ambiguously.in fact,kroger plainly spells out the erisa policy that pension funds are entitled to rely on the writings that establish the employer obligation to them,id.at,dist.lexis,at,concluding that an oral agreement between the employer and the union to disregard the text and course of performance can not prevent the written agreement from being enforced at the insistence of the pension funds because a ny less protection may well saddle the plans with unfunded obligations.id.at,dist.lexis,at citations omitted.
w f also cites the unreported craig severino,wl.lexis cir.june.w f reliance on severino is misplaced.in severino,the parties signed a duplicate of a collective bargaining agreement,but specified in writing on the contract that it was limited in scope to just one job.the court found that the parties had executed a new agreement,with the limitation included.in the case at bar,there is no question that the union and w f sought to amend the project agreements in some way.the question is whether they put noa on notice of the intended amendments by making what the district court described as cryptic notations on the agreement.in severino,the limitation was clearly spelled out at the top of the signature page of the contract.here,only two of the project agreements bear any handwritten markings at all,and they are inserted near the signature line rather than in the body of the contract,or adjacent to any related provision.moreover,as the district court correctly noted,the parties made no attempt to excise,or otherwise manifest their intent to nullify the portion of the contract that required that benefits be paid for both union and employees,or otherwise to call attention to the modification.
even if the notations on the project agreements perhaps should have caught the attention of an noa administrator,nothing in the agreements indicated that the notations were intended to supercede the unambiguous printed portions of the agreements.the district court correctly applied the precedent that erisa funds are accorded a special status and are entitled to enforce the writing,regardless of what defenses may be available under the common law of contracts.see new bakery of ohio,at the fund stands much like a holder in due course in commercial law who is entitled to enforce the writing without regard to understandings or defenses applicable to the original parties.citation omitted.the district court also relied on gerber truck,which presents a factual scenario similar to the one before us today.the gerber court articulated the policy of section of erisa,namely,that the administrator is not required to look into potential side agreements.this court has adopted the gerber position.see new bakery of ohio,at because,under section,multiemployer plans are entitled to rely on the literal terms of written commitments between the plan,the employer,and the union,the actual intent of and understandings between the contracting parties are immaterial.
whether a contract term is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to determine.tennessee consol.coal united mine workers of,cir.the district court concluded that the handwritten notations in the two agreements were ambiguous.we agree.the law of this circuit does not require fund administrators to read the minds of contracting parties rather,administrators may rely on the unambiguous terms of the writing.see new bakery of ohio,at.here,the cursory and notes on two of the five project agreements were the only pieces of information noa had that the parties might have intended any modification.without more,these notations do not indicate an intent to supercede the unambiguous typed provisions.
w f also claims that the entire contract is void because the district court ruled that the attempted amendments,if effective,would have produced an illegal contract.but the district court did not hold that those attempted modifications were in fact effective rather,the court opined that the handwritten notations,if interpreted as modifying the contract in the way in which w f claims,would make the contract illegal,and that noa had no reason to suppose that those handwritten notations were intended to modify the contract so as to render it illegal.the district court observation on this issue has nothing to do with whether noa was on notice that a side agreement had been reached.
accordingly,we affirm the district court decision that noa was entitled to rely solely on the printed terms of the project agreements.
iv.motion to dismiss complaint 
in its complaint,invoking both supplemental jurisdiction and jurisdiction under c,w f claims that the union and helldobler fraudulently induced w f to enter into the project agreements,fraudulently executed the project agreements,and negligently misrepresented the scope of those agreements w f demands a declaratory judgment that because of the defendants fraud,the project agreements are either void or voidable,and further seeks a judgment against them for indemnification,compensatory and punitive damages,and attorney fees.the union and helldobler claim that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the complaint against them pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and.specifically,they claim that the complaint is subject to dismissal under the rule of textron lycoming reciprocating engine div.avco,d the complaint is preempted by the rule of san diego.trades council garmon,d the complaint is preempted by section and therefore subject to dismissal and helldobler is immune from suit as an individual,pursuant to section b and the rule in atkinson sinclair refining,d.
we find these claims to be without merit and affirm the district court denial of the motion to dismiss.
supplemental jurisdiction 
helldobler and the union first claim that the federal court lacked jurisdiction over the complaint because of the limitations set out by the supreme court in textron.in that case,the court concluded that section a of the lmra confers federal jurisdiction only over s uits for violation of contracts,textron,at,and that s uits for violation of contracts under are not suits that claim a contract is invalid,but suits that claim a contract has been violated.id.at.because w f does not claim in its complaint that the union and helldobler violated the cba but instead claims that the actions render the project agreements void,the defendants argue,the federal court lacks jurisdiction over the complaint.the union and helldobler have missed the point.while w f has indeed asked for a determination that the project agreements are void or voidable,it has also asked for judgment against the union and helldobler for indemnification and damages in the event w f is found liable to noa for the additional that w f claims arose only because of the defendants fraud and misrepresentation.the complaint does not present a textron situation,and it is immaterial that the fraud and misrepresentation claims are not cognizable under section.those claims are clearly within the supplemental jurisdiction of the federal court as spelled out in a 
a except as provided in subsections b and c or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.
neither subsection b nor c is applicable here.therefore,unless the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction for some reason other than the textron rule,which is inapposite here,these claims are properly within the supplemental jurisdiction of the court,arising as they do out of exactly the same facts that gave rise to noa complaint against w 
the union and helldobler also claim that no case or controversy exists because the project agreements have expired.this claim is also meritless.w f has now been held liable to noa for contributions far in excess of what it allegedly believed it was bound by those agreements to make.what is at issue in this complaint is whether the union and helldobler are liable to w f for their alleged fraud in inducing w f to enter into those agreements,their alleged fraud in the execution of those agreements,and their alleged misrepresentations as to the number of employees covered by those agreements.the fact that the agreements themselves have now expired is immaterial.
garmon preemption 
the defendants next claim that the complaint is preempted by federal law under the rule in san diego.trades garmon,d.the party arguing garmon preemption bears the burden of showing that the conduct at issue is prohibited or protected by the national labor relations act,nlra.int l longshoremen ass davis,d.
in garmon,the supreme court synthesized its prior nlra preemption cases when an activity is arguably subject to or of the act,the states as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the national labor relations board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.garmon,at.the supreme court was motivated by the expressed congressional desire for uniformity in the nation labor policy.id.at.to allow the board to create uniform labor regulations for the nation workers and employers,and to make use of the board expertise in the area of labor relations,the court sought to exclude the states from the initial process of construing the reach and application of the nlra.
this same underlying motivation for uniformity,and the principles of federalism,also allowed for exceptions to the general garmon preemption rule.thus,where the regulated conduct at issue touched interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that,in the absence of compelling congressional direction,we could not infer that congress had deprived the states of the power to act,the court would not find nlra preemption.id.at.likewise,where the regulated activity is merely peripheral to the central concerns of the nlra,the states may regulate the activity.id.at.
the extent of the nlra preemption was elucidated further in sears,roebuck and san diego county dist.council of carpenters,d.in that case sears brought a trespass action in state court to enjoin the union from picketing on its property.id.at.the supreme court ruled that the nlra did not preempt the employer state trespass action.id.at.the court refused to apply garmon preemption mechanistically and instead opted for a flexible balancing of the federal need for uniformity,the state interest in regulating the conduct at issue,and the potential for the state regulation to threaten unduly the federal regulatory scheme.id.at.the court explained that when the conduct is arguably prohibited,two factors weigh in determining whether state regulation is preempted whether there exists a significant state interest in protecting its citizens from the conduct and whether state jurisdiction over the arguable labor violation would entail little risk of interfering with the uniform national labor policy.id.at.the second of these factors is equivalent to the question of whether the state cause of action is identical to a claim that could have been made to the board.id.if the claim and a potential claim to the board are identical,then the board has exclusive jurisdiction because the state regulation impinges directly on the board prerogative to fashion a uniform labor policy.id.in sears,the court ruled that the state trespass law regulated the location of the picketing,while a claim to the board would have looked at the motive behind the picketing to discern whether the picketing was an unfair labor practice.id.at.because the two claims were not identical,and because the state has a strong interest in protecting the integrity of its citizens property,the state could permissibly regulate the union picketing on the employer property.id.at.
later decisions have further expanded the rationale of garmon and have also displayed the extent of the exceptions to garmon.in belknap,hale,d,the court rejected a claim of garmon preemption based on misrepresentation and breach of contract claims brought by replacement workers against their former employer.there,the employer had promised the replacement workers that they would retain their jobs even after the settlement of the labor dispute with the union.id.at.however,as a result of unfair labor practice charges belknap agreed to lay off its permanent replacement workers and rehire the strikers.id.at.the supreme court held that the replacement workers state suit against belknap for fraud in relation to belknap promise to the replacements was not preempted because the state claim for fraud was not identical to the unfair labor practice claim brought by the striking workers.id.at.since the board was not concerned with belknap representations to the replacement workers,and the replacement workers suit had no impact on the strikers unfair labor claims,the state regulation would not interfere with national labor policy as elucidated by the board.id.finally,the court found that the state interest in protecting its citizens from misrepresentations was a substantial interest.id.
before we address the garmon factors,we must first address the threshold question of whether the union conduct at issue here is arguably prohibited by section the state law counterclaim brought by w f is for fraud in the inducement.the claim is based on the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations made by the union representative to induce w f to sign agreements providing for the employment of a discrete number of union employees on particular jobs at particular job sites.
the ninth circuit faced a very similar situation in which the employer filed a complaint against a union for fraudulent inducement.operating eng rs pension trust wilson,cir.the ninth circuit ruled that the union actions were not arguably prohibited as an unfair labor practice.id.at.as a result,garmon did not even apply and there was thus no need to reach the question of whether a garmon exception applied.id.likewise here,the union has offered no evidence demonstrating that its activities are unfair labor practices.the agreement in question is not a collective bargaining agreement because the union was not the duly elected representative of a majority of the employees,and was not authorized to bargain on the employees behalf on the terms and conditions o
