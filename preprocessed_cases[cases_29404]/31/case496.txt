alfred wade appeals a summary judgment in favor of the,administrator of his employer disability plan,on his claim for benefits under the plan.we affirm.
alfred wade began his employment with compaq computer corporation compaq in as a line operator at the time he left his employment,he was employed as an internal consultant in sales and services at one of compaq retail stores.on august,wade consulted a psychiatrist,mary ann ty,who diagnosed wade with major depression and attention disorder.ty based her diagnosis on wade symptoms including feelings of being out of control and overwhelmed,hypersomnia,decrease in energy,difficulty with concentration and attention,disorganization,and inability to complete tasks.however,she found that wade ability to make decisions regarding daily living,relationships,and life was rated as good.she advised him not to go to work.
upon this diagnosis,wade,on august,filed a claim for disability benefits.the plan defined disability as 
a medical condition or having such a condition,as the case may be determined by the plan administrator to be one which is continuous and prevents the employee from performing each of the material duties of his or her regular occupation.the employee must also be under the regular care of physician appropriate to the medical condition and can not be working at any job for wage or profit in order to be disabled or considered to have a disability,except when such a job is for his employer or within the terms of rehabilitative employment pursuant to section.
compaq,his employer,was the plan administrator and retained final authority over benefits decisions however,it outsourced preliminary disability benefits review to valueoptions,a disability care management service company.upon receiving wade claim,valueoptions opened a disability case file for him on or around august.
the plan benefits review process consisted of three levels.valueoptions conducted the first two levels,while compaq conducted the third and final level.at the first level,valueoptions solicited a neurophysiologist,barbara uzzell,to conduct a psychiatric and functional assessment of wade on september,based upon this assessment,she diagnosed him with dysthymic disorder and avoidant personality disorder.her assessment of ten categories revealed wade moderate impairment in three of the categories,whereas there was mild to no impairment in the other seven.she recommended that wade continue treatment with ty and referred him to suzi phelps,a psychologist and therapist.however,because uzzell found that wade condition did not constitute a disability,she recommended denying benefits.a valueoptions psychiatrist,frank webster,reviewed wade file,agreed with uzzell that wade was not disabled,and upheld uzzell recommendation.on september,valueoptions contacted wade via telephone and communicated its decision to deny benefits it did not share uzzell report with him or send him a denial letter.in this conversation,wade immediately advised valueoptions of his desire to appeal and to submit information from his treating physician.
at the second level of the claims process,the valueoptions appeals committee on which webster was a member reviewed wade claim and the initial denial of benefits.they invited wade treating physicians to submit a letter and a copy of treatment notes for consideration on october,ty and phelps submitted information to the committee.nevertheless,the valueoptions appeals committee,on october,affirmed the denial of disability benefits.as it explained in a letter to wade,the clinical information provided does not meet valueoptions disability criteria.additionally,the letter explained to wade that he had the right to appeal to compaq and provided an address and phone number.the letter did not,however,reference the plan criteria,explain why his information failed to meet the criteria,advise him of the appeal,or detail the information wade should submit to perfect his appeal.
wade attorney wrote to compaq on december,requesting various plan documentation and requesting an appeal.compaq responded,inviting wade attorney to provide any additional information for compaq to assess in its review of wade claim.at this third and final level,the compaq welfare benefits administrative committee wbac,comprised only of elaine boddome a compaq employee,reviewed wade claim in may kathy collier,a compaq benefits representative responsible for preparing wade file to present to wbac,noticed several errors in valueoptions processing of wade claim.therefore,she requested that valueoptions wade case and provide wbac with additional information.additionally,wbac enlisted another psychiatrist,conway mcdanald,to conduct an additional review of all of the documentation in wade file.subsequently,on august,wbac issued a final denial of disability benefits via a letter to wade.this letter explained that disability benefits were being denied,because the documentation did not substantiate a claim for disability.
wade sued in the united states district court for the southern district of texas under a b upon assessing the parties for summary judgment,the district court denied wade motion,granted defendant motion.the court also summarily and sua sponte awarded costs in favor of the defendant.
wade timely appealed,wherein he argues that the district court erred by applying the abuse of discretion standard of review to wade case,despite an asserted conflict of interest disregarding the impact of significant procedural errors,which allegedly should have reduced the district court level of deference to the plan administrator refusing to conclude that the plan administrator abused its discretion and awarding costs to the defendant.

wade argues on appeal that the district court erred when it applied the abuse of discretion standard of review,asserting that it should have given less deference to the plan administrator,given the conflict of interest,that compaq was both the insurer and administrator of the plan.whether the district court applied the correct standard of review is a question of law that we review de novo.maclachlan exxonmobil,cir citing chevron chem.oil,chem.atomic workers local union,cir.
a plan administrator completes two tasks in making a benefit determination determining the facts underlying the benefit claim and construing the terms of the plan.the administrator factual determinations are reviewed for abuse of discretion.chacko sabre,cir.by contrast,the administrator construction of plan terms is typically reviewed de novo.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.but where,as here a plan expressly confers discretion on the plan administrator to construe the plan terms,the administrator construction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.chacko,at citing firestone,at.gosselink,cir vega life ins,cir en banc.
where an administrator decision is tainted by a conflict of interest,courts implement a sliding scale standard of review.maclachlan,at.the standard of review does not change,it remains abuse of discretion the existence of a conflict of interest is simply a factor to be considered in determining whether the administrator abused its discretion.vega,at.less deference is given to the administrator,in proportion to the evidence of conflict.id.where a minimal basis for a conflict is established,the decision is reviewed with only a modicum less deference than we otherwise would.lain unum life.ins.of,cir quoting vega,at.
wade concedes that the administrator has the discretion and final authority to determine eligibility for benefits,therefore triggering the abuse of discretion standard.nonetheless he asserts that because compaq both administers and insures the plan that an apparent conflict of interest exists thus,he contends that the district court failed to apply the proper sliding scale standard.even if a conflict of interest exists under these facts,the district court detailed the appropriate standard of review for such cases and nevertheless granted summary judgment for compaq,ruling that the administrator had not abused its discretion in denying wade claim.we find no error in the standard of review it employed.
next,wade encourages us to heighten our standard of review due to the procedural irregularities in the handling of his claim,which he alleges violated erisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder,effectively denying him a full and fair review.wade has cited no direct authority by the supreme court or the fifth circuit dictating a change in the standard of review based upon procedural irregularities alone,and we see no reason to impose one.
next,wade argues that procedural violations in the processing of his claim justify the award of disability benefits.wade points to the alleged following problems in the processing of his claim valueoptions initial denial of his claim at the first level claims processing was communicated orally via telephone instead of in writing valueoptions second denial of his claim at the second level of claims processing failed to explicate the appropriate information as to the steps to be taken to submit a claim for review,the time limits for review,the specific reasons for the denial of the claim,reference to the specific plan provisions upon which the denial was based,and what information was needed to perfect the claim the plan relied upon valueoptions criteria for disability,as opposed to the plan criteria the plan failed to communicate its final decision to his attorney the plan created confusion during the pendency of the appeal the plan failed to notify wade of its denial of his claims in a timely fashion and wade never received the letter that denied his benefits.
erisa was enacted to promote the interests of employee and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans and to protect contractually defined benefits.firestone tire,d citations omitted.therefore,erisa provides certain minimal procedural requirements upon an administrator denial of a benefits claim.schadler anthem life ins,cir.these procedures are set forth in and the regulations promulgated by the department of labor thereunder.section provides that 
every employee benefit plan shall 
provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant,and 
afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.
the federal regulations,promulgated pursuant to erisa and in force at the time explained 
the notification shall set forth,in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant 
i the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination 
ii reference to the specific plan provisions on which the determination is based 
iii a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary 
iv a description of the plan review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedure 
g i iv.challenges to erisa procedures are evaluated under the substantial compliance standard.lacy fulbright jaworski,cir.this means that the technical noncompliance with erisa procedures will be excused so long as the purpose of section has been fulfilled.robinson aetna life,cir.the purpose of section is to afford the beneficiary an explanation of the denial of benefits that is adequate to ensure meaningful review of that denial.schneider sentry long term disability,cir.the substantial compliance test also considers all communications between an administrator and plan participant to determine whether the information provided was sufficient under the circumstances.moore lafayette life ins,cir.all communications may include oral communications.white aetna life ins,citing heller fortis benefits ins.
we conclude that the plan fulfilled the requirements of section and accompanying regulations in its processing of wade claim.wade is certainly correct that the first two levels of review in the plan claims processing arguably failed to substantially comply with erisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder.at the first level,valueoptions communication of the denial of benefits to wade via telephone did not comply with erisa,as valueoptions did not provide the notice in writing.at the second level,the letter denying benefits sent to wade did not comply with erisa,as it did not list the plan criteria,or indicate the specific reasons why wade clinical information failed to satisfy the criteria.further,it also did not specify what information wade was required to submit in order to perfect his appeal.
however,at the third level of review,compaq,as administrator,required valueoptions to the file and solicited another independent physician,mcdanald,to review it,as well.the administrator,when making its final determination to deny wade benefits claims,had all of the documentation regarding wade claim.additionally,the letter that wbac sent to wade substantially complied with erisa.
section and its corresponding regulations require that the plan provide adequate notice in writing setting forth the specific reasons for such denial written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant and afford a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review by the administrator.we find that the plan did meet these requirements.the statute and regulations do not require compliance with section at each and every level of review of a plan internal claims processing.the end goal of judicial intervention in erisa is not to correct problems at every level of plan administration,but to encourage resolution of the dispute at the administrator level before judicial review.see robinson aetna life ins,cir noting the fifth circuit has a policy of encouraging the parties to make a serious effort to resolve their dispute at the administrator level before filing suit in district court.here,although the plan claims processing at the first two levels of review did not comply with section,the final level of review,and the most relevant one,substantially complied and intended to correct the disputed procedural and technical errors below.therefore,we find that wade was provided with full and fair review of his claims based on an examination of all communications at all levels between the administrator and the beneficiary.the communications,as a whole,and especially at the administrator level,constituted a meaningful dialogue between the beneficiary and administrator despite technical violations.see gilbertson allied signal,cir noting that the purpose of erisa procedural provisions is to create a meaningful dialogue and as long as a meaningful dialogue existed,there is substantial compliance.
even were we to decide otherwise,f ailure to fulfill procedural requirements generally does not give rise to a substantive damage remedy.hines massachusetts mutual life ins,cir.there is no reason to deviate from this general rule in this case.
we now turn our attention to wade assertion that the district court erred in ruling that the administrator did not abuse his discretion in denying wade claim for benefits.because the district court granted summary judgment in the defendant favor,we review de novo,using the same standard as the district court.wade does not challenge the administrator interpretation of any plan term instead he only asserts that his condition qualifies as a disability.accordingly,the case hinges upon the administrator factual determinations,and we therefore review this decision for an abuse of discretion.pierre connecticut gener
