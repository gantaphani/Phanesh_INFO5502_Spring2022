opinion of the court 
this case arises out of a decision by connecticut general life insurance company cigna,as the administrator of the lucent technologies.long term disability plan for management or lba employees the plan to deny alcatel lucent usa,lucent employee robert funk claim for disability benefits under the plan.funk challenged that decision in the united states district court for the district of new jersey pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa.the district court granted summary judgment for funk on both his claim for disability benefits and on cigna counterclaim under erisa to recover overpaid benefits.
cigna and the other appellants appeal from that decision and order for the following reasons,we will vacate the district court order and remand with respect to cigna denial of benefits,and we will reverse the district court order with respect to cigna counterclaim for overpaid benefits.
background 
a.the parties and the erisa plan at issue 
funk worked as a member of lucent technical staff at all times relevant to this appeal,he was a participant in lucent plan,which was governed by erisa and by lucent through a trust.cigna administered the plan.as plan administrator,cigna had full discretionary authority and power to determine eligibility for plan benefits and to interpret and construe the terms and provisions of the plan.app.at.
pursuant to the plan,a participant could be eligible to receive disability ltd benefits after he had received disability benefits for weeks.the plan provided ltd benefits in two phases.phase one began immediately after the week disability period and ran for one year.to receive ltd benefits for that period,the putatively disabled participant had to show that he was 
prevented by reason of such disability,other than accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment of the company,from engaging in his occupation or employment at the company,for which the eligible employee is qualified,based on training,education or experience.
app.at.however,for a plan participant to receive ltd benefits beyond the period,to move on to phase two,cigna,in its sole opinion as the plan administrator,had to be persuaded that the participant was 
incapable of performing the requirements of any job for any employer for which the individual is qualified or may reasonably become qualified by training,education or experience,other than a job that pays less than percent of the eligible employee eligible pay that would have been in effect on the day preceding the day that the eligible employee short term disability benefits ceased.
the plan also provided that ltd benefits could be reduced by certain offsets,including social security disability benefits.pursuant to the plan,a ny retroactive award of social security benefits which covers any portion of the period for which plan benefits have been paid shall be considered as an offset of such plan benefits and be payable to cigna by the recipient.app.at.
cigna denial of funk claim for phase two ltd benefits 
on december,funk began a leave of absence due to depression and related disorders.in august,after receiving disability benefits for weeks,funk applied to cigna for ltd benefits in support of his application,funk submitted a claim form and the treatment records from his mental healthcare providers,pinchuck,his psychiatrist,and libby,his psychotherapist funk submissions indicated that he had a history of alcohol abuse and had been experiencing stress from his financial situation and his relationship with his wife.pinchuck and libby treatment notes described funk as suffering from,among other things,depression,anxiety,and paranoia.the notes indicated that funk had difficulty concentrating,making decisions,and otherwise performing daily tasks.both pinchuck and libby opined that funk was unable at that time to return to work in his former position.
cigna forwarded funk treatment records to mohsin qayyum for independent review.qayyum opined that the information provided to him supported the conclusion that,due to severe psychiatric symptoms,funk could not return to work.app.at.accordingly,funk was awarded ltd benefits for a period retroactive to june.
in june,funk executed an agreement providing that his ltd benefits under the plan were to be reduced by any social security benefits he ultimately received and that he would reimburse cigna for any ltd overpayment that may occur as a result of having received social security benefits.app.at.in august,he executed a similar agreement together with the june agreement,the reimbursement agreements.
in january,cigna notified funk that it would again be reviewing his case to determine if he would remain eligible for benefits beyond the phase one period.the review required funk to complete a disability questionnaire and to provide current treatment information from his mental healthcare providers.
funk submitted the questionnaire,listing bad tremors,lack of concentration,tiredness,memory loss,aggression,depression,and paranoia as reasons why he could not return to work.libby provided notes from therapy sessions,including observations that funk relationship with his wife had improved,that he was communicating his feelings much clearer,that he had been able to use the skills learned in session to manage his depression which is now under control,and that he had continue d to improve but need ed regular sessions and proper med ication to avoid regression.app.at.libby also reported that funk was still suffering from confusion,depression,helplessness,and hopelessness and could not at that time return to work.pinchuck did not provide updated treatment notes,stating that they were sent before and that you ca read my handwriting anyway.app.at.he instead provided an updated evaluation of funk,which indicated that funk was not abusing substances and that he exhibited fair judgment and insight along with grossly intact cognition.id.at.however,pinchuck also indicated that funk still suffered from depression and anxiety,scored a on the global assessment of functioning gaf,exhibited limited capacity to socialize and perform daily tasks,and was unable to return to work.
cigna again enlisted qayyum to independently review funk claim.on august,after reviewing funk supplemental information,qayyum issued a report concluding that,while the records showed funk to be suffering from psychiatric symptoms,they did not show that those symptoms were severe or that he had severe functional limitations in psychosocial domains.id.at.given that,and considering funk fair insight and judgment,grossly intact cognition,and thought process and content,id.qayyum opined that the entirety of the available information did not provide evidence of psychiatric functional impairment to preclude id.at funk from working.
on august,the day after issuing his report,and after having made several unsuccessful attempts to contact pinchuck for a discussion about funk,qayyum finally spoke with pinchuck.during that conversation,which qayyum later memorialized in notes,pinchuck suggested that funk might be able to work in a menial job,such as mopping floors or working at a post office at night.id.at.qayyum declined to speculate as to a suitable vocation but responded,echoing his report,that funk was not functionally impaired from working in a supportive,low stress,low cognitive demand environment,as evidenced by,inter alia,his ability to use a computer and daily check his email.id.
also during that conversation,pinchuck revealed that he had referred funk to a neuropsychologist,robert pancza,for an evaluation in march.pancza evaluation,the results of which pinchuck later faxed to qayyum,consisted of a battery of tests administered over two days.from that evaluation,pancza observed 
funk was pleasant and cooperative throughout th e examination.an appropriate amount of effort was applied to all tasks,without any signs of frustration.there was no noted tendency toward mental fatigue,distractibility,impulsivity,or lapses in concentration.all instructions were understood without difficulty.there were no indications that any affective factors,including anxiety or depression,were present at a level sufficient to diminish his functional level during the course of th e examination.mood was noted to be normal and affect was well modulated throughout th e examination.
id.at.the test results indicated that funk enjoyed average to high function in most cognitive areas.summarizing the evaluation,pancza stated 
t here is a disparity between funk of everyday cognitive functioning and the objective results of this examination.there is a growing body of research that has indicated that individuals who are depressed often significantly underestimate the quality of their cognitive functioning.such appears to be the case for funk i reassured funk about being capable of performing occupational activities based solely upon his current cognitive abilities.
on august,cigna notified funk via letter that he was no longer disabled as defined under the plan and so would not receive further ltd benefits.explaining its decision,cigna acknowledged pinchuck opinion that funk still suffered from depression,disorder,anxiety,and paranoia and so was unable to work.however,it noted pinchuck observations that,as of july,funk was alert and oriented and exhibiting good behavior,that he had thought process and content within normal limits,had fair judgment and insight and grossly intact cognition,and had stopped drinking alcohol.id.at.echoing pinchuck opinion,cigna noted that funk ongoing severe depressive symptoms made it difficult to get a clear picture of funk cognitive problems but noted too that panzca testing revealed no gross cognitive defects.id.at.finally,cigna noted that funk was able daily to use a computer to check email.from the foregoing,cigna concluded that there is no clinical evidence to support that funk would be unable to work in a supportive,low stress,low cognitive demand environment.id.cigna closed the letter by informing funk of his right to administratively appeal the decision and to include additional information for cigna to consider 
funk appealed to cigna for further review of his case.he contended that qayyum report and notes,which cigna cited in denying benefits,were at odds with the medical documentation provided by pinchuck and libby.funk also noted that cigna failed to perform any sort of vocational assessment to determine whether he could,in his mental condition,reasonably become qualified by training,education or experience,and earn of his pay,id.at which,funk contended,not only made hollow cigna conclusion that he was not functionally impaired from working in a supportive,low stress,low cognitive demand environment,but also constituted noncompliance with the terms of the plan,since disability under the plan could only be determined in light of a vocational assessment id.at.
funk included as additional information in support of his appeal a letter from the social security administration that indicated that his application for disability benefits was being reviewed and that,based on the submitted information,funk appeared to need help managing his money and meeting his daily needs.id.at.funk subsequently supplied a medical questionnaire completed by libby on february,indicating that funk gaf score was that his response to treatment over the last three years had been fair to poor,that his,stress tolerance,and performance were hindered by confusion,fatigue,dysphoric mood,and depression,that he had marked functional limitation in daily activities,social functioning,and concentrating,and that at present his depressive symptoms hinder sustained,gainful employment.id.at.nevertheless,libby also indicated in the questionnaire that,contrary to the social security administration opinion,funk could manage benefits in his own best interest.id.at.
in january,while his appeal to cigna was pending,funk was awarded social security disability benefits,retroactive to june.that retroactive social security award created a period in which funk received both social security and ltd benefits,meaning that,under the plan,he had been overpaid and was obligated to reimburse cigna the overpaid amount,which was.funk paid cigna,but spent the remaining on ordinary living expenses.despite notice from cigna,funk did not pay the balance owed.
having received funk additional submissions in support of his appeal,cigna forwarded all of the medical documentation that had previously been submitted with funk claim to stuart shipko for an independent review.after reviewing those records,shipko concluded that funk medical history did not support any restrictions or limitations on his working.shipko opined that pinchuck assessment lack ed credibility,citing two reasons.id.at.first,shipko believed that pinchuck had,in his phone conversation with qayyum,mischaracterized pancza neuropsychological testing.in particular,shipko was troubled that pinchuck had said the test results did not provide a clear assessment of funk cognitive problems due to funk ongoing severe depressive symptoms and that testing was needed,despite pancza having stated in his report that emotional factors were not causing any cognitive impairment or interfering with effort or testing of cognition in any manner.id.at.second,according to shipko,pinchuck had indicate d that funk ha d marginal cognitive abilities,had poor grooming and hygiene,and was still severely depressed,though pancza had stated in his report that funk was pleasant and cooperative throughout his examination,had a normal mood and affect,and applied an appropriate amount of effort without a tendency toward mental fatigue,distractibility,impulsivity or lapses in concentration.id.at.
shipko similarly criticized libby opinion that funk could not work,observing that it was at odds with libby own treatment notes,which,shipko said,indicate d that depression is under control and d id not indicate that funk was reporting any problems with cognition or serious symptoms of depression.id.at.shipko also noted that libby conducted no formal cognition tests and that his report was inconsistent with pancza evaluation.shipko closed his review thusly available information does not support an inability to work in any occupation for which he is suited.id.at.
cigna subsequently denied funk appeal.citing shipko and pancza evaluations,and giving no deference to prior reviews,cigna noted that pinchuck and libby opinions were at odds with their own treatment notes and pancza evaluation.id.at.cigna concluded that it had not received medical information demonstrating a severity in funk condition supporting restrictions preventing him from performing his own or any occupation.id.
funk again appealed within cigna,this time submitting a copy of shipko report marked up with libby handwritten comments.libby noted errors he believed shipko had made in chronicling funk treatment and opined that pancza evaluation was misleading because it was done in a controlled environment and that funk status did not support shipko conclusion that funk was able to work.
on february,cigna issued a final decision denying funk ltd claim.noting in particular a lack of clinical evidence or documentation to support libby opinion,cigna stated that it had not been provided with the clinical evidence to support a physical or psychiatric functional loss which would preclude funk from performing his regular occupation.id.at.
proceedings in the district court 
on october,having exhausted his administrative appeals,funk sued cigna pursuant to a b,seeking under erisa to overturn cigna denial of ltd benefits.cigna countersued pursuant to a,seeking under erisa to recover from funk the remaining of overpaid ltd benefits.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,and,on august,the district court granted funk motion and denied cigna.with respect to the denial of benefits,the court held that cigna had acted arbitrarily and capriciously because,as an initial matter,it had failed to assess whether funk was disabled as defined under the plan that is,it had failed to assess whether funk could work in a job that would pay him of his former wage a job,given the restrictions identified in cigna initial denial low stress environment.in the alternative,the court held that cigna denial of benefits was not supported by substantial evidence as set forth in metropolitan life insurance glenn,because cigna had failed to reconcile its decision with the social security administration award of disability benefits given greater weight to physicians opinions without explanation issued the initial denial without having reviewed pancza report confused cognition with mental illness in determining funk ability to be productive at work and exhibited a financial conflict of interest in administering the plan.with respect to cigna counterclaim for recoupment of overpaid benefits,the court held that an equitable lien over the social security funds,which is the relief cigna sought,was not possible here since those funds had been dissipated prior to suit and could not be traced.
cigna timely appeal to us followed.
ii.standard of 
summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.smathers multi tool,multi plastics.emp.health welfare plan,cir.applying that standard,we exercise plenary review of a district court grant of summary judgment.id.

iii.discussion 
this appeal raises the question of whether cigna complied with its own plan and relied on substantial evidence in denying ltd benefits to funk.it also requires us to address whether cigna may assert an equitable lien on funk social security benefits such that it may recoup an overpayment of benefits.we discuss each of those issues in turn.
cigna denial of ltd benefits 
the district court held that cigna abused its discretion in denying funk phase two ltd benefits because cigna failed to comply with the plan in determining disability and because its decision,which did not give proper consideration to the evidence and was infected by a conflict of interest,was not supported by substantial evidence.we disagree with the former conclusion and can not accept the district court analysis as to the latter.
whether cigna complied with the plan 
the district court concluded that,because cigna decision did not explicitly address salary or provide examples of suitable alternative jobs,cigna failed to comply with the plan provision requiring it to determine whether funk was incapable of performing the requirements of any job for any employer for which the individual is qualified or may reasonably become qualified,other than a job that pays less than percent of his former pay.app.at.cigna argues that it was not required to explicitly discuss salary and alternative jobs because it had authority under the plan to reasonably interpret plan provisions,and it was reasonable to interpret the plan as not requiring an analysis of alternative jobs when it had determined that funk could return to his former job.
erisa plans commonly grant authority to plan administrators to interpret the plan terms.goldstein johnson johnson,cir.even so,plan administrators do not have unfettered discretion in undertaking that task.
if the terms are unambiguous,then any actions taken by the plan administrator inconsistent with the terms of the document are arbitrary.but actions reasonably consistent with unambiguous plan language are not arbitrary.if the reviewing court determines the terms of a plan document are ambiguous,it must take the additional step and analyze whether the plan administrator interpretation of the document is reasonable.
bill gray.emp.health welfare plan gourley,cir see also mcelroy smithkline beecham health welfare benefits trust plan for,f d,cir holding that plan administrator was authorized to interpret plan language that was equivocal.
regardless of cigna characterization of what it did here,it does not appear that it interpreted ambiguous plan terms.indeed,the plan requirements for determining phase two disability appear to be clear and thus unsuited to any further interpretation.the issue,then,is whether cigna acted reasonably consistent with those requirements.gourley,at.in our view,it did.the plan required cigna to determine whether funk was capable of working in any job that would pay him of his former pay.cigna literally complied with that requirement when it determined that funk could,without restrictions,perform his regular occupation id.at,his former job at lucent.it went without saying that his former job could be understood to pay of his former wage.moreover,because cigna determination that funk was not disabled did not turn on the existence of an alternative job,it was unnecessary to discuss in its decision any alternative jobs.cigna decision was therefore reasonably consistent with the plan,and the district court contrary holding was in error 
whether substantial evidence supported cigna decision 
in the alternative,the district court concluded that cigna decision was not supported by substantial evidence because it did not give proper consideration to the evidence and was infected by a conflict of interest.regarding the latter point,the court stated that cigna exhibited a financial conflict of interest in the way that the plan for lucent was administered.app.at.the court reasoned that because cigna was a claim administrator operating in a competitive market,it labored under a conflict.citing glenn,the district court said,if a company is a claim administrator that offers itself to plans in a competitive market,then its incentive is to keep claims down to be more attractive to potential plans,which incentivizes the claim administrator to claims.id.at.
that analysis,however,does not take full account of the supreme court instructions in glenn.a party status as a plan administrator does not automatically encumber it with a material conflict of interest.while the supreme court in glenn did say that,for erisa purposes a conflict exists when a plan administrator operates in a competitive market for the delivery of such services the court also acknowledged that the conflict may be of little or no practical significance.see at explaining that,while a plan administrator may have a conflict of interest by virtue of its participation in a competitive market,a court can nonetheless take account of the circumstances which diminish the significance or severity of the conflict in individual cases emphasis original.
here,as even funk rightly and frankly acknowledged at oral argument,there is nothing to suggest that cigna was laboring under a meaningful conflict of interest.thus,the district court should not have given the significant weight it appeared to give to a largely hypothetical conflict.because we can not be sure of the extent to which the district court weighing of that factor affected the court holding,we will remand the case for a reevaluation of cigna claim decision in light of the other factors cited by the district court.
