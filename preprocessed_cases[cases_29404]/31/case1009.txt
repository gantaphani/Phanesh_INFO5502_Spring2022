former employees of ceridian technology center initiated this action in minnesota state court under the provisions of the,alleging breach of contract and implied contract,promissory estoppel,and false statements as inducement to entering employment.employees sought to recover severance pay and compensation for paid days off accrued during their tenure at ceridian.while employed at ceridian technology center,employees participated in a benefits plan,the ceridian corporation severance pay plan ceridian plan,pursuant to which they received paid days off and were guaranteed severance payments.only active,employees who are employed by ceridian or any one of the affiliate operations which have adopted the plan were eligible to participate in the ceridian plan and receive consequent benefits.
in late,ceridian management announced that it was negotiating with grey fox to sell the technology center.on april,dyste,ceridian vice president,wrote to employees,informing them that grey fox offered them employment at their current job descriptions,responsibilities,and base rate of pay.employees,the majority of whom had been employed by ceridian for more than a decade,some for more than thirty years,had accrued substantial severance benefits,as well as compensation for paid days off.employees were concerned that the sale of the technology center would adversely affect the value of and their ability to obtain their severance benefits.
employees allege that ceridian management,aware of employees concerns,guaranteed that if they accepted employment with grey fox,and grey fox subsequently terminated them within their first year of employment,ceridian would pay them severance equal to that which they would have received under the ceridian plan.dyste april,letter to employees informed them that should they decline to become employees of grey fox,they would be ineligible for severance under the ceridian plan as a matter of company policy,when employees receive an offer of employment from the buyer of a ceridian business and refuse such an offer,those employees are considered to have terminated voluntarily from the company and are ineligible for severance.the letter did not address ceridian statements concerning covering severance benefits for employees who transferred to grey fox.
ceridian sold the technology center to grey fox in may.employees accepted employment with grey fox.employees contend that they relied upon ceridian guarantee that they would receive severance pay should grey fox terminate them within their first year of employment with grey fox.at the time of the sale,employees had accumulated in aggregate more than in severance payments and were owed as compensation for paid days off.

the district court granted summary judgment in favor of grey fox and general dynamics,holding that employees state common law and statutory claims to recover severance benefits were preempted by erisa.the court determined that employees could not recover severance pay based on ceridian alleged oral promise because such a delivery of benefits would be inconsistent with the terms of the ceridian plan and because erisa does not permit oral modifications of existing plans.the court declined to grant summary judgment to either party on the issue of remuneration for paid days off,holding that grey fox and general dynamics did not dispute that employees were owed compensation reflecting paid days off accrued while at ceridian.the parties stipulated to a settlement of the claims concerning paid days off.a final judgment was entered concerning the grant of summary judgment on the erisa issue,from which employees now appeal.
