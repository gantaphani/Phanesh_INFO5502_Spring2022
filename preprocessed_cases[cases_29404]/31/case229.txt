background 
the background of this case is described in detail in the decisions of the district court,and in our september decision in the appeal from the district court initial judgment.we restate it here only insofar as it is relevant to the issue presented in this appeal.
aramony employment with united way and united way pension plans 
aramony served from to as president and ceo of united way of america,one of the nation leading charitable organizations.in,united way terminated aramony employment amidst allegations that he had engaged in fraud and financial improprieties with respect to united way funds.aramony was convicted in in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia of numerous felony counts of fraud,and sentenced to seven years in prison.
during aramony tenure as president and ceo of united way,united way provided its employees with a qualified defined benefit plan under which pension benefits were calculated as a function of an employee average salary over a period.under a amendment to the internal revenue code,section of the code set a limit of to be adjusted upwards for cost of living increases on the benefits that an employee may receive each year under such a qualified benefit plan.see b a setting limitation d providing for cost of living adjustments.
section reduced the benefits available to aramony and other united way employees under united way qualified defined benefit plan.in order to offset the impact of section on united way employees,the united way executive committee met in february to consider adopting a pension plan,titled the replacement benefit plan or rbp.
the general practice at united way was for the executive committee to adopt the concept of a pension plan,but not to involve itself in the details of the plan.details were worked out by stephen paulachak,a senior vice president of united way,and mutual of america life insurance company mutual.mutual was the entity with which united way had signed a group annuity contract.mutual also drafted united way pension plan documents and administered united way pension plans.
at the february meeting,paulachak described the purposes of the rbp as to restore benefits lost because of the restrictions imposed by section,and to restore the pension benefits lost as a result of rul,which excluded deferred compensation from the definition of compensation under united way qualified benefit plan the minutes of the meeting show that the executive committee adopted paulachak recommendation and authorized united way to establish an rbp.after a delay,mutual drafted a plan document for the rbp,and on may,paulachak executed it on united way behalf.
as ultimately executed,the rbp is made up of nine articles,two of which are relevant here.article i sets out the purpose of the plan.it states in relevant part that 
t his plan is being installed to provide a mechanism for securing the pension benefit promises made to united way management and highly compensated key employees who may receive relatively smaller retirement benefits under the existing pension arrang e ment than rank and file employees will receive as a result of limitations imposed by the internal revenue code and rulings thereunder on the amount of pensions payable to the highly compensated.
article v sets out the operative terms of the rbp.the relevant aspects of article v are sections through.sections,and,which are set out in full in the margin each specify a particular formula for calculating contributions to the rbp.section provides a formula for calculating contributions to the rbp to replace benefits lost because of section of the internal revenue code.section provides a formula for calculating contributions to the rbp to replace benefits lost because of the revenue ruling exclusion of deferred compensation from the definition of compensation.section provides a formula for calculating contributions to the rbp to replace benefits lost because of both section and the exclusion of deferred compensation.section provides that united way shall specify which of the formulas is applicable to each eligible group of participating employees.finally,section provides that 
the benefit to be provided under this plan on behalf of each eligible participant shall be the sum of a plus b below 
a the yearly contributions required pursuant to section,or,whichever is applicable,and 
b any additional contributions or benefit amount that the employer has agreed to pay to the participant pursuant to either a contractual commitment or a resolution of the board of trustees of the employer.
approximately a year later,in,as part of the tax reform act of,congress enacted section a of the code,which placed a cap of,subsequently reduced to,on the annual compensation that could be taken into account by a qualified plan in calculating the benefits due to each employee subject to upward adjustments for cost of living increases.see a.because aramony salary was in excess of the cap set forth in section a,the effect of section a was to decrease the annual compensation that could be taken into account in calculating aramony pension benefits under united way qualified defined benefit plan.
in october and january,mutual sent aramony estimates of his united way pension benefits under both the qualified defined benefit plan and the rbp.notwithstanding that the rbp does not mention the replacement of benefits lost because of section a,estimates sent to aramony indicated values that reflected the replacement not only of the benefits he lost because of section,but also of the benefits he lost because of section a in addition,mutual prepared annual valuation reports for united way between and that estimated the expected value of aramony pension benefits.these annual valuation reports,like the estimates that mutual sent to aramony,also included sums that resulted from an assumption that aramony would receive replacement benefits for the benefits he lost because of section a,as well as those he lost because of section.
in,the united way executive committee convened to amend the rbp by adding a provision to replace benefits lost as a result of an unrelated change in the qualified defined benefit plan formula mandated by the tax reform act of.at that meeting,the executive committee agreed to amend the rbp by adding the replacement benefits traceable to that unrelated change,but no plan document incorporating the amendment was ever generated.the executive committee never discussed amending the rbp to provide replacement benefits for benefit reductions caused by the enactment of section a.
prior proceedings proceedings below 
as a consequence of aramony misconduct,united way determined to deny aramony pension benefits under both the rbp and a supplemental benefits agreement sba into which united way and aramony had entered in.aramony brought this action pursuant to section a b of the employees retirement income security act erisa,a b,seeking,inter alia,declaratory judgment that he was entitled to the pension benefits.after a bench trial,the district court issued a split decision explained by an opinion that we characterized in the first appeal as lengthy,thoughtful,and meticulous.aramony ii,at.the district court ruled that aramony was entitled to recover benefits under the rbp,but that he was not entitled to recover benefits under the sba.see aramony i,d at.the district court also found that aramony was liable to united way under united way counterclaims for,inter alia,breach of fiduciary duty.see id.at.
on the issue whether the rbp included replacement benefits for pension benefit losses incurred because of section a,the district court ruled in aramony favor because it found that united way was estopped from arguing that the rbp did not include such benefits.the estoppel was found to result from the two reports sent by mutual to aramony in and,which calculated aramony expected pension benefits in a manner that included in the rbp the replacement of benefits lost because of section a.see aramony i,d at the magnitude of these figures reveals mutual belief that aramony rbp benefits would make up for the effect of a moreover,the district court stated that the rbp was ambiguous as to whether it was intended to compensate for the effects of a.id.at.the court found that aramony had reasonably relied to his detriment on the representations of mutual,acting as united way agent,and that these facts satisfied the extraordinary circumstances requirement that we have established for promissory estoppel claims in the erisa context.see id.at see also schonholz long island jewish med,cir lee burkhart,cir.accordingly,the district court ruled that aramony was entitled under the rbp to replacement benefits for those benefits he lost because of the enactment of section a.see id.at.
both parties appealed.we affirmed the district court judgment with respect to all questions except the issue of the section a benefits under the rbp.see aramony ii,at.on the question of section a replacement benefits,we held that aramony had not satisfied the requirement to show extraordinary circumstances to justify promissory estoppel in erisa cases.we stated that neither ambiguity in a plan terms alone,nor ambiguity in combination with the promise element of ordinary estoppel analysis,constituted an extraordinary circumstance.id.at.accordingly,we reversed the district court determination that united way is estopped from denying that the rbp provides a benefit offsetting the effect of a.id.at.rather than grant judgment to united way on this issue,however,we remanded to the district court for consideration of the scope of the rbp as a matter of contract law 
as part of its estoppel analysis,the district court decided,however,that the rbp was ambiguous on this point.we remand,therefore,so that the district court may consider whether united way is contractually bound by the rbp itself to provide the benefit to aramony.
on remand,the district court again ruled in aramony favor.the court explained that there is a conflict between the plan stated purpose in article i of the rbp,on the one hand,and the effect of a,on the other.aramony iii,d at quoting aramony i,d at.in particular,the court reasoned that it is not clear from the language of the rbp that the general statement of purpose in article i of the rbp does not include the limitation on pension benefits contained in a,and that such ambiguity is reinforced by the fact that a takes away some of the benefit explicitly mentioned in of the rbp.id.at.moreover,the district court explained that the absence of any mention of a from the rbp is not determinative of the rbp scope because the rbp was executed before the enactment of section a.id.at quoting aramony i,d at.finally,the district court reasoned that the terms of the rbp are ambiguous on their face with respect to section a benefits because even if the purpose of the rbp was simply to provide a full benefit for,the failure to offset the limitation contained in a would frustrate this purpose.id.at.
the district court thus turned to extrinsic evidence to construe the terms of the plan and concluded that the parties conduct after the execution of the rbp demonstrated that the parties understood the rbp to provide replacement benefits for pension benefit reductions caused by section a.in particular,the court referred to two pieces of extrinsic evidence to support this view.first,in the united way executive committee increased aramony annual salary from to,stating a purpose to maintain growth in his pension base.aramony iii,d at.unless the rbp included section a replacement benefits,however,an increase in aramony salary would not have increased his pension base because section a had capped at the annual earnings that could be taken into account in calculating qualified defined benefit plan benefits.see id.at.second,mutual annual valuation reports to united way calculated aramony pension benefits as if the rbp included a replacement benefits.the benefit figures calculated in the reports were consistent with the view that the rbp included section a benefits,and a former executive of mutual testified that in he had informed united way that mutual believed that the rbp compensated aramony for benefits that were lost as a result of section a.see id.at.on the basis of this evidence,the district court concluded that the extrinsic evidence conclusively demonstrates that united way thought that the rbp did provide an offset of a.id.the court therefore held that united way is contractually bound by the rbp itself to provide the benefit to aramony.id.quoting aramony ii,at.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,united way argues that the district court erred in interpreting the rbp as ambiguous,and that the rbp can be read reasonably only as not providing section a replacement benefits.we agree.
a.the law of the case doctrine does not bar our consideration of whether the rbp is ambiguous 
as a threshold matter,we reject aramony contention that the law of the case bars us from ruling that the rbp is not ambiguous.the doctrine of the law of the case posits that if a court decides a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern in subsequent stages of the same case.in re energy,cir,cert.denied,d quoting county of rensselaer,cir.courts apply the law of the case doctrine when their prior decisions in an ongoing case either expressly resolved an issue or necessarily resolved it by implication.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at.application of the law of the case doctrine is discretionary and does not limit a court power to reconsider its own decisions prior to final judgment.in re,at quoting,at internal quotation marks omitted.
aramony argues that in our decision in aramony ii,at,we necessarily held that the rbp is ambiguous.first,he argues that we so held when we affirmed the district court decision in aramony i to resort to extrinsic evidence to resolve an ambiguity in the rbp unrelated to the question now at issue in this case a contract that is ambiguous in one respect,however,need not be ambiguous in another,and nothing we said in aramony ii about an unrelated ambiguity in the rbp has any bearing on the question now before us.
second,aramony argues that we necessarily held that the rbp is ambiguous as to the question of a replacement benefits when we reversed the district court estoppel decision and remanded for further consideration whether the rbp provides a replacement benefits as a matter of contract law.in aramony i,the district court stated that the rbp is ambiguous as to whether it was intended to compensate for the effects of a,and went on to rule that the doctrine of promissory estoppel barred united way from denying the replacement of benefits lost because of section a.aramony i,d at.on appeal,we held that the district court erred in finding an estoppel.we recited that the district court had concluded that the rbp is ambiguous on the question of a benefits.aramony ii,at.but we explained that the combination of we have concluded does not alone suffice to establish extraordinary the promise element of ordinary est
