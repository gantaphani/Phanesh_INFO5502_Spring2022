the plaintiffs are a class of retirees from raytheon and its predecessor,hughes missile systems,along with their spouses and eligible dependents.since,hughes,and later raytheon,paid insurance premiums for healthcare coverage for early retirees until age pursuant to a series of collective bargaining agreements cbas with the plaintiffs union.in,raytheon limited its contributions to premiums for this insurance and started charging the plaintiffs monthly payments for their healthcare coverage.the plaintiffs sued alleging that raytheon breached the cbas and violated the labor management relations act lmra,and the employee retirement income security act of erisa.the district court concluded that the cbas obligated raytheon to continue to pay the premiums and granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.raytheon appeals the order granting summary judgment.
in a separate order,the district court granted raytheon motion for judgment on the pleadings,concluding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to punitive and damages.the plaintiffs appeal that judgment.
we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and its judgment on the pleadings in favor of raytheon.
background 
the cbas that apply to the plaintiffs are those adopted in,and.each cba provided premiumfree medical insurance coverage to qualified retirees until they attained the age of years,as well as their spouses and eligible dependents.to qualify,retirees had to be at least age but less than age,with five years of continuous employment,and three years of continuous participation in the company retirement plan.
hughes missile systems executed the cbas.in,hughes missile systems merged into raytheon and raytheon was substituted as the employer in the cba.in,raytheon executed a new cba that continued to provide retirees with medical insurance coverage.
the relevant provisions of the cbas remained largely unchanged.each cba carried a term.for qualifying retirees,hughes and raytheon agreed to continue to provide the comprehensive medical plan coverages for which they were covered while active employees,until the retired employee attain ed age this promise assured retirees of medical insurance coverage,because a separate provision of the cbas obligated hughes and raytheon to pay the premiums for the comprehensive medical plan for active employees.starting in,a provision was added to the cbas confirming that for retirees there is no weekly for the preferred plan,the hughes medical plan,or an hmo.raytheon continued to pay the full premiums for retirees until.
in,raytheon negotiated a new cba that eliminated its obligation to pay the full medical insurance premiums for retirees.the cba obligated raytheon to pay only a portion of the premiums for retiree medical insurance coverage.raytheon applied this new agreement retroactively and,in,began charging the plaintiffs monthly payments to keep their medical insurance coverage in force.
continuing obligation 
as an initial matter,we must decide whether raytheon obligation to pay the premiums for retiree medical insurance coverage survived the term of each of the cbas.we conclude that it did.
in general,contractual obligations will cease,in the ordinary course,upon termination of the bargaining agreement.litton fin.printing div.nlrb,see also poore simpson paper,cir.there are exceptions,however,which are determined by contract interpretation.litton,at.as the supreme court has explained 
rights which accrued or vested under the agreement will,as a general rule,survive termination of the agreement.and of course,if a agreement provides in explicit terms that certain benefits continue after the agreement expiration,disputes as to such continuing benefits may be found to arise under the agreement 
the cbas explicitly provided that the retirees rights to fully paid premiums for medical insurance would continue after the cbas expiration.poore,at an exception to this general rule exists,however,where the parties dispute concerns a right that accrued or vested under the agreement,or where,under normal principles of contract interpretation,the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.quoting litton,at emphasis added.
hughes and raytheon expressly agreed to continue to provide medical insurance coverage for retirees until age notwithstanding the cbas terms.see litton,at recognizing that obligations already fixed under the contract but as yet unsatisfied do not expire with the agreement.unlike other group coverages in the cbas,premium payments for retiree medical insurance coverage were not limited to the term of the agreement.compare united mine workers brushy creek coal,cir concluding that retiree benefits,although described as for life in one provision of a cba,were limited to the term of the cba under a separate provision so stating expressly crown cork seal,int l ass of machinists aerospace workers,cir holding that retiree benefits did not vest under a cba in part because the cba expressly precluded only modification for the life of the agreement.
retiree medical insurance coverage with premiums paid by raytheon was not limited to the cbas expiration dates by virtue of the general integration clause,which applied the cbas term limits to group coverages that did not specify duration as the district court determined,retiree medical insurance coverage,with premiums paid by raytheon,was the only group coverage under the cbas that supplied a specific duration until the retiree attains age and therefore survived the expiration of the cbas.compare turner local union,int l of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers of,cir concluding that the cbas made no representation as to the length of the period during which retiree benefits would continue to be paid,other than throughout the term of this agreement and therefore could be terminated at the end of any one cba int l union of united,aerospace agric.implement workers of am.rockford powertrain,cir holding that a company could terminate ongoing retiree health benefits because the cba contains no statement regarding the period of time during which retirees would be entitled to benefits.
the language of the cbas makes clear that raytheon agreement to pay retiree medical insurance premiums continued beyond the term of the cbas even where its agreement to pay employee premiums did not.the cbas provided retirees with medical insurance coverage for which they were covered while active employees,which was,undisputedly,in addition,letters from raytheon to retirees between and support the understanding that retirees and their qualified dependents were eligible for retiree medical coverage until the age of.thus,raytheon agreed to continue providing retirees with the same medical insurance coverage they had as active employees,until they turned.
while raytheon argues that this promise was merely an agreement to pay some portion of retirees medical coverage until age,the language of the cbas supports the plaintiffs contention that it obligated raytheon to continue the coverage that retirees enjoyed as employees.the cbas provide different retirement benefits to employees who enrolled in the contributory option of the retirement plan from those who enrolled in the option,and the difference sheds light on the correct interpretation of.the cbas exclude from the benefit what they alternately called employer provided medical coverage and medical.instead,employees opting for the benefit were required to pay the full retiree cobra group premium for the medical plan of benefits in which they are enrolled,if they wished to maintain coverage after retirement.the difference is clear.retirees who elected the noncontributory benefit pay for their insurance,while retirees who elected the contributory benefit receive the same medical they received as employees until they turn.
right to terminate 
the cbas each contained a general provision stating that a ll benefits of employees and retired employees are subject in every respect to the terms of the applicable plan documents under which payment is claimed.raytheon contends that this provision sub
