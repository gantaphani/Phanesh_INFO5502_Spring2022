richard flores,individually and doing business as construction,and priscilla flores,individually and doing business as tile,appeal the judgment of the district court in favor of the trustees of the bricklayers and trowel trades international pension fund upon the trustees claim under the employment retirement income security act of erisa,et,for delinquent pension contributions.the appellants contend the district court overlooked genuine issues of material fact and applied incorrect legal standards in concluding tile was the alter ego of construction and liable for its delinquent pension contributions.we affirm the judgment.
background 
the three flores brothers joseph,richard,and jesse do tile work on public projects in southern california.joseph flores manages all operations of the family tile installation businesses his wife,priscilla flores,oversees the finances and acts as office manager for the family businesses.richard and jesse flores set tile and do not have management responsibilities.
over the past thirty years the flores family has owned and operated several tile businesses in southern california.joseph flores owned and operated majestic tile from to richard flores worked for him.majestic tile closed in after joseph flores encountered problems with the irs owing to majestic failure to remit payroll taxes.this case concerns three of the family businesses that began operations after majestic was closed.
in richard started a business known as construction.although nominally the owner,richard had little knowledge about or involvement with the management and finances of construction.richard received wages for his work as a tile setter but received no share of the profits.joseph flores,who referred to himself as the operations manager of construction,estimated,bid,and negotiated construction tile setting contracts as he had majestic before.priscilla was in charge of construction finances,as she had been of majestic.
in construction entered into a collective bargaining agreement cba with the local affiliate of the international union of bricklayers and allied craftsmen.construction thereby agreed to make contributions to the bricklayers and trowel trades international pension fund for each hour worked by all workmen covered by this agreement defined to include all tile setters employed by construction until such time as the company gave effective notice of its withdrawal from the cba.although construction ceased making payments to the fund in december,and ceased operating in january,it did not then provide the fund with a notice of withdrawal from the cba.
shortly after construction ceased operations,jesse flores started tile.although jesse was listed as the owner,he did not have any involvement in the management of the firm he worked solely as a tile setter.joseph,who again styled himself the operations manager,stated in his deposition that tile was my company.priscilla served tile,as she had construction,as the office manager and bookkeeper.although there was no written contract between the two companies,tile assumed construction tile setting and completed jobs construction had begun.tile did not,however,become a signatory to the cba or contribute to the fund.
in jesse flores transferred the assets of tile to priscilla flores there was no written contract of sale and apparently no consideration.priscilla continued to do business under the tile name and each member of the flores family continued to perform his or her job at tile.
when construction had not made any payments to the fund for more than a year,the trustees of the fund made unavailing demands upon both construction and tile.richard and priscilla flores respectively notified the trustees that construction and tile although not a signatory were withdrawing from the cba.the trustees then sued construction,tile,and richard and priscilla flores under g and to recover the delinquent pension fund payments.
the district court granted the trustees motion for summary judgment.the court concluded from the undisputed material facts that construction and the two tile companies are alter egos and that it is in the interest of justice to hold that these three successive companies are alter egos.the appellants moved for reconsideration,which the district court denied,and they now appeal to this court.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see workman united methodist comm.on relief of the bd.of global ministries.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see anderson liberty lobby,d.
the appellants present three arguments for reversing the judgment of the district court first,the court failed to consider the declaration of joseph flores,which contained material facts in dispute.second,the court both ignored other facts material to whether construction and tile were alter egos and applied incorrect legal standards for determining whether an entity is an alter ego under the erisa.third,the trustees are barred by equitable considerations from recovering the delinquent pension contributions.
declaration of joseph flores 
in its initial decision the district court refused to consider the declaration of joseph flores because it contradicts flores deposition testimony at several relevant points.the court would not allow the flores to create a factual dispute through the submission of a declaration that contradicts prior deposition testimony.
upon the flores motion for reconsideration,however,the district court did consider the declaration and found it did not contradict any fact material to whether tile was the alter ego of construction.rather,the court stated,the declaration disputed only minor and immaterial issues of fact and did not alter the district court conclusion that the trustees were entitled to summary judgment.
on review,therefore,this court need not consider the merits of the district court initial conclusion that the declaration was a sham affidavit.the appellants protestation notwithstanding,at the end of the day the district court simply did not ignore joseph declaration in granting summary judgment to the trustees.
alter ego liability 
the trustees claim arises under of the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of mppaa.that provision makes a federal obligation of an employer contractual commitment to contribute to a multiemployer pension fund 
every employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall,to the extent not inconsistent with law,make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans or such agreement.
section was a response to the problem created when an employer defaults upon its obligation to fund a multiemployer pension plan if one employer does not make its contributions to such a plan,then the other participating employers must make larger contributions to cover the shortfall.see,ii at.the funding burden may be shifted beyond other participating employers to taxpayers via the pension benefit guaranty corporation,and to beneficiaries in the form of reduced pension benefits.see upholsterers int l union pension fund artistic furniture of pontiac,cir.
section evinces a strong congressional desire to minimize contribution losses and the resulting burden such losses impose upon other plan participants.id.at.the statute puts multiemployer plans in a stronger position than they otherwise occupy under common law contract principles,bakery confectionery union indus.int l pension fund ralph grocery,cir it facilitates recovery of contributions from delinquent employers by limiting the defenses available to an employer in an action brought to enforce the obligation created by.
