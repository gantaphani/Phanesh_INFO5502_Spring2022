this is an erisa case.plaintiff shirley mcleod mcleod,a former employee of defendant valley media,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant hartford life and accident insurance hartford in which the court upheld hartford denial of long term disability ltd benefits to mcleod based upon hartford interpretation of the language in mcleod benefits policy with hartford.the question before us on appeal is whether hartford wrongfully determined that mcleod,who had been receiving medical care for various ailments since,but who was neither diagnosed with nor treated specifically for multiple sclerosis ms until after her benefits plan became effective in,should have been excluded from coverage due to the existence of a condition,namely consistent with our opinion in lawson ex rel.lawson fortis insurance,cir,we hold that despite language in the benefit plan aimed to cast a broad net as to what constitutes receiving medical care for a condition,mcleod did not receive treatment for such a condition prior to her effective date of coverage because neither she nor her physicians either knew or suspected that the symptoms she was experiencing were in any way connected with under the heightened standard of review formulated in pinto reliance standard life insurance,cir,the decision to deny mcleod ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious and we will therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to hartford,reverse its denial of mcleod motion for summary judgment on liability,and remand for calculation of benefits.

the issue in the case centers around the fact that on february,a date that fell within the day period that ended the day before the effective date of period mcleod consulted eileen digregorio because of numbness in her left arm.digregorio had already treated mcleod for a number of years for cardiac insufficiency,and for multiple bulging cervical discs whose presence had been confirmed by mri evaluations.mcleod had also been diagnosed with hypertension and had suffered several panic attacks.it is unconstested both that digregorio provided medical care for the numbness during the february visit and that she did not diagnose or otherwise suggest that mcleod might have ms at that time.mcleod continued to seek treatment for her condition over the next several months from digregorio,as well as from two neurologists,emil matarese and clyde markowitz,and underwent a number of neurological evaluations and mris,none of which produced a diagnosis of ms or even a suspicion that ms was a possible cause of the numbness and other complaints.
it was not until august that mcleod was finally diagnosed with ms,an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system.with the benefit of hindsight,a number of physicians including her treating physicians and a physician who reviewed her medical record for hartford,attributed mcleod various symptoms and ailments to in march,mcleod applied for short term disability std benefits.she had last worked on january.the attending physician statement completed by digregorio and submitted as part of mcleod application provides 
diagnosis multiple sclerosis 
subjective symptoms severe pain legs,feet,ca stand long,paresthesias 
date of onset of this condition 
dates of treatment for this condition progressive symptoms since 
mcleod claim for std benefits was initially approved from february,through february,and was then extended through may.at the time of the extension,mcleod was informed that benefits beyond may,would be reviewed to determine her eligibility for ltd benefits.hartford denied mcleod application for ltd benefits on the grounds that her disabling condition,ms,was a condition for which ltd benefits were not payable under the plan.although the diagnosis of ms was not made until august,more than four months after her effective date of coverage,hartford concluded that mcleod had received medical care for manifestations,symptoms,findings or aggravations relating to or resulting from multiple sclerosis during the day period prior to her insured effective date of april,when she saw digregorio for left arm numbness on february.
on november,mcleod appealed this denial through an internal appeals mechanism.hartford informed mcleod,by letter dated february,that it was upholding its determination that the multiple sclerosis was a condition based on the manisfestations,symptoms,findings,or aggravations related to the multiple sclerosis.
mcleod filed a timely appeal of that decision,again in accordance with the plan grievance procedures.the appeal focused on mcleod claim that she had not received treatment for ms during the period,since the ms had not yet been diagnosed at that time.as part of the appeal process,hartford forwarded mcleod file to the university disability consortium for an independent medical review.the review was conducted by brian mercer,a neurologist.as part of the process,mercer reviewed mcleod medical information and spoke to her treating physicians,digregorio and markowitz.based on his review of the medical records and his discussions with mcleod treating physicians,mercer concluded that the records indicate that mcleod was treated on for left arm numbness,which was a symptom and manifestation of her multiple sclerosis,albeit not yet diagnosed at that time.in consideration of all the information before it,hartford affirmed its decision to deny ltd benefits.
mcleod then filed a complaint in the district court alleging claims of interference with protected rights count i failure to award benefits due under the terms of the plan count ii breach of fiduciary duty count iii and breach of contract count iv.mcleod named hartford,group long term disability benefits for employees of valley media,and valley media,as defendants.mcleod voluntarily dismissed counts i,iii and iv of her complaint as against hartford pursuant to.the matter was stayed as against hartford due to the bankruptcy of valley media,
hartford and mcleod filed for summary judgment.the court granted hartford motion on february.mcleod filed a timely notice of appeal on march.the court had jurisdiction pursuant to because the complaint sought benefits under a b.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.standard of review 
our review of the grant of summary judgment is plenary.see shelton of med.dentistry of,cir.we apply the same standard of review to hartford decision to deny ltd benefits to mcleod that the district court should have applied.see smathers.employee health welfare plan,cir.mcleod claim arises under erisa,where a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,firestone tire rubber bruch,d,in which case it must be reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see smathers,at.under the arbitrary and capricious standard,the court may overturn hartford decision only if it is without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.abnathya roche,cir quoting adamo anchor hocking.
in this case,the plan provides hartford with full discretion and authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe and interpret all terms of the plan.thus,hartford decision to deny ltd benefits to mcleod must be reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard unless the heightened standard of review formulated in pinto applies.in pinto,we held that when an insurance company both funds and administers benefits,it is generally acting under a conflict that warrants a heightened form of the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.at.this heightened standard of review uses a sliding scale approach,intensifying the degree of scrutiny to match the degree of conflict,considering,among other factors,the exact nature of the financial arrangement between the insurer and the company.see id.at.when applying this standard,a court is directed to consider the nature and degree of apparent conflicts and shape its review accordingly,with the result that the less evidence there is of conflict on the part of the administrator,the more deferential the standard becomes.id.at.
mcleod contends that hartford both funds and administers the plan,and that the heightened standard of review formulated in pinto therefore applies.both in its brief and at oral argument,hartford conceded that it funded the plan and that a heightened standard of review applied there is no dispute that hartford insures the plan and has been provided with authority to construe plan terms and to determine eligibility for benefits.therefore,under lasser reliance standard life insurance,cir,cert.denied,d,the district court was required to review this decision under a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard.while the record is not clear as to the exact nature of the funding arrangement of the plan,we accept hartford concession that a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies 
given this heightened standard of review,the discretion hartford accords itself to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe and interpret all terms and provisions of the plan is not unfettered.
iii.the plan language 
the question before us is whether the district court erred when it concluded that a diagnosis of ms that postdated mcleod consultation with a physician during the period for numbness in her arm established a condition such that hartford decision to deny ltd benefits to mcleod was justified.more specifically,could hartford read back a condition for purposes of excluding coverage when the condition itself was not diagnosed in the period,especially in a situation such as this where other diagnoses were made as to the very symptoms that are now being attributed to the alleged condition.
hartford would have us hold that receiving medical care for symptoms of a condition encompasses receiving care for symptoms that no one even suspected were connected with the later diagnosed ailment but which were later deemed not inconsistent with it,but a heightened standard of review will not countenance such a strained interpretation.in a case of heightened review,where the plan administrator is not afforded complete,freewheeling discretion,we must be especially mindful to ensure that the administrator interpretation of policy language does not unfairly disadvantage the policy holder.erisa was enacted to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans and to protect contractually defined benefits.firestone,at.quoting shaw delta air lines,d.mut.life ins.russell,d.were the plan language the subject of discretionary review,and had hartford provided a plausible reason for its interpretation,then perhaps the result would be different.but,given hartford concession,heightened review applies and hartford suggested reading of the terms for and symptom can not withstand that scrutiny.
under hartford interpretation of the plan,any symptom experienced before the excludable condition is diagnosed could serve as the basis for an exclusion so long as the symptom was not later deemed inconsistent with that condition.for example,a policy holder could seek medical care for shortness of breath and be diagnosed with the remnants of a very bad cold,and have a heart attack two months later.according to its interpretation,hartford would then be able to claim that the original shortness of breath was a symptom or manifestation of the underlying,and undiagnosed,heart disease,rendering the heart disease a condition for purposes of excluding the policy holder from ltd benefits.the problem with using this type of ex post facto analysis is that a whole host of symptoms occurring before a correct diagnosis is rendered,or even suspected,can presumably be tied to the condition once it has been diagnosed.thus,any time a policy holder seeks medical care of any kind during the period,the symptom that prompted him to seek the care could potentially be deemed a symptom of a condition,as long as it was later deemed consistent with symptoms generally associated with the condition eventually diagnosed.
the language at issue before us revolves around the meaning of two terms for and symptom.the hartford plan defines neither.we have already undertaken the analysis of for in lawson.there,elena lawson was taken to the emergency room two days before her insurance policy became effective,for what was initially diagnosed as a respiratory tract infection.one week later,after the effective date of her policy,she was correctly diagnosed as having leukemia.the insurance company denied coverage of medical expenses relating to the leukemia on the ground that it was a condition for which lawson received treatment prior to the effective date.lawson parents,acting on her behalf,sued for breach of contract and we affirmed the district court grant of their motion for summary judgment.
the lawson panel framed the issue in the following way 
the central issue in this case is whether receiving treatment for the symptoms of an unsuspected or misdiagnosed condition prior to the effective date of coverage makes the condition a one under the terms of the insurance policy.in other words,we must determine whether it is possible to receive treatment for a condition without knowing what the condition is.
addressing this issue,the lawson panel held that the word for has an implicit intent requirement and that it is hard to see how a doctor can provide treatment for a condition without knowing what that condition is or that it even exists.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court engaged in a detailed analysis of other courts renderings of the word for in similar contexts,noting that although there are differing readings of what constitutes receiving treatment for a condition,the word for itself must,by definition,include a notion of intentionality.see id.for is used as a function word to indicate purpose quoting webster ninth new collegiate dictionary.
as quoted above,the plan at issue here defines a condition,in relevant part as 
any manifestations,symptoms,findings,or aggravations related to or resulting from such accidental bodily injury,sickness,mental illness,pregnancy,or substance abuse 
for which you received medical care during the day period that ends the day before 
your effective date of coverage
