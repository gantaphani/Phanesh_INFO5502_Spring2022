after being denied benefits under her employer severance plan for selected employees plan,judy dabertin brought an action under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et against her employer hcr manor care hcr,the plan,and the plan administrator and the committee appointed by hcr board of directors to administer the plan committee seeking district court review of the committee determination.the district court held that the committee was arbitrary and capricious in denying dabertin claim for severance benefits.we affirm in all aspects save for one minor housekeeping matter which we remand for further consideration.
for over seventeen years,judy dabertin worked for manor care manor care,a company that owns and operates skilled nursing facilities across the country.for at least some portion of those years,dabertin worked as one of several vice presidents of operations.over the course of that time she became accustomed to her duties as vice president.those duties changed,however,when,in september,manor care merged into a subsidiary of health care and retirement corporation.paul ormond,the designated president and chief executive officer of the new organization,hcr,embarked on a plan to radically alter operations in the merged entity.as part of his plan,he required all vice presidents of operations,including dabertin,to take on the additional role and title of general managers.as general managers,ormond expected the executives to spend significantly more time in the facilities assigned to them and participate more directly in their management.all of the vice presidents,including dabertin,were required to perform all of the same functions they performed when they were solely vice presidents,but to those duties ormond added new of a general manager.to accommodate the nature of these increased duties,ormond opted to reduce the number of facilities to which some vice presidents were assigned.dabertin,for example,had formerly directed operations of all of the facilities in the central and western divisions of the company.the facilities in the western division,however,were geographically dispersed throughout california,washington,utah,nevada and arizona.according to hcr,the wide geographic dispersion of the facilities would make managing the western division under the new approach significantly more difficult than before.consequently,manor care determined that in order to enable dabertin to perform her new managerial duties properly,she could no longer oversee operations at both divisions.ormond,therefore,assigned her to the western division alone.according to the defendants,dabertin maintained the same authority,functions,duties,and responsibilities in the western division as she had previously for both the central and western divisions.as a practical matter,however,this meant that she went from having authority for and oversight over facilities to,from skilled nursing units to seventeen,and from beds to.according to dabertin,she lost all of her authority,functions,duties and responsibilities for the central region operations,one of the largest and most complex markets.her budgeted revenue decreased from million to million and her operating profits decreased from million to million.her independent capital spending authority went from million to zero,and she lost her independent authority to manage her total budget.she no longer had any responsibility and authority for development and implementation of advertising,public relations,consulting,business meetings,seminars,and conventions.hcr eliminated her construction project authority for twenty western division sites and eliminated her role in identifying,reviewing,overseeing,and coordinating construction projects.when hcr closed the pleasant hill,california and lombard,illinois facilities,dabertin lost her management function and hiring and firing authority for staff members.
dismayed by what she saw as her waning authority,on october,dabertin gave notice to her supervisor,keith weikel,that she was leaving hcr.she made a claim for severance benefits under the plan which had been adopted in preparation for the merger.that plan designated officers,including dabertin,as plan participants.under the terms of the plan,employees were entitled to severance benefits in the following two circumstances 
a participant shall be entitled to severance benefits under this plan if and only if his employment with the company terminates under either of the following circumstances 
a a termination by the company other than for cause,or 
b a termination by the participant for good reason.
the plan defines good reason as a significant reduction in the scope of a participant authority,position,title,functions,duties or responsibilities.at.dabertin submitted to hcr that she had good reason to terminate her employment with hcr because,among other things,the number of facilities,beds,direct reports,and construction projects assigned to her had decreased.
hcr claims,however,that prior to the merger,ormond the incoming president and ceo of the merged entity discussed the purpose and goal of the plan with stuart bainum,the ceo of the former manor care.according to hcr,ormond stated that dabertin and the other executives were critical to the success of the merged entity and he did not want the plan to give them an incentive to resign and receive severance benefits under the plan.ormond and bainum agreed that a switch to a more operating procedure would not trigger any entitlement to severance benefits.dabertin,of course,was not privy to these conversations.nor were ormond intentions recorded in the text of the plan.
weikel denied dabertin claim for benefits and she appealed that denial to the committee.on january,the of ormond and three to consider dabertin claim for benefits.during the consideration of dabertin claim,ormond relayed his conversation with bainum to the committee,reiterating that it was his intention that the switch to the new approach would not constitute a reduction in the scope of a vice president authority,position,title,functions,duties or responsibilities,and therefore would not trigger entitlement to benefits.the committee interpreted the plan consistently with ormond stated intention and denied dabertin benefits,determining that if a participant continues to have a full range of operational,financial,administrative and other authority,functions,duties and responsibilities with respect to the business unit the participant manages,the scope of the participant authority,duties,functions and responsibilities would not be affected.at emphasis in original.it determined that in dabertin case,her duties,responsibilities,authority,title,position and functions had actually significantly increased since she,as well as the other vice presidents,were expected to spend significantly more time in the facilities in their divisions,they were required to conduct operations reviews with the regional directors of operations on every month on every center and they were required to be more involved in the oversight of the centers in the areas of quality of care,staffing levels,accounts receivables,workers compensation and agency utilization.at.finally,the committee reasoned that dabertin title and position were the same under the new operating scheme as the old she was a vice president before the merger and remained a vice president after,and the additional title of general manager did not reduce her position within the company.to the contrary,the committee found that dabertin position with manor care was enhanced by the fact that the company was approximately twice as large as it had been before the merger.in short,the committee concluded that if dabertin had lost any duties,responsibility,authority,she had gained far more and was not entitled,therefore,to severance benefits under the plan.
dabertin filed suit in the district court on march,claiming that hcr,the plan,manor care,the committee,and the plan administrator defendants violated erisa by refusing to pay her severance benefits,withholding certain documents related to the plan,and breaching their fiduciary duties to plan participants.in the alternative,she asserted claims for breach of contract and violation of the illinois wage payment and collection act.holding that erisa preempted the state law claims,the district court entered summary judgment for the defendants on those claims as well as the erisa claim that the defendants had wrongfully withheld plan documents.dabertin hcr manor care,d,dabertin i.the district court also held that the committee was not arbitrary and capricious in deciding that any changes in manor care bonus system did not adversely affect dabertin and that manor care had not significantly reduced dabertin employee benefits.id.at.a genuine issue of material fact,however,prevented the district court from determining whether the committee acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it concluded that hcr had not reduced that scope of dabertin duties,responsibilities,authority,title,position and functions.id.at.consequently,the district court held a bench trial to determine the content of the record before the committee and december,that the committee decision was indeed arbitrary and capricious.dabertin hcr manor care,d,dabertin ii.in a separate order entered on march,the court awarded in prejudgment interest,and in attorneys fees and costs.

before addressing the merits,we must resolve the parties dispute over the appropriate standard of review.where an erisa plan gives the plan administrator discretion to interpret the plan terms or determine benefits eligibility,a reviewing court employs the arbitrary and capricious standard.firestone tire rubber bruch,d militello cent.states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund,cir.the district court determined,and neither party disputes on appeal,that the plan at issue here gives such discretion.see dabertin i,d at.consequently,we,like the district court,look only to see whether the committee acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying dabertin benefits see hackett xerox.disability income plan,cir,johnson allsteel,cir,perlman swiss bank.comprehensive disability prot.plan,cir.this standard gives great deference to the decision of a committee which can not be overturned unless the committee decision was a downright unreasonable one.carr v.the gates health care plan,cir.it is not the function of the district court to decide whether it would have reached the same conclusion as the committee id.or to substitute its judgment for the judgment of the committee.smart state farm ins,cir.but even review under this most deferential standard does not amount to a rubber stamp.hackett,at.the committee must articulate a rational connection between the facts found,the issue to be decided,and the choice made.cozzie metro.life ins,cir.where the committee interpretation of the plan defies all common sense,the district court must overturn that decision.see hess hartford life accident ins,cir in some cases,simple common sense will require the court to pronounce an administrator determination arbitrary and capricious.
the facts regarding the changes to dabertin job are largely undisputed they include reduction of her independent capital spending authority from million to zero elimination of her overhead budget development and implementation responsibilities and authority for advertising,public relations,consulting,business meetings,seminars and conventions elimination of her management functions including hiring and firing authority for staff members elimination of independent authority to manage her total budget elimination of management functions and responsibilities in three areas discontinuation of construction project authority,functions and responsibilities in twenty sites in the western division elimination of a host of authority and other responsibilities for building projects and new markets elimination of operational,administrative and strategic authority,position,title,functions,duties or responsibilities for the central division reduction of her overall budget authority,her budgeted revenue,and her budgeted operating profit reduction by half of the number of skilled nursing units and the number of beds under her authority and a halving of the number of direct reports.dabertin ii,d at.it is also undisputed that hcr added new tasks to dabertin plate with the addition of her new duties as a general manager id.at.
the question we face is whether these job alterations amounted to a reduction in the scope of a participant authority,position,title,functions,duties or responsibilities so as to trigger payment of benefits under the plan.the committee determined that the scope of dabertin employment had not changed as she had the same list of duties before and after the merger she just had fewer facilities in which to perform them.at.it also concluded that the additional tasks of general manager added to the scope of her duties.id.under the committee interpretation of the term scope,if dabertin had certain duties,responsibilities,and functions for facilities before the merger,and had the same duties,responsibilities and functions for fifty facilities after the merger,she would not suffer a significant reduction in the scope of her duties,responsibilities or functions.the district court reasonably concluded that this definition of scope defied common sense and was not in accord with the ordinary and popular meaning of the term,and therefore was arbitrary and capricious.id.at.in some cases,simple common sense will require the court to pronounce an administrator determination arbitrary and capricious.hess,at.this is just such a case.
the committee interpretation of a decrease in the scope of duties defies common sense.if hcr had added to each vice president duties a new set of bedpans,delivering meals,and mopping hcr interpretation of the plan,these new duties would not have decreased the scope of the vice president role at all.in fact,the scope of the vice president duties would have increased.after all,they have not lost their title they are still vice presidents,they have just added to that title the additional title of janitor.likewise,they have not lost any of their prior duties they simply have added a few new tasks.common sense dictates otherwise.when the defendants took the central division away from dabertin,they eliminated her authority for the central division,and the additional general manager tasks in no way compensated dabertin for the loss of authority.although the tasks assigned to a general manager are not as low in the corporate pecking order as those of a janitor,they are lower nevertheless.it is not dabertin loss of prestige alone,however,that bolsters our conclusion that hcr significantly reduced dabertin job.there is plenty of other evidence that she suffered a significant reduction in her authority,functions,duties and responsibilities.so much evidence,in fact,that any decision by the committee otherwise would be arbitrary and capricious.
the defendants,of course,must concede that by eliminating her responsibilities for the central division,dabertin lost responsibility for beds,staff,facilities,and projects.they also concede that dabertin did lose some duties,responsibilities,authority,position and functions in the western division as well.combined reply responsive brief of at.they dismisses these as insignificant based on the fact that dabertin did not mention the loss in her initial application for benefits,but raised it for the first time on appeal to the committee,and then buried the claim on the last pages of her page position paper submitted to the committee.we think it unfair to impose a judgment regarding the significance of a loss based on the page number on which the claim appears.likewise,the defendants put too fine a point on the fact that dabertin did not mention a particular loss in her initial application for severance benefits.she had no reason to know that her application for benefits would be so hotly contested and that she might need to load it with every piece of available evidence of job diminution from the.in any case,her page position paper submitted to the committee and her brief before the district court set forth in great detail all of the many ways in which she believed hcr had significantly reduced the scope of her authority,position,title,functions,duties or responsibilities,including the loss of beds,staff,budget dollars,and construction oversight,to name a few.as the district court concluded 
a lay person could reasonably conclude that the phrase scope of a participant authority,position,title,functions,duties or responsibilities when applied to a of operations for the division would mean the common measures of that authority,functions,duties and responsibilities over and involving beds,facilities,employees,budgets,and projects managed or supervised.in the ordinary and popular sense then the number of beds,facilities,projects and direct reports would define the scope or extent of such an employee authority,position,functions,duties or responsibilities.hcr manor care,however,adopted a definition of the term scope that was beyond the ken of a person of average intelligence and experience.
dabertin ii,d at internal citations omitted.
the defendants refer us to collins ralston purina,cir as evidence of this court recognition of the possibility that an employee whose territory is reduced but who gains additional tasks does not necessarily suffer a substantial reduction in duties or authorities.in the first instance,the defendants contort the language and reasoning of collins.the majority in collins did not conclude that collins responsibilities and duties were not significantly reduced,but rather the opinion concluded that collins employer never actually collins duties,nor did it even make an offer to do so.id.at.collins thought he saw the writing on the wall and quit before he could be.in fact,the majority stated,w ithout more we will assume the position offered to collins would have meant a lesser job and fewer responsibilities.id.in any case,the determination of what constitutes a substantial reduction in duties and responsibilities obviously varies greatly based on the specific facts of the particular case and the tasks allotted before and after a job.after considering all of the evidence that the committee had before it,including the functions,duties,and responsibilities dabertin lost,as well as those she gained,we conclude,that under a common sense view of the changes in dabertin job assignments,the committee arbitrarily and capriciously denied her benefits.there simply is no rational connection between the facts the amount of authority,beds,budget,that dabertin lost and the committee conclusion that hcr did not reduce the scope of her job.see cozzie,at the committee must articulate a rational connection between the facts found,the issue to be decided,and the choice made.
this lack of rational connection is certainly enough to allow us to conclude that the committee decision was arbitrary and capricious.in addition,we agree with the district court that the committee imposed new requirements on plan participants that were not part of the plain language of the plan.dabertin ii,d at.an erisa benefit can not be a moving target where the plan administrator continues to add conditions precedent to the award of benefits.see swaback american info.tech,cir it is arbitrary and capricious to impose requirements that are not part of the plain language of the benefit plan cozzie,at an insurance company is bound by the terms of the benefit and although it may interpret the language of the plan,it may not modify it.the district court noted three additional qualifications that the committee added that did not exist in the plain language of the plan 
that if a participant continues to have a full range of operational,financial,administrative and other authority,functions,duties and responsibilities with respect to the business unit the participant manages,the scope of the participant authority,functions and responsibilities would not be affected 
that absent a significant adverse effect on the participant status in the organization,reporting relationships,participation in major decisions,or a significant reduction in the scope of the participant authority,duties,functions or responsibilities with respect to the business unit for which the participant has responsibility,a significant reduction under section i has not occurred and 
the purpose of article i is only to preclude changes that make a participant continued employment degrading or humiliating.
id.at.the district court reasoned that this language imposed requirements beyond those articulated in the plan as the plan does not reference the size of the business unit,there is no plan language requiring a significant adverse effect,or requiring such an effect on a participant status in the organization,reporting relationships or participation in major decisions,and the plan says nothing about whether the changes to the participants job must be degrading or humiliating.id.at.the district court identified these limitations as modifications to the original plan and not merely interpretations of it,and concluded that the addition of the extraneous conditions was arbitrary and capricious.id.we agree with the district court conclusions.
the defendants argue that,in coming to this conclusion the district court conducted a de novo review.we must not,however,misconstrue the district court careful consideration of the facts and proceedings of the committee as de novo review.unlike the district courts in the cases cited by the defendants,the district court here did not evidence see vlass raytheon employees disability trust,cir,did not substitute its own weighing of the conflicting evidence for that of the committee see bolling eli lilly,cir,nor did it simply reject the committee reasonable decision merely because it disagreed with the conclusion see noram energy,cir.what the district court did do was to consider the undisputed facts regarding the diminution of dabertin territory and responsibilities and her added general managerial duties and assess the plain language of the plan to determine whether there was any reasonable basis for the committee conclusion that dabertin had not experienced a significant reduction in the scope of her authority,position,title,functions,duties or responsibilities.and although the district court recognized the vast amount of deference due to the committee,it found that the committee decision lacked any rational connection between the plain meaning of the language of the plan that permits benefits to those who have suffered a significant reduction in the scope of a participant authority,position,title,functions,duties or responsibilities and the committee decision to deny dabertin benefits.
furthermore,because it must have been clear to the district court that it would be unreasonable for the plan administrator to deny the application on any ground,hess,at,the district court did not err by refusing to remand the case to the committee for further reconsideration.also miller united welfare fund,cir no remand necessary where no new evidence could produce a reasonable conclusion permitting a denial of the claim.the defendants state that it is quite likely that the committee could consider additional evidence that would produce a reasonable conclusion permitting denial of dabertin claim,appellants brief at,yet they fail to inform the court what that evidence might be or why the committee did not consider it in the first place.it would be a terribly unfair and inefficient use of judicial resources to continue remanding
