life annuity insurance company appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment reinstating benefits in favor of a class of disabled employee claimants plaintiffs receiving disability benefits under an employee benefit plan provided by the company the plan.plaintiffs,challenging the relief,or lack thereof,awarded them by the district court.although we find that properly amended its plan and gave the requisite notice,there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the welfare benefits at issue were previously vested.accordingly,we reverse the district court and remand that issue for trial.we affirm the district court determination regarding the issue raised in plaintiffs dismissal of plaintiffs request for damages in the nature of certain benefits and cobra overpayments.
background 
generally speaking,until december,provided a package of medical coverages to former employees receiving disability benefits on the same terms as the medical coverages offered active employees.the plan was an employee welfare benefit plan for purposes of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.the menu of medical coverage includes health,vision,dental,and prescription drug benefits,and life insurance coverage.
article v of the plan provides 
amendment of plan.the company reserves the right at any time or times to amend the provisions of the plan to any extent and in any manner that it may deem advisable,by a written instrument signed by an officer of the company provided,however,that no such modification shall divest a participant of benefits under the plan to which he has become entitled prior to the effective date of the amendment.
termination of plan.the company has established the plan with the bona fide intention and expectation that it will be continued indefinitely,but the company has no obligation whatsoever to maintain the plan in whole or in part for any given length of time and may terminate the plan in whole or in part by a written instrument signed by an officer of the company at any time without liability provided,however,that such termination shall not divest a participant of benefits under the plan to which he has become entitled.
we will refer to these sections as the clause.this procedure complies with erisa,which requires that all plans have a procedure for amending the plan,and for identifying the persons who have the authority to amend the plan.b.
in late,decided to cease providing medical coverage to longterm disability claimants.mailed all plan participants a letter advising them of the changes that would become effective january.relies upon this letter as the actual plan amendment,as it is the only document announcing the amendment that is signed by an officer of the company.the letter stated that effective december,medical benefits will no longer be continued for current or future long term disability claimants.further,the letter stated that d ue to the change in the benefit package,your health coverage will terminate december,and you will be offered the option to elect coverage under cobra.the letter did not clearly elucidate that the health,vision,dental and prescription drug benefits would be eliminated,but it did enclose and reference a summary of all plan changes,tools,health plan overviews and a health care resource guide.the enclosed summary plan document spd was entitled summary of benefit plan changes.
plaintiffs sued alleging that its plan amendment and denial of benefits violated the plan and erisa.on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court ruled in plaintiffs favor.the court determined that letter along with the enclosed spd did not validly amend the plan because even though the letter was signed by an officer,the spd was not.nor,according to the court,was it properly incorporated within the amendment,and thus did not satisfy the written instrument requirement of the plan.then,looking at the letter in isolation,the court held that the letter failed to enumerate the benefits that were being eliminated and failed to notify the plan participants of the specific changes to the plan documents.
as to whether plaintiffs had vested rights to welfare benefits for the length of their disability,the court,applied a de novo standard of review.it also permitted the use of extrinsic evidence because it determined that the plan language was ambiguous as to vesting.the court then determined that the benefits were vested.the district court granted summary judgment in plaintiffs favor and ordered that their medical coverage be reinstated.appeals.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the decision to grant summary judgment de novo and will affirm if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we conclude there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.sanders city of minneapolis,cir.in our review,however,we apply the same standard as the district court,which brings us to the first issue we must address what standard do we,the federal courts,apply in reviewing this particular decision hillstrom kenefick,cir.we review de novo the district court determination of the appropriate standard.id.
the usually cursory exercise of articulating a standard of review is complicated in this case because there are varying standards applicable to the different issues presented.we address each in turn.first,we review the process used in carrying out the plan amendment,that is,the way communicated the amendment to plaintiffs.second,we examine articulated amendment and analyze whether it seeks to eliminate already vested benefits.and finally,we address the remedies claimed in the plaintiffs.
carrying out the plan amendment 
the parties disagree about what standard of review to apply.claims that because the plan gave the plan administrator discretion to interpret the plan,the validity of the amendment is subject to an abuse of discretion standard.focuses on the communication of the amendment to plan participants,or the process of amendment.plaintiffs respond that the overall decision to amend the plan in the first place was a task undertaken by as plan sponsor and thus is subject to a de novo standard,focusing on the decision to amend the plan.the fact that the parties approach the standard of review question from different angles confounds the issue only slightly.in the end,both parties make valid arguments.acted as plan sponsor when it sought to amend the plan,but carried out its duties as plan administrator in communicating that decision to plaintiffs.at the bottom line,though,the fighting issue between the parties is whether validly amended the plan.here,we easily reach this bottom line without necessarily deciding the dispute regarding the appropriate standard of review to apply.under either standard,we hold that validly amended the plan.
the sole issue here is whether validly complied with its plan amendment requirements by mailing a letter to plan participants that enclosed and referenced the spd brochure.this act must constitute a written instrument signed by an officer of the company as the plan requires for amendments.there is no dispute of material fact as to how communicated the amendment,only whether the process satisfies the plan requirement,and thus erisa.
the district court,without citation to legal authority,first discussed whether the spd,standing alone,constituted a valid plan amendment.because the spd was not signed by an officer of the company,the district court held it did not.next,the district court held that the letter reference to the spd was insufficient to incorporate the spd into the plan amendment.the district court then turned to the letter itself.the court specifically reviewed the letter and discussed only one statement in it that stated medical benefits will no longer be continued for current or future long term disability claimants.the court analyzed whether the term medical was sufficient to encompass all welfare benefits terminated,including health,dental,vision,and prescription drug benefits.the district court held this language failed to enumerate the benefits being eliminated and failed to notify the plan participants of the specific changes to the plan documents.as such,the court held that the amendment was ineffectively communicated and therefore not binding upon plaintiffs.
we disagree with the district court ultimate conclusion here.first,we note that it could be argued that the letter itself complies with the amendment procedure established in section,without any reference to the spd at all.the letter,signed by an officer of the company,states that d ue to the change in the benefit package,your health coverage will terminate december.the ordinary meaning of health coverage encompasses the health,vision,dental and prescription drug benefits,and life insurance coverage that sought to eliminate,however,focuses its argument on whether the letter plus the attached spd complies with the plan requirements.it claims that the letter plus the attached spd,which does enumerate that a ll medical,dental and vision coverage you are currently enrolled in will terminate december,more than satisfies the plan written instrument requirement.principles of contract law guide our analysis because the signed letter must validly incorporate the unsigned spd in order to satisfy the plan requirements.
in the first paragraph,letter informs that medical benefits will no longer be continued for current or future long term disability claimants.in a separate,paragraph,the letter also states enclosed is a summary of all plan changes,tools,health plan overviews and a health care resource guide.the letter then reiterates that d ue to the change in the benefit package,your health coverage will terminate december.the enclosed spd was entitled summary of benefit plan changes.page two of the spd specifically states that a ll medical,dental and vision coverage you are currently enrolled in will terminate december.
basic contract principles instruct that w here a writing refers to another document,that other document,or the portion to which reference is made,becomes constructively a part of the writing,and in that respect the two form a single instrument.the incorporated matter is to be interpreted as part of the writing.richard lord,williston on contracts ed.and,in a similar context,this court has applied this principle and acknowledged that a writing may incorporate another document if the terms of the incorporated document are known or easily available to the contracting parties.marolt alliant techsystems,cir.here,the spd was easily available.it was attached to the letter and in the same mailing.the letter reference to the spd,then,was sufficient as a legal matter to incorporate the attached spd.reviewing these two documents in harmony,as requests,we find that validly amended the plan by way of a written instrument signed by an officer of the company as the plan requires.accordingly,we reverse the district court decision on this issue.
plaintiffs claim that the welfare benefits at issue were vested at the time made its decision and,as such,violated the plan terms by discontinuing them.a vested right is commonly defined as a right that so completely and definitely belongs to a person that it can not be impaired or taken away without the person consent.black law dictionary ed.
erisa categorizes employment benefits as either welfare benefits or pension benefits.here,the parties agree that the plan in dispute is a welfare benefit plan.while erisa mandates vested pension benefits,congress did not mandate vesting for employee welfare benefit plans,like the health care plan at issue here,schoonejongen,d.therefore,an employer may unilaterally modify or terminate medical benefits at any time absent the employer contractual agreement to the contrary.jensen sipco,cir quotation omitted.it is possible for welfare benefits to vest,however,if a promise to provide vested benefits is incorporated in some fashion into the formal written erisa plan hughes retiree med.plan,cir.whether such benefits are vested,then,is a matter of private contract and our inquiry begins with the written plan documents 
in our de novo review of the plan terms themselves,we give the language its common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person in the position of the plan participant,not the actual participant,would have understood the words to mean.hughes,at quoting chiles ceridian,cir barker ceridian,cir barker i.plaintiffs have the burden of proof on the vesting issue.hutchins,at.
when interpreting erisa plan documents,the supreme court has referred us to,and explicated,the law of trusts 
the terms of trusts created by written instruments are determined by the provisions of the instrument as interpreted in light of all the circumstances and such other evidence of the intention of the settlor with respect to the trust as is not inadmissible.
firestone,at.quoting restatement second of trusts cmt.d.the question of what other evidence is admissible turns on the relative ambiguity of the plan provision being construed 
that intent of the settlor is first sought by careful examination of the trust clause in question,giving the words in that clause their ordinary meanings.if the construction question can not be resolved by reference to the clause alone,the court will examine the entire trust instrument to determine the creator intent and purposes the third step becomes necessary when the intent or meaning of the settlor can not be determined by reference to the provisions of the trust instrument itself.at that point e xtrinsic evidence will be admitted by the court to assist it in determining the meaning and effect of the particular clause.

the district court,considering vesting the key issue,reiterated a previous finding that the plan was ambiguous as it relates to vesting of benefits.because the provided,however language of section of the plan states that no such modification shall divest a participant of benefits under the plan to which he has become entitled prior to the effective date of the amendment,the court held that clearly certain benefits do question the district court found it faced was whether welfare benefits were those sort of benefits.given its ambiguity determination,the court then analyzed all of plaintiffs extrinsic evidence.the court acknowledged that normally an analysis of extrinsic evidence would require a trial on the merits in order to determine the factual dispute regarding whether an employer intended that certain benefits vest,but determined that there was no dispute regarding the extrinsic evidence here.accordingly,the district court felt it was appropriate to resolve this issue on summary judgment.the court ruled in favor of plaintiffs generally based upon the following evidence presented in support of summary judgment testimony of plan representatives stating that the participant becomes entitled to welfare benefits upon a determination of disability statements from plan participants themselves regarding how they interpret the plan language and evidence of interpretation of the plan in letters,handbooks,and the plan itself provisions that the plan provides for the continuation of welfare benefits for the duration of a plan participant disability,or until age or death.this evidence,coupled with the section language that states the clause is inapplicable to those benefits to which a participant has become entitled,formed the basis of the district court determination that these welfare benefits were vested.the court discussed three cases in making its determination jensen,barker i,and barker ceridian,cir barker ii.both jensen and barker ii came to us on appeal following bench trials.
on appeal,plaintiffs claim that jensen,barker i,and barker ii support the proposition that if there is a conflict between a promise of benefits for a specified duration and a clause,an ambiguity exists that must be resolved through extrinsic evidence.jensen,at barker i,at barker ii,at.they claim that just such an ambiguity exists here between the language of section and the spd language concerning the duration of disability benefits.
jensen,barker i,and barker ii each turned to extrinsic evidence to determine whether particular welfare benefits were vested.jensen reviewed medical benefits under two medical benefit plans for salaried pensioners.at.the district court and the appellate court determined the benefits at issue in jensen were vested.id.the jensen plans did contain clauses that gave the board of directors the power to alter,amend or annul any of the provisions in the plan.id.at.the jensen plaintiffs pointed out,however,that the applicable spd did not disclose that the company could amend or terminate retiree medical benefits.id.at.the termination of coverage clause in the spd promised benefits until the retiree dies,or a spouse divorces,or a child marries or reaches the age of.id.at.the court,seeing a conflict in the two documents,recognized that a provision is inconsistent with,and in most cases would defeat,a claim of vested benefits.id.at.even so,the appellate panel held that the provisions were ambiguous in jensen because it was not clear whether the right to change or terminate benefits only applied to those participants covered by the plan but not yet retired or whether it also included already retired pensioners.id.the plaintiffs in jensen presented a wealth of overwhelming extrinsic evidence supporting their contention that the company intended that the medical benefits would vest upon retirement and the panel agreed.id.at.this evidence included testimony of multiple former executive management employees regarding the company contemporaneous intent to vest at the time the relevant plans were adopted and the company persistent interpretation of the plan as providing vested benefits.id.
the barker cases likewise found particular language in a clause time in the context of discussing whether certain disability benefits were vested,or not.barker i,at.like jensen,the plan in barker provided a welfare benefit until a person was no longer eligible for the plan,yet retained the right to amend or terminate the plan.id.at.again,we were unable to discern whether the clause preserved the right to amend the plan only as to those who would become entitled to the benefits in the future,or also as to those already on disability.id.at.on remand from the barker i determination of ambiguity,the district court then reviewed the extrinsic evidence concerning the company intent to vest,which also found its way to our court.barker ii,at.here,too,the class of plaintiffs provided a wealth of extrinsic evidence in support of their claim of vesting including,for example,testimony of plan participants,testimony that employer representatives had told participants they could not lose the benefits once they were disabled,testimony from former management employees regarding their understanding that the intent was to vest and that they explained it as such to employees,and testimony from the employee in charge of preparing the employee welfare plan regarding the contemporaneous intent of the plan sponsor at the time the language was implemented.id.at.this evidence supported a determination that the plan sponsor,indeed,intended to vest the welfare benefits at issue.id.at.
disagrees with plaintiffs reliance on jensen,barker i,and barker ii.claims the plan language is unambiguous and relies primarily upon our decision in howe varity,cir howe i as an example of similar unambiguous language in a plan clause.goes on to argue that even if the panel finds ambiguity in this plan language,questions of material fact remain as to the sufficiency of plaintiffs extrinsic evidence concerning the company alleged intent to vest.howe i was an appeal from the grant of a preliminary injunction requiring the employer to reinstate portions of a terminated employee welfare benefit plan.id.at.we reversed.id.at.in howe i,the court reviewed language in a clause that stated that the company reserved the right to amend or terminate the plan at any time.the clause also stated that h owever,the right to amend or terminate the plan shall not,in any way,affect an employee right to claim benefits,diminish,or eliminate any claims for benefits under the provisions of the plan to which the employee shall have become entitled prior to the exercise of the company right,through its board,to terminate or amend.id.at.we disagreed with the district court that the shall have become entitled language constituted explicit vesting language securing retirement benefits for employees.id.at.in doing so,we reviewed the entire trust document and reiterated that an employer promise to future retirees that benefits will continue could not be read as a promise of vested lifetime benefits in the face of a termination clause.id.quoting degeare alpha portland,cir.t he mere fact that employee welfare benefits continue in retirement does not indicate that the benefits become vested for life at the moment of retirement.id.at.as such,we held that the district court erred in granting a preliminary injunction in favor of the employees on their vesting claim.id.at and,because we found the language unambiguous,we further held the district court erred in reviewing extrinsic evidence.id.
turning first to the words of the plan and determining whether any ambiguities abound,we focus our inquiry on the plan.stated again,section of the plan provides 
amendment of plan.the company reserves the right at any time or times to amend the provisions of the plan to any extent and in any manner that it may deem advisable,by a written instrument signed by an officer of the company provided,however,that no such modification shall divest a participant of benefits under the plan to which he has become entitled prior to the effective date of the amendment.
here,we agree with the district court that the plan language is ambiguous as it relates to intent to vest.the instant situation is more akin to that discussed in jensen and barker i ii where the language in the clause in the plan is on its own or when juxtaposed with the durational language contained in the spd.examining only section as the edicts of trust law dictates,we are unable to say that its language is so unambiguous as to make unnecessary any reference to other plan provisions and extrinsic evidence.the clause in the plan is not facially unambiguous.the provided,however language either refers to pipeline claims as argues,or it refers to the exclusion of certain,already vested,can not say which for certain.this is not the sort of unambiguous clause we have previously found to defeat a claim that welfare plan benefits are vested.see stearns ncr,cir reviewing a clause that merely stated t he company reserves the right to change or cancel the plan,or any benefits under the plan,at any time hughes,at,reviewing a clause that stated that t he company fully intends to continue this plan indefinitely,but reserves the right to change or discontinue it if necessary,and that coverage will stop if discontinues the plan.
given this ambiguity,we follow the dictates of trust law and expand our review to examine the entire trust document itself to determine the settlor intent.this is where our review distinguishes itself from howe although the spd reiterates the section language that may change,amend or terminate at its discretion,and further sets out that coverage will end on the date terminates the benefits described in the spd,it also states that in the case of ineligibility,i f your service ends due to illness and you have been approved for ltd benefits,coverage will continue during the course of the total disability,and in the section entitled how long will my benefits continue,it states 
your benefits will continue until the earliest of these dates 
the date you are no longer totally disabled 
the date you fail to give proof of your total disability as required 
the last day of the calendar month in which the maximum benefit period ends or 
the date of your retirement.
at best,this language is ambiguous.unlike howe i,where we held that statements that welfare benefits continue in retirement in the plan documents did not pinpoint retirement as a vesting trigger,at,the alleged vesting language here between the plan and the spds is more akin to the clarity,or lack thereof,we discussed in barker i,at.
