these consolidated appeals and involve disputes under the employee retirement income security act erisa regarding a plan amendment and the amount of retirement benefits awarded to edward sunder and louis jarodsky,both of whom were participants in a pension plan sponsored by their employer and now known as the bank pension plan usbpp in a summary judgment ruling,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs age discrimination claim.following a bench trial,the district court awarded damages to sunder and jarodsky on the ground that the conversion of the plan into a cash balance system decreased their accrued benefits in violation of section g of erisa,see g.usbpp appeals the award of damages,and sunder and jarodsky cross appeal the district court determination of the date of the plan conversion and the adverse ruling on their erisa age discrimination claim.we reverse the award of damages but affirm on the cross appeal.
sunder and jarodsky each worked at mercantile bank in louis,missouri.sunder retired at age after a career making investments,and jarodsky retired at age after working years in investment management.both retired in august of,by which time mercantile bank had merged with firstar,which in turn had become.
during their employment,sunder and jarodsky each accrued benefits toward a pension under the mercantile bancorporation.retirement plan,now merged into and known as usbpp.the plan was amended and converted into a cash balance system prior to their retirements.for the sake of clarity,we will refer to the original plan as the mercantile plan,and the amended plan after the conversion as the cash balance plan.
the mercantile plan was a fixed income defined benefit plan set up to provide employees with a fixed monthly annuity at retirement based on each employee years of service and income level.under erisa,a defined benefit plan means a pension plan other than an individual account plan.typically,a defined benefit plan consists of a general pool of assets rather than individual dedicated accounts from which the employee,upon retirement,is entitled to a fixed periodic payment.hughes aircraft jacobson,d internal marks omitted.
in,the plan participants received a notice that the mercantile plan was converting to a cash balance system.by way of background,at the time of the plan conversion,and at the time sunder and jarodsky received their benefits in october of,no erisa provisions or rules dealt expressly with a cash balance plan a cash balance plan is a relatively new form of plan intended to combine attributes of both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.hirt,at.it is typically designed to pay out a that accrues in a hypothetical account from a combination of the employer hypothetical contribution,generally expressed as annual credits valued by the employee salary and years of service,and hypothetical earnings or interest credits based on a rate specified in the plan and generally guaranteed at either a fixed or variable rate linked to an index such as a treasury bill rate.id.internal marks omitted see also register pnc fin.servs.group,cir campbell bankboston,cir.cash balance plans create a benefit structure that simulates that of defined contribution plans because the employer makes contributions for recordkeeping purposes,but the employer does not deposit funds into an actual individual account,and the employer continues to bear the market risks by guaranteeing specific earning credits and a specified level of interest.hirt,at campbell,at.because a cash balance plan is not an individually invested account,and no erisa rules explicitly governed cash balance plans at the relevant time,the cash balance plan was by default a defined benefit plan subject to compliance with the erisa rules governing defined benefit plans.hurlic cal.gas,cir c ash balance plans are defined benefit plans.
the notice sent to sunder and jarodsky stated that depending on various factors,the change to a cash balance system could result in future benefits being earned at a rate that is greater than,the same as,or less than what they would have earned if they had continued to accrue benefits under the mercantile plan the new cash balance plan would begin with an opening balance that would include the value of the benefits you earned under the old plan.at.participants were informed that each year,the cash balance would increase by a credit equal to a given percentage of the employee pay and an interest credit.consistent with section g of erisa,which prohibits plan amendments that decrease an accrued benefit,g,the notice promised that the total benefit earned under the mercantile plan through december,was guaranteed your opening balance will be at least as much as the value of your benefit earned under the old plan.at.additionally,the notice promised that certain early retirement subsidies would be included in the opening cash balance for employees age through age,and additional transition credits would be added to the opening balance for employees age to.id.the cash balance plan provided participants the advantage of knowing how much they had accumulated toward retirement at any given time and permitted participants to elect to take their cash balance upon retirement as a lump sum or an equivalent monthly annuity.
sunder and jarodsky both elected to retire prior to reaching normal retirement age,and both elected to receive their benefit in a lump sum.when a plan participant opts to cash out a cash balance account before reaching the normal retirement age,as in this case,erisa requires that the payment must be the actuarial equivalent of the normal accrued pension benefit.west,at.at the time sunder and jarodsky retired,which was before the enactment of the pension protection act of,determining the actuarial equivalent,or present value,of the benefit was a process called a whipsaw calculation,requiring the plan administrator to project the hypothetical account balance forward to age using the rate of future interest credits that would have accrued under the plan if the participant had remained in the plan to that time,and discount that amount back to its present value on the date of the actual distribution using the internal revenue code irc statutory discount rate,which is tied to the treasury bond,e a i ii.west,at.this prevented an impermissible forfeiture of erisa benefits that might otherwise occur if the plan projection rate exceeds the statutory discount rate,then the present value of the accrued benefit will exceed the participant cash account balance,and the highest figure between the whipsaw calculation and the cash balance must be paid esden bank of boston,cir,cert.dismissed,d.
the cash balance plan required usbpp to determine the actuarial present value of the participants retirement benefits through a whipsaw calculation but also provided that the participant would receive the greatest of three separate calculations the amount accrued under the mercantile plan as of december,using the irc e discount rate,the cash balance in the account,or the actuarial equivalent of the cash balance the whipsaw calculation.usbpp compared these three calculations and paid sunder and jarodsky the highest of the three,which in each case was the final cash balance in their accounts.sunder received,and jarodsky received.sunder and jarodsky questioned the accuracy of these amounts after discovering that the irc e discount rate had not been used to calculate their opening cash balances.instead,the cash balance plan terms had required the opening cash balance to be set using a higher discount rate prescribed in its appendix the statutory rate at the time was just over.sunder and jarodsky knew that using a lower discount rate would have produced a larger opening balance and,consequently,a higher ending cash balance.
sunder and jarodsky brought suit against usbpp,alleging that the use of the higher discount rate to set their opening cash balances was contrary to erisa because it divested them of vested rights in the mercantile plan,see g,and resulted in a decreased at payout.they also claimed that cash balance systems in general violate erisa discrimination provision,arguing that the benefits provided under such a plan accrue at a rate that is reduced on account of age.see b h i.
the district court initially granted summary judgment to usbpp,except on the issue of whether the proper interest rate was used in calculating the distribution.the district court concluded that the discount rate of appendix a used to determine the opening cash balance was not unreasonably high and did not violate erisa.specifically,the district court held that erisa does not prescribe a discount rate for determining the present value of an opening cash balance and that erisa only prevents a plan amendment from decreasing accrued benefits,not future benefits.the district court also rejected their assertion that the cash balance system varies the rate of benefit accrual on the basis of age.
at the bench trial on the remaining issue of whether the proper interest rate was used in calculating their distributions,eric tepen,the plan administrator,first testified about how he calculated the opening balances.he said that he used the discount rate and the actuarial assumptions provided in appendix a and then added additional retirement subsidies in arriving at each participant opening cash balance.tepen testified that sunder and jarodsky opening cash balances were higher than the actuarial equivalent of their accrued mercantile plan benefit as of december,calculated using the irc e discount rate tepen then testified that to determine the distributions due to sunder and jarodsky at the time of their early retirement,the cash balance plan required him to compare and pay the largest of three different computations the cash balance at the time of retirement,the value of the accrued benefits under the mercantile plan as of december,using the irc discount rate,and the whipsaw calculation,rolling the cash balance forward to the normal retirement age of and then discounting it back to today dollars using the irc rate as prescribed in e.at.tepen testified that sunder accrued benefit under the mercantile plan was id.at,the whipsaw calculation yielded id.at and the final cash balance of,the largest of the three calculations,was paid to sunder id.at.tepen testified that jarodsky accrued benefit under the mercantile plan was id.at,his whipsaw calculation yielded id.at,and the final cash balance,the amount jarodsky received,was the greater amount of id.
a consulting actuarial expert,lawrence sher,prepared a report discussing cash balance plans in general as well as the formula used in this case for setting the opening balance.he stated that most commonly,an opening balance is set by determining the present value of the individual accrued benefit under the prior plan at the date of conversion,but how that present value is determined varies significantly among employers.id.at.in his experience,a rate close to the treasury bond rate which was near in is most often used to determine the present value for purposes of setting the opening balance.he knew of no legal restrictions governing what discount rates a plan sponsor must use when establishing an opening cash balance.sher explained that in this case,the actuarial assumptions provided in appendix a were more favorable than is common in setting an opening balance and that very generous early retirement subsidies were included in the opening balance.id.at.in his opinion,sunder and jarodsky opening balances would have been considerably less if calculated under the more commonly used assumptions.id.at.
because it became clear at the bench trial that usbpp had used the correct irc statutory discount rate to calculate the final distributions,sunder and jarodsky urged the district court to revisit the summary judgment conclusion that using the discount rate of appendix a to calculate the opening balances did not violate erisa.sunder and jarodsky presented evidence that their final distribution would have been greater if usbpp had used the irc e discount rate in the opening balance calculation.the district court agreed to revisit the opening balance issue and reversed its summary judgment ruling.the court concluded that the use of the higher discount rate decreased accrued benefits in violation of erisa and the terms of the plan.the district court denied usbpp motion to amend the judgment and ultimately ordered usbpp to pay damages in the amount of plus prejudgment interest to sunder,and plus prejudgment interest to jarodsky.
on appeal,usbpp argues that the district court erred in finding an erisa violation in its calculation of the opening cash balances.sunder and jarodsky cross appeal,challenging the district court determination of the date of the plan conversion,the corresponding determination of which statutory discount rate applied,and the denial of their erisa age discrimination claims.
the main issue in this appeal is whether usbpp was required to apply the irc e discount rate in calculating the opening cash balances in order to prevent a decrease of accrued benefits in the mercantile plan,in violation of erisa,g,or the plan terms.the district court determined,and it is not disputed on appeal,that usbpp properly calculated the final distributions using the irc e discount rate.however,if the opening cash balances were improperly calculated,as the district court concluded,then that miscalculation necessarily affected the calculation of sunder and jarodsky final distribution.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that neither erisa nor the terms of the plan precluded usbpp from calculating the opening cash balances using the discount rate of appendix 
we apply de novo review to issues involving the interpretation of erisa.calhoon trans world airlines,cir.section g of erisa provides that t he accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan.g.as the district court noted in its summary judgment ruling,erisa does not prohibit modifying or eliminating expected future benefits.see campbell,at benefits already earned under an old plan may not be taken away,but benefits expected but not yet accrued are not similarly protected.internal citations omitted.thus,only the benefits accrued in the mercantile plan as of the date of the plan amendment december,are protected from being decreased by the amendment.
sunder and jarodsky argue that in order to protect their accrued benefits,the opening cash balance should have been calculated using the irc statutory discount rate,which would have yielded a higher opening balance and consequently a higher final payout.the district court final ruling agreed with that reasoning,but we respectfully disagree because section g protected only the benefits accrued under the mercantile plan as of december.the opening balance calculation included additional factors,such as early retirement subsidies and more favorable mortality tables,that were not part of the accrued benefits under the mercantile plan,so applying the irc discount rate to that calculation not only would have prevented a decrease in accrued benefits but also would have given sunder and jarodsky a windfall that erisa did not require.at the time of the plan conversion to a cash balance system in,there was no erisa provision governing the creation of an opening cash balance absent such a provision,usbpp was free to set the opening cash balance as it wished,as long as the calculation did not decrease already accrued benefits in the original plan.because the cash balance plan preserved the amount of the accrued mercantile plan benefit as of december,by guaranteeing that a participant final distribution in the cash balance plan shall not be less than the accrued benefit in the mercantile plan appellant add.at,the plan conversion and opening balance in the new plan did not decrease accrued benefits,regardless of how the opening balance was calculated.
as additional support for our conclusion,we note that prior to the pension protection act of,courts had interpreted erisa to permit a provision in which a plan amendment was allowed to freeze the accrued benefits and not permit any additional accumulation of benefits until the new cash balance exceeded the benefits under the old plan.
