for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court grant of defendants motion for summary judgment.
ii.factual background 
plaintiffs frank wright,john goff and carl krantz are trustees of the wright,goff,krantz,harmon jones,profit sharing plan the retirement plan.they are physicians who practiced together as a professional corporation known as wright,goff,krantz,from the late until when goff retired 
shortly after the corporation was formed,it created a retirement plan.wright and krantz have been trustees of the plan since its inception,and goff was a trustee of the plan from the time the plan was created until his retirement from the practice of medicine in.
the plan included a general account,as well as individual accounts for those participants who wanted them.plaintiffs were all participants in the plan,and each had a account under the plan.while wright,goff,and krantz,as trustees,were responsible for directing transactions in the plan general account,goff played the most active role in directing those transactions.with respect to the accounts,each individual was responsible for the direction of his own account.
prior to late,plaintiffs utilized the services of professional investment management to help them invest the assets of the plan general account.wright,goff and krantz also each used the services of professional investment management to help them with investments in their respective accounts.
plaintiffs terminated the services of professional investment management in late,and shortly thereafter,hired defendant michael heyne to provide investment advice and services to the plan with respect to the general account.each individual also retained heyne to provide investment advice and services for his account.
plaintiffs were also aware that heyne was affiliated with,and had an ownership interest in,vestax.in december,the plan and each of the individual plaintiffs also entered into a vestrak investment analysis service agreement with vestax,under which vestax was to provide quarterly investment analysis reports to the plan with respect to the general account,as well as to plaintiffs with respect to each of their respective accounts.these reports included a list of each investment made,the date and cost of each investment,the proceeds received from the sale of each investment,the current market value of each investment and the earnings of each investment.the vestrak agreements disclosed that vestax would earn fees for the services it would provide and the amount of the fees that would be earned.the agreements further disclosed that vestax could earn commissions on the purchase or sale of certain securities 
client understands that if he as a purchaser of the vestrak investment analysis service uses the services of vestax in connection with the sale or purchase of a security that is the object of the vestrak investment analysis service,then vestax may act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person in undertaking such sale or purchase and may be paid a commission on such sale or purchase.client hereby consents to the payment of such commission to vestax.
also in december,the plan and wright,goff,and krantz,individually with respect to their accounts,entered into a soliciting agent agreement with heyne.the soliciting agent agreements disclosed that heyne solicited clients to enter into vestrak agreements with vestax,that heyne was an officer and stockholder of vestax,that heyne could receive a portion of the fees that a client would pay to vestax,that vestax would receive commissions or other compensation if financial service products or investments are purchased through vestax and that heyne would receive a portion of such commissions if such sales are arranged through heyne and he is a registered representative of vestax.see ja.
pursuant to the vestrak agreements,quarterly investment analysis reports were provided to the plan and to wright,goff and krantz,individually,for their respective accounts.heyne also usually met with plaintiffs on a quarterly basis to discuss the reports as well as to answer any questions plaintiffs had about the investments and other information reflected in the reports.
in or,approximately three or four years after the plan relationship with heyne and vestax began,goff began to feel some dissatisfaction with heyne.the dissatisfaction stemmed from goff learning that heyne was an officer of afa financial,an entity with which the plan and wright,goff and krantz on behalf of their own respective accounts had placed money for management.goff considered heyne affiliation with afa financial to be a conflict of interest and he instructed heyne to take his money out of afa,which heyne did.goff was also concerned that the general account and his own account were not meeting his financial objectives and that the fees and commissions that heyne was earning was driving the choice of investment as opposed to the appropriateness of the investment.ja.
during and,krantz likewise began to become dissatisfied with heyne services.like goff,krantz was concerned with heyne affiliation with afa financial,heyne failure to follow investment objectives,and the fees and commissions paid to heyne.
sometime in,goff asked philip shaffer of the consulting group at smith barney shearson to review the performance of the general account and his own account.shaffer informed goff that the investments in his portfolio were driven by fees and commissions and were not proper.ja.shaffer also informed goff that heyne had deviated from the investment plans for the plaintiffs accounts.ja.
later in or early,goff also asked denny dicky of berwanger overmeyer to review the plan investments and performance.dicky informed goff that after reviewing the plan investments,he could sleep at night.ja dicky also made statements of the same tenor as shaffer comments.id.
in,wright asked his brother,tom wright who had experience managing his own investments and later registered as an investment advisor,to review his account.in june,tom wright advised his brother to get away from heyne,vestax,and afa financial.ja tom wright further advised his brother that he had received bad investment advice from heyne,should not purchase any more limited partnerships,and should not annuitize any more of the annuities.ja.tom wright also concluded that heyne had been paid excessive compensation for his services.ja.
then,in early,goff asked william cseplo of mcdonald company to review his account.in a letter dated march,cseplo specifically stated that he was terribly disturbed at the failure of this investment advisor to implement your written desires and the thought that he would place his interests commissions before your interests.i have never seen such gross neglect of ethics with regards to this portfolio ja.the letter went on to state 
if you feel as if you have been wronged by what has occurred in this portfolio,i would suggest you could probably seek legal action.i believe you have some basis.michael heyne invested your money in high yield bonds that you specifically told him not to buy.he annuitized an annuity and,in my opinion,had no reason to do so i would seek full restitution for the transactions that were not in your specific written directions and the annuity transactions that make no sense at all 
on march,just a few weeks after receiving cseplo conclusions with respect to his review of goff account,goff terminated his relationship with heyne and vestax and transferred his account to cseplo.
in april,plaintiff krantz asked cseplo to review his account.on april,cseplo informed krantz in writing that,although krantz had instructed heyne not to purchase high yield junk bond portfolios,heyne began the account in with a purchase of the very thing you did not want to own ja.on may,based on cseplo conclusions,krantz terminated his relationship with heyne and vestax with respect to his account and engaged cseplo to manage the account.
on july,the plan informed heyne that it,too,was terminating its relationship with heyne and vestax with respect to the general account and on august,the plan general account was transferred to cseplo.
on september,wright terminated his relationship with heyne and vestax with respect to his account.
on february,plaintiffs retained the services of an attorney,tony merry.in late,after further analysis by cseplo,in which cseplo advised at least goff and krantz that the plan had suffered monetary losses at the hands of heyne and vestax,merry advised plaintiffs that they had valid erisa claims arising out of heyne alleged breach of fiduciary duties.merry specifically advised plaintiffs that some of heyne investments had created a conflict with organizations in which heyne and vestax had personal interests,and that heyne had been paid excessive compensation.
on october,plaintiffs filed the instant action.in their complaint,plaintiffs alleged that heyne and vestax acted in breach of their fiduciary duties in violation of erisa,a,and engaged in conduct prohibited by a,b.
pursuant to c and.c,the parties consented to the jurisdiction of a united states magistrate judge and further consented that an appeal from the magistrate judge judgment would be directly to the court of appeals for the sixth circuit.ja.
iii.the district court decision 
on july,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that because the action had been commenced more than three years after the plaintiffs acquired actual knowledge of the defendants alleged breach of duty,the claims of the plaintiffs were barred by the statute of limitations provided in.the text of is set forth in footnote,infra.on november,the district court issued an opinion and order and judgment agreeing with defendants that plaintiffs complaint was.
in reaching its conclusion,the district court relied on several previous decisions of this court.while noting that this circuit has yet to articulate in any published decision a broad definition of actual knowledge for purposes of erisa limitations of actions provision,the district court also noted that the sixth circuit has examined numerous cases involving the question of whether a plaintiff had actual knowledge under.specifically,the district court stated 
t o charge an erisa plaintiff with actual knowledge of an erisa violation,it is not enough that he had notice that something was awry he must have had specific knowledge of the actual breach of duty upon which he sues s ection a a sic means only that once the plaintiff learns of the facts that support his allegation of illegality,he has no more than three years in which to bring his suit.
ja quoting rogers millan,wl at cir unpublished decision text available on westlaw emphasis added by district court.
relying on the information provided to plaintiffs by various investment advisors in and,the district court reached the conclusion that plaintiffs had actual knowledge under more than three years prior to filing their claim in october.specifically,the district court concluded that 
the record in this action does not portray investors or trustees who,prior to the fall of,merely had general concerns for their investments,which every investor should have.rather,each of the three trustees had been advised by any number of financial experts,by,that defendants had engaged in inappropriate and unauthorized investments,under circumstances that conflicted with the interests of the plan and its participants.
ja citation omitted.
the district court also rejected plaintiffs argument that it was not until the fall of,when william cseplo informed them that appellee conduct had worked to the financial detriment of the plan,that plaintiffs had the requisite actual knowledge.the district court determined that erisa statute of limitations will apply when the plaintiff has actual knowledge of the facts that give rise to the claims upon which it sues it can not wait until the consequences of the act become painful.ja citing ternes,wl at cir unpublished decision text available on westlaw.therefore,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had actual knowledge by at least september and their claim was,therefore,barred by of erisa.
iv.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.pinney dock transport penn cent,cir,cert.denied,d.in conducting this review,the court determines,in the light most favorable to the party,whether any issue of material fact existed in the record below.celotex catrett,d.
erisa statute of limitations 
under erisa,when a fiduciary breaches an obligation or duty,the victim of the breach normally has six years in which to file suit.however,this period may be shortened to three years where the victim had actual knowledge of the breach or violation.
the district court found that plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the breach or violation by at least september.it is clear from the record below that if plaintiffs did not have actual knowledge,their claim was filed within the requisite period provided in.therefore,the ultimate question presented here is whether plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the breach or violation more than three years prior to the initiation of this action on october.
the actual knowledge requirement 
the basic erisa limitation period of six years begins on the date of the breach or violation.however,a plaintiff with actual knowledge of a breach of erisa fiduciary duties must file suit within three years.tassinare american ins,cir.
as the district court observed,the sixth circuit has yet to articulate a broad definition of actual knowledge under.however,other circuits have examined the issue of what constitutes actual knowledge under,and differing views of the definition have emerged.
plaintiffs urge the court to apply the standard articulated by the third circuit in gluck unisys,cir,which was subsequently adopted and applied by the fifth circuit in reich lancaster,cir and maher strachan shipping,cir.
in gluck,the third circuit held that a ctual knowledge of a breach or violation requires that a plaintiff have actual knowledge of all material facts necessary to understand that some claim exists,which facts could include necessary opinions of experts,knowledge of a transaction harmful consequences,or even actual harm.id.at.the third circuit elaborated upon its formula in international union murata erie north america,cir,stating that actual knowledge requires a showing that plaintiffs actually knew not only of the events that occurred which constitute the breach or violation but also that those events supported a claim for breach of fiduciary duty or violation under erisa.id.at.
however,as indicated above,courts are divided on the issue of what constitutes actual knowledge under.the third circuit position represents one view.other circuits which have examined section actual knowledge,the seventh,ninth and eleventh held that actual knowledge requires only knowledge of all the relevant facts,not that the facts establish a cognizable legal claim under erisa.see martin consultants administrators,cir t he relevant knowledge for triggering the statute of limitations is knowledge of the facts or transaction that constituted the alleged violation.consequently,it is not necessary for a potential plaintiff to have knowledge of every last detail of a transaction,or knowledge of its illegality.emphasis in original rush martin petersen,cir we have defined actual knowledge as knowledge of the essential facts of the transaction or conduct constituting the violation,and have explained that this means
