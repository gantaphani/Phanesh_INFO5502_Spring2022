we would ask that you agree that has no subrogation claim against any monies which are allocated for receipt by hollander statutory beneficiaries as a result of their wrongful death claim,and that rightful interest in this case lies against the assets of the estate of patrick hollander which include the fund allocated as a result of the survival action which we have maintained on his behalf.
on january,in a letter addressed to todd attorney and carbon copied to diggs,the plan agreed to accept the from settlement i,but stated that t he plan will pursue the remainder of its subrogation interest from future settlements received by the hollander estate.at.
on march,diggs sent the plan administrator a check from his trust account in the amount of.the check was accepted and the funds applied toward reimbursement,leaving an outstanding balance of.
thereafter,diggs continued his efforts to obtain settlements or judgments against the other defendants to the tort action.the plan administrator requested and received periodic updates from diggs as to the status of the proceedings to collect from third parties.
on march,diggs wrote the plan administrator and explained that because hollander never regained consciousness we were not able to develop any evidence to warrant payment to him in a survival action for pain and suffering.the settlement the estate has agreed to is structured and will pay hollander daughter payments throughout her life settlement ii.at.diggs offered to pay the plan from settlement ii toward the outstanding medical expenses.
on april,the plan administrator responded and refused the 
please be advised the additional making a total of settlement you offered in your letter is not acceptable.the plan requires reimbursement from any settlement 
referring to the previous telephone conversations and letters between the plan administrator and diggs,i see that the plan agreed not to pursue reimbursement from settlement i.it was agreed that reimbursement would be made once settlement was obtained from the other parties involved in this tragic accident.
please forward a check for the full amount due the plan as previously agreed.please be advised the plan requires reimbursement from any settlement,including whether or not the settlement was designated as a wrongful death settlement or otherwise.
on april,diggs replied,informing the plan administrator that settlement ii had not yet been approved by the court and stating 
i n order to obtain court approval of the settlement,and thus the payment of to your plan,please provide me with the language in your plan which requires reimbursement to you under the circumstances of the instant case.i will need this language in order to present it to the court for approval.please understand that we acknowledge that the law of this circuit supports the position you have taken in your letter of april.see united mcgill stinnett,cir.
on april,the plan administrator faxed a written response and attached a copy of the relevant language from the plan in effect in and the version that became effective on january,the letter stated that the plan specifically requires reimbursement from any settlement and no reduction for attorneys fees.at.
the plan administrator received no response from diggs.on october,the plan administrator sent diggs a request for a status update 
it has just come to my attention that i have not heard from you since your letter dated april,at which time you requested a copy of our plan language in order to obtain court approval of the settlement and payment of the plan reimbursement interest.please advise what is the status of settlement settlement disbursement.
on october,diggs answered the inquiry,indicating that as a result of plan administrator assertions and reliance on united mcgill,which did not involve a wrongful death claim,diggs was led to believe that case law required reimbursement to the plan.however,diggs stated,
a more complete review of the case law from the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit shows that has misrepresented the legality and breadth of its subrogation interest,at least in its scope,as applicable to this case,which is a wrongful death case.
at.diggs also requested an explanation as to why was entitled to the previous received from settlement i was never entitled to claim an interest in wrongful death proceeds generated in favor of hollander daughter,including the previously paid to you.at.
diggs and the plan administrator exchanged a few more letters,requests for information,and requests for status updates.on november,diggs indicated by letter that w e have entered into a structured settlement for hollander daughter.a sufficient amount of funds were held in trust to satisfy subrogation claim.at.the plan administrator response letter cited mcinnis provident life accident ins,cir,which held that north carolina wrongful death statute was preempted by erisa,and indicated i trust you will be forwarding reimbursement to my attention in the very near future.at.
on may,the state court entered an order approving settlement ii.the court authorized the personal representative to accept now and future periodic payments in the name of kristen hollander with a guaranteed value of,with expected benefits totaling as settlement in full of any and all liability for any claims,liens,causes of action,settlements,judgments or the like that said personal representative of the estate of patrick hollander has or might have against the defendants to the tort action.at.
on november,diggs notified the plan administrator that he felt misled as to the law applicable to the committee claim for reimbursement.diggs claimed that in hollander case,there was no evidence of any conscious pain and suffering and therefore,no evidence to support a survival claim.at.furthermore,diggs stated,
i n hollander case,the damage claim at issue was the wrongful death settlement proceeds belonging to hollander daughter,not hollander or his estate.under such circumstances,the law in this circuit provides that we are not responsible for the payment of subrogation claim.
moreover,consistent with the foregoing,it appears that the previously paid to should be refunded.please make plans to do so.
on november,the plan administrator responded that it would continue to insist on reimbursement based on the clear,plain reimbursement provision of the plan and in accordance with fourth circuit case law.at.furthermore,the plan administrator indicated that failure to forward the amount due would result in legal action.
on february,the plan administrator,by letter,informed diggs that the committee had decided to pursue the reimbursement from settlement ii in accordance with the plan language.this letter indicated that the file was turned over to the legal department.
on march,the plan filed a complaint in the district court,alleging a claim for equitable relief under erisa,a b.specifically,the plan,as a fiduciary,sought restitution and imposition of a constructive trust on the proceeds of settlement ii.the district court held the plan claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and even assuming,arguendo,the claims were not barred,the claims were meritless.this appeal follows.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standards as the district court.eckelkamp beste,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is only appropriate when,viewing the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c bennett federated mut.ins,cir citations omitted.
despite the committee many arguments on appeal,the dispositive issue is whether the committee claim is time barred.we answer this question in the affirmative and,therefore,do not address the committee other arguments.
because erisa does not contain a statute of limitations,the court borrow s the most analogous state statute of limitations.duchek blue cross blue shield of dist.of,cir citation omitted.t he characterization of plaintiff claim for statute of limitations purposes is a question of federal law.johnson state mut.life assurance of,cir citations omitted.federal law also determines when the cause of action accrues.bennett,at citations omitted.
the committee argues that the district court erred in applying arkansas code annotated section a statute of limitations,because this action is most properly characterized as a breach of written contract action to which arkansas code annotated section a statute of limitations,should apply.we need not decide which statute of limitations applies because under either the statute of limitations,the committee claim is barred because more than five years have passed since this cause of action accrued.
this action was filed on march,thus,the committee claim is barred under either statute if it accrued prior to march.the committee argues that the date on which the claim accrued was april,the date it became aware of settlement ii.we disagree.
generally,this court applies the discovery rule to determine when a claim accrues.union pacific beckham,cir holding that absent a contrary mandate from congress,the discovery rule determines when a cause of action accrues in a federal question case.the discovery rule provides that a plaintiff cause of action accrues when he discovers,or with due diligence should have discovered,the injury that is the basis of the litigation.id.citations omitted.
diggs notified the plan administrator in writing,on january,that the personal representative had entered into settlement i for and that has no subrogation claim against any monies which are allocated for receipt by hollander statutory beneficiaries as a result of their wrongful death claim,and that rightful interest in this case lies against the assets of the estate of patrick hollander at.the district court found that this statement was a clear and unequivocal repudiation of the committee claimed right to reimbursement from the proceeds of any settlement related to the accident.at.we agree and,accordingly,find that the claim accrued on january.
the committee fails to offer any legal support for its contention that the statement t he plan will pursue the remainder of its subrogation interest from future settlements received by the hollander estate,at,somehow tolled the statute of limitations.as such,we agree with the district court that summary judgment was appropriate because the committee cause of action was time barred.
for the aforementioned reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
i suggest that the court opinion may be appropriately morphologized by the expression no good deed goes unpunished.believing this should not be true,i respectfully dissent.
at the request of evelyn soles,personal representative of the estate of patrick hollander,made through her attorney,william diggs,now the stakeholder of part of the proceeds of a substantial tort settlement,the employees of acting through an administrator of their erisa benefit plan,performed a good deed by agreeing to accept partial payment of a subrogation claim from a portion of the monies derived through a modest settlement with one of several potential tortfeasors.quoting only a part of the letter of request from attorney diggs to,dated january,the court now holds that the letter and act of acceptance triggered the running of the statute of limitation that clearly applies in this action.with this result,i disagree.and,in my view,the portion of the letter not quoted or discussed in the court opinion illustrates the error.
two separate settlements occurred in this case.the first settlement,set forth in the january letter,involved james todd,ii,the driver of the first vehicle that struck hollander.the second settlement,consummated on may,involved the operator of the second car that struck hollander and two establishments.
the january,letter stated in greater part as follows 
survival action proceeds are typically generated when a deceased is not killed instantly but rather experiences conscious pain and suffering prior to death.while we have no evidence that indicates hollander suffered conscious pain and suffering,we have nevertheless agreed to allocate ten thousand and dollars of the settlement to the survival claim.this is in keeping with our view of south carolina case law with respect to the issue of fund allocation.we did this to insure that there was some fund which could begin to satisfy claims against hollander estate including the subrogation interest of.
as an employee of in myrtle beach,south carolina,hollander received the generous benefits from the plans which have been established by and which are governed by the provisions of erisa.we would ask that you agree that has no subrogation claim against any monies which are allocated for receipt by hollander statutory beneficiaries as a result of their wrongful death claim,and that rightful interest in this case lies against the assets of the estate of patrick hollander which include the fund allocated as a result of the survival action which we have maintained on his behalf.
your acknowledgment in this regard will enable us to conclude this portion of the case and allow for the distribution of proceeds to hollander daughter.of course,a conservator or guardian will be appointed on behalf of the minor child to receive these monies for her.this is a position which is required and regulated by south carolina law and which must be bonded.
