the trustees of multiemployer welfare and pension funds have sued corman under erisa for failing to make contributions that the trustees claim corman was required to make by collective bargaining agreements that it had made with the union effective in,and,respectively.the district judge ruled for corman after a trial based on a stipulated record,and the trustees appeal.
corman provides emergency services when a railroad or an industrial facility that has its own rail facilities suffers a derailment.the services include righting or disposing of derailed cars by means of heavy equipment owned by corman,repairing damaged sections of track,and cleaning up hazardous spills from derailed cars.between derailments there is work in the shop,that is,work at the facilities in which corman stores and maintains the equipment that it uses to clean up derailments and from which its employees sally forth when a derailment occurs in the vicinity of the facility to which they are assigned.one of these facilities is in gary,rather was.the last collective bargaining agreement between corman and the union concerning workers at the gary facility,the agreement,expired at the end of.negotiations for a new agreement collapsed the following may,when corman withdrew recognition from the union.the union struck in june and corman closed the facility at the end of that month.
the dispute giving rise to this suit concerns workers employed at various times between and at the gary facility who corman contends were casual employees not entitled by the collective bargaining agreements to pension and welfare benefits but who the trustees contend were regular employees and thus entitled to the benefits.it appears that on average the gary facility was staffed by between four and eight employees conceded to be regular employees plus one or two of the casual employees.two of the worked after the last agreement expired the contributions due on behalf of these workers present a distinct issue discussed later in this opinion.
the collective bargaining agreement defined casual employees as employees hired for a specific customer project.nothing in this section is to prevent casual employees from future employment on customer projects.furthermore,no casual employee will be employed if such employment causes a reduction or prevents an increase in hours of any present regular employee.also,no casual employees shall be employed as a means of preventing an increase in the number of regular employees.the agreement had contained a similar definition but with the addition that casual employees hours of employment shall not exceed hours in a calendar month a customer project,whichever is greater.because corman had difficulty finding workers willing to accept emergency calls for temporary work cleaning up derailments when the income from that work was so limited,the hour restriction was omitted from the subsequent agreements.
so far as the scope of our appellate review is concerned,we note that a trial on a stipulated paper record is equivalent to a conventional trial on largely oral evidence.hess hartford life accident ins,cir.since the district judge based his interpretation of the agreement not just on its language but also on the language that we just quoted from the agreement and on the evidence we mentioned that was offered to explain why that language was changed,the standard of appellate review applicable to the interpretation might seem to be that of clear error,rather than the de novo plenary standard.cook boston scientific,cir.but that is on the assumption that the judge was right to consider evidence extrinsic to the agreement.he was not if that agreement was clear as written,geier medtronic,cir rje northville industries,cir per curiam a principle fully applicable to collective bargaining agreements.bidlack wheelabrator,cir en banc mazzei trucking,cir pierce county hotel employees restaurant employees health trust elks lodge,cir.we think that the agreement was clear as written and that therefore the judge should not have looked outside it,and thus that our review should be plenary because the interpretation of a contract is treated as an issue of law when extrinsic evidence is not used in the interpretation,alexander city of evansville,cir ryan chromalloy american,cir rje northville industries,supra,at.
a further wrinkle is that the judge thought that only the agreement was at issue,but this is incorrect because some of the employees in question worked under the earlier agreements.that makes no difference to the appeal the only difference among the agreements,so far as the definition of casual employees is restriction found in the first and dropped in the second and third,as we see,immaterial.
corman argues that as long as a worker was initially hired to work on a specific project,he could be retained to work between projects and thus in the shop without losing the status of a casual employee.we disagree.a casual employee,in normal parlance as in the language of the agreements,is one hired for a specific project or other limited purpose,so that his employment ceases when he finishes his work on the task that he was hired to do.see central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund kroger,cir central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund independent fruit produce,cir.employers faced with unpredictable surges in is a good description of a company whose business is cleaning up a flexible workforce,and one way of imparting flexibility is to have a reserve pool of workers who go off the payroll when the surge recedes.such workers are casual employees.their leaving the payroll when the specific job for which they been hired ends is implicit in the definition of them in the collective bargaining agreements as employees hired for a specific customer project.corman acknowledges that specific customer project means a specific derailment.the sentence that follows the definition of casual employees states that they are not barred from future employment on customer projects emphasis added,implying that they ca be rehired to do storage and maintenance or the other tasks that are performed between derailments and that correspond to what firemen do between fires no more can they be hired for such work initially.
the deletion of the limit found in the collective bargaining agreement has no bearing on casual employees who did not bump up against the limit or did not work under that agreement and so were not bound by the limit.under the subsequent agreements a casual employee who worked hours in a period was still a casual he spent those hours working only on derailments rather than performing maintenance or other chores in the gary shop.at argument corman lawyer contended that the only limitation on casual employees in the later agreements is that they may not take work away from regular employees.that is not the only limitation.a casual employee loses his status if he takes work away from the regular employees,he is not entitled to that status in the first place unless hired to work on a specific customer project,that is,a derailment,and he loses that status if,though initially hired to work on a derailment,he is retained to work in the shop after his work on the derailment is finished.
the question then is whether the employees ever worked in the shop.information culled from payroll records indicates the number of hours that employees,whether regular or casual,who were assigned to the gary facility worked every week.the hours are classified as regular,wreck,or ot standing for overtime.regular suggests work not tied to a specific derailment and thus not tied to a specific customer project,and thus continuing in the shop between derailments,while wreck and suggest work on a specific derailment.an appendix to the collective bargaining agreements states that the regular shop rate shall be for all hours worked in the shop.this is further evidence that regular work is work done by regular employees in contrast,wreck rates are for customer service work.and the employees whose status is in issue worked approximately the same total hours,and with approximately the same proportion of regular
