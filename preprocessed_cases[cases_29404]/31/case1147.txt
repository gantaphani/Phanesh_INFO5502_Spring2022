toni feibusch feibusch appeals the district court decision that sun life assurance of canada sun life did not abuse its discretion in terminating her disability benefits.feibusch principal argument is that the district court incorrectly applied abuse of discretion review rather than de novo review.feibusch was denied benefits under policy language that states that proof of a disability claim must be satisfactory to sun life.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we hold that de novo review applies under the policy language at issue.we reverse the summary judgment in favor of sun life and remand for trial proceedings.
factual background 
beginning in,feibusch was employed by integrated device technology,idt as a technical writer and administrative assistant.her job duties included typing,answering phones,and creating and maintaining technical data sheets.in a typical day,she was required to sit for seven to seven and a half hours,stand for to one hour,walk for to one hour,and drive for hour.although her job was largely sedentary,she was occasionally required to bend,stoop,climb,reach above her shoulders,kneel,balance,push,and pull.in addition to typing,the job required constant movement of both hands,and use of the right hand with the computer mouse.feibusch earned more than annually.
feibusch participated in an employee disability benefit plan the plan regulated under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.benefits under the plan were partially funded by a group disability insurance policy the policy issued and administered by sun life.
key to this appeal is the language of several sun life policy provisions.according to the policy,proof of a disability claim must be satisfactory to sun life.an employee is totally disabled if she because of injury or sickness,is unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of her own occupation.an employee is partially disabled if she because of injury or sickness is unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of her own occupation on a fulltime basis,but is performing at least one of the material and substantial duties of her own occupation or another occupation on a or basis and earning less than of her total monthly earnings due to the same injury or sickness that caused the total or partial disability.
in early,feibusch complained of shoulder pain.she temporarily stopped working in march.arthur ting,feibusch orthopedic surgeon,performed surgery on her shoulder in july and september.feibusch returned to work in january.on august,sun life approved an initial partial disability claim dating from march.in september,feibusch underwent a third shoulder surgery with ting.in a november report,ting noted continued improvement in feibusch condition and stated that despite pain,she had full range of movement in her shoulder and could work if she were limited to medium manual activity.feibusch continued to receive partial disability payments from sun life until january.
in january,however,feibusch stopped working altogether and began collecting total disability payments.in march,ting reported that feibusch was unable to return to work.in april,idt terminated feibusch employment because she was unable to work without restrictions.in july,ting found that feibusch had severe limitation of functional capacity and was incapable of minimum sedentary activity.
as part of its claim review,sun life required feibusch to submit to an independent medical examination by charles borgia.on december,borgia stated that feibusch could work four hours a day if she took an extra strength tylenol three times a day.a february,sun life file memo on feibusch case concluded that feibusch continued to meet the plan definition of disability but that she should undergo rehabilitation to aid her in returning to full or work.on july,james sarni reviewed feibusch file upon referral from sun life and concluded that she has a functional capability of her shoulder that would allow her to perform her duties as an administrative assistant.sarni opined that feibusch could return to work on a basis for a few months,and then return to work.
on august,sun life determined that feibusch no longer met the policy definition of total disability and terminated her benefits effective july.sun life explained that information in our file at this time fails to support feibusch continued physical incapacity to perform the duties of an administrative assistant.feibusch appealed this decision through sun life internal process.
as part of the appeal process,steve moon,a certified work capacity evaluator,performed a functional capacity evaluation of feibusch for sun life.on october,moon stated that although he believed feibusch was in pain,she could return to work in her former position with certain limitations.on november,feibusch underwent another independent medical examination by walter newman.newman concluded that although feibusch was likely to suffer from chronic shoulder pain syndrome she was capable of performing her own occupation as an administrative assistant and technical writer.on december,sun life issued a final decision denying feibusch appeal.
procedural background 
feibusch filed an erisa action against idt and sun life.pursuant to stipulation,idt was dismissed from the case.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted sun life motion for summary judgment,denied feibusch motion for summary judgment,and directed the entry of judgment in favor of sun life.feibusch timely appealed.
analysisa.the proper standard of review of feibusch benefits denial 
following firestone tire rubber bruch,d,we held that district courts must review erisa benefit denial claims de novo unless the discretion to grant or deny claims is unambiguously retained by a plan administrator or fiduciary.kearney standard ins,cir en banc.recently,in abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc,we explained 
when a plan does not confer discretion on the administrator to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,a court must review the denial of benefits de novo regardless of whether the plan at issue is funded or unfunded and regardless of whether the administrator or fiduciary is operating under a possible or actual conflict of interest.de novo is the default standard of review.if de novo review applies,no further preliminary analytical steps are required.the court simply proceeds to evaluate whether the plan administrator correctly or incorrectly denied benefits,without reference to whether the administrator operated under a conflict of interest.
but if the plan does confer discretionary authority as a matter of contractual agreement,then the standard of review shifts to abuse of discretion.we have held that,for a plan to alter the standard of review from the default of de novo to the more lenient abuse of discretion,the plan must unambiguously provide discretion to the administrator.the essential first step of the analysis,then,is to examine whether the terms of the erisa plan unambiguously grant discretion to the administrator.

the dispositive policy language in feibusch case is that proof of a disability claim must be satisfactory to sun life.this language does not unambiguously provide discretion to the plan administrator.this conclusion clearly follows from our case law.in sandy reliance standard life ins.we stated,neither the parties nor the courts should have to divine whether discretion is conferred.it either is,in so many words,or it is,cir.we subsequently emphasized 
if an insurance company seeking to sell and administer an erisa plan wants to have discretion in making claims decisions,it should say so.it is not difficult to write,the plan administrator has discretionary authority to grant or deny benefits under this plan.i t is easy enough to confer discretion unambiguously if plan sponsors,administrators,or fiduciaries want benefits decisions to be reviewed for abuse of discretion.
