defendant company employee benefits organization income protection plan the plan appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff karen lamantia awarding her disability benefits.the plan argues that the district court committed three errors in holding that lamantia complaint was timely,in applying the treating physician rule,and by reviewing the claims administrator decision under a de novo standard of review.we agree with the district court that lamantia complaint was timely.however,because the district court erred in applying the treating physician rule and erred in reviewing the claims administrator decision under a de novo standard of review,we reverse and remand for reconsideration of whether lamantia was improperly denied disability benefits.
facts and proceedings below 
lamantia was employed at for fourteen years and was a member of the plan,which provides disability benefits to qualifying claimants.the plan claims administrator,voluntary plan administrators vpa,makes the determination whether a claimant is totally disabled under the plan definitions.the member is entitled to appeal an initial denial of benefits by submitting a written request for an appeal.the plan states that if the member does not receive written notice of the claims administrator decision with respect to his or her claim within one hundred twenty days after the date the claims administrator receives the request for review,the claim shall be deemed to have been denied on review.this provision mirrored a department of labor regulation then in effect that applied to lamantia appeal.see h,h allowing a claimant to commence a lawsuit if the insured had not received a response days after the appeal.regarding an appeal,company employee benefits organization the organization is the named fiduciary which has the discretionary authority to act with respect to any appeal from a denial of benefits.vpa is given the discretionary power to construe the language of the plan and make the decision on review on behalf of the organization.the claimant must file a lawsuit challenging a denial of benefits within four years after the occurrence of the loss for which a claim is made.
vpa granted lamantia disability benefits,which terminated on may.lamantia filed a claim for disability ltd benefits,which vpa denied on may.the denial letter reminded lamantia of her right to appeal the decision and said that she would receive a written decision of her appeal within days of the request for the review,but if she did not receive the written decision within the day period,the appeal can be considered denied.lamantia appealed vpa denial of ltd benefits on june,which meant that days from her appeal date would be october.
beginning in september and october of,there were several communications between vpa and lamantia counsel leading to an extension of time for lamantia to file additional medical reports.on september,lamantia counsel sent a copy of a medical report with a letter informing vpa that an additional medical report would be forthcoming.on september,lamantia counsel and vpa participated in a telephone call.vpa reported this call as follows 
indicated to him lamantia counsel that as long as his client understands that her appeal will remain pending until we receive all the info.they wish to be considered with the appeal.i have no problem waiting for him to gather what ever info.he feels is necessary for the appeal i told him that if he feels that it is truely sic necessary then he should do so,but please send me something in writing indicating this is his choice to delay the claim.
on october,lamantia counsel sent a letter to vpa memorializing their agreement that the appeal review will not conclude until such time as lamantia has obtained a report from an evaluator of her choice and submitted said report,and that he hoped the report would be sent in two months.
no report was submitted within two months instead,there was a breakdown in communication for at least the next two years.lamantia counsel claims that a letter with additional medical reports eventually was sent on july.the plan claims that it never received this letter and that the last communication it had with lamantia counsel was in october.on august,vpa received a letter from lamantia counsel inquiring about the status of her appeal and referring to the july,letter.vpa responded the next month by stating that it had not received the july,letter and requested that this information be forwarded.lamantia counsel sent the reports from the july,letter on october.nearly a year after this latest submission,vpa still had not rendered a final decision.after telephone calls by lamantia counsel,on august,vpa finally sent a letter to lamantia counsel that reaffirmed the initial denial of ltd benefits on the merits,analyzing the medical records and concluding that she is suffering from illnesses that ltd benefits do not cover and that,in the absence of these illnesses,she could return to work.
lamantia filed a complaint on october,alleging a claim for disability benefits pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.she filed a single cause of action against the plan,vpa,and the organization.lamantia argued that she was entitled to ltd benefits because she is totally disabled as defined by the plan.
after stipulating to the dismissal of vpa,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court issued an order dismissing the organization,granting lamantia motion as to the plan for benefits,and denying the plan motion.on april,the plan timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

the plan argues that the district court erred in disregarding the plan contractual limitations period.under the plan,the claimant must file a lawsuit challenging a denial of benefits within four years after the occurrence of the loss for which a claim is made.the summary plan description states that this means the action must be commenced within four years from the date when the disability occurred.under the plan,an employee can not be deemed totally disabled,and qualify for disability benefits,unless the member is continuously unable to perform each and every duty of his or her usual occupation.to be deemed totally disabled to qualify for ltd benefits the claimant must show she is continuously unable to perform any occupation for which he or she is or may become qualified by reason of his or her education,training,or experience.the plan concludes that under these definitions a claimant who is working can not be considered disabled and therefore no occurrence of the loss has occurred yet.thus,the plan reasons that lamantia date of the occurrence of the loss occurred on august,the first day she was unable to work.the plan argues that lamantia suit had to be filed within four years from august,making her filing on october,untimely.
the district court refused to apply the plan contractual limitations period.while noting that contractual limitations periods in disability plans could apply,the district court stated that the claimant must have notice of the denial of her claim and that the limitations period must be reasonable.the district court held that,under the plan,lamantia did not receive notice as of august,that her claim had been denied.next,the district court held that the limitations period was unreasonable because lamantia claim could have accrued and run through the entire limitations period before she even sought disability benefits.
instead,the district court applied ninth circuit precedent governing when a claim accrues.this court has held that an erisa cause of action accrues either at the time benefits are actually denied,or when the insured has reason to know that the claim has been denied.wetzel lou ehlers cadillac group long term disability ins.program,cir en banc citations omitted.applying wetzel,the district court held that the earliest lamantia could have had notice of the denial of coverage was when her claim was deemed denied,which was days from her appeal date of june.however,due to a counting error the district court held that december,rather than october,was the earliest date that the limitations period began to run.therefore,the district court concluded that lamantia complaint,filed on october,was not.
we agree with the district court that lamantia complaint was timely,but we reach that conclusion under a different analysis.whether the accrual date for the limitations period stems from the plan contractual provision or from federal law does not matter.nor does it matter whether the accrual date runs from the date the claimant identified as the starting date onset of total disability,or some later date.regardless whether the plan contractual limitations period or federal law governs,the totality of vpa representations and conduct between september and august estopped the plan from asserting either limitations defense.these representations and conduct indicated to lamantia that her appeal was placed in suspension pending both vpa receipt of further medical reports and a final decision on the merits,and that there was no reason for lamantia to file a lawsuit while vpa considered her appeal.
as a general rule,a defendant will be estopped from setting up a defense when its own prior representations or conduct have caused the plaintiff to run afoul of the statute and it is equitable to hold the defendant responsible for that result.allen robins,cir.estoppel may apply not only against a party asserting a statute of limitations defense,but also against a party asserting a contractual limitations defense based on a specified time period in an erisa disability plan.see doe blue cross blue shield united of,cir.before estoppel can apply,the following conditions must be met 
the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts,and the party to be estopped must have acted so that the other party had a right to believe that the party intended its conduct to be acted upon and the other party relied on the conduct to its prejudice.

when a plaintiff seeks to recover benefits under an erisa plan based on an equitable estoppel theory,the ninth circuit requires the plaintiff to satisfy a test.see pisciotta teledyne,cir per curiam greany farm bureau life ins,cir.however,this sixprong test is inapplicable to the present case because lamantia is not seeking to recover benefits based on an equitable estoppel theory concerning the substance of her claim.rather,estoppel is applicable here because this case involves representations and conduct by vpa which caused lamantia not to file suit within the limitations period.when estoppel has been invoked in cases arising under erisa involving similar circumstances,courts have not required heightened standards and instead have applied general estoppel principles.see hinton,at applying golden faust to the plaintiff argument that the defendant should be estopped from asserting statute of limitations defense bourgeois pension plan for employees of santa fe int l,cir holding that defendants estopped from arguing claim is before internal appeals committee ralph lucent,cir citing doe,at,court holds that the only impact on lucent erisa plan is the extension of time to make application for certain benefits.no variation in the terms of benefits or their application is implicated.doe,at applying estoppel to toll limitations period in erisa disability benefits plan.due to these representations and conduct,the issue is whether the plan should be estopped from asserting any limitations defense lamantia ultimate theory of recovery is unrelated to equitable estoppel.
the record reveals that,over the course of four years,vpa made several representations to lamantia regarding the status of her internal appeal which lamantia reasonably relied upon,and that lamantia reliance caused her prejudice by her failure to file suit within either limitations period.importantly,during the course of lamantia appeal vpa never relied on or even mentioned the contractual limitations period or the provision,and it never considered lamantia claim to be fully denied until august,when a final decision on the merits was rendered.on september,vpa represented to lamantia counsel that her appeal would remain pending until vpa received all of the medical information that lamantia wanted to be considered and that there was no problem waiting for him to gather what ever info.he feels is necessary for the appeal.on october,lamantia counsel sent a letter to vpa memorializing vpa representations that the appeal review will not conclude until such time as lamantia has obtained a report from an evaluator of her choice and submitted said report.not once did vpa object to this initial extension of time.indeed,between and,vpa never informed lamantia that her claim had been denied and,for all lamantia knew,her appeal was still being considered by vpa.due to vpa statements,there was no need to file a lawsuit because vpa was considering her appeal.
even more significant is vpa response when vpa received a letter from lamantia counsel on august,days before,according to the plan,the contractual limitations period as to why vpa had not yet rendered a final decision.rather than mention that the limitations period to file a lawsuit was about to expire or invoke the provision,vpa waited more than a month to write a letter to lamantia counsel.instead of asserting that lamantia claim was now,this september,letter allowed even more time to file medical records.vpa could have replied that the contractual limitations period had already expired,or that her claim had been deemed denied by the passage of time.instead,this action clearly demonstrates that vpa did not intend to rely on either the plan limitations provision or the provisions and,instead,wanted additional information to consider the appeal.again,due to these representations,rather than file a lawsuit lamantia waited for vpa final decision.
finally,after nearly another year had passed without a final decision,lamantia counsel made further contact with vpa to inquire about the appeal.again,instead of informing lamantia that her claim was,vpa rendered a final decision on august,that was based on the merits,analyzing all the medical evidence vpa now had and reaffirming its initial denial.not until litigation ensued did the plan begin to rely on its contractual limitations period,much less the provision.instead,vpa communications lulled lamantia into believing that her appeal was being considered and that there was no reason to file a lawsuit if the internal appeals process would ultimately result in ltd benefits.
we conclude that the totality of vpa representations and conduct between september and august estopped the plan from relying on either the statute or contractual limitations period.vpa rendered a final decision on the merits on august,and lamantia filing of her complaint only two months later on october,was timely.
