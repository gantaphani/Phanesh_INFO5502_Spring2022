carmen peralta appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of her former employer,hispanic business,hbi.peralta alleges that hbi breached its fiduciary duty as an erisa plan administrator by failing to inform her in a timely manner that her erisa benefit plan for disability insurance had been cancelled.the district court found that any state law claims were preempted by erisa and that the remedy sought was not available under erisa.on appeal,peralta asserts that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking or,in the alternative,that an erisa violation occurred and a remedy exists.we conclude that we have jurisdiction and affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant.
in october,carmen peralta began work as a special events manager for hbi,a publisher of business magazines.as part of an effort to enhance its benefits package,hbi introduced a new disability insurance policy ltd policy,effective january,at no cost to its employees,which automatically covered all regular employees who work ed or more hours per week.letter from hbi,er at.the ltd policy was an employee benefits plan,as defined by erisa,and peralta was a beneficiary of the plan.in july,maureen girouard,the resources hr manager at hbi,wrote to the ltd policy carrier to cancel the policy.
on october,peralta,while still employed at hbi,was involved in an automobile accident and suffered serious injuries.believing that she was covered under hbi ltd policy,peralta attempted to make a claim for disability benefits.but as the policy had already been cancelled,no benefits were paid.
at the time of peralta accident,june wozny was hbi hr manager.wozny was in charge of the administration of hbi employee benefits plan,and one of her projects was to take a good hard look at the current benefit plan and try to improve the benefits package,in an attempt to reduce hbi high employee turnover.wozny dep.july,er at.during wozny investigation into the existing hbi benefits,she discovered,based on a file,a printed material or something in someone handwriting,that someone had cancelled this disability policy.id.at.as a result,wozny sent out an email,on october,informing all hbi employees that the ltd policy had been cancelled inadvertently in july b ecause of some communication errors.id.during her deposition,wozny admitted that prior to these discoveries,based on a summary of hbi employee benefit plans,she was under the assumption that hbi had an ltd in place.peralta,who had been in the hospital since october,was initially not aware of wozny email.by the time she left the hospital at the end of october,however,peralta had learned of the cancellation of the ltd policy,which she later verified with the hr manager.
on october,peralta filed suit in federal district court,alleging breach of fiduciary duty by hbi under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et peralta claimed that she had relied on hbi ltd policy and,believing that she was already covered,did not purchase outside insurance.she further claimed that hbi had a fiduciary duty to provide complete and accurate information about the status of the employee benefits plan,which included providing notice of the discontinuation or suspension of coverage.complaint,er at.according to peralta,hbi violated its fiduciary duty to give adequate notice by intentionally concealing the fact that it had cancelled the ltd policy.peralta sought either an order reinstating her ltd benefits,or,in the alternative,other orders that would provide substantive relief equivalent to the reinstatement of the ltd benefits.
on august,hbi moved for summary judgment on numerous grounds,including that hbi provided adequate notice of the ltd policy cancellation,pursuant to erisa notice requirement,see a b,b peralta request for a reinstatement of ltd benefits or substantive relief equivalent to the reinstatement of benefits would be a compensatory monetary recovery not permitted under life annuity insurance knudson,d,for a procedural erisa breach and even if monetary recovery for a procedural erisa breach were possible,it would not be available to peralta because hbi committed no egregious action 
on october,the district court granted summary judgment for hbi,concluding that no remedy was available.the court stated that p ursuant to and its progeny,plaintiff may not use the equitable enforcement mechanisms of erisa to secure compensatory relief for hbi alleged breach of fiduciary duty.order granting def.mot.for summ,er at.the court reasoned that because the ltd policy had been cancelled and was no longer in effect,peralta requested relief must be compensatory in nature,and thus,outside the scope of the equitable enforcement mechanisms of erisa a.id.on october,the court ordered that the plaintiff take nothing and that the action be dismissed on the merits.judgment,er at.peralta now appeals.
discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
the parties dispute whether subject matter jurisdiction exists.although this issue was first presented to the district court at the hearing on the summary judgment motion,and not addressed in the district court order,we must still determine whether federal jurisdiction exists.see freeman jacques orthopaedic joint implant surgery med.group,cir explaining that it is this court duty to see to it that the d istrict c ourt jurisdiction,defined and limited by statute,is not exceeded.we review the existence of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.millers ins.axel express,cir.
in civil cases,subject matter jurisdiction is generally conferred upon federal district courts either through diversity jurisdiction,or federal question jurisdiction.there is no diversity jurisdiction here because peralta and hbi are both california citizens.the sole federal question in peralta complaint arises from her disability claims under erisa,et,which preempts state law claims that relate to an employee benefit plan.see a.
the complaint filed in the district court makes quite clear that peralta seeks remedies based on a breach of fiduciary duty by an administrator of an erisa plan.there is no doubt,and the parties do not dispute,that the ltd policy at issue was an erisa welfare benefit plan there is also no doubt or dispute that hbi was an erisa fiduciary.
in previous cases,while we have found no erisa preemption with respect to certain claims that are only loosely related to erisa,in none of those cases did an erisa plan exist under which the plaintiff sought benefits based on a breach of fiduciary duty by the plan administrator,as is the case here.for example,we have at times found insufficient relation to the benefit plan for preemption to attach.see,winterrowd am.annuity ins,cir no erisa preemption because there was no erisa plan curtis nevada bonding,cir no erisa preemption because plaintiff never became eligible to receive benefits under the plan harris provident life accident ins,cir no erisa jurisdiction because,at the time of filing suit,the former employee,was not a participant in employer erisa health care plan delaye agripac,cir no erisa jurisdiction because employment contract is not a plan governed by erisa scott gulf oil,cir no erisa preemption of employees prospective benefits claim based on the employer failure to negotiate coverage with the successive employer,which prevented the existence of a plan.
recently,in providence health plan mcdowell,cir,cert.denied,d,and cert.denied,d,we concluded that an erisa provider breach of contract claim against a participant for failure to reimburse it from a settlement was not preempted by erisa.at.the reimbursement claim in that case did not relate to the plan because adjudication of the claim required no interpretation of the plan,no distribution of benefits,and no dispute regarding any benefits previously paid.id.at explaining that when evaluating whether a claim relates to a plan governed by erisa,the focus is whether the claim is premised on the existence of an erisa plan,and whether the existence of the plan is essential to the claim survival.we concluded that such reimbursement claims are merely state law claims for contract damages,requiring no construction of plan terms and for which no erisa remedies exist.id.mcdowell,however,has no factual similarity to the instant case,where interpretation of erisa law lies at the heart of the dispute.because,as discussed infra,we conclude that erisa imposes a fiduciary duty of timely notification of plan cancellation,and that breach of such a duty may give rise to equitable remedies,we also conclude that erisa preemption exists and that federal question subject matter jurisdiction is present.
ii.duty of timely notification 
it is indisputable that an employer has a right to eliminate an benefit plan.see cunha ward foods,cir holding that termination of erisa plan was not a breach of fiduciary duty citation omitted.that is not the issue here.the issue is,rather,whether an administrator has a fiduciary duty to notify participants in a timely fashion of the total termination of their coverage,and whether that duty is separate from the reporting and disclosure duty under b to notify participants of material changes and modifications 
in this case,because hbi notification of the ltd policy cancellation,per wozny october email,occurred approximately three months after girouard july cancellation letter,the b requirement,that a summary description of such modification or change shall be furnished not later than days seven months after the end of the plan year in which the change is adopted,would be satisfied.whether there is a more basic duty to provide timely notice of plan cancellation,however,is an issue that few courts have addressed,and for us is an issue of first impression.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that,although the statute does not expressly require timely notice of plan termination,such a requirement is implicit in the purpose and structure of erisa.
a.the fiduciary purpose of erisa 
erisa seeks to safeguard the and security of working men and women and to apprise them of their rights and obligations under any employee benefit plan.blau,at quoting donovan dillingham,cir.t he evils against which erisa was enacted to guard are insecurity,lack of knowledge,and inability to police plan administration id.erisa guards against these evils and protects employee benefit plans by setting forth certain fiduciary duties applicable to the management of both employee welfare and benefit plans 
see generally.the statute places a core obligation on an erisa fiduciary to discharge its duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.id.a see also varity,at.bins exxon,cir en banc.
citing a,the eleventh circuit has concluded that p roviding notice of the discontinuation or suspension of coverage is a fiduciary responsibility and that employees are entitled to prompt notice of the suspension of their plan coverage.willett blue cross blue shield of alabama,cir see id.at holding that delegation of duty to notify individuals of suspension of coverage does not relieve fiduciary of all liability for breach of that duty accord presley blue shield of alabama,recognizing that insurer could delegate fiduciary duty of notifying plan participants of termination of coverage,but that its liability for breach could still exist see also rucker pacific fm,recognizing duty of prompt notification of ltd policy cancellation 
we agree with the eleventh circuit that the broad fiduciary responsibilities imposed by erisa require a plan administrator to provide timely notification to employees of termination of their benefits.to conclude otherwise would conflict with erisa purpose to safeguard the of employees and apprise them of their rights under an erisa plan.
b.the structure of erisa 
in addition to fiduciary duties,erisa imposes reporting and disclosure obligations on a plan administrator.the reporting and disclosure provisions,see,are set forth separately from the fiduciary duty provisions,see.this separation suggests that an administrator satisfaction of specific reporting requirements does not necessarily satisfy its fiduciary responsibilities.indeed,to say that compliance with part one of erisa would also satisfy obligations under part four would render the act fiduciary protections a nullity,or at least surplusage.see trw andrews,d quotations and citations omitted it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.
therefore,in order to give meaning and effect to erisa fiduciary purpose,more must be required of an administrator than mere compliance with erisa express reporting and disclosure provisions.in other words,i f the fiduciary duty applied to nothing more than activities already controlled by other specific legal duties,it would serve no purpose.varity,at.
moreover,although hbi approximately three months of the ltd policy satisfy the reporting and disclosure requirements set forth in b,a termination is not the equivalent of a change or modification see black law dictionary,ed defining modification as a change an alteration which introduces new elements into the details,or cancels some of them,but leaves the general purpose and effect of the intact and terminate as t o put an end to to make to cease to end see also mci telecomms.v.at t,d defining modify as having a connotation of increment or limitation,which is evidenced by the fact that nearly every dictionary says to modify means to change moderately or in minor fashion,and that modify does not contemplate fundamental changes.
unlike a change or modification,the termination of a plan leaves an employee without any coverage whatsoever.see rucker.at stating that a termination of benefits affects a beneficiary rights to a much greater degree than compared to a mere modification.if the statute notification period were to apply,employees,unknowingly,would be at risk of having no coverage for seven months.a notification period hardly can be considered the meaningful disclosure mandated by erisa or the prompt notification set forth in willett,at 
as we stated in blau,
t he administrator of an employee welfare benefit plan has no discretion to secrete the plan,to flout the reporting,disclosure and fiduciary obligations imposed by erisa,or to deny benefits in contravention of the plan plain terms.fiduciary responsibilities with respect to plan reporting and disclosure provisions a d plan must be administered in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of erisa.
hbi notification,three months after the plan cancellation,does not constitute timely notification.timely notification may in some circumstances mean prompt notification after a change has been effectuated.in other circumstances,timely notification may require prior notice.for example,timely notification of cancellation may require prior notice so that employees may purchase replacement coverage or consider alternative employment see hamilton air jamaica,cir noting that erisa reporting and disclosure requirements ensure that participants know where they stand with respect to the plan,and permit employees to bargain further or seek other employment if they are dissatisfied with their benefits hozier,at an employee who never receives information about gaps in the coverage of his benefits package is unable to make fully informed decisions about whether to purchase alternative insurance,or even to seek alternative employment.
in short,while there is no express statutory requirement to notify participants in a timely fashion of plan cancellation,such a requirement is implicit in the structure and purpose of erisa,and is more vital than the ordinary technical reporting and disclosure requirements.employees are entitled to know if they have or do not have an erisa plan.failure to so advise employees violates the obligation of a fiduciary to discharge his duties in the interest of the participants with care,skill,prudence,and diligence.a b.
iii.remedies 
the remaining issue is whether erisa civil enforcement provision provides a remedy.in this case,there is no possibility that peralta can recover any ben
