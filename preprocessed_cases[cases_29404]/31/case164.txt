plaintiffs are five present or former employees of either smith barney or citibank,both of which are divisions of citigroup,citigroup.plaintiffs,and the class they represent,allege that the citibuilder cash balance plan plan violates the employee retirement income security act of erisa,as amended,et.plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief as well as monetary damages.
by order dated december,the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin,granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs on various grounds,including first,that the plan violated erisa minimum benefit accrual rules through its use of the fractional rule and second,that citigroup violated erisa h notice requirement.h citigroup challenges those two conclusions.plaintiffs,raising a number of issues.on appeal,both parties agree that the district court erred in concluding that the fractional rule can never properly be applied to cash balance plans,such as citigroup plan.because we find that citigroup plan does not violate erisa minimum benefit accrual rules,and that citigroup did not violate erisa h notice requirements,we reverse.
background 
erisa benefit plans generally 
erisa recognizes two basic types of retirement plans defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.hirt equitable ret.plan for employees,managers agents,cir.defined contribution plans,also known as individual account plans,guarantee only that the employer will contribute a certain amount to the employee retirement account,without providing any guarantee as to that account value upon the employee retirement.id.at see also.a defined contribution plan is a pension plan which provides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount contributed to the participant account,and any income,expenses,gains and losses.both the employee and the employer may contribute to a defined contribution plan,but the employer contribution is fixed.hughes aircraft jacobson,d.
defined benefit plans generally guarantee employees a specific benefit upon retirement without regard to how the market performs.hirt,at see also.in contrast to a defined contribution plan,a defined benefit plan consists of a general pool of assets rather than individual dedicated accounts.hughes aircraft,at.the pool of assets may be funded by employer or employee contributions,or a combination of both.id.in a defined benefit plan,no plan member has a claim to any particular asset that composes a part of the plan general asset pool.id.at.rather,members have a right to a defined level of benefits,known as accrued benefits.id.in a defined benefit plan,an accrued benefit is expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.a.whereas,in a defined contribution plan,the accrued benefit is understood as the balance of the individual account.b.
defined contribution and defined benefit plans primarily differ in who bears the risk of investment performance.hirt,at.in a defined contribution plan,the employee bears the risks,while in a defined benefit plan,the employer typically bears the entire investment risk.hughes aircraft,at.in a defined benefit plan,the employer is obligated to cover any underfunding as the result of a shortfall that may occur from the plan investments.id.and,if a defined benefit plan is overfunded,the employer may reduce or suspend its contributions.id.at.
within the context of these two types of retirement plans,employers have developed a relatively new kind of plan called a cash balance plan.hirt,at.the cash balance plan is intended to combine attributes of both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.id.c ash balance plans are often described as hybrid they create a benefit structure that simulates that of defined contribution plans,but employers do not deposit funds in actual individual accounts,and employers,not employees,bear the market risks.id.cash balance plans are considered defined benefit plans under erisa because the accounts are hypothetical in nature and the employee receives a specified payout upon retirement.esden bank of boston,cir see also.as a result of this classification,the term accrued benefit in a cash balance plan is expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.esden,at quoting a 
when an employer establishes a cash balance plan,an account is created in the name of each participant to keep track of his or her accrued benefits.bilello jpmorgan chase ret.plan,d,dlc,wl,at.in a cash balance plan,the account contains pay credits,which represent a percentage of the participant salary that is periodically deposited into the account,as well as interest credits,which apply a common interest rate to the account balances.id.pay credits only accumulate until the termination of the participant employment,but interest credits continue to accrue until the benefits are distributed.id.in a cash balance plan,the employer may offer the employee the option of a lump sum payout instead of an annuity however,any such payout must be worth at least as much,in present terms,as the annuity payable at normal retirement age.id.
proponents of cash balance pension plans assert that this hybrid structure is beneficial for employees because it is easier for them to understand,it allows for greater portability,it establishes a system whereby benefits accrue more evenly over an employee career,and it is therefore better suited to the increased of contemporary labor markets.esden,at.
advocates of cash balance plans also maintain that they benefit employers.they suggest that because employees better appreciate the value of their pension rights,the employer fringe benefit dollar has greater impact.id.they also argue that a cash balance plan retains the funding advantages of a defined benefit plan for the employer.id.specifically,actual contributions are made to a single trust fund,based on actuarial assumptions therefore the employer retains funding flexibility as long as the solvency of the plan is maintained and investment returns that exceed the promised interest credits as well as forfeitures of the benefits of any terminated participants are retained by the employer.id.almost of all defined benefit plan ten million covered by cash balance plans,or other similar hybrid plans.
b.the citigroup plan 
in,citicorp merged with travelers corporation.authority to amend citibank pension plan was vested in the plan sponsor,citigroup,by action of its board of directors.in,at a meeting of the board of directors,citigroup converted its traditional,final pay pension formula into a cash balance plan.the citigroup board adopted a series of resolutions in october of incorporating the cash balance design into the plan.the conversion had an effective date of january.
in may of,the provisions of the newly adopted cash balance plan were set forth in plan article.under the plan,citigroup created a hypothetical account for each participating employee,and then credited each account with two kinds of deposits benefit credits and interest credits.benefit credits were awarded to participants as a percentage of that year total compensation.under the plan formula,benefit credits increased with age and years of service,ranging from two percent for participants under age in their first ten years of service,to seven percent for participants fifty years or older with fifteen or more years of service.interest credited to the account was awarded based on an extrinsic index treasury rate.at retirement,participants would be entitled to a lump sum payout based on the accumulated value of their accounts,or to an actuarially equivalent pension.
although the provisions of the amendments were not set forth in an executed citibuilder retirement plan document until may of,in the months leading up to the effective date citigroup sent out a number of brochures and pamphlets concerning the changes to the structure of the benefit plan.pursuant to erisa h,official notice of the amendment was given to all plan participants in a letter from tim peach,director of retirement benefits,dated december.the letter was entitled the citigroup pension plan notice of significant reduction in benefit accruals for certain employees of citigroup and its subsidiaries the notice.
the notice contained a general summary of how the new cash balance plan would work,as well as a table listing the percentages of salaries credited to accounts annually,as determined by an employee age and years of service.the cover letter referenced erisa h and explained that,due to the forthcoming amendments to the pension plan,it was likely that some employees would see some level of reduction in total accumulations in the future.the documentation accompanying the letter,distributed to each affected employee,also outlined the mechanisms of a cash balance plan.it explained that under the plan as amended,the company credits a percentage of your total compensation each year to a hypothetical account.that percentage generally increases with your age and service.the notice also explained that the hypothetical account earns interest credits at a rate based on treasury bonds.the notice did not,however,indicate the formula that the plan would apply in order to achieve compliance with statutory accrual principles.
the plan was again amended,effective january.this amendment incorporated the same cash balance regime adopted in,but recalibrated the range of benefit credits allotted annually to employees accounts.pursuant to this amendment,benefit credits ranged from one and percent for participants under age in their first five years of service,to six percent for those or older with fifteen or more years of service.citigroup employed a notification process similar to the process it utilized in.pursuant to erisa h,an information package dated december was sent to plan participants informing them of the amendment.as with the notice,there was no mention of the means by which the plan would ensure compliance with erisa accrual requirements.
c.the minimum benefit accrual tests 
cash balance plans,such as the citibuilder plan,are defined benefit plans within the meaning of erisa because they guarantee a prescribed level of retirement benefits.esden,at see also.all defined benefit plans must comply with erisa minimum benefit accrual rules,which are primarily designed to minimize backloading.langman laub,cir,reprinted in.backloading occurs when a plan awards a covered employee disproportionately higher benefit accruals for later years of service.langman,at.thus,while erisa does not require pension plans to pay out any specific dollar amount,it does regulate the rate at which benefits accrue.b see cent.laborers pension fund heinz,d.toward that end,erisa sets forth three alternative minimum benefit accrual tests pension plans are required to pass one.b a c.two of these tests are implicated by this appeal the test and the fractional test.
under the test,the rate of benefit accrual in any future year may not be more than greater than the rate in the current year.b b.this test prevents backloading by cabining fluctuation in accrual rates.as the supreme court explained,the test permits the use of any accrual formula as long as the accrual rate for a given year of service does not vary beyond a specified percentage from the accrual rate of any other year under the plan.alessi,d.
the fractional test is essentially a pro rata rule under which in any given year,the employee accrued benefit is proportionate to the number of years of service as compared with the number of total years of service appropriate to the normal retirement age.see also b c.in other words,this test uses a fractional calculation based on years of service to ensure that benefits accrue at a rate that approximates the prorated amount of the total benefits that the employee would receive if he or she worked until normal retirement age.one unique feature of the fractional test formula is that it uses the employee current compensation rate to project the total benefits available at retirement.this means that the formula assumes no salary increases for the employee.
article e of the citibuilder plan sets forth its mechanism for compliance with erisa minimum accrual standards although the percentage of compensation that citigroup contributes to participants accounts increases by more than one third,based on increasing age and service years,the plan may still qualify under the percent test because of the value of the interest credits compounded annually through normal retirement age.esden,at.compliance with the percent rule depends upon the balance between benefit credits,which increase with age,and interest credits,which decrease with age.compliance is also contingent upon the variable interest rate remaining sufficiently high to counterbalance the increase in benefit credits with the decrease in interest credits.
in order to ensure compliance,regardless of fluctuations in the interest rate,citigroup plan provides that when the rate of accrual does not satisfy the test,participants accounts will be made to comply with the fractional rule of accrual upon the termination of the period of employment.if the variable interest rate falls to a level at which compliance with the test is not possible,citigroup will calculate the minimum account requirements pursuant to article e and then add the difference to the participants accounts.under the interest rates in effect in and,the plan was in compliance with the test,and neither article e nor the fractional test was implicated.however,beginning in,a change in the interest rate brought the plan out of compliance with the test for some participants.article e was invoked with respect to the affected participants in order to bring the plan into compliance with erisa minimum accrual rules.
erisa notice requirement 
in order to safeguard benefits promised to employees and to ensure that employees can form realistic expectations about the benefits that they will receive,erisa prohibits employers from reducing the accrual of future benefits without adequate notice to plan participants.see frommert conkright,cir.at all times relevant to the amendments at issue on this appeal,erisa h provided that a pension plan 
may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual,unless,after adoption of the plan amendment and not less than days before the effective date of the plan amendment,the plan administrator provides a written notice,setting forth the plan amendment and its effective date,to each participant in the plan.
guidelines promulgated by the internal revenue service irs clarify that notice is required when an amendment is reasonably expected to change the amount of the future annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.notice of significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual,codified at pts.whether an amendment creates a significant reduction in accrual rates is determined based on reasonable expectations taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances at the time the amendment is adopted.id.at.according to the irs guidelines,notices may contain a summary of the amendment,rather than the text of the amendment,if the summary is written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.id.at see also register pnc fin.servs.group,cir.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
plaintiffs filed consolidated actions on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals against citigroup and its plan administration committee,alleging that the citibuilder plan violates erisa.in re citigroup pension plan erisa,d,citigroup i.plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief as well as monetary damages.plaintiffs allege,among other things,that the plan is impermissibly backloaded due to insufficient interest credits that the plan fractional test method of computing accrued benefits is precluded under erisa and that defendants failed to provide plan participants with adequate notice that the and cash balance amendments would reduce the rate of future benefit accrual.id.at.
on december,on for summary judgment,the district court denied defendants motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiffs motion in part.id.at.the court ruled,in relevant part,that,
