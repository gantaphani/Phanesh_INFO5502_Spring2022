aventis pharmaceuticals and helen hefner appeal the orders of the district court requiring them to pay the plaintiff,linda brown,in statutory penalties for a violation of cobra notification,in statutory penalties under erisa for failure to supply summary plan documents after a written request,and a certificate of life insurance for minus the amount of premiums that would have been incurred by the plaintiff in exercising her life insurance conversion rights.we affirm.
linda sue brown began working for one of the defendant predecessor companies in.she continued to work for the company until when she received a period of disability leave.when brown was unable to return to work at the end of this period she was terminated.brown termination letter was sent on november.it informed her that the effective date of her termination was october.the letter also indicated that brown would receive further information regarding the impact of termination on her benefits.
brown benefits as an aventis employee included health,dental,and life insurance coverage.employees also had the right to convert their life insurance benefits upon leaving the company.this conversion right allowed employees to maintain their current level of coverage without having to provide additional evidence of insurability.this is significant because brown has health problems making it difficult to get insurance from a new provider.to qualify for conversion and maintain the life insurance benefits,an employee must fill out the necessary paperwork and pay a fee within days of termination.
this process of conversion and the deadlines involved are explained in a summary plan description spd,contained within aventis employee yearbook.aventis provided brown with an employee yearbook,but brown did not possess it at the time of her termination.she had left it in her employee locker when she went on disability leave.while she was on leave,the company maintenance staff cleaned out her locker and did not return the contents to her.
when brown did not receive the information promised in her termination letter,she,on at least two occasions,called representatives in aventis human resources department,who assured her that the information would be forthcoming.when the information had not arrived nearly two months after her termination,brown hired an attorney in an attempt to obtain it.
brown attorney mailed two letters requesting this information on january,and february.although these letters did not specifically ask for a summary plan description,the district court found them to constitute a request for the spd based on their language requesting information about all benefits.brown received cobra information and insurance conversion forms,but not a spd,on february.upon receiving these forms,brown attempted to convert her life insurance coverage.this application and the subsequent appeal were denied.unum,the insurance provider,is not a party to this action.
after a bench trial,brown was awarded,the maximum statutory damages allowed,for aventis failure to provide cobra notification within the required time period.brown also received in civil penalties authorized by erisa for aventis failure to supply a spd upon receipt of brown written request.aventis was additionally required to provide brown with a life insurance certificate for amount of coverage brown was unable to any costs brown would have incurred in the process of conversion.
this court reviews the decision of the trial court to grant or deny civil penalties under erisa for abuse of discretion.wilson moog.pension plan,cir.aventis argues that it was an abuse of discretion to award brown the maximum damages allowed because there was no evidence of bad faith and brown suffered no harm as a result of receiving her cobra notification late because aventis provided her health benefits retroactively.
although an employer good faith and the absence of harm are relevant in deciding whether to award a statutory penalty,chesnut montgomery,cir,neither a defendant good faith nor the absence of actual injury to the plaintiff precludes the award of a statutory penalty.id.at.there is no evidence that aventis failure to provide the necessary information was anything other than an administrative caused by the company moving its offices during this time period.even so,aventis failure to act for a period of several months,despite brown repeated phone calls,could be considered bad faith.additionally,although brown did not suffer any loss of health benefits due to the delay she was forced to invest time,effort,and money in hiring an attorney to gain access to information that she was legally entitled to.thus it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to award maximum damages.
aventis also contends that it was an abuse of discretion to award the plaintiff statutory penalties under c b for aventis failure to provide a spd upon written request as required by b.the first rationale for aventis claim is that brown did not plead or contend that she had made a written demand for the spd under b nor that she was seeking civil penalties under c b.aventis also argues that these claims were not tried with the consent of the parties.however,brown first amended complaint paragraph does reference civil penalties available under erisa c.also,in response to aventis summary judgment motion,brown specifically raised issues of fact regarding aventis failure to provide the employee yearbook which contained the spd.this was adequate to put the defense on notice that brown sought damages for the failure to provide the spd.furthermore,aventis never raised any objections in the district court regarding the introduction of evidence about the spd.the appellate court will not entertain such objection regarding the admission of evidence on appeal for the first time.united states price,cir.
aventis second argument against civil penalties for failure to provide the spd is that an employer is not required to provide information about life insurance benefits upon termination as long as it previously provided a spd to the employee.while this principle is generally true,it does not apply in this case because aventis prevented brown from accessing the spd it had given her.while brown was on leave,the company maintenance staff removed the spd from her employee locker and did not return it to her.no additional copy was provided.
lastly,aventis cites fisher metropolitan life ins.in an attempt to show that brown written request was not specific enough to put aventis on notice to provide a spd,cir.fisher was denied statutory damages because his written request for information was deemed insufficient.fisher request was 
nothing more than a scribbled note at the bottom of a social security award certificate requesting,not plan documents,but rather a copy of the policies covering my contract for salary continuation.nothing in either the request or the response indicates that metropolitan knew or should have known that fisher had requested a copy of any document related to the company benefits plan.
id.brown request is distinguished from fisher in two key respects.first,it was a formal letter,sent to two separate individuals in the company.second,although brown letter did request specific information regarding cobra,it also requested notice of termination of any of her other benefits.the district court issued a finding of fact that this constituted a request for the spd.as this finding was not a clear error,it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to award civil penalties under c.
whether the order to provide a certificate of life insurance is an appropriate equitable remedy under erisa is primarily a question of law reviewed de novo.see kerr charles vatterott,cir finding that an appeal as to whether lost interest is an equitable remedy involved primarily issues of law.to the extent that the decision rests on any underlying facts,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.greater kansas city laborers pension fund superior general contractors,cir en banc.
