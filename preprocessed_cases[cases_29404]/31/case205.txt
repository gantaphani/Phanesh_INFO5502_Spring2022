background 
in,at t corporation established the at t master pension trust trust,which has the sole purpose of holding and managing the assets of various pension plans established and maintained by at t.the trust is a qualified trust under the federal,internal revenue code irc.however,it is responsible for paying federal taxes on its ubti.some of this ubti is generated by the trust investments.because of this,the trust files federal tax returns and pays federal taxes when required.
the state of many other a ubti scheme similar to that found in the irc.compare,cal.tax code,with,the primary purpose,aside from raising revenue,behind both the federal and state ubti schemes is the same ubti laws serve to even the playing field among organizations and their rivals.they accomplish this by ensuring that entities pay taxes on revenue unrelated to their purpose.that way,organizations do not receive an unfair advantage in the market based on an purpose.
the trust is tax exempt under california law just as it is under the irc thus,it pays state tax only on its ubti.since,the trust,which has approximately dollars of investments,has paid in ubti to california.according to,the trust has forgone an unquantifiable amount of income by avoiding investments.the trust also claims that it has incurred substantial administrative and fiduciary burdens as a result of the california ubti system because it has been forced to expend time and resources determining when to avoid certain investments that may generate state ubti.according to the trust,these burdens divert the trust resources away from fulfilling its primary function,which is providing retirement income to many retirees.
challenge california ubti system,arguing that erisa preempts california right to maintain it.the district court disagreed with.it held that erisa does not preempt california ubti system,and it granted summary judgment in favor of.see hattem,wl,at.
on appeal,contend that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of.of course disagree,claiming both that preemption claim is barred by the argument rejected by the district court,see id.at that erisa does not bar california tax on ubti.
we disagree that the tia bars the preemption claim,and we hold that erisa does not preempt california ubti system.we therefore affirm the district court in all respects.
discussion 
i.the tax injunction act 
the district court determined that erisa preemption claim was not barred by the tia.see id.the tia,states that district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.id.according to the supreme court,the purpose of the tia is to limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the collection of taxes.california grace brethren church,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because of this,the court has noted that the tia prohibits,in most circumstances,a federal district court from issuing an injunction preventing the collection of state taxes.id.at.the court has also held that the tia prohibits a district court from issuing a declaratory judgment holding laws unconstitutional.id.
we have explained that two conditions must exist before the tia can be invoked.see travelers ins.cuomo,cir hereinafter cuomo,rev on other grounds,state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d hereinafter travelers f irst,the surcharges must constitute taxes,and second,the state remedies available to plaintiffs must be plain,speedy and efficient.id.internal footnote omitted.neither party disputes that the tax on ubti constitutes taxes as the term relates to the tia.
as to the second requirement,that the tia bars federal review only when there is a plain,speedy and efficient remedy in state court,we have clearly held that in cases involving erisa,such a state remedy is lacking.id.at.in cuomo,we explained that erisa dictates that federal courts maintain exclusive jurisdiction over actions such as those determining whether a state tax system is preempted by erisa.see id.therefore,a plain,speedy and efficient remedy is lacking in state court as to such claims,and the tia does not bar suit in federal court id.for these reasons,we agree with the district court that the tia does not bar claim that california ubti system is preempted by erisa.
ii.erisa preemption 
erisa preempts state law in certain circumstances.according to a,the provisions of erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.id.emphasis added.although a plain reading of this statute lends itself to an extremely broad interpretation,the supreme court has greatly narrowed the scope of this section.
the court applied such a narrowed interpretation in travelers,at.in that case,the court considered whether erisa the state provisions for surcharges on bills of patients whose commercial insurance coverage is purchased by employee plans governed by erisa,and for surcharges on hmo insofar as their membership fees are paid by an erisa plan.id.at.under the surcharge system at issue,different surcharges were added to individuals hospital bills depending on the provider.see id.at.the court decided that this scheme did not violate erisa,holding that the provisions for surcharges do not relate to employee benefits plans within the meaning of erisa provision.id.at.
in reaching this decision,the court declined to interpret relate to literally.see id.at.it explained that to interpret the term literally would render congress words of limitation a mere sham.id.instead,the court concluded that a law relates to an employee benefit plan,within the meaning of a,if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.id.at.
in determining whether a given state law has the impermissible connection with or reference to such a plan,the supreme court began its analysis noting that it has never assumed lightly that congress has derogated state regulation,but instead has addressed claims of with the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law.id.at.specifically,the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by erisa unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in light of this heavy burden and precedent controlling in this circuit,it is clear that california tax on ubti is not preempted by erisa because it has neither a connection with nor a reference to an employee benefit plan.
a.the connection with prong.
in determining whether a connection with exists,we look to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide.id.at.congress intended erisa to establish the regulation of plans as an exclusively federal concern.id.specifically,congress aimed to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.this minimizes the administrative and financial burdens of complying with conflicting directives from the states,and between the states and the federal government.id.this was designed to prevent a conflict of substantive law that would require tailoring plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the laws of each jurisdiction.id.at.in sum,the basic thrust of the clause,then,was to avoid multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans,id.at,and to prevent frustrating plan administrators obligations to calculate uniform benefit levels nationwide,id.at.
in determining whether a particular state law runs afoul of these goals,the court has instructed that preemption is not called for if the state law has only a tenuous,remote,or peripheral connection with covered plans,as is the case with many laws of general applicability.id.at.emphasis added citation and internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,it is not sufficient that the law in question has an indirect economic effect on choices rather,the law must actually dictate which choices must be made.see id.at.
for instance,in holding that a system was not preempted by erisa,the supreme court,in travelers,explained that although the surcharge might make certain insurance companies more attractive purchases,they have only an indirect economic effect,which does not reach the high threshold necessary for preemption.see id.at.this is because an indirect economic influence does not actually bind plan administrators to any particular choice thus,it does not function as a regulation of an erisa plan itself.see id.it is an influence that can affect a plan shopping decisions,but it does not affect the fact that any plan will shop for the best deal it can get,surcharges or no surcharges.id.at.it is therefore insufficient that a law has the effect of increasing the costs associated with one purchase over another.id.at.c ost uniformity was almost certainly not an object of.id.at.surcharges do nothing more than leave plan administrators in the same position they would be in irrespective of the the responsibility to choose the best overall coverage for the money.id.this is true even if the surcharges impose administrative costs and burdens on benefit plans.see id.at.thus,neither an indirect source of administrative costs nor an indirect economic influence is a ground for preemption.see id.at.
in so finding,however,the court cautioned that a state law might produce such acute,albeit indirect,economic effects,by intent or otherwise,as to force an erisa plan to adopt a certain scheme,which might result in preemption.id.at.the court explained that the new york surcharges at issue in travelers did not fit into this category because they only indirectly affected the relative price of insurance policies,and that is no different from myriad state laws in areas traditionally subject to local regulation,which congress could not possibly have intended to eliminate.id.
in other cases,the court has provided additional elaboration on the connection with test.for instance,in egelhoff egelhoff,d,the court found that a state law did have an impermissible connection with an employee benefit plan.id.at.the washington statute at issue in egelhoff revoked an individual beneficiary status if the designation was made prior to a dissolution or invalidation of a marriage between the designator and the beneficiary.id.at.in finding the washington statute preempted,the court explained that the state law bound plan administrators to choose a particular beneficiary as dictated by state law,rather than as directed by the plan.id.at.the court distinguished this case from cases like travelers,explaining that egelhoff is unlike cases involving generally applicable laws where erisa has nothing to say about the issue and where the court has upheld the law despite an incidental effect on erisa plans.id.unlike these generally applicable laws,the law at issue in egelhoff governed the payment of benefits,which is a central matter of plan administration.id.at.
the court identified another distinction,which rendered the law at issue in egelhoff as having the impermissible connection with erisa plans namely,the law interfered with a nationally uniform plan administration,the creation of which was another goal of erisa.id.at.the law did this by dictating to whom the administrator must pay.see id.at.were a similar law adopted in every state,an administrator would face the laborious task of researching every state law each time it needed to pay a beneficiary.see id.this would impose precisely the type of burden erisa aimed to eliminate by creating a federal system enabling plan administrators to look simply to the plan to determine beneficiary status.id.at.additionally,the law at issue in egelhoff directly conflicted with erisa requirement that plans be administered in accordance with plan documents.id.at.for these reasons,the court found the law preempted.id.at.
this circuit has also defined the contours of connection with preemption.in a case decided before the supreme court greatly narrowed preemption in travelers,this court held that a state escheat law was not preempted by erisa.see aetna life ins.borges,cir.in so holding,this court explained that the preemption provision does not require the creation of a fully insulated legal world that excludes these plans from regulation of any purely local transaction.id.at.indeed,many state laws of general applicability affect the cost and administration of these plans,yet they are not preempted.id.if erisa were held to invalidate every state action that may increase the cost of operating employee benefit plans,those plans will be permitted a charmed existence that never was contemplated by congress.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
in determining whether a new law is preempted,we have found it helpful to examine prior laws that have not been preempted.id.at.these laws include a generally applicable garnishment law under which creditors may garnish erisa welfare benefits a law requiring companies to make severance payments when closing a plant a law prescribing the amount that hospitals can charge for care and a city income tax of general application that affects employee contributions to benefit plans.id.generalizing from these cases,we found,in aetna life,that laws that have been ruled preempted are those that provide an alternative cause of action to employees to collect benefits protected by erisa,refer specifically to erisa plans and apply solely to them,or interfere with the calculation of benefits owed to an employee.id.contrarily,t hose that have not been preempted are laws of general traditional exercises of state power or regulatory effect on erisa plans is incidental.id.
we reviewed the issue again after the supreme court,in travelers,remanded cuomo.on remand,we found state surcharges on plans not preempted by erisa.see travelers ins.pataki,cir hereinafter pataki.in pataki,we explained that a surcharge is no different than any other economic factor that weighs into a decision.id.at.the surcharge simply affects the relative costs of the various alternatives.id.echoing the supreme court,we found determinative that the surcharges do not bind an administrator decisions,rather they merely affect a plan shopping decisions.id.at.accordingly,states may create rate differentials that influence such choices.id.at.
more recently,we have expressed similar sentiments,noting that,there has been a significant change in preemption analysis that necessitates revamping our view of its scope.see gerosa savasta,cir.in gerosa,we also noted that state laws that would tend to control or supersede central erisa as state laws affecting the determination of eligibility for benefits,amounts of benefits,or means of securing unpaid typically been found to be preempted.id.at.
this precedent makes clear that california ubti system does not have an impermissible connection with an erisa plan and is therefore not preempted un
