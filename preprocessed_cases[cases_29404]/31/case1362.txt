this appeal arises from a subrogation action brought by appellant asbestos workers local welfare fund the fund against appellees thomas brewster,candace brewster,and charles snyderman,esquire.the fund was established under the employment retirement income security act of erisa for the benefit of the members of asbestos workers local local and their dependents.it operates pursuant to a summary plan description the plan and the provisions of erisa.brewster is a member of local and brewster qualifies as his dependent.brewster was injured in an automobile accident and sought to have her medical expenses paid by the fund.snyderman,who was their counsel,also achieved settlements from the tortfeasor and from the brewsters automobile insurance company.
the plan expressly required repayment of benefits from any money received from a third party for expenses paid by the fund.the fund paid brewster medical expenses,after she signed a subrogation agreement as required by the plan promising to repay to the fund an amount equal to the benefits she received from the fund.the brewsters through their counsel,snyderman,recovered the same medical expenses from a third party settlement,but did not repay the fund after being requested to do so.
the fund filed suit under erisa in the united states district court for the district of delaware seeking a declaration of its subrogation rights and a constructive trust over the settlement proceeds.the fund complaint was dismissed by the district court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the claim under erisa.the fund did not appeal that ruling.a second lawsuit brought by the fund in the court of chancery was also dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.the court of chancery transferred the case to the superior court,which granted summary judgment in favor of the brewsters and snyderman after concluding that the fund claim was preempted by federal law.
we hold that the fund state law claim is preempted by of erisa because that claim relates to the plan.the fund claim also duplicates or supplements a civil enforcement remedy available to the fund under a of erisa because there is federal jurisdictional preemption of the fund subrogation claim in this case,we affirm the judgment of the superior court.
the fund is a multiemployer employee benefit plan the plan as defined by a of erisa.the fund was established for the benefit of the members of local and operates pursuant to both the plan and the provisions of erisa.brewster is a member of local and a participant under the plan.brewster is a dependent of a plan participant as defined by the plan and.
the plan gave express subrogation rights to the fund.specifically,it provided 
when injury or injuries death for which any benefits would otherwise be payable under this are caused under circumstances which create a legal liability with some other person or party,any payment made by the plan to or on behalf of the participant shall be considered an advance only,and acceptance by the participant,dependent or provider shall constitute their agreement to repay the payments to the plan in the event a recovery is made from the other person or party.in addition,the fund shall be entitled to recover its lien directly from the third party.
subrogation means that the fund can regain,by legal action if necessary,benefits paid by it to the participant or that person insurance company or other plan or from the participant or the parties responsible for the injury 
under the plan subrogation provision,a participant has the following obligations in order to be entitled to receive the advance which is provided under this section 
to sign the standard subrogation agreement of the plan and to take such action and cooperate with plan representatives as may be necessary or appropriate to recover from any third party,as damages those payments made by the plan.even if,however,a participant fails to sign the standard subrogation agreement,will still be responsible to repay the plan in the event of a recovery.
to immediately pay to the plan any money recovered from third persons for expenses paid by the plan.
to not do anything to impair,prejudice or discharge the plan right of subrogation.
to assign to the plan the right to bring an action against any third party responsible for the injuries sustained if the participant fails to bring such action 
the plan can withhold future benefits to a participant for failure to comply with these rules.
in,brewster sustained extensive injuries in an automobile accident.brewster applied to the fund for payment of her medical bills.as a precondition for payment,brewster signed the standard subrogation agreement,contemplated by the plan,entitled asbestos workers union local welfare fund subrogation agreement the agreement.under the agreement,brewster assigned to the fund benefits paid or payable with respect to the same injury in an amount equal to the benefits received by her from the fund after brewster completed the form,the fund paid medical expenses of relating to brewster accident.
in,snyderman,on behalf of the brewsters,settled their claim against the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident for limit of the other driver insurance policy.snyderman also negotiated and settled an underinsured motorist claim against the brewster own automobile insurance company for.snyderman notified the fund of the settlements and requested that the fund provide him with the amount of its subrogation claim.
the fund requested that the brewsters reimburse all monies it paid to or on behalf of brewster under the agreement.in response,snyderman questioned the fund ability to enforce the agreement.sometime thereafter,he distributed to the brewsters and deducted of the for his attorneys fees and related expenses.according to the fund,snyderman put the remainder in escrow to reimburse the fund,but then later distributed that amount to the brewsters as well.
in,the fund filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the united states district court for the district of delaware under a of erisa seeking a declaration of its subrogation rights and an equitable lien and constructive trust over the brewsters settlement proceeds.the fund filed a parallel action in the court of chancery,which was stayed pending the outcome of the federal action.the district court dismissed the federal action in reliance upon life annuity insurance knudson concluding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction under a of erisa because that section authorized only equitable remedies.the district court reasoned that the fund was trying to recharacterize an effort to recover a money judgment against the brewsters,which had classified as a legal remedy 
thereafter,the court of chancery dismissed the parallel action for lack of equitable jurisdiction the case was then transferred to superior court pursuant to.in the superior court,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the superior court granted summary judgment in favor of the brewsters and denied the fund cross motion,concluding that,as a matter of law,the fund claim relates to an erisa employee benefit plan under a of erisa in reaching this conclusion,the superior court stated that the fund appears to be without a legal mechanism thru sic which to obtain reimbursement of the monies paid to or on behalf of brewster.this appeal followed.
the fund argues that there is no federal preemption of its state law subrogation claim.specifically,it contends that the superior court erred as a matter of law and misinterpreted the term relates to within of erisa.it also argues that the superior court erred as a matter of law by holding as had the district court that the litigation was not an equitable action under a,yet finding that the fund action could still be preempted by of erisa.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo issues of subject matter jurisdiction involve questions of law that are also reviewed de novo 
the brewsters argue that the fund claim is completely preempted by erisa.moore manual on federal practice and procedure aptly summarizes the variety of categories that have been used to describe preemption 
complete preemption applies only in the extremely limited circumstance that congress intends in a particular area to supersede both the substantive and remedial provisions of state law and create a federal remedy for violation of the law that is exclusive,even when a claimant attempts to rely entirely on state law in state court.to date,the supreme court has found only three federal statutes to have this broad preemptive scope the labor management relations act,the employee retirement income and security act,and the national bank act for claims of usury against national banks.
some courts have noted that the label of this exception is not entirely accurate,because the doctrine is not one of preemption,but rather one of federal jurisdiction.furthermore,removal and preemption are two distinct concepts,and the fact that a claim may be preempted does not necessarily establish that it is covered by federal question jurisdiction.a better term might be jurisdictional preemption because it is a doctrine that not only preempts the substantive state law but also supports federal jurisdiction to address the issue regardless of the procedural context in which the matter is brought before the federal court.it should also be noted that a claim of ordinary preemption,as opposed to complete preemption jurisdictional preemption,is not a defense to the complaint rule.ordinary preemption is an affirmative defense to the allegations in a plaintiff complaint asserting a state law claim claiming that a state law conflicts with,and is overridden by,a federal law.on the other hand,complete preemption does not constitute a defense at all.rather,it is a narrowly drawn jurisdictional rule for assessing federal removal jurisdiction when a complaint purports to raise only state law claims.it looks beyond the complaint to determine if the suit is actually and entirely a matter of federal law,even if the state law would provide a cause of action in the absence of the federal law.therefore,complete preemption creates the federal question jurisdiction requisite to removal of the claim to federal courts 
the case before us involves the issue of complete or,more appropriately,jurisdictional preemption.
our analysis begins with erisa,which has a broad preemptive purpose.in enacting erisa,one of congress principal goals was to enable employers to establish a uniform administrative scheme,which provides a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits.to effectuate that goal,of erisa provides that the provisions of this title shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan even where the causes of action do not fall under the terms of,if the state cause of action falls within the scope of the civil enforcement provision of,the action is still preempted and removable to federal district court 
in examining the congressional intent underlying,the supreme court has held that any cause of action that duplicates,supplements,or supplants the erisa civil enforcement remedy conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the erisa remedy exclusive and is therefore preempted.the policy underlying these preemption provisions is to maintain uniformity of the federal administrative scheme as the supreme court has recognized 
it is thus clear that erisa provision was prompted by recognition that employers establishing and maintaining employee benefit plans are faced with the task of coordinating complex administrative activities.a patchwork scheme of regulation would introduce considerable inefficiencies in benefit program operation,which might lead those employers with existing plans to reduce benefits,and those without such plans to refrain from adopting them.ensures that the administrative practices of a benefit plan will be governed by only a single set of regulations 
the integrated enforcement provisions of implement this policy for example,a b allows a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.section a allows a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary to use this section to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this title or the terms of the plan or to obtain other appropriate equitable relief 
in life annuity insurance knudson the supreme court explained that equitable relief under a requires that the action for restitution must seek not to impose personal liability on the defendant,but to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant possession.the court explicitly left open the issue of whether a direct action by petitioners against respondents asserting claims such as breach of contract would be by erisa.before,courts throughout the country generally found that erisa had preempted certain claims,including breach of contract actions brought to enforce reimbursement claims under a subrogation agreement after,courts were divided on the question of whether a fiduciary could enforce a subrogation provision under a in,the supreme court answered that question affirmatively in sereboff mid atlantic medical services,the sereboff case has remarkable similarities to the case before us.
in sereboff,the beneficiaries of an erisa plan were involved in a car accident and suffered injuries under its acts of third parties provision,the plan required a beneficiary who receives benefits under the plan for such injuries to reimburse mid atlantic for those benefits from a ll recoveries from a third party whether by lawsuit,settlement,or otherwise.the plan paid the beneficiaries medical expenses,and the beneficiaries sought to recover compensatory damages from the third party tortfeasors as a result of the accident the plan asserted a lien on the anticipated proceeds from the beneficiaries suit,which eventually settled.after the beneficiaries refused to reimburse the plan,the plan sought to recover the settlement proceeds due it in federal district court under a of erisa the district court found in the plan favor and the fourth circuit affirmed in relevant part to resolve a split among the circuit courts of appeal,on the question of whether a authorized recovery in these circumstances,the supreme court granted certiorari.affirming the fourth circuit,the court concluded that the relief the plan was seeking in the federal district court was equitable under a 
here,the fund,consistent with sereboff,was entitled under a of erisa to seek an equitable lien or constructive trust in federal court over the settlement proceeds the brewsters had received.that the fund sereboff claim also could be duplicated or supplemented by a state law claim to enforce the same subrogation right does not deprive a federal court of its exclusive jurisdiction under erisa as the supreme court explained in metropolitan life insurance company taylor congress has clearly manifested an intent to make causes of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of a removable to federal court.in both that case and in aetna health davila the supreme court emphasized the congressional intent to make the erisa remedy exclusive under a 
both the plan and the agreement specifically contemplated relief that the fund could seek under erisa,namely,the assignment of the settlement proceeds equal to the amount of benefits paid.even though state law also provides a cause of action to enforce subrogation rights,erisa has preempted the jurisdiction of the delaware courts over the fund equitable claim to the settlement proceeds.we agree with the superior court that brewster agreement with the fund also relates to the plan under a of erisa the plan expressly required the repayment of benefits from any money received from a third party for expenses paid by the fund.the plan also required the agreement,which brewster signed.
we also agree with the fund that the superior court erred in suggesting that the fund had no remedy to enforce subrogation.sereboff holds that there was an erisa remedy for the fund,namely,to enforce subrogation claim
