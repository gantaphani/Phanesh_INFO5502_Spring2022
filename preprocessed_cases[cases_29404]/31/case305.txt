opinion of the court 
this case requires us to determine whether an agreement by a union to purportedly indemnify or hold harmless an employer for the employer withdrawal liability to a pension plan under the employee retirement income security act of,erisa,and the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of,mppaa,is unenforceable because it violates public policy.we hold that it is not.as a result,we will vacate the district court judgment to the contrary and will remand this matter to the district court.
pittsburgh mack sales service,pittsburgh mack serviced and sold mack trucks at issue are two collective bargaining agreements cbas between pittsburgh mack and the international union of operating engineers local union the union.the cbas were effective january,through january,and applied to certain groups of employees at pittsburgh mack pittsburgh,pennsylvania,facility.the cbas provided,inter alia,that pittsburgh mack would make specific contributions to the operating engineer construction industry and miscellaneous pension fund the fund a multiemployer pension fund covered by erisa and the that the union would hold pittsburgh mack harmless for liability to the fund in excess of its specified contribution.specifically,the relevant section of the cbas hereinafter section of the cbas provided 
during the term of this agreement,the employer agrees to contribute to the fund for each man hour paid to the employees covered by this agreement.
the union will hold pittsburgh mack harmless for any liability to the fund for any amounts claimed over and above this hourly contribution.
appendix app,app.pittsburgh mack made all of the hourly contributions to the fund required under section of the cbas.the cbas also contained a successor clause,which provided that the contract would be binding on a new owner if pittsburgh mack was purchased by an outside third party.
on october,during the period that the cbas were in effect,pittsburgh mack executed a letter of intent to sell substantially all of its assets to allentown mack.during the following two weeks,the union voluntarily negotiated a new labor agreement agreements with allentown mack to govern the wages,hours and other conditions of employment for the bargaining unit employees of allentown mack after it purchased the assets of pittsburgh mack.app.complaint.a product of the union bargaining with allentown mack was that the union eliminated agreement provisions requiring hourly contributions to the fund on behalf of the bargaining unit employees.id.complaint.pittsburgh mack had no involvement in the negotiations between the union and allentown mack.
pittsburgh mack and allentown mack entered into an asset purchase agreement on december.in a letter dated november,the fund notified pittsburgh mack of its determination that pittsburgh mack had incurred a complete withdrawal from the plan on december,and made a demand on pittsburgh mack for the resulting withdrawal liability in the amount of plus interest.
in a letter dated november,pittsburgh mack advised the union of the fund demand and,in turn,demanded that the union indemnify or otherwise hold it harmless for the withdrawal liability.pittsburgh mack,in support of its demand on the union,cited section of the cbas and argued that because the alleged withdrawal liability to the plan is in addition to,and in excess of,pittsburgh mack required hourly contribution,the union is responsible for this withdrawal liability to the plan.app.the union has refused to indemnify or hold harmless pittsburgh mack for the withdrawal liability to the fund.
pittsburgh mack brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that pursuant to section of the cbas,the union is obligated to indemnify it or hold it harmless against claims for withdrawal liability by the fund.the union moved to dismiss under federal rules of civil procedure b and b,arguing,inter alia the district court lacked jurisdiction pittsburgh mack claims were not ripe and section of the cbas was unenforceable because it was contrary to public policy.
after considering a magistrate judge report and recommendation r r,the district court granted the union motion to dismiss and adopted the r r.the district court determined that section of the cbas was unenforceable as contrary to the public policy manifested in erisa and the mppaa.pittsburgh mack sales,international union of operating engineers,wl,at.in support of its determination,the district court noted that the controlling principle of the case is that congress intent that withdrawal liability under the mppaa be born by the employer,and that the employees retirement benefits be thereby protected,may not be defeated by private contractual arrangement.id.at.this appeal followed.
pittsburgh mack alleges that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to section of the labor management relations act lmra.section provides that 
suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties,without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.
a.the union contends that there is no jurisdiction under section once a cba has been terminated.it further contends that because the cbas were terminated when pittsburgh mack no longer employed union workers,the district court lacked jurisdiction.pittsburgh mack responds that the cbas were not terminated.it is unnecessary for us to resolve whether or not the cbas were terminated,however,because despite the union assertions to the contrary,the existence of a contract is not a jurisdictional element of a section claim.
this court has,in the past,noted that a prerequisite for section jurisdiction is a contract between the employer and labor organization.international brotherhood of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers of america,local.motor carriers ass n,cir.however,after the supreme court decision in arbaugh y h,d,this is no longer the case.
in arbaugh,the supreme court addressed concerns that courts were conflating and confusing subject matter jurisdiction with the need to prove the essential elements of a claim for relief.id.at.the court adopted a bright line test to determine whether a statute or a provision thereof was jurisdictional or part of the merits.id.at.the test,the court in arbaugh explained,is as follows 
if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.but when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.

the court of appeals for the sixth circuit in winnett caterpillar,cir,applied the arbaugh test to the question of whether the existence of a union contract is a jurisdictional prerequisite under section.the court in winnett held that the existence of a union contract is not a jurisdictional prerequisite under section because congress did not clearly state that the existence of such a contract was a limit on subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.in so holding,the court in winnett analyzed section,noting that the only time jurisdiction is mentioned in the statute is in the context of personal jurisdiction.id.the court observed that the statute actually relaxes jurisdiction by permitting federal courts to handle such cases without regard to the amount in controversy or the existence of diversity jurisdiction.id.finally,the court explained that because a ll of the elements of a plaintiff prima facie case for the breach of a union contract appear in the same subsection,a finding that the existence of a union contract had jurisdictional consequences would necessitate a finding that all of the other parts of the subsection were also jurisdictional in nature.id.emphasis in original.the court concluded that even if arbaugh was not considered,such a finding would suggest that congress intended to create a cause of action that has no elements,a result that the court was reluctant to reach.id.
we adopt the reasoning of the court of appeals for the sixth circuit in winnett and hold that the existence of a union contract is not a jurisdictional requirement under section.regardless of whether or not the cbas were terminated,then,the district court had jurisdiction under section.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
the union also contends that pittsburgh mack claim is not ripe.article iii of the constitution limits the judicial power of the united states to the adjudication of cases or controversies.const.art.iii.courts enforce the requirement through several justiciability doctrines that cluster about article iii.allen wright,d quoting vander jagt,bork,concurring.they include standing,ripeness,mootness,the doctrine,and the prohibition on advisory opinions.see daimlerchrysler cuno,d.
the ripeness doctrine determines whether a party has brought an action prematurely,and counsels abstention until such time as a dispute is sufficiently concrete to satisfy the constitutional and prudential requirements of the doctrine.peachlum city of york,cir citation omitted.however,r ipeness is a matter of degree whose threshold is notoriously hard to pinpoint.ne hub partners,cng transmission,cir.this is especially so in declaratory judgment actions because declaratory judgments are typically sought before a completed injury has occurred,reno,cir.
in data systems,wyse,cir,we outlined the test to determine ripeness in the declaratory judgment context.first,we analyze the adversity of the interest of the parties.id.at.though a plaintiff need not suffer a completed harm to establish adversity of interest between the parties,to protect against a feared future event,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the probability of that future event occurring is real and substantial,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.armstrong world,adams,cir quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted emphasis added.we have held that a potential harm that is contingent on a future event occurring will likely not satisfy this prong of the ripeness test.see,at armstrong,at.
second,we look to the conclusiveness of the judicial judgment,at.in analyzing this factor,we must determine whether judicial action at the present time would amount to more than an advisory opinion based upon a hypothetical set of facts.presbytery of of the orthodox presbyterian church florio,cir.p redominantly legal questions are generally amenable to a conclusive determination in a preenforcement context,so long as article iii standing exists.id.third,we look to the practical help,or utility,of that judgment,at.if all three of these requirements are met,the claim is ripe.travelers ins.obusek,cir.but see armstrong,at citing,at explaining that this list is not exhaustive of the principles courts have considered in evaluating ripeness challenges.
the union contends that pittsburgh mack has failed to meet these three factors.it argues that the first factor has not been established because pittsburgh mack has not yet actually paid any withdrawal liability,and therefore has suffered no harm.instead,payments have been made by robert arnoni,the sole remaining shareholder of pittsburgh mack.the union also argues that the second factor has not been established because the fund could pursue withdrawal liability against other individuals or commonly controlled companies,and the declaratory judgment would therefore be inconclusive.union br.at.third,the union claims that a judgment in this case would not be practical because the fund could pursue withdrawal liability against other entities,and therefore the third factor has not been established.
we disagree with the union on all three of these points,and hold that this case is ripe for adjudication.our analysis in is instructive here.in,the plaintiff,sought a declaratory judgment that the defendant was liable to it if collateral actions filed by customers established a defect in the products sold by the defendants to,and subsequently by to its customers,at.we held that declaratory judgment request was not ripe.request was based on a contingency the determination that the defendant was responsible to was only relevant if the actions between and the consumers resulted in liability based on the defendant actions.id.at.this contingency,coupled with the fact that the defendant did not yet have to admit or deny liability to based on the alleged defects in the products,resulted in an insufficient adversity of interests between and the defendant.id.at.see also armstrong,at finding that the adversity of interest prong was not met because the plaintiffs complaint was based on a of a takeover attempt of a corporation in violation of pennsylvania law and the subsequent hypothetical actions of the directors of the corporation.the facts in are distinguishable from those in this case.here,the interests of the parties are sufficiently adverse because the union has explicitly refused to indemnify or hold pittsburgh mack harmless for the withdrawal liability.furthermore,pittsburgh mack claim is not based on a has already received correspondence from the fund that pittsburgh mack is liable for withdrawal liability the first factor,then,points in favor of a finding of ripeness.
in,we also determined that the second factor,the conclusiveness of the judgment,was not met because request for declaratory relief was itself based on a contingency,so even if we issued the requested declaration,the legal status of the parties would not change nor would it be clarified,because our declaration itself would be a contingency.at.here,in contrast,the declaratory judgment will be conclusive because it will establish whether the union is obligated to indemnify or hold harmless pittsburgh mack or some derivative of it for the withdrawal liability.
finally,in,we found that the third factor,the utility of the judgment,was not satisfied because would take the same steps whether or not it was granted a declaratory judgment.id.at.in the present case,however,determining this issue is practical and useful because at the conclusion of pittsburgh mack declaratory judgment action,it will know whether or not it can proceed with an indemnification suit against the union for any withdrawal liability it has incurred.this case is therefore ripe for adjudication.
this court review of the district court order granting the union motion to dismiss is de novo.mcternan city of york,cir.in analyzing a motion to dismiss,w e must accept all factual allegations as true,construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,and determine whether,under any reasonable reading of the complaint,the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.id.quoting phillips county of allegheny,cir.a complaint may not be dismissed merely because it appears unlikely that the plaintiff can prove those facts or will ultimately prevail on the merits.id.citation omitted.
pittsburgh mack argues that public policy does not bar enforcement of section of the cbas because pittsburgh mack would still be primarily liable to the fund for the withdrawal liability,the fund would still be fully insulated from pittsburgh mack withdrawal,the union employees still would receive their full pension benefits,the mppaa stated goal of ensuring pension benefits would still be achieved,and the integrity of the collective bargaining process would be maintained.pittsburgh mack br.at.we will accept,as we must,pittsburgh mack contention that section of the cbas constitutes an agreement by the union to indemnify or hold it harmless from withdrawal liability.for the reasons that follow,we will vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
