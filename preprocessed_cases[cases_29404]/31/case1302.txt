background 
the appellants are a group of individuals formerly employed by independent life and accident insurance company independent life,an insurance company that operated primarily in the southeastern united states prior to merging with american general.beginning in the,independent life provided its employees with a generous group life insurance that stayed with independent life until retirement would retain their group life insurance coverage after retirement at company expense.
independent life provided this benefit through an welfare benefit plan the plan.while independent life revised the plan from time to time over the years,the plan consistently contained language stating that if you retire directly from active employment from the company you get to keep all or some of your group insurance additionally,at least one summary plan description spd stated that employees hired before may,will continue to be covered after they reach age or retire for the full amount of insurance in effect immediately before retirement.
at the same time,however,the termination of insurance section of the plan always stated that coverage would automatically terminate on the date of termination of this policy the spds consistently contained near identical termination of insurance language.in addition,the incarnation of the plan contained a more explicit reservation of rights provision,which stated 
although the company has established this group insurance plan with the intention of continuing it indefinitely,the uncertainty under which all businesses operate,as well as possible future changes in the law,make it necessary for the company to reserve the right to amend or terminate the plan at any time.
the appellants contend that independent life used the promise of free lifetime group coverage as a tool for recruiting and retaining agents and other employees.during discovery,the appellants offered a substantial body of evidence,consisting primarily of letters written to plan participants and deposition testimony of former independent life management,which they allege demonstrates that independent life represented to current and prospective employees that the group life benefit would never be terminated.
additionally,while the appellants concede that independent life periodically reduced the group life benefit,they contend that independent life would only make these changes prospectively.in,independent life amended the plan to cut the amount of retiree insurance coverage,but only for employees retiring after december.in,independent life terminated the retiree insurance coverage altogether,but only for employees hired after january.under the plan,retirees retained the amount of insurance in effect for them in.
the appellants further contend that,after independent life merged with american general,american general continued to represent to employees that the retiree group life benefit would never be eliminated.to demonstrate this,they offered letters that american general mailed to at least retirees in which american general confirmed the amount of each retiree group life benefit and stated,this amount will remain in effect for your lifetime.no premiums are required for continued coverage under the plan.the appellants contend that they planned for their retirement in reliance on this promise of lifetime group purchased little additional life insurance and selected life only pension disbursements that would pay their spouses nothing upon their deaths.
by letter dated september,american general informed the appellants that it was terminating the retiree group life benefit effective january.the letter explained that retirees had the option to convert to individual coverage by paying premiums established by their attained age.as the appellants were beyond retirement age,attained age conversion to permanent insurance was cost prohibitive and,thus,not a viable option for most of the appellants.
following receipt of this letter,appellant gerald jones contested the discontinuation of his life insurance benefits through the claim procedure provided under the plan.when his claim was denied,jones filed this class action in a georgia superior court in december,seeking to enjoin cancellation of the policy and to recover the cost of purchasing permanent,lifetime coverage in the amount offered by american general.american general removed the case on the basis of erisa preemption,and the district court then dismissed jones state law claims and struck jones request for a jury trial.

in july,the district court granted american general motion for summary judgment and dismissed both of the appellants remaining claims.with respect to the appellants breach of contract claim,the district court concluded that the appellants had no vested right to the retiree group life benefit,and thus,that american general was free to terminate this benefit at any time.with respect to the promissory estoppel claim,the district court concluded that the appellants could not make out a prima facie case because they failed to demonstrate that the relevant provisions of the plan were ambiguous,or that any of the appellants received an oral interpretation of any ambiguity.this appeal followed.
