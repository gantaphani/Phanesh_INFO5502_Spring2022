this is a class action lawsuit challenging the manner in which certain credits accrue in the monsanto company pension plan as inconsistent with a provision of the employee retirement income security act erisa,b h i,which prohibits defined benefit plans from ceasing or reducing an employee benefit accrual because of the attainment of any age.finding that the employees rate of benefit accrual does not decrease because of age,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants.
background 
this case has its origins in a restructuring of monsanto company pension plan monsanto converted its classic defined benefit plan into a cash balance plan.in a typical defined benefit plan,participants benefits are described as an annuity to be paid at regular retirement age.under a cash balance plan,each participant has a hypothetical account that represents the value of his or her pension benefit as a lump sum some,but not all,plans give participants the option of taking this lump sum at retirement rather than receiving annuity payments.the account is hypothetical because plan participants do not actually have individual accounts.instead,all of the plan assets are held in trust for all participants,and the employer is responsible for ensuring that the assets are sufficient to pay the promised benefits.erisa treats cash balance plans as a type of defined benefit plan.
as part of the conversion,monsanto established two different cash balance accounts for each of its employees.one account was intended to reflect only new benefits earned after conversion.the second was intended to preserve the benefits that employees had already earned at the time of conversion.only the second account,called the prior plan account or ppa,is at issue in this case.
prior to conversion,the monsanto retirement plan was not wholly standardized,meaning that the retirement options of individual employees varied.first,all employees earned an retirement benefit,which was expressed as a monthly annuity beginning at age.for example,an employee who retired at age might be entitled to receive a monthly annuity beginning at age until she died.second,some of the prior plans provided a discounted early retirement option to employees.these employees could begin receiving annuity payments as early as age,although the payments would be discounted by for each year that the employee age was less than to reflect the longer time of payment.finally,some of the prior plans provided for a subsidized early retirement option.eligible employees could begin receiving their full benefit as early as age,without taking a discounted monthly payment.
the new ppa accounts were designed to preserve each employee accrued balances,while standardizing the early retirement options of monsanto employees.first,the ppa extended to all employees the right to begin receiving full payments as early as age the most generous of the old early retirement options.second,the new plan gave all employees the opportunity to begin receiving benefits even before age.if an employee chose this option,his or her benefit would be discounted by per year for each year the participant was younger than age.it is the mechanism through which this discount was implemented that is at the center of this lawsuit.
to calculate the opening balance of each participant ppa,monsanto applied a conversion formula by which the account was credited with an amount equal to the actuarial equivalent lump sum value of the participant predecessor plan accrued benefit discounted using an interest rate of eight and percent per annum for each month,if any,by which the participant age as of january,precedes age.plan b.in other words,each employee benefit under the old plan,which had been expressed as an annuity,would be converted to a lump sum equivalent to the cost of that annuity.that lump sum would then be discounted by per year for each year younger than the employee was at the time of conversion.
once established,each individual ppa increases by way of two monthly credits pay credits and interest credits.pay credits,which are intended to reward employees for the length of their service,are equal to the current ppa balance multiplied by the monthly equivalent of per annum.employees continue to receive pay credits as long as they work for monsanto,regardless of age.interest credits are equal to the current ppa balance multiplied by the monthly equivalent of per annum.interest credits cease once the participant attains age.plan d.
in,before the effective date of the plan conversion,monsanto distributed literature to employees to explain the new plan.these communications explained that the discount applied to the initial balance of employees younger than and the corresponding credits then applied until age.each of these communications described the discount as an early retirement benefit and the interest credits as necessary to restore the full previously accrued benefit to employees.
on june,plaintiffs filed walker monsanto company pension plan,in the southern district of illinois.on september,the district court entered an order consolidating the walker action with three related actions davis solutia.employees pension plan,filed october,donaldson pharmacia pension plan,filed january,and hammond solutia.employees pension plan,filed february.the consolidated complaint alleges,among other things,that the substantively identical cash balance defined benefit plans violate erisa prohibition on ceasing or reducing an employee benefit accrual because of the attainment of any age.
on may,the district certified three identical age claims.on june,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on the claims and denied plaintiffs for summary judgment on those same claims.after additional proceedings in which the plaintiffs prevailed on an unrelated claim not challenged on appeal,the district court entered final judgment disposing of all claims with respect to all parties on september.plaintiffs timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs argument is that the plan violates erisa on its face.first,they argue that the interest credits are part of a participant benefit accrual because they are an input credited by the employer to the participant stated account balance.second,they argue that the express terms of the plan terminate this benefit when a participant reaches age.
erisa prohibits defined benefit plans from reducing an employee rate of benefit accrual because of the attainment of any age.b h i.as an initial matter,then,we must address whether interest credits,which are intended to reverse the per annum discount applied to employees opening balances,constitute benefit accrual.
erisa does not define the phrase,benefit accrual.however,we have considered its meaning previously.see cooper ibm personal pension plan,cir.in cooper,the defendant,ibm,ran a cash balance pension plan that operated in a manner similar to a defined contribution plan.each employee received a pay credit based on the employee current salary and an interest credit equal to above the treasury rate multiplied by the account balance each year.interest credits continued to accrue until retirement age,whether or not the participant ceased working for the company.at retirement,an employee could either take the balance as cash or roll it over into an annuity.id.at.the plaintiffs in cooper alleged that this plan discriminated against older workers.because a younger worker would receive more years of interest before retirement,a year of service at age would increase an employee total accrued benefit more than a year of service at the same salary at age.we rejected the cooper plaintiffs arguments,noting that it treats the time value of money as age discrimination.id.at.instead,we held that benefit accrual addresses the rate at which value is added or imputed to an account,rather than the annual pension at retirement age.id.at.in reaching this decision,we relied on the fact that ibm method of crediting retirement accounts would certainly have been permissible for a defined contribution plan.id.at see also b a requiring that,for defined contribution plans,allocations to the
