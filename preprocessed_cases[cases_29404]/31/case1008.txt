bull moose tube company caparo,and bull moose tube,collectively,the company,appeal from the judgment entered by the district court on a jury verdict in favor of charles emmenegger and robert ritzie on their claims for compensation related to a plan.the company also appeals from the court prejudgment interest award.emmenegger,ritzie,and james riley cross appeal from the order awarding the company partial cost of the supersedeas bond that the company was required to post on the first appeal of this case.we affirm.
this is the second time this case has been before us,and we refer the interested reader to the previous published opinions,cited infra,for details of the relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendants.briefly,in the first case,emmenegger,ritzie,and riley,senior executives whose employment with the company was terminated,sued the company under erisa and state law seeking compensation under a plan the psp or the plan and their severance plans.the district court determined that erisa was properly invoked and dismissed the state law claims as preempted.after a bench trial,judgment was entered for emmenegger,ritzie,and riley on all of their claims,emmenegger bull moose tube,d,and attorney fees and costs were awarded to the plaintiffs,emmenegger bull moose tube,d.
on appeal,the company challenged the jurisdiction of the district court under erisa.we affirmed in part,concluding that the severance plans were indeed erisa plans.the company did not appeal from the district court decision on the merits of the severance claims.but we vacated the judgment as to the psp claims,having determined that the psp was not an erisa plan,and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.we remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.emmenegger bull moose tube,cir.
back in the district court,the plaintiffs recast the psp claims as state law causes of action for breach of contract,and those claims were tried to a jury.the jury found for emmenegger and ritzie on a portion of their claims.before us now are appeals from the district court denial of the company motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial and from two orders of the district court.

emmenegger,ritzie,and riley were employed as senior executives at bull moose tube company bmt when it was acquired in by caparo,a company essentially owned by lord swraj paul.soon after caparo took over,a plan was put in place,in which all three plaintiffs participated.as we observed in our first opinion,the psp is an incentive plan,which also has the objectives of furthering the interests of bmt and its owner,encouraging selected managers to stay with bmt,and compensating those managers for services rendered to bmt.emmenegger,at quoting the psp.under the terms of the plan,psp shares are redeemed at either redemption value,which reflects the earnings performance of bmt,or the considerably lower book value.book value is paid to a participant who leaves bmt for any reason other than those set out in subsection.bull moose tube.phantom stock plan revised,hereinafter phantom stock plan.under of the psp,a participant may redeem his shares,once vested,for redemption value beginning five years after implementation of the program simply by making the request,and otherwise receives redemption value upon the happening of certain triggering events,such as retirement,disability,death,termination without cause,or takeover.emmenegger,at.termination of employment without cause is defined in the plan as termination for other than i willful or gross misconduct or willful or gross negligence of his duties for the corporations,ii intentional or habitual neglect of his duties for the corporations or iii theft or misappropriation of the corporations funds or the commission of a felony.phantom stock plan at definitions.
in,psp participant dave lichtfuss resigned from bmt and received book value for his shares.emmenegger and ritzie,who together with swraj paul at that time constituted the caparo,board,which administered the plan,believed the board had authorized a redistribution of those shares,six to emmenegger,nine to ritzie,nine to riley,and the rest to the remaining participants.
things went well for bmt after it was acquired by caparo,and the redemption value of the psp shares skyrocketed.notwithstanding this success,emmenegger,ritzie,and riley all were terminated in march,and emmenegger and ritzie were removed from the board the reconstituted board that decided emmenegger and ritzie were terminated with cause for purposes of psp share redemption consisted of paul,two of his sons,and two of his employees.at that time,emmenegger owned phantom shares and ritzie and riley each owned,not counting the redistributed lichtfuss shares.because of the transfer of his employment from bmt to caparo steel,riley had been compelled to request redemption of his shares at the time of the transfer,before his termination,but had not yet been paid for those shares when he was fired.indeed,none of the three plaintiffs was paid anything,not even book value,for his psp shares initially.at some point after judgment was entered in the district court following the first trial,emmenegger and ritzie finally were paid book value for their shares and riley was paid redemption value for his shares according to the terms of the plan request for redemption while still employed.
as we have explained,emmenegger,ritzie,and riley raised various claims under erisa in their initial complaint.upon remand,it having been determined there was no jurisdiction as to the psp claims,emmenegger and ritzie amended their pleadings to allege claims that the company breached its contracts with them when it failed to pay them redemption value for their shares.by this time the company had paid riley redemption value for his shares.in addition,all three plaintiffs claimed breach of contract for the company failure to pay them for the redistributed lichtfuss shares.the district court determined it had jurisdiction to try the case 
after hearing all the evidence and upon deliberating,the jury answered yes to the interrogatory did the caparo.board of directors fail to engage in a reasonable exercise of its discretion in good faith in determining that emmenegger and ritzie were terminated with cause verdict form,questions.the jury also found,however,that the redistribution of the lichtfuss shares to the plan other participants was not authorized,and emmenegger,ritzie,and riley claims regarding the lichtfuss shares were dismissed with prejudice,a decision from which the plaintiffs have not appealed emmenegger was awarded damages of,plus interest,and ritzie was awarded,plus interest.the company asserts that the court erred in denying its motion for jaml and its motion for a new trial.
the company cites three actions of emmenegger and ritzie in arguing that the termination with cause was a reasonable exercise of the board discretion in good faith.primarily,it relies on the efforts of emmenegger and ritzie to effect a redistribution of the lichtfuss shares to the remaining psp participants.emmenegger and ritzie testified that at a meeting of the caparo,board emmenegger,ritzie,and paul,it was determined that the board had authority under the terms of the plan to redistribute the shares and that in fact the board voted to do so.paul testified that he never agreed to the redistribution and that no action could be taken by the board unless he agreed,notwithstanding that the plan neither required that votes of the board be unanimous nor provided that paul could override a majority vote.the company characterizes the actions of emmenegger and ritzie as gross or willful misconduct and misappropriation of the company funds.in addition to the dispute over the lichtfuss shares,the company briefly alludes to purported evidence of a real estate transaction that it claims involved on the part of emmenegger and to the alleged poor job performance of emmenegger and ritzie at caparo steel based on these acts,the company contends that the board reasonably exercised its discretion in good faith in deciding that emmenegger and ritzie were terminated with cause.as we have said,the jury found otherwise.
a motion for judgment as a matter of law is a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.yannacopoulos dynamics,cir.we have reviewed the record in this case mindful of our charge to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and to give emmenegger and ritzie the benefit of all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence.we conclude there is ample evidence to support the jury finding that the board did not act reasonably or in good faith when it decided that emmenegger and ritzie were terminated with cause,that is,for willful or gross misconduct and misappropriation.the company takes up much of its brief citing evidence that it claims supports its position in this appeal,but has ignored evidence to the contrary,including the evidence that the company had a significant financial incentive to terminate emmenegger and ritzie with cause and thereby prevent them from receiving redemption value for their psp shares.the jury apparently believed the plaintiffs evidence on this point,and we can not say that no reasonable juror could have returned a verdict for the plaintiffs.see moring,at.the district court did not err in denying the company motion for jaml.likewise,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.
as another basis for reversal,the company contends that the verdict in favor of emmenegger and ritzie is inconsistent with the jury finding that the redistribution of the lichtfuss shares was not authorized when presented with allegedly inconsistent verdicts on appeal,we must make every effort to bring them into agreement,viewing the case in any reasonable way that makes the verdicts consistent,john labatt,cir,cert.denied,d.assuming without deciding that inconsistent verdicts in a civil case are grounds for jaml or a new trial,we nevertheless reject the company argument because we conclude that the verdicts in question here are easily reconciled and therefore not inconsistent with each other.
in finding for the company on the issue of the lichtfuss shares,the jury found any or all of three facts that the plan did not permit a redistribution that the caparo,board did not agree to a redistribution and that the board failed to reach agreement on all matters necessary for redistribution,including a carrying value for the shares.see instruction.but in order to find in favor of the company on the lichtfuss redistribution issue,the jury was not required to find that the efforts of emmenegger and ritzie to redistribute the lichtfuss shares reflected gross or willful misconduct and misappropriation.on the evidence before it,the jury might easily have found that it should have been clear to the board that emmenegger and ritzie innocently misunderstood the plan or the results of the board meetings relating to redistribution.in that case,the jury could also find,as it did,that the board therefore did not reasonably exercise its discretion in good faith when it determined that emmenegger and ritzie were fired with cause.the arguably inconsistent verdicts are reconcilable and are not grounds for reversal of the denial of the company motion for jaml or a new trial.
the company also argues that the district court erred in refusing to give its proposed jury instructions explaining the meaning of good faith as that term is used elsewhere in the instructions and in the verdict form relating to the issue of termination with cause.the phrase was relevant to the jury deliberations because the terms of the psp give the board authority to administer the plan in the reasonable exercise of its discretion in good faith.phantom stock plan at.nowhere in the plan,however,is good faith explained or defined.the court agreed with emmenegger and ritzie that good faith likewise did not need to be defined for the jury and rejected the proposed instructions.
we review claims of error in instructions for abuse of discretion.cox dubuque bank trust,cir.where the trial court elects not to give proposed instructions,we will find such an abuse only if the proposed instructions correctly state the law,concern a matter not otherwise covered by the charge to the jury,and involve a point so important that the court refusal to give the instructions seriously impaired the party ability to present an effective case.yannacopoulos,at citations to quoted cases omitted.because the company case was not impaired,that is,there was no prejudice to the company from the district court rejection of the instructions,see cox,at,we do not consider elements and.
the proposed instructions defined good faith as the state of mind denoting honesty of purpose,freedom from intention to defraud,and faithfulness to one duty or obligation.proposed instructions,alt.the company asserts that i f the jury had been given this definition,and had it considered the caparo board actions within the framework of the question whether there was evidence of dishonesty or intention to defraud,the outcome of this case likely would have been different inasmuch as there was no such evidence.brief of appellants at.even though the proposed definition does not set out the three good faith factors in the alternative,but apparently requires that a jury find of all of them if one is to prove good faith,the company does not argue there was no evidence of the board lack of faithfulness to its duty or obligation.in any event,as we have discussed,we think there was ample evidence that the board did not act with honesty of purpose in firing emmenegger and ritzie with cause,given the company financial incentive to avoid paying the men redemption value for their psp shares.the rejection of the tendered instructions explaining good faith was not an abuse of discretion and is not grounds for reversal.
the district court,stating that i do not believe that missouri law gives me any discretion to deny the requested prejudgment interest from the time the payments were due until the date of this judgment,awarded in prejudgment interest to emmenegger and in prejudgment interest to ritzie.memorandum opinion at.the company contends that the district court erred in concluding that it had no discretion regarding the calculation and proposes that any award of prejudgment interest for the time during which the plaintiffs pursued their case under erisa should be either denied altogether or calculated using the lower federal rates of prejudgment interest for that period we review de novo the question of law raised by the company.swope,cir.whether the rate of prejudgment interest in a diversity case should be that specified by state law rather than the federal prejudgment rate is a question of law and should be reviewed de novo,cert.denied,d.
in a diversity case,the question of prejudgment interest is a substantive one,controlled by state law see swope,at happy chef,john hancock mut.life ins,cir.under missouri law,as relevant here,c reditors shall be allowed to receive interest at the rate of nine percent per annum,when no other rate is agreed upon,for all moneys after they become due and payable,on written contracts,and on accounts after they become due and demand of payment is made.as a general rule,a n award of prejudgment interest in a case where is applicable is not a matter of court discretion it is compelle
