background 
defendant is a canadian company with its principal place of business in canada.it does not maintain a place of business,employ individuals,serve customers,or have a designated agent for service inside the united states.in april,defendant purchased of the stock of fleming packaging corporation fleming.fleming was a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in peoria,illinois.defendant did not direct or control the daily affairs of fleming.defendant and fleming maintained separate payrolls,bank accounts,and leases and filed separate tax returns.
fleming,as a consequence of the collective bargaining agreements of its subsidiaries,was required to contribute to plaintiff,a pension plan in may,fleming filed for bankruptcy.thereafter,fleming assets were sold.plaintiff argues that when fleming assets,which included its subsidiaries,were sold,fleming withdrew from the fund,see,and thereby incurred withdrawal liability,see id.plaintiff now seeks to collect from defendant for fleming withdrawal from the fund.
prior to fleming demise,defendant had considerable involvement with fleming creditors.in,fleming entered a loan agreement with bank one.in the years that followed,fleming defaulted on the loan,and amended the loan agreement several times.as a result of fleming continuing financial difficulties,in,defendant increased its ownership in fleming to in march,three members of the goldfarb family,martin,stanley,and alonna,were elected as fleming officers and also accounted for of the seats on its board of directors.at that time,martin and alonna were officers,directors,and shareholders of defendant.although not an officer,stanley was also a director and shareholder of defendant.in december,defendant presented a restructuring plan to fleming lenders,but the lenders rejected the plan and declared fleming in default in february.
in march,fleming and bank one amended the loan agreement to require fleming to sell two of its businesses.on the same day,defendant and bank one entered into a subsequent private agreement,containing a michigan clause,which provided that when fleming sold these businesses,defendant would make a secured,subordinated loan to fleming for million.
in july,the goldfarbs met with bank one representatives in canada before a scheduled fleming board meeting.at that meeting,defendant indicated that it would not fulfill its promise to infuse million into fleming upon the sale of its businesses.the goldfarbs notified bank one that they planned to use some of the profits from the sale of two divisions of fleming to restructure fleming and that they planned to consolidate fleming peoria operations and close others.at the fleming board meeting,fleming learned of defendant negotiations regarding the million loan to fleming.the other lenders at the meeting rejected the restructuring plan that fleming had presented to bank one earlier and insisted that fleming hire an independent consultant.on august,alonna goldfarb traveled to peoria,illinois,on behalf of defendant.the nature of this trip is unknown.
in september,fleming sold part of its peoria operations causing bank one to demand the million originally promised by defendant.defendant sought to condition this loan on bank one providing additional money for restructuring.after negotiations between defendant and bank one,defendant loaned fleming of the million.defendant also agreed to advance an additional million to fleming if the lenders funded fleming operations until july.however,between december and january,the lenders rejected fleming proposals to continue operating,sought to have fleming and its assets sold,gave notice of default,and retained bankruptcy lawyers.
in february,the lenders,fleming,some of fleming subsidiaries,and defendant negotiated and executed the fifth amendment to the loan agreement.in the agreement,the lenders agreed to delay exercising their default rights if defendant relinquished control of fleming to george gialenios,who was hired in to develop fleming restructuring plan.in exchange,defendant would receive of fleming sale proceeds and the lenders and bank one agreed not to enforce defendant remaining obligations as to the million promised under defendant march agreement.one of the purposes of the fifth amendment to the loan agreement was for the lenders to temporarily forebear from exercising their rights and thereby permit fleming to develop,implement and complete a program for sale of fleming operations as a going concern.in early february,the goldfarbs resigned from fleming board and defendant executed an irrevocable proxy permitting gialenios to vote its shares 
on april,martin goldfarb reported to defendant board of directors that the banks had taken over fleming and he had been informed by the investment banker that the original negotiated sale was not proceeding,but he was not otherwise informed of their progress.in may,fleming filed for bankruptcy.in july,the bankruptcy trustee brought an adversary proceeding against defendant involving many of the same transactions and events alleged in this case.
according to joanna anderson,an asset manager for bank one who was involved in the sale of fleming,defendant initially did not intend to cooperate in any way in the bankruptcy,restructuring or liquidation of fleming,but eventually agreed to give up control during the sale process.in her notes,anderson remarked that the lenders plan was to set the path of how the sale will occur in the sales process before control is transferred.anderson noted that no bankruptcy would occur until the lenders found a buyer.thereafter,the plan was to file for bankruptcy and run a auction.however,according to anderson,it was not until after the fifth amendment to the loan agreement was signed that fleming actively sought out buyers.
ii.procedural history 
in june,plaintiff filed this suit seeking to collect withdrawal liability payments from defendant,and the matter was referred to magistrate judge byron cudmore.in response to defendant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the magistrate judge entered a report and recommendation recommending dismissal.the magistrate judge reasoned that although defendant had sufficient minimum contacts with the united states,plaintiff was unable to show that its claim arose from or was related to defendant contacts.the magistrate judge also recommended that plaintiff request for further discovery be denied because further information about matters such as alonna goldfarb trip to peoria and defendant negotiations with fleming lenders was unrelated to plaintiff claim.
the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommendation and reasoning,finding that plaintiff claims did not arise out of defendant minimum contacts with the united states.the court found that defendant contacts with the united states arose from its involvement with fleming lenders.however,the court noted that these contacts did not involve fleming withdrawal from the fund,which serves as the basis for plaintiff claim.specifically,the court found that defendant had relinquished its control over fleming well before fleming withdrew from the fund,and pointed out that fleming lenders were the ones that originally sought to have fleming sold in january.in addition,the district court found that defendant interactions with the lenders had no impact on the collective bargaining agreements entered into by fleming subsidiaries.the district court also denied defendant request for further discovery,agreeing that the limited discovery sought would not relate to plaintiff claim.
