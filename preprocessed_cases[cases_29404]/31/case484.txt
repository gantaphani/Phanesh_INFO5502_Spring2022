this is an appeal of the district court grant of summary judgment upholding the denial of appellant laurie cooper claim for continued disability benefits under the hewlett packard company disability plan the plan,governed by et erisa.cooper argues that she was denied a full and fair review of her claim and that the denial of benefits was an abuse of discretion because it was not supported by substantial evidence.based on the following analysis,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
laurie cooper worked for for years in the position of content manager,which involved writing documentation regarding how to accomplish certain technical solutions at.most of her work was performed in front of a computer.as a result of her employment at,cooper became eligible to receive benefits under the plan.benefits provided by the plan are funded by,and administered by vpa,vpa.
on march,cooper stopped working at hp.cooper,then years old,applied for short term disability std benefits pursuant to q i of the plan because of neck and back pain she had been experiencing.section q i definition of totally disabled provides that d uring the first weeks following the onset of an injury or sickness,the participant is unable to perform the material and essential functions of his usual occupation in the participating company.the plan defines usual occupation as the customary work assigned to the participant by the participating company which employs the participant and performed on the participant customary schedule in support of her claim,cooper submitted medical evidence,including reports from her psychiatrist,riaz mazcuri,and another treating physician,mehboob nazarani,documenting chronic back pain,depression,bipolar disorder,and generalized anxiety.on april,vpa approved cooper application for std benefits under q i.
following the initial period of std benefits under q i,cooper applied for long term disability benefits under q ii of the plan.section q ii provides that a participant is totally disabled under that section if a fter the initial week period and prior to the month period following the onset of injury or sickness,the participant is unable to perform the material and essential duties of his own occupation.the plan defines own occupation as the type of work in which the participant was engaged prior to the onset of his total disability and is not limited to the participant usual occupation or to jobs that provide any particular earnings level.cooper submitted evidence of her continuing chronic back pain,depression,bipolar disorder,and generalized anxiety from her treating physician,arthur tullidge.based on this evidence,vpa determined that cooper was eligible for disability benefits under q ii,effective september.
on september,vpa again contacted cooper regarding continuing eligibility for disability benefits,under q iii of the plan.the q ii period of benefits would end on march,and vpa gave cooper the opportunity to present any other diagnoses by any other treating physicians.section q iii imposes a stricter standard for eligibility than those in q i and ii,requiring a participant to demonstrate that she is unable to perform any occupation for which he is or may become qualified by reason of his education,training or experience not just the participant usual occupation or own occupation.additionally,vpa notified cooper that,unlike under q i and ii,under q iii nervous or mental disorders are disregarded in the determination of the participant disability.
in support of her claim for benefits under q iii,cooper submitted medical documentation from several physicians and other medical professionals relating to procedures she underwent to treat her chronic back pain and resulting pain management procedures.on november,james rose,a neurosurgeon who examined cooper following her october,anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery,remarked that cooper neck and hand were healing well and that cooper main problem was a possible kidney stone.margarita lyons,one of cooper pain management providers,examined cooper on january.during the examination,cooper reported that she was feeling much,much better since the surgery,and that she had been able to decrease all her medications,had started an exercise regimen,planned to lose weight,and was looking for a job.cooper ranked her pain on a scale of to with being the worst and to being acceptable currently as,usually as to,least pain as,and most pain as.lyons noted further,the patient has been doing remarkably well.she has been able to decrease some of her medications.she has noted she has a mild increase in anxiety however,with regard to her pain,she is doing very well.on january,tullidge noted that cooper condition was improved,and that cooper said the pain was gone and that she was feeling so much better.madhuri are,also cooper pain management provider,examined cooper on april.cooper reported to are that her pain level was currently,and usually was a.her least pain was a and most pain was a,with as the acceptable pain level.are found some tenderness in cooper axial region and lower back,but documented that cooper was in no acute distress,had a good range of motion,and had scars.
vpa ordered an independent medical evaluation before determining whether to grant or deny benefits to cooper under q iii.andres keichian,a neurologist,conducted the independent medical evaluation.in his april,report,keichian found that cooper had a moderate range of motions limitation of the cervical and lumbar spine.in evaluating her physical capabilities,keichian determined that cooper was able to stand,walk,sit,and drive for up to four hours each per day for one hour each at a time occasionally to lift up to pounds,bend,squat,crawl,reach above shoulder level,and fine manipulate with both hands and frequently to and simple grasp with both hands.vpa also referred cooper file,including keichian report,to a vocational specialist,renee lange.lange used cooper medical history,including the physical capabilities determined by keichian,to identify jobs in cooper geographic area that cooper could perform notwithstanding her physical restrictions.based on this information,lange identified three manager,computer operations manager,and department cooper could perform and that would not require sitting or standing for more than an hour at a time and allowed for alternating positions.furthermore,lange noted these occupations allowed for modifications such as a workstation.
on july,vpa denied cooper claim for benefits under q iii the claim denial letter stated that medical and vocational evidence demonstrated that,while cooper may have been unable to return to her former position as content manager,she was capable of performing other occupations for which she was qualified or could become qualified by the date on which her disability benefits under q ii ended.vpa highlighted cooper improving medical condition,specifically referring to the comments of rose and keichian.vpa also explained that the vocational specialist had considered cooper education,training,and experience in addition to keichian evaluation in finding that cooper could perform the jobs of program manager,computer operations manager,and department manager.vpa noted the fact that cooper needed to change physical positions every hour in deciding that cooper could perform the above three occupations.
on february,cooper appealed vpa decision.in support of her appeal,cooper submitted further medical documentation from rose.this documentation included a november,note in which rose remarked that the fusion of course was healing pretty well at cooper and discs.he also commented,however,that cooper continue d to have some discomfort and neck pain which was aggravated by her work.rose stated that while the discs that had been operated upon were healing well,cooper had degenerative disc disease at other levels above and below the fusion and that he thought this problem was giving cooper pain to the point where she was disabled from her work.he commented that he thought cooper had a significant physical disability and that her condition has prevented her from doing any meaningful work,especially doing her usual work,which is working at a computer and the like and writing.rose concluded that cooper had found that she could not work because of the increased pain.
additional notes submitted from tullidge,cooper treating physician,dated march,stated that cooper would start working at the jewelry store next week,that cooper condition was stable,and that cooper was not happy about ending of long term disability.in notes from april,tullidge commented that cooper was working part time,experiencing pain,and tolerat ing med ication on june,tullidge noted that cooper was working part time hours per week and made no reference to any complaints of pain on the part of cooper.on september,cooper saw are,one of her pain management providers,for an examination following an epidural injection to reduce pain.are documented that cooper had increased pain and pain going down her left thigh to her knee.are remarked that cooper was in no acute distress and had intact reflexes.are examined cooper again on october.on that date,cooper ranked her pain as a.are again documented that cooper was in no acute distress and had intact reflexes,and commented that she had some tenderness in the low lumbosacral region as well as painful flexation.are scheduled cooper for a caudal epidural steroid injection which was performed the following day,october.
at a january,visit with are after the epidural injection,cooper reported that pain control following the injection did not last very long,and that her pain was currently at the.during another examination by are on february,cooper ranked her pain as currently at.are remarked that cooper was working at a jewelry store as a sales clerk and was abiding by her restrictions of no prolonged sitting or standing for more than minutes.he noted that cooper was in chronic pain due to disc bulges in her thoracic and lumbar spine,that he strongly doubt ed she was able to work on a basis,and that she was very restricted in her abilities and mobility due to her chronic disabling pain from disc disease.
vpa requested and received copies of cooper pay stubs from her employment as a sales clerk at the jewelry store.the pay stubs indicated that cooper had been working between to hours at ben bridge jewelers per pay period since the date her disability benefits ended on april.vpa also considered cooper application for social security disability benefits.on july,the social security administration denied cooper application because of her work and the amount she earned.in an april,letter,cooper counsel stated that it was his understanding that cooper was denied social security disability benefits because of her part time job at the jewelry store.
on may,vpa denied cooper claim on appeal.the denial letter noted cooper examination by physicians assistant lyons when cooper reported that her symptoms were much better and ranked her pain level at.the letter further stated that vpa had attempted to contact keichian following cooper request that vpa clarify information with him,but that keichian had not responded to vpa repeated requests for information.vpa did repeatedly note that the fact that cooper was actually working supported its conclusion that cooper could not establish her inability to perform any occupation as required to qualify for continuing benefits under the plan.on may,apparently in response to vpa earlier request,keichian sent a letter to vpa,stating that t he primary diagnoses of cooper that impair her ability to work are cervical laminectomy and fusions,persistent spinal pain,and bipolar disease.she also has a retroperitoneal tumor resected,of unclear prognosis.in view of her medical pathology,cooper is totally disabled and unable to be gainfully employed.
cooper filed this action against the plan on september.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plan on january.reviewing vpa decision under the abuse of discretion standard,the district court rejected cooper position that vpa had shifted the grounds for denying cooper claim.the district court noted that,while vpa weighed cooper new employment as strong evidence that cooper did not meet the q iii standard,cooper lost her appeal on the same specific grounds as she lost the initial claim her improved medical condition.the district court determined that substantial evidence supported vpa denial of cooper claim for disability benefits,finding that no doctor had opined that cooper was unable to perform any occupation within the meaning of q iii.the district court highlighted the vocational specialist finding that cooper was capable of performing three occupations,and the fact that cooper herself reported feeling better and planning to lose weight and look for a job.that cooper did begin employment a few months later,the district court found,tended to confirm that vpa was correct in relying on the signs of improvement shown by the vocational specialist report and on cooper statements about her medical improved condition.cooper timely appealed.

when an erisa benefits plan provides the plan administrator with discretionary authority to construe the terms of the plan,the plan administrator denial of benefits is reviewed for abuse of discretion gosselink american,cir.abuse of discretion review is synonymous with arbitrary and capricious review in the erisa context.meditrust,at.when reviewing for arbitrary and capricious actions resulting in an abuse of discretion,we affirm an administrator decision if it is supported by substantial evidence.id.at.substantial evidence is more than a scintilla,less than a preponderance,and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.ellis liberty life assurance of boston,cir.a decision is arbitrary only if made without a rational connection between the known facts and the decision or between the found facts and the evidence.meditrust,at citation omitted.
first,cooper argues that she was denied the full and fair review mandated by of erisa because vpa did not provide review of its specific basis for rejecting her claim.to comply with the full and fair review requirement in deciding benefit claims under erisa,a claim administrator must provide the specific grounds for its benefit claim denial.robinson aetna life ins,cir.challenges to erisa procedures are evaluated under the substantial compliance standard see lacy fulbright jaworski,cir.viewing her appeal in light of the substantial compliance standard,we conclude that cooper received a full and fair review of the specific grounds upon which her benefit claim was initially denied.
cooper claim that vpa changed its basis for denying her claim on appeal is without merit.vpa basis for denying cooper claim on appeal was the very same as its original basis the fact that her medical evidence failed to establish that she was incapable of employment cooper claim for disability benefits was originally denied because,based upon a review of the medical evidence in her record,it was determined that she could perform the following jobs program manager computer operations manager and department manager.when cooper appealed vpa initial decision,her own medical records from anderson cancer center indicated that she was employed at ben bridge jewelers,thus,on appeal,vpa reviewed its original assessment of the medical evidence that is,the assessment that she was capable of employment,coupled with her medical records from anderson cancer center indicating she was in fact employed,and concluded that its original assessment regarding cooper lack of a total disability was correct.
cooper,however,contends that vpa changed its original grounds for denying her claim when,on administrative appeal,vpa referenced cooper subsequently acquired of referring exclusively to the medical and evidence the administrator relied upon in the original denial of benefits.to support this position,cooper relies on this court decision in robinson,in which this court held that section requires an administrator to provide review of the specific ground for an adverse benefits decision.at.cooper,therefore,avers that because vpa highlighted the anderson cancer center records proving her employment in its review letter denying her claim,vpa failed to lawfully provide review of the specific grounds for the administrator original adverse benefits decision.
cooper interpretation of robinson is mistaken,and provides the court with the opportunity to highlight the significant differences between the bait and switch tactic at issue in robinson,and the honest,fair,and full review cooper received here,with vpa.cooper argument that robinson applies is misplaced because although the vpa mentioned a new,additional fact that the administrator had not considered in the initial denial of her claim this new fact being her employment,the mention of that new fact did not constitute different or separate specific grounds for the initial denial of cooper claim.instead,the specific ground remains the same the administrator denied her claim on the grounds that she failed to demonstrate with sufficient medical evidence that she was unable to perform any occupation as required under q iii of the plan.the fact that cooper is now gainfully employed does not provide the vpa with a different basis for affirming the administrator initial denial of cooper claim,but rather,it provides the vpa with a concrete affirmation that the administrator original assessment of the medical evidence in the record was correct.
thus,while the court agrees with cooper that robinson mandates that as a claimant,she be specifically notified of the reasons for an administrator decision regarding the denial of her application at,the court disagrees with cooper that she was not notified of the specific reasons supporting the administrator decision in her case.the present case does not contain the bait and switch tactic this court was presented with in robinson in contrast to robinson,this is not a case where the claimant claim was initially denied based on a factual assessment that the claimant was physically capable of performing a certain task necessary to a certain occupation,and then on administrative appeal,denied based on a new interpretation from a vocational expert that the performance of that task was no longer considered necessary to the claimant ability to maintain that certain occupation.that is,in the present case,vpa did not change the analysis at hand to conclude that the original basis for denying cooper claim had become superfluous,but instead,vpa observed that this new evidence merely supports the vpa conclusion that the original assessment of the medical and vocational evidence on record is correct.
the dissent mistakenly reads our precedent in both robinson and lafleur.health serv.indem,cir,as requiring us to conclude that cooper did not receive a fair and full review.as support for this proposition,the dissent cites vpa review letter on appeal,specifically the sentence as a result,cooper does not meet the any occupation definition of disability noted above.according to the dissent,vpa use of a s a result,following its discussion of cooper employment,indicates that the basis for vpa decision on appeal changed from cooper ability to maintain employment to the fact that she is maintaining employment.such a shift does not indicate a shift in the basis that first formed vpa decision,but rather,highlights two different aspects of the same basis for denying cooper claim her ability to maintain employment.the shift in language the dissent points to constitutes nothing more than a technical noncompliance.in both robinson and lafleur,this court recognized that such a technical noncompliance with erisa procedures will be excused so long as the purpose of section has been fulfilled.lafleur,at quoting robinson,at.
in the present case,there can be no doubt that the purpose of section has been fulfilled.id.the purpose of section is to afford the beneficiary an explanation of the denial of benefits that is adequate to ensure meaningful review of that denial.id.quoting schneider sentry long term disability,cir.and in robinson,we concluded the purpose behind mandating review of the specific ground for a termination was to encourag e the parties to make a serious effort to resolve their dispute at the administrator level before filing suit in district court.at.
here,cooper received notice that her claim was denied because vpa considered her capable of employment.it should come as no surprise that on appeal,vpa would consider her employment to be an affirmation that its original assessment of the medical evidence was correct.because vpa initial reason for denying cooper claim was the conclusion that her medical evidence indicated she was capable of employment,we can not read to require vpa to blind itself to the fact that cooper,on appeal,is arguing she can not maintain simultaneously maintaining employment.it is an insurmountable challenge to imagine just how requiring administrators to ignore the disability claimant medical records mentioning a claimant current employment would serve to resolve a dispute before it reaches the district court.
that is,were we to agree with the dissent and send cooper claim back to vpa based on the dissent analysis,we would be sacrificing the true statutory purpose behind section fair and full review for an unfortunate adherence to counterproductive technicalities.to attribute such a flawed reading to would make a mockery of erisa full and fair review and undermine the integrity of the administrative process as whole.
where the evidence of subsequently acquired employment merely serves to support the administrator original decision to deny the claimant claim based on the medical evidence contained within the record,we decline to interpret as requiring vpa to blind itself to the fact that the claimant is asserting she can not maintain employment and simultaneously maintaining employment.cooper had an adequate and fair opportunity to put forth evidence demonstrating that she can not maintain any occupation as required under q iii of the plan.the record reveals that she failed to adequately do so.
cooper also contends that there is no concrete evidence to support vpa finding that she not unable to perform any occupation,as required by q iii of the plan cooper relies heavily on keichian may,addendum letter to vpa,which stated that t he primary diagnoses of cooper that impair her ability to work are cervical laminectomy and fusions,persistent spinal pain,and bipolar disease.she also has a retroperitoneal tumor resected,of unclear prognosis.in view of her medical pathology,cooper is totally disabled and unable to be gainfully employed.we are not persuaded that this evidence undermines support for vpa decision that cooper was not disabled as defined under q iii of the plan.there is no evidence to show that keichian examined cooper during the time between his original concluded that cooper could stand,walk,sit and drive for one hour each at a time,for a total of four hours per day of each his addendum.his addendum does not cancel out the specific findings in his original evaluation.furthermore,keichian conclusory statement that cooper is totally disabled does not suffice to establish disability under the language of the plan,a determination which is a legal conclusion left to the plan administrator.frank barnhart,cir noting that a doctor conclusion that a social security disability applicant is disabled or unable to work is not a medical opinion entitled to deference,but rather a legal conclusion reserved to the commissioner.rose and are statements to the effect cooper was incapable of meaningful work and work though entitled to some similarly inconclusive of the determination of disability under the language of the plan.under q iii,cooper was required to demonstrate she was unable to perform any occupation there were no limitations as to earnings level,or whether the work was meaningful or gainful employment.
support for the plaintiff claim is not controlling because we must defer to the administrator decision if the plan administrator denial is supported by substantial evidence.ellis,at we are aware of no law that requires a district court to rule in favor of an erisa plaintiff merely because he has supported his claim with substantial evidence,or even with a preponderance.vpa conclusion that cooper is not disabled as defined in q iii of the plan is supported by substantial evidence.lange,the vocational specialist,found that cooper was able to perform three occupations based on the physical activities that keichian found her capable of performing program manager,computer operations manager,and department manager.furthermore,are noted significant improvements in cooper condition and acknowledged cooper ability to perform work.the letter denying cooper claim on appeal noted that cooper had to establish she was disabled,under q iii of the plan,by march,the day her initial period of disability benefits under another part of the plan,q ii,ended.approximately three months before the date on which cooper needed to qualify for benefits under q iii,lyons noted that she had been able to decrease all medications,had started an exercise regimen,planned to lose weight,and was looking for a job.
cooper claims that no concrete evidence supports vpa conclusion is even further undermined by the fact that tullidge,her own treating physician,stated on march,that she would start working at the jewelry store next week,that cooper condition was stable,and that cooper was not happy about ending of long term disability.in notes from april,tullidge commented that cooper was working part time,experiencing pain,and tolerat ing med ication on june,tullidge noted that cooper was working part time hours per week and made no reference to any complaints of pain on the part of cooper.that is,the medical evidence in the record indicates not only that cooper hypothetically could maintain employment,but rather,her medical records demonstrate that at the time of vpa initial july,decision,cooper was maintaining gainful employment.
thus,we conclude that the record contains substantial evidence to support vpa conclusion that cooper did not meet the definition of total disability since following the termination of her benefits under q ii of the plan,she was not unable to perform any occupation as required by q iii.
based on the foregoing analysis,the judgment of the district court upholding the administrator denial of benefits is affirmed.
the majority deviates from the substantial compliance standard and affirms vpa decision based on a reason vpa never gave when it initially terminated cooper benefits.we may typically affirm the district court on any grounds in the record to support the judgment.mangaroo nelson,cir.this is not our standard,however,when we review the procedural adequacy of an administrator review of a benefit termination,as substantial compliance with requires that a plan administrator disclose the precise basis for its decision so that beneficiaries can adequately prepare for any further administrative review,as well as an appeal to the federal courts.schadler anthem life ins,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.at the review stage,vpa based its decision solely on a ground raised for the first time,which cooper has never had an opportunity to contest on the merits at the administrative level.it is not our task to recast this flawed review as having had another basis,as such a result deprives cooper of her right to a full and fair review mandated by.see lacy fulbright jaworski,cir.accordingly,i dissent.
vpa review of cooper original benefits termination did not comport with the requirements set out in and this court interpretation of those requirements.erisa requires that every employment benefit plan provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant and afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.emphasis added.in robinson aetna life ins,this court interpreted these subsections to require a review of the specific reasons given in the initial claim denial rather than a review of the termination of benefits generally,cir.an erisa claimant is confined to the administrative record when appealing her denial of benefits to the courts.following her initial denial,the claimant sole opportunity to submit evidence for inclusion in the record is at the administrative appeal stage.it therefore is imperative that the administrator give the specific reasons for its denial of a claim so that the claimant has a fair opportunity to gather evidence to submit for the record,with which the claimant will challenge the specific reasons for denial where a claimant is not given a review of the specific reasons for the original termination of her benefits,she is denied her right to a full and fair review guaranteed under.robinson,at.
i would hold that cooper was denied a full and fair review because,just as the court found in robinson the specific reason for terminating cooper benefits has never been reviewed at the administrative level.id.both parties agree that cooper benefits were originally terminated on the basis that cooper spinal condition had improved to the point that she would not meet the q iii definition of totally disabled.a different reason cooper employment at ben bridge jewelers,which she acquired after the relevant date to determine benefit given for her benefit termination on appeal.the majority attempts to characterize vpa decision on appeal as one based on cooper medical evidence,with cooper new employment serving merely as support for the administrator original decision to deny the claim based on the medical evidence contained within the record.the plain reading of the review letter supports no such interpretation.
in regard to the medical evidence supporting cooper improved health sole reason given for cooper original termination of page,review letter offered only three terse sentences 
during the office examination,cooper reported that her symptoms were much better.she reported a decrease in pain medications,starting an exercise regiment,and was looking for a job.she ranked her pain at 
these sentences offer no insight on the propriety of vpa original determination regarding whether these improvements disqualified cooper from meeting the definition of total disability.rather,they are mere recitations of facts contained in the record accompanied by no analysis.the majority states that these sentences immediately followed a discussion of the significance of the medical evidence on record that established cooper was capable of employment.the paragraphs in question,however,provide no discussion or analysis of the evidence.rather,they contain only a listing of cooper ailments,rote descriptions of the procedures she underwent to correct them,and descriptions of documents in the record that attest to these facts.these paragraphs are analogous to the fact section in a judicial opinion,as they contain no language weighing or judging the evidence.the actual analysis of the claim begins with a paragraph discussing cooper employment 
as you are aware,cooper claim and appeal are being reviewed based on the definition of total disability noted above we noted in the medical records from anderson cancer center that cooper was employed at ben bridge jewelers.
thereafter,vpa focuses on the ben bridge jewelers job throughout the remainder of the letter.
the majority nevertheless suggests that cooper jewelry store employment,which cooper accepted only after the relevant deadline for establishing her benefit eligibility,and thus could not have been considered at the time of her original benefit termination,was simply support for vpa ultimate con
