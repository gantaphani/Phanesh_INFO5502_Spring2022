kathy joy kirkendall kirkendall is a longtime employee of dresser rand company dresser rand.dresser rand was a partnership,first between dresser industries,dresser and ingersoll rand company ingersoll,and later between halliburton,halliburton and ingersoll.in,halliburton sold its interest in dresser rand to ingersoll and subsequently informed dresser rand employees that,for pension plan purposes,it now considered their date of termination to be march of.as a consequence,kirkendall pension benefit for the amount she would receive if she retired early was not as high as previously quoted to her.
in,kirkendall and her filed this putative class action suit without first availing themselves of the procedure described for benefits claims in the plan documents.their suit,brought pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa,included claims for redetermination of benefits and for improper amendment of plan terms.the district court held that kirkendall complaint must be dismissed because she had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and because she had not alleged an actual amendment of the plan terms.we hold that because kirkendall reasonably interpreted the plan exhaustion requirement not to apply to a determination of future benefits and did not exhaust her administrative remedies as a result,she was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies.we also hold that halliburton actions did not constitute an amendment within the meaning of erisa g.g.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court insofar as it dismissed plaintiffs claims for failure to exhaust and affirm the district court judgment insofar as it denies plaintiffs claims relating to improper amendment,and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
kirkendall and her,wesley snyder,barbara caya,and bonnie seth,were all employees of dresser rand in february of.dresser rand was formed as a partnership between dresser and ingersoll on january.dresser rand employees received pension benefits through the dresser industries.consolidated retirement plan the dresser plan,which was sponsored by dresser.
in september,halliburton became the successor by merger to dresser and sponsor of the dresser plan.effective february,halliburton sold its interest in dresser rand to ingersoll,leaving ingersoll as the sole owner of dresser rand.nonetheless,dresser rand continued to operate under ingersoll,and,apparently,its employees were still participants in the dresser plan or at least they so believed.subsequently,on december,the dresser plan was merged into the halliburton retirement plan the halliburton plan or the plan.
kirkendall takes issue with halliburton administration of the plan with respect to her and other dresser rand employees after the sale.although kirkendall seems to allege that the end result of the sale was that her pension benefit decreased,it is,at times,difficult to understand through what mechanism this decrease came about.the difficulty perhaps reflects kirkendall own confusion regarding why her pension benefit dropped,as well as the quality of the information she has received about the changes 
kirkendall alleges that,beginning in july,halliburton has taken the position that the sale had the effect of terminating dresser rand employees as of march,such that they were no longer participants in the dresser later,halliburton plan.in other words,despite the fact that she and her coworkers continue to be dresser rand employees,they apparently no longer have an employment relationship with halliburton.because the plan administrator uses a termination date of march,in calculating participants pension benefits,rather than whatever presumably later date they actually leave the employ of dresser rand,their pension benefits will be lower as a result.
in particular,kirkendall alleges that she lost an early retirement subsidy as a result of the sale.during a june,meeting for dresser rand employees to discuss the consequences of the sale,kirkendall learned that employees would no longer be eligible for an early retirement subsidy unless they had reached the age of before march.it is unclear why kirkendall and her fellow employees did not learn of the changes until more than two years after the sale.
following the june meeting,kirkendall made various efforts to clarify what changes had been made and what legal avenues were available to her to contest the changed calculation of her pension benefits,should she opt for early retirement.on october,kirkendall sent a letter to ann head,who apparently worked in the halliburton benefits center and led the june meeting,requesting a copy of any amendment to the plan that employees not years of age by march,were no longer eligible for the early retirement factors.she received no response.
on march,norman stein stein of the pension counseling clinic at university of maine school of law sent a letter to a monica thurman,identified only as a halliburton employee,on kirkendall behalf seeking clarification of her rights under the halliburton plan.the letter began by noting that thurman had previously assured stein that the actuarial firm employed by the plan would send figures for kathy benefits,but noted also that no such information had arrived.the letter went on to raise legal objections to halliburton calculation of benefits to date and to request clarification of kirkendall benefit rights with respect to these issues and any rights for reconsideration or appeal after you answer her.neither kirkendall nor stein received any response to this letter 
in january,kirkendall called the halliburton pension center to ask for a retirement quote.the person who answered the phone told her that she had already received the money to which she was entitled,which kirkendall took to mean that she had been terminated from the halliburton plan.shortly thereafter,kirkendall received a pension quote that stated her monthly payment would be,lower than a statement of benefits she had received in.she interpreted this figure to mean that it was obvious that halliburton was still not giving me the early retirement subsidy.
the halliburton plan includes procedures that describe how participants are to file claims for benefits the claims procedures.article iii of the claims procedures provides,
to file a benefit claim under the plan,a claimant must obtain from the benefits administrator the information and benefit claim forms,if any,provided for in the plan and otherwise follow the procedures established from time to time by the committee or the benefits administrator for claiming plan benefits a claimant may only request a plan benefit by fully completing and submitting to the benefits administrator the benefit claim forms,if any,provided for in the plan and otherwise following the procedures established from time to time by the committee or the benefits administrator for claiming plan benefits.in connection with the submission of a claim,the claimant may examine the plan and any other relevant documents relating to the claim,and may submit written comments relating to such claim to the benefits administrator coincident with the filing of the benefit claim form.failure of a claimant to furnish written proof of loss or to comply with the claim submission procedure will invalidate such claim unless the benefits administrator in its discretion determines that it was not reasonably possible to provide such proof or comply with such procedure.
the plan further provides,completion of the claims procedures will be a condition precedent to the commencement of any external proceeding in connection with a claim for benefits 
on may,kirkendall and her filed this suit.kirkendall describes her decision to file a lawsuit thusly,
at that moment it appeared to me that i would have to try to repeat the long,frustrating and unproductive process that my and i had tried,from through that moment.i felt that we had tried everything that we knew what to try and nothing had changed in regards to our pensions.people had lost the early retirement subsidy that they had been promised and on which they had based their financial plans.i thought that my and i had reached a dead end.i did not want to go through that process again,so i gave up.
the complaint alleges four counts,all stemming from halliburton allegedly incorrect determination that kirkendall and her coworkers had been terminated as of march.the first count seeks declaratory judgment the second seeks a redetermination of plaintiffs benefits which we understand to be a claim for clarification of future benefits under erisa a b,a b the third alleges an unlawful amendment pursuant to erisa g and,g,and the fourth alleges a breach of fiduciary duty.
halliburton moved for judgment on the pleadings,arguing,inter alia,that kirkendall and her had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.the district court granted the motion in full.kirkendall halliburton,cv jtc,wl june.in doing so the district court converted the portions of the motion pertaining to kirkendall benefits redetermination claim and breach of fiduciary duty claim to one for summary judgment so that it could consider a declaration that kirkendall submitted,along with accompanying exhibits.id.at.
the district court agreed that kirkendall had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.it concluded that there was no evidence that kirkendall had submitted a claim using the forms and procedures dictated by the halliburton plan and that kirkendall efforts to resolve her claim prior to filing suit did not indicate that recourse to the formal claims process would have been futile.id.at.it concluded that kirkendall breach of fiduciary duty claim must similarly be dismissed because it was merely a benefits claim in clothing,and so also required kirkendall to exhaust her administrative remedies prior to filing suit.id.at.
the district court held also that a plaintiff may pursue a g improper amendment claim only when she has alleged an actual amendment to the text of the plan,not when,as here,a plaintiff alleges a constructive amendment accomplished by interpretation of plan terms.id.at.kirkendall claim that the merger between the dresser plan and halliburton plan resulted in a decrease in benefits in violation of was dismissed for failure to allege any ill effects of the merger of the dresser plan into the halliburton plan.id.at.finally,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief because such a claim provides merely an additional remedy to litigants,rather than an independent cause of action,and plaintiffs had not adequately alleged a cause of action under which they could seek declaratory relief.id.at.
this timely appeal followed.

failure to exhaust administrative remedies 
erisa itself does not contain an exhaustion requirement the requirement is instead.paese hartford life accident ins,cir.we have described the exhaustion requirement as fulfilling the following purposes 
to uphold congress desire that erisa trustees be responsible for their actions,not the federal courts to provide a sufficiently clear record of administrative action if litigation should ensue to assure that any judicial review of fiduciary action or inaction is made under the arbitrary and capricious standard,not de novo to help reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits under erisa to promote the consistent treatment of claims for benefits to provide a nonadversarial method of claims settlement and to minimize the costs of claims settlement for all concerned.

the exhaustion requirement,however,is not absolute.we do not require plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies where they make a clear and positive showing that pursuing available administrative remedies would be futile,kennedy,at internal quotation marks omitted,and we allow plaintiffs to assert equitable defenses to the exhaustion requirement such as waiver,estoppel,and equitable tolling,paese,at.
implicit in the exhaustion requirement is the condition that a plaintiff must have an administrative remedy to exhaust.see kennedy,at e xhaustion in the context of erisa requires only those administrative appeals provided for in the relevant plan or policy.kirkendall contends that the halliburton plan provides no procedure for filing a claim,such as hers,for clarification of future benefits.halliburton argues that kirkendall did have such a remedy available to her and that she did not take advantage of it.although it conceded at oral argument that kirkendall request for information was not the benefits claim,halliburton nonetheless argues that kirkendall should have filed a claim for benefits pursuant to article iii of the claims procedures prior to bringing suit in federal court.
article iii begins with the words,to file a benefit claim under the plan.here,kirkendall did not seek to retire immediately,but rather,sought to know what her benefits would be if and when she chose to pursue early retirement.the term benefit claim as set forth in the plan could be read to apply only when a plan participant is demanding benefits at the time when she is filing the claim.it is unclear,therefore,whether kirkendall inquiry as to the amount of her benefits in the event of a future,hypothetical event was a benefit claim within the meaning of the plan such that it would be governed by the article iii claims procedures.compounding this confusion is the fact that when halliburton sent kirkendall a benefits quote in,the cover letter described the enclosed claims form as an application for retirement benefits.this language likewise suggests that kirkendall should resort to this form only if she wanted to receive her benefits in the immediate future.
halliburton asserted at oral argument that kirkendall inquiry was nevertheless a benefit claim because,even though the benefits would not actually be paid out until sometime in the future,she is asking right now to have those benefits redetermined,according to what she thinks is the correct interpretation of the plan.to the extent that kirkendall inquiry does not fit within the usual understanding of a benefit claim,halliburton argued,article iii only entitled kirkendall to submit written comments relating to such claim to the benefits administrator coincident with the filing of the benefit claim form.although article iii does state that applicants may submit written comments relating to such claim to the benefits administrator coincident with the filing of the benefit claim form,it does not suggest that those seeking a determination of future benefits must avail themselves of this procedure.
we have doubts as to whether kirkendall inquiry was truly a benefit claim within the meaning of the plan terms.regardless,we imagine that if the plan terms are a bit baffling to us,they are equally baffling to plan participants such as kirkendall.two of our sister circuits have held that,where a plaintiff reasonably interprets the plan terms not to require exhaustion and,as a result,does not exhaust her administrative remedies,the case may proceed in federal court.watts bellsouth,cir if a plan claimant reasonably interprets the relevant statements in the summary plan description as permitting her to file a lawsuit without exhausting her administrative reme
