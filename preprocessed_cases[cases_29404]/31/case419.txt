life insurance company of north america lina appeals a district court order granting judgment to rebecca duperry on her claim that lina wrongly denied her longterm disability ltd benefits in violation of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.see a b west.finding no error,we affirm.
duperry worked as a payroll and benefits clerk for railroad friction products corporation rfpc until april.while at rfpc,she participated in a group ltd benefits plan administered by lina and funded by an insurance policy that lina issued the policy.the parties agree that the ltd plan is an employee benefit plan,as that term is defined in erisa.see.to qualify for ltd benefits,participants must be disabled,and must satisfy the elimination period,be under the appropriate care of a physician,and meet all the other terms and conditions of the policy.until an employee has received months of ltd benefits,she is disabled 
if,solely because of injury or sickness,she is 
unable to perform the material duties of her regular occupation and 
unable to earn or more of her indexed earnings from working in her regular occupation.
once disability benefits have been payable for months,she is disabled if 
solely due to injury or sickness,she is 
unable to perform the material duties of any occupation for which she is,or may reasonably become,qualified based on education,training or experience and 
unable to earn or more of her indexed earnings.
an employee regular occupation is defined as t he occupation the employee routinely performs at the time the disability begins.lina classified duperry regular occupation as a payroll benefits hr administrator as sedentary,meaning that it required lifting,carrying,pushing,or pulling pounds occasionally and that although it involved mostly sitting,it could involve standing or walking for brief periods.the policy further provides that an employee must provide lina satisfactory proof of disability before benefits will be paid.finally,t he elimination period is the period of time an employee must be continuously disabled before disability benefits are payable,which was days for duperry.
following what duperry asserted was the expiration of her elimination period,duperry first submitted a proof of loss form to lina on october,claiming that she was disabled as a result of rheumatoid arthritis,osteoarthritis,and fibromyalgia 
in evaluating duperry claim,lina reviewed medical records of her primary care physician,glenn harris,and her treating rheumatologist,supen patel,as well as attending physician statement of disability forms that the doctors had completed.harris form noted his diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and stated that duperry was limited to hours per day of climbing,balancing,stooping,kneeling,crouching,crawling,reaching,walking,sitting,and standing,and that duperry would never be able to return to work.harris also indicated on a physical ability assessment form that duperry could o ccasionally sit,stand,walk,reach,engage in fine manipulation,grasp,lift,carry,stoop,or push or pull up to pounds,where o ccasionally was defined alternatively as of an workday or less than hours.
patel attending physician statement of disability form noted his diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.in a column titled applicable,patel marked a box for class limitation.in response to a question of when duperry would be able to return to work,patel wrote never duperry is permanently disabled.and,where the form asked for duperry maximum level of ability sedentary,light,medium,heavy for lifting,carrying,pushing,or pulling,patel selected the lowest available choice of sedentary lbs.maximum,walking occasionally.
two other documents that lina considered in its initial review are relevant to this appeal.first,a blood test report showed duperry as having normal levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin.second,a physical therapist report dated april,indicated that duperry had made small strength and endurance gains and had demo nstrated excellent compliance.the form also noted that duperry was able to walk laps around the approximately gym track in nine minutes.
melissa graham,the case manager handling duperry claim for lina,requested that a nurse case manager ncm telephone patel for clarification of the information he had provided on his physician statement of disability form,specifically his decision to circle sedentary.patel spoke to the ncm on november,informing her that fibromyalgia,fatigue and side effects from her pain medications prevented duperry from working,even though her rheumatoid arthritis was under control.he further explained that duperry suffered from achiness and stiffness coinciding with changes in the weather,and that she had been responding well to medications.this assessment was consistent with notations in lina notes,which stated date clear.no both attending physicians stating claimant is permanently disabled.nevertheless,the ncm eventually concluded that duperry had not submitted satisfactory proof that she suffered from a continuing disability from her regular occupation during the elimination period.
lina informed duperry by letter dated november,of its decision to deny her claim because of a lack of medical evidence of her disability.the letter referenced the medical records lina had reviewed,mentioning in particular five office notes from patel,six from harris,and the ncm telephone conversation with patel.the letter concluded 
our ncm opined that we do not have medical information on file to support the restrictions and limitations given by your providers.our ncm opined that we do not have diagnostic testing to suggest severity of illness precluding you from performing a sedentary occupation.
duperry appealed lina initial denial by a letter dated may,that referenced nearly pages of documents in support of her claim.
the appeal included letters from harris and patel.harris november,letter explained how duperry situation had worsened over the years to the point that her pain was almost unbearable in may,and harris had urged her to stop work.the letter stated that duperry had nevertheless attempted to continue working,but,by february,she was at the point that even percocet twice a day was not quite enough to hold her,and she agreed to stop work.
patel january,letter explained that while duperry arthritis had been reasonably well controlled by her medications and,although her fibromyalgia and fatigue symptoms were managed with medications,they make it difficult for her to function.thus,patel concluded that because of the above medical problems and complications thereof and medications,duperry certainly is not able to return to any previous work duties.an exam report also dated january,noted that duperry pain seemed to be worse than it had been,and that while she was taking milligrams of percocet three to four times a day,patel additionally prescribed milligrams of oxycontin per day 
patel notes from may,reported that duperry pain seem ed to be better,but her fatigue had worsened somewhat and she still ha d not much energy level.patel report dated july,stated that duperry was experiencing quite a bit of pain in her back from her osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine with intermittent sciatic symptoms.he noted that by that time,along with the percocet,duperry was using milligrams of oxycontin twice a day,which was making her sleepy and drowsy.he reported that duperry needs to limit her activities such that if she did five to ten minutes of work,she needed to rest for about to minutes before returning to work duties.patel notes from september,reported that duperry was still symptomatic with pain and discomfort and that he had increased several of her medications,including increasing her oxycontin to milligrams.he noted that she was having symptoms of constipation and excessive drowsiness with the oxycontin.
in addition to the medical records and letters,included in the materials was a letter from duperry former boss,who described duperry as having a work ethic that is unsurpassed.he described duperry transition from one of the most valuable employees he had known to someone sitting at her desk trying valiantly to work with her hands trembling so badly that she could hardly hold a pencil.duperry appeal also included a declaration,her own dvd filmed at her home,supporting statements from several relatives,and her prescription medication list.her evidence showed how she depended on help from her family for most household chores,errands,and shopping and that at times she used a cane,a walker,and a wheelchair.she generally remained in her bedroom,in which she had a hospital bed and a refrigerator.
nancy ippolito,lina appeal claim manager,requested a full review of the claim by charles mccool,a licensed physician and a lina employee.mccool resulting report consisted of a of largely illegible,handwritten notes.however,according to ippolito summary of his views,mccool recommended affirming the benefits denial and noted that updated letters from duperry treating physicians showed minimal exam findings and levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin of around.lina subsequently advised duperry that her appeal had been denied.in its denial letter,dated may,lina acknowledged patel diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia.lina nevertheless emphasized that patel records demonstrated that duperry medications were keeping her rheumatoid arthritis reasonably under control and her fibromyalgia and fatigue were secondary to the underlying disease process and managed with medication.lina also noted that harris had previously completed a physical ability assessment form in october of indicative of sedentary capacity,but he has not released duperry to return to work.lina further stated that the physician who reviewed her file had determined that the records do not show a severe impairment that would prevent duperry from performing at the sedentary demand level.in concluding,lina stated 
duperry physicians have failed to provide clinical data to correlate with an impairment that would preclude work at the sedentary demand level.the reviewing physician noted that there are only minimal examination findings and the hematocrit and hemoglobin are near normal and do not explain fatigue.furthermore the records document that duperry conditions are under control with medication.
by letter dated november,duperry once again appealed lina denial of benefits.along with her appeal,she included additional medical records from patel,harris,and misty sinclair.she also included a second dvd documenting her condition.lina assigned the second appeal to a third claim manager,andrea russo,who requested a review of duperry records from an independent rheumatology consultant.that review was completed by marc levesque,a rheumatologist with the duke university medical center.
levesque produced two reports recommending denying duperry appeal.in a report dated january,levesque noted patel and harris diagnosis of duperry with a combination of rheumatoid arthritis,osteoarthritis,and fibromyalgia,but he concluded that patel and harris restrictions nevertheless are not supported.levesque noted that duperry rheumatoid arthritis appears to be under excellent control with a combination of medicines that are typically used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and that the video movements,especially of duperry hands and also of her ambulation would suggest that there is no permanent deformity and no significant swelling associated with the patient rheumatoid arthritis that would preclude most sedentary occupations,including duperry occupation.as for her fibromyalgia,levesque stated that given the absence of physical limitations due to this problem,there is nothing that would preclude duperry normally from pursuing a typical sedentary occupation,and g enerally,patients with fibromyalgia are able to work a sedentary occupation.levesque did note that duperry chronic pain and fibromyalgia appear ed to be complicated by the presence of depression but stated that whether the depression would prevent duperry from being able to work was a question outside of his area of expertise.
in a subsequent report,dated february,levesque also considered the dvd duperry provided with her second appeal in the report,levesque stated 
a s noted in the previous video,no deformity is noted of duperry hands or other joints.there appears to be relatively normal range of motion in most of her joints,based on the limited video that is available.the major area of stiffness and limited range of motion appears to be in her back and the limitation primarily appears to be due to pain rather than other factors,based on the limited footage in the video.
levesque also concluded that with regards to duperry work capacity,as in the previous video of duperry in her home,this video supports the idea that duperry primary problem is fibromyalgia and perhaps some osteoarthritis of her knees.he stated,
the video indicates that her rheumatoid arthritis is not likely to be a significant cause of her inability to work or her inability to perform most activities of daily living given the fact that the underlying major diagnosis for duperry pain appears to be fibromyalgia.since it appears to be fibromyalgia,and given the lack of physical findings associated with this diagnosis,it does not adequately support the limitations imposed on duperry ability to work by her treating physicians.
based on levesque review,by letter dated february,lina once again affirmed its decision to deny duperry claim for ltd benefits.the letter summarized levesque conclusions and stated that duperry had exhausted all administrative levels of appeal and no further appeals w ould be considered.
duperry filed this action pursuant to a b of erisa,in federal district court on july,alleging that she was wrongly denied benefits under the policy.lina answered,denying that duperry was eligible for benefits.on august,the district court granted judgment to duperry,ordering lina to pay duperry disability income benefits as calculated under the provisions of the policy,from the expiration of plaintiff elimination period through the date of this order.
observing that t his case falls into that difficult class of erisa disability cases involving subjective complaints of pain as a primary cause and driver of the insured claim of disability,the district court noted that no language in the plan specifically concerned the evaluation of claims involving subjective complaints of pain.the court reasoned 
where the plan documents do not provide a procedure for dealing with disability claims based on subjective complaints of pain,a plan administrator employing a principled reasoning process need not simply accept a claimant subjective complaints of pain without question,especially if there is other conflicting evidence in the record.neither,however,can a plan administrator in such a situation simply dismiss such subjective complaints of pain out of hand,especially where there is objective medical proof of a disease that could cause such pain.
lina pointed to statements in six health care records as conflicting with duperry complaints of disabling pain and fatigue.the district court concluded,however,that the alleged conflicts were only minor inconsistencies,not the type of substantial conflicting evidence that a plan administrator can use to justify a denial of benefits.while lina attempted to use some of this evidence to justify a conclusion that patel may not have actually believed that duperry was unable to return to work,the court concluded that the remaining evidence in the record clearly demonstrated that patel believed duperry could not return,and that lina own notes reflected that.as for levesque reports,the court noted that levesque dismissed the notion that duperry fibromyalgia was disabling because of the absence of physical limitations due to this problem and the lack of physical findings associated with this diagnosis.but,the court noted that the presence of painful trigger points that are indicative of fibromyalgia were amply documented,and the court concluded that levesque offered no basis for his rejection of duperry evidence that her pain from that condition was physically disabling.to the extent that levesque believed that duperry was in fact unable to work but was not disabled because her inability to work was due only to pain or other,subjective symptoms,the court reasoned that levesque was utilizing a definition of disabled plainly at odds with the one given in the plan.thus,the court concluded that b y adopting levesque opinion,lina essentially grafted a new limitation regarding disability onto the plan that the language of the plan did not support.
lina moved to alter the judgment to limit payment of benefits to the period running from the expiration of duperry elimination period through october,which is the end of the term for which lina determines disability according to duperry ability to perform the duties of her regular occupation the period.lina argued that the district court could not award benefits for the subsequent period because lina had not considered duperry claim under the standard that applied for that period.thus,lina requested that the court remand to the plan administrator for a decision regarding benefits for this period.the district court denied the motion,concluding that remand was not appropriate because the record clearly showed the duperry was entitled to benefits for both periods.the court also awarded prejudgment interest and attorney fees.
lina first argues that the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that lina abused its discretion in denying duperry claim.we disagree.
in reviewing the denial of benefits under an erisa plan,a district court first must consider de novo whether the relevant plan documents confer discretionary authority on the plan administrator to make a determination.see johannssen district.coast,meba pension plan,cir.when a plan by its terms confers discretion on the plan administrator to interpret its provisions and the administrator acts reasonably within the scope of that discretion,courts defer to the administrator interpretation.colucci agfa.severance pay plan,cir.the parties agree that the plan confers discretionary authority upon lina,as the plan administrator,to make benefit decisions according to the plan terms.
under the standard,the reviewing court will set aside the plan administrator decision only if it is not reasonable.see stup unum life ins.of,cir.the administrator decision is reasonable if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence,bernstein capitalcare,cir internal quotation marks omitted,which is evidence which a reasoning mind would accept as sufficient to support a particular conclusion,lefebre westinghouse,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in booth stores.associates health welfare plan,cir,we set forth eight nonexclusive factors to be considered by courts in reviewing the a plan administrator decision for reasonableness 
the language of the plan the purposes and goals of the plan the adequacy of the materials considered to make the decision and the degree to which they support it whether the fiduciary interpretation was consistent with other provisions in the plan and with earlier interpretations of the plan whether the decisionmaking process was reasoned and principled whether the decision was consistent with the procedural and substantive requirements of erisa any external standard relevant to the exercise of discretion and the fiduciary motives and any conflict of interest it may have.
id.at.these factors continue to guide our review under erisa.see williams metropolitan life ins,cir.
prior to the supreme court issuance of metropolitan life insurance glenn,our precedent called for review of a plan administrator decision under a modified standard.see ellis metropolitan life ins,cir.under this standard,when a plan administrator had a conflict of interest because the administrator was responsible for both evaluating and paying claims,courts would afford less deference to the administrator decision.see id.in glenn,however,the supreme court clarified that the presence of such a conflict does not alter the applicable standard of review,but rather is but one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account.glenn,at.in the present case,because lina insures the plan as well as administering it,lina has a structural conflict of interest,williams,at,and we therefore consider this factor in determining the reasonableness of lina decision,see glenn,at.
lina points to seven items of evidence in defending the reasonableness of its decision to deny duperry claim 
patel statement in his may,attending physician statement that duperry could perform some s edentary job functions.
patel november,telephone message stating that duperry arthritis was controlled and that she had had a good response to medications and had not called with complaints since september.
harris statement in his october,physical ability assessment form that duperry was able to perform functions associated with sedentary work.
patel letter dated january,stating that duperry arthritis is moderately active and has been reasonably well controlled with medications and that her fibromyalgia and fatigue symptoms are secondary to her underlying disease process and are all managed with medications.
duperry physical therapist note in an assessment that duperry demonstrated excellent compliance,made small strength and endurance gains,could complete ten laps around the gym track in nine minutes,and did not note any limitations or restrictions due to pain.
duperry blood tests showing normal levels of hematocrit and hemoglobin.
levesque determination that duperry doctors opinions that she could not return to work were unsupported.
of course,we begin with the language of the policy.during the period,the policy provided that duperry was d isabled 
if,solely because of injury or sickness,she wa s 
unable to perform the material duties of her regular occupation and 
unable to earn or more of her indexed earnings from working in her regular occupation.
duperry case turned on the question of whether she was in fact unable to perform the material duties of her job.lina makes no argument that even if duperry was unable to perform those duties,her inability was not solely because of injury or sickness.thus,it is the former issue on which we focus our discussion.
initially,we note,as a global matter,that the pieces of evidence lina identifies tend to show,first,that duperry was able to perform,for relatively brief periods,certain tasks involved in sedentary work and,second,that certain individual diseases and physical problems that afflicted her were not sufficient,in isolation,to render her unable to do such work.however,to perform her job,duperry obviously would be required to do much more than perform a small subset of her duties for a relatively short duration.moreover,in so doing,she would have to overcome the combined effect of all of the problems caused by her diseases,not just a select few.
now we will address the individual pieces of evidence that lina has identified and the degree to which they support lina decision to deny benefits.booth,at.first,in a question on a form asking for the maximum level of ability of your patient to lift,carry,push,and pull,patel marked the choice sedentary lbs.maximum,walking occasionally.j.while that answer certainly was some evidence of the fact that patel believed that duperry could at times complete those individual tasks,as we have explained,that is a separate question altogether from whether she could perform the material duties of her job,which required many hours of work several days per week apart from these tasks.see stup,at explaining that even if functional capacity examination had shown conclusively that the claimant could perform sedentary tasks for the duration of the test,the results would provide no evidence as to the claimant abilities for a longer period.patel left no doubt regarding the latter question as he wrote on that very form that duperry could n ever return to work because she was p ermanently disabled.
for similar reasons,harris checking o ccasionally in a number of blocks on a physical ability assessment form concerning how often duperry could perform certain tasks such as sitting,standing,and walking did not conflict with his opinion that she could not return to work.aside from the fact that performing these individual tasks comprised only a small part of duperry workday,it is noteworthy that the form defined o ccasionally alternatively as to of an day or less than hours.
the physical therapist note that duperry had made small strength and endurance gains obviously also falls well short of creating a conflict with duperry doctors opinions for the same reason.that duperry made small gains in no way calls into question duperry doctors opinions that she still was not able to return to work.nor does the physical therapist note stating that she was able to complete ten laps around a track in nine minutes create such a conflict.aside from the fact that this pace is only slightly more than two miles per hour,the test lasted only nine minutes.it could hardly be found to be instructive on the question of whether duperry could endure the rigors of a full workday or workweek.the same can be said of lina citation to duperry excellent compliance with her strength and conditioning exercises,which indicates only that duperry was giving her best effort.
patel telephone message of november,also creates no conflict.according to that message,patel reported 
duperry unable to work due to fibromyalgia,fatigue as well as side effects of pain are what is limiting duperry,symptoms overall w achiness and stiffness w weather changes,no other major complaints at this time,to continue on good response so not called w complaints,have not se e n since arthritis is controlled at this point in time duperry not able to work due to pain and fatigu e as well as pain med side effects.
lina focuses on the part of the message stating that duperry arthritis is under control,but it is hard to see how that matters much in light of patel statement that her pain,fatigue,and side effects from her medications were preventing her from working.
similarly,patel january,letter does not undercut his opinion that duperry was disabled.the letter reported 
duperry arthritis is moderately active and has been reasonably well controlled with the medications she is on however,her fibromyalgia and fatigue symptoms are secondary to her underlying disease process and are all managed with the medications.it makes it difficult for her to function and return back to previous work duties.at this time,she certainly has some limitations requiring a hospital bed at home to sleep comfortably on.she has trouble getting up and around,although the pain is reasonably well controlled with the pain medications.at this time,because of the above medical problems and complications thereof and medications,she certainly is not able to return to any previous work duties.
again,the fact that her arthritis was under control and that her pain may have been well controlled with pain medications does not conflict at all with patel view that the combination of duperry pain,fatigue,and the effects of her medication prevented her from engaging in gainful employment.
as for mccool note that duperry blood test results showed her hematocrit and hemoglobin around,lina does not explain how this advances its cause.lina maintains,without explanation,that this note indicates that the results contradicted duperry subjective complaints of fatigue.brief of appellant at.duperry,however,argues that low scores on these blood tests are indicative of anemia and that duperry did not claim to be suffering from anemia,which is not a of arthritis or fibromyalgia.see,last visited,http last visited.lina does not explain how these blood tests conflict with duperry claim that she is disabled.
in short,lina has not satisfactorily explained how any of the first six pieces of evidence it identifies creates any significant reason to doubt the correctness of the opinions offered by patel and harris that solely because of injury or sickness,duperry was unable to perform the material duties of her regular occupation.policy.that leaves lina only with levesque reports,to which we now turn.
levesque acknowledged in both reports that duperry suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia,but he found no reason for concluding that either disease prevented duperry from being able to work.in his january,report,he stated that while t he records amply document duperry problems with chronic pain and fibromyalgia given the absence of physical limitations due to fibromyalgia,there is nothing that would preclude duperry normally from pursuing a typical sedentary occupation.emphasis added.he added that g enerally,patients with fibromyalgia are able to work a sedentary occupation.in his february,report levesque further acknowledged that fibromyalgia is the underlying major diagnosis for duperry pain but stated that given the lack of physical findings associated with the diagnosis,it does not adequately support the limitations imposed on duperry ability to work by her treating physicians.emphasis added.
levesque reasoning is cryptic,to be sure,and it is not for us to lina reading of the reports to the extent it was reasonable.nevertheless,we agree with the district court that under any permissible reading,the reports do not provide a reasonable basis for denial of duperry claim.we will address the possible meanings of the reports seriatim.
first,it is possible that levesque simply concluded that duperry did not produce the type of evidence that would show that the pain and fatigue caused by her fibromyalgia and other conditions was so substantial that she could not perform the material duties of her job.however,duperry produced the only types of evidence a claimant in her situation could produce,her own description of the severity of her subjective symptoms,videos showing how she moved in her condition,and her treating physicians opinions that the pain and fatigue rendered her unable to work.as the policy contained no provision precluding duperry from relying on her subjective complaints as part of her evidence of disability,lina could not reasonably deny her claim because of such reliance.smith continental cas,cir discussing plan stating that limited benefits would be provided for a disability due to a diagnosed condition which manifests itself primarily with symptom s.
second,it is possible that levesque simply was not persuaded that duperry was rendered unable to work by the pain and fatigue she experienced from her fibromyalgia and her other conditions.if that was levesque opinion,we can not conclude that the opinion was deliberate or principled.although levesque did not examine duperry,he noted that review of her videos indicated that her rheumatoid arthritis was sufficiently controlled that it would not prevent her from working.however,he did not report seeing anything in the videos that would cause him to doubt her claim and those of her treating doctors that her pain and fatigue from her fibromyalgia and her other conditions prevented her from enduring the rigors of the workweek.levesque,of course,noted that g enerally,patients with fibromyalgia are able to work a sedentary occupation.emphasis added.however,even if fibromyalgia were the only condition afflicting duperry,levesque observation would be insufficient to create any conflict with duperry claim absent evidence that duperry symptoms were no worse than average in severity.and,of course,fibromyalgia was not duperry only condition.
considering all of the evidence together,we simply see no reasonable basis in the record for lina denial of duperry claim.it is undisputed that duperry suffers from chronic diseases that are potentially debilitating.she has presented substantial evidence from her physicians that these diseases do,in fact,prevent her from working.and,she has presented her own declaration and declarations from her family and even her former employer confirming the severity of her symptoms.the only evidence of any consequence that lina can point to as conflicting with duperry entitlement to benefits are the reports of levesque.however,these reports contain no significant basis supporting a conclusion that the symptoms from duperry fibromyalgia,either by themselves or combined with the symptoms from her other conditions,are not sufficien
