andrew rego filed suit against his employer,two employee benefits plans,and the administrator of those plans,alleging a series of violations of the employee retirement security act erisa.the gravamen of his complaint was a charge that defendants had prevented him from withdrawing his share of one of the benefits plans in time to take advantage of a high stock price.he also claimed that defendants had failed to give him statutorily required information and that they had improperly delayed his pension payments by a month.the district court dismissed most of his allegations for failure to state a claim and remanded several claims for administrative resolution.the plan administrator granted rego relief on one of his claims and rejected the rest,and the district court affirmed the plan administrator.we affirm the district court.
rego was employed by westvaco corporation from to,working as southeast region sales representative for most of that time.during his employment,he participated in two employee benefit plans administered by westvaco the westvaco corporation savings and investment plan for salaried employees savings plan and the westvaco retirement plan for salaried employees pension plan.the parties have stipulated that both the savings plan and the pension plan are employee benefit pension plan s within the meaning of the employee retirement income security act.a.the savings plan is funded partly by contributions from participants and partly by contributions from westvaco.the pension plan is funded entirely by westvaco.rego regularly received communications pertaining to each plan,including a summary plan description.he also attended a seminar in for savings plan participants.
in may,westvaco notified rego that his position with westvaco was going to be eliminated and that he would be terminated effective october.he was told to contact human resources employee cheryl blume with any questions he had regarding the company savings plan and pension plan.
on october,westvaco sent rego a letter with information about his company benefits and the mechanics of withdrawing funds from the two plans after his termination.the letter informed rego that he was eligible to submit distribution forms at any time,and that if he chose to withdraw funds from the plan,his account would be valued on the tuesday next following or coincident with the receipt of his distribution form.the plan itself states that a terminated employee will be able to withdraw all of his funds on any valuation date any tuesday when the new york stock exchange is open elected by the member.likewise,the summary plan description states that a terminated employee can receive a distribution of all his funds with an immediate valuation if he turns in his request by on the valuation date of his choice.
rego alleges that he and his wife repeatedly asked blume to specify the earliest date that rego funds in the savings plan could be valued and distributed.according to rego,blume consistently responded that the earliest point rego could do this was november.blume testified that she does not recall any such conversation,but offered one reason why she might have identified november as the relevant date.rego was actually entitled to a valuation and distribution of some of his assets on october,first valuation date following his termination.but because he did not receive his final paycheck a portion of which was automatically invested in the savings plan on his behalf until the end of october,rego could not actually have withdrawn all of his funds from the plan until november.blume testified that,therefore,if he had asked me,when can i withdraw all of my funds,then i would have had to tell him november.
another employee who had been terminated on the same day as rego went directly to blume on october,and told her that he wanted his interest in the savings plan valued and distributed effective that day.blume executed the employee request,and he received his distribution with a valuation date of october.
based on the information given to him by blume,rego requested that his holdings in the savings plan be valued and distributed to him at the earliest time he thought possible november.had his holdings been valued on october,they would have been worth.however,on october,the value of the stock in the plan fell substantially,and rego notified blume that he no longer wanted his portion of the savings plan distributed on november.
more than a year later,on january,rego submitted distribution forms directing defendants to distribute his savings plan funds by sending the cash proceeds to one ira and the stock shares to another ira.rather than filling out the distribution forms completely,he attached a separate sheet detailing his instructions for the distribution.blume approved the forms and told rego that the valuation would be effective on february.the valuation on february would have been.however,blume was then told by another westvaco employee that rego could not make multiple distributions from his funds.she was told that this was not company policy but a matter of cost and westvaco chose not to do multiple rollovers.
on february and,another employee of westvaco told rego and his wife that he could not make his distribution as requested,both because multiple rollovers were impossible and because forms could not be completed by reference to attached materials.rego and his wife replied that he should not have to file new forms,and that his distribution should be valued based on the february,valuation.however,on february rego received a letter stating that he was required to file new forms,and that the valuation would be based on the value on the tuesday following the date of the receipt of the forms.this letter did not inform him that he had a right to appeal the determination about the savings plan distribution.
ultimately,rego interest in the savings plan was distributed to him in the form of stock on march,and valued at.he eventually sold the stock through several transactions at the end of for a total of.
besides the dispute over the savings plan distributions,the two parties have also joined issue over westvaco handling of rego pension plan participation.on may,rego prepared,notarized,and mailed forms to begin his pension payments on february.however,when his wife called westvaco in january to ensure that pension payments would begin as scheduled,she was told that westvaco could not find any retirement forms for rego.she then faxed copies of the forms to westvaco,which were received on january.westvaco took no action until february,at which point rego wife was informed that the forms were incorrect because they were more than ninety days old.rego had not been aware of the rule,because the statement of that rule was contained in an april pension plan amendment that he never received.rego pension was not started until march.
rego filed suit against westvaco,its plan administrator,the savings plan,and the pension plan.his claims focused on four issues westvaco failure to value his assets on october,westvaco failure to value his assets on february,westvaco failure to begin his pension plan payments in february,and westvaco failure to provide him with statutorily required information.the district court dismissed most of his claims under.b.it remanded three of claim for the difference in his savings plan assets between the october,and march,valuation,a claim for the difference in those assets between the february,and march,valuation,and a claim for the money he would have received from the pension plan between february and march,exhaustion of administrative remedies before the benefits plans administration committee bpac,the entity responsible for the resolution of administrative claims related to the savings plan and the pension plan.
administrative remedies resulted in an award to rego of the pension money that should have been paid to him during february,with interest.his claims under the savings plan,however,were rejected.the district court dismissed his challenge to the administrative ruling on summary judgment.the court also refused to grant him attorney fees for the expense of pursuing his pension plan claim administratively.rego now appeals.
rego first claims that he was entitled to relief under a,which allows plaintiffs to obtain appropriate equitable relief for erisa violations in certain cases.a.specifically,he argues that defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to give him complete and accurate information about his benefits plans when he requested it.he contends that communications on plan benefits are a fiduciary function and that a therefore provides him with a cause of action to remedy defendants breach.he requests an order of specific performance requiring defendants to issue him roughly in westvaco stock,or the difference between the valuation on october,and march.
the district court dismissed this claim on summary judgment,holding that rego requested relief was not fairly classifiable as equitable,which is required for a claim to proceed under a.we agree.
rego begins by arguing that,at common law,actions for breach of fiduciary duty by a trustee could only be brought in equity.see austin wakeman scott william franklin fratcher,the law of trusts ed.he therefore contends that under a any remedy,when sought for breach of fiduciary duty,is always an equitable remedy.the supreme court has squarely rejected this argument,holding that it would read the statute to render the modifier equitable superfluous,since all relief available for breach of trust could be obtained from a court of equity.mertens hewitt,d emphasis in original.defining equitable relief,in other words,as whatever relief a court of equity could provide in such a case would limit the relief not at all.mertens,at.emphasis in original.rather,a authorizes only those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.id.at.emphasis in original.and the scope of this relief is emphatically not defined by reference to the many situations at common law in which an equity court could establish purely legal rights and grant legal remedies which would otherwise be beyond the scope of its authority.id.at.internal quotation omitted.under mertens,then,the relevant question is not whether a given type of case would have been brought in a court of equity,but whether a given type of relief was available in equity courts as a general rule.and the relief rego seeks was not available.in fact,monetary relief for all losses sustained as a result of an alleged breach of fiduciary duties was the classic form of legal relief.id.at.emphasis in original.
rego then argues that his claim can be considered a request for equitable restitution or a constructive type of relief which was typically available in courts of equity.this claim fails as well.in life annuity ins.knudson,d,the supreme court addressed this issue in the course of denying a claim for relief under a.with a minor exception not relevant here,a claim for equitable restitution must seek not to impose personal liability on the defendant,but to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant possession.id.at.the plaintiff,in other words,must argue that money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.id.at.it is only under such circumstances that plaintiffs can proceed in equity with a claim for restitution other claims for restitution are considered restitution at law.id.emphasis in original.
in this case,defendants possess no particular fund or property that can be clearly identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff.the particular fund or property that is the basis of rego claim was simply his share of the savings plan.and that share has long since been transferred to rego it is no longer in defendants possession.
rego next argues that the relief he seeks is equitable because relief has traditionally been available under trust law as an equitable form of relief for a trustee breach of duty.but it is obvious on the face of his complaint that rego is not actually trying to make himself whole.at most,defendants actions caused rego to lose approximately the difference between the valuation on october,and the amount for which he eventually sold his shares.rego,however,requests far more than that amount approximately,a figure based on the difference between the october valuation and the march,valuation.this claim in no way corresponds to any out of pocket loss it is thus in no sense a request to be restored to the position he would have occupied if the misrepresentations had never occurred.howe varity,cir,aff,d.we decline to consider it appropriate equitable relief authorized by a.
rego also brings a claim for relief under a b,which entitles plaintiffs to recover benefits due to them under the terms of their plan.a b.he claims that the bpac improperly denied him benefits by refusing his claim for the difference between the october,valuation and the march,valuation.he argues that,had it not been for the misinformation promulgated by westvaco and its employees,he would have withdrawn the lion share of his savings plan assets on october,rather than on march,when their value was substantially lower.he argues that under a b he is therefore entitled to recover the difference between the valuations on those two dates.the district court rejected this claim,and we affirm.
a denial of benefits challenged under a b is reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.when reviewing an administrative decision regarding benefits,then,a court must determine whether the plan language confers such discretion on the administrator,and if so,whether the administrator decision falls within the scope of the discretion conferred.haley paul revere life ins,cir.if the administrator acted within the scope of discretion conferred on him by the plan,the decision is reviewed merely for abuse of discretion.id.if the administrator did not act within the scope of such discretion,the decision is reviewed de novo.bruch,at.
in resolving this initial question,w e have not always required an explicit grant of discretionary authority.rather,we have recognized that a plan terms can create discretion by implication.feder paul revere life ins,cir.such discretion can be inferred from the plain language of both the plan itself and the summary plan description.see sheppard enoch pratt,travelers ins,cir see also buce allianz life ins,cir.in united mcgill stinnett,cir,for example,discretionary authority was found where a plan granted the administrator authority to construe the terms of the plan and resolve any disputes which may arise with regard to the rights of any persons under the terms of the plan.id.at.and in boyd trustees of the united mine workers health retirement funds,cir,we found implied discretionary authority where the administrator was given the power of full and final determination as to all issues concerning eligibility for benefits and was authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to implement this plan.id.at.
the language in the savings plan grants this kind of implied discretionary authority.like the language in boyd,the savings plan instructs the administrator to adopt such procedures and rules as he deems necessary or advisable to administer the plan.and like the plans in boyd and stinnett,the summary plan description provides that the bpac is responsible for both the determination of participants eligibility to receive benefits and the determination of appeals of denied claims.as the district court noted,these grants of authority indicate that the administrator is the ultimate and final with respect to coverage under the savings plan.this in turn demonstrates that the savings plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to make benefits eligibility determinations.
it is clear bpac was acting within the scope of this discretion when it made the decision currently under review.as discussed above,bpac is charged with making final determina
