ronald gooden,gooden sued provident life and accident insurance company provident for improperly denying his claim for long term disability benefits.the district court found that gooden was entitled to benefits and that provident abused its discretion by failing to reasonably investigate gooden claim.we reverse and render judgment for provident.
gooden received coverage from the long term disability policy supplied by his employer.the policy,which provident issued and administered,provides income replacement benefits for a covered,disabled employee who satisfies the policy conditions gooden sought disability benefits under the policy due to his angina and coronary artery disease,which were discovered after he suffered a heart attack.for approximately seven months after his heart attack,gooden was unable to work,and,therefore,received short term disability benefits.thereafter,placed gooden on unassigned status,as his cardiologist,causey,had indicated he could return to work.less than a month later,terminated gooden employment due to a workforce reduction.at this time,gooden requested that file a claim on his behalf for long term disability benefits.
gooden application for benefits included the following documents a claimant statement,an employer statement,an attending physician statement of disability aps,which causey completed during gooden last appointment,medical records relating to gooden treatment,and a letter from causey that was dated after gooden had been informed that his employment was terminated.in the claimant statement,gooden noted without elaboration,that he was employed as a piping engineer,and that his injury was not work related.the employer statement contained information regarding the date he returned to work,and the date his employment was terminated.the aps reflected,inter alia,causey findings that gooden suffered from occasional angina that his condition had improved the date on which he would be able to return to work and his work capacity limitations.the medical records included gooden hospital records and the results of his latest stress test.finally,the letter from causey stated that gooden had coronary artery disease and angina pectoris,which were significant and limited his activity.although causey noted that gooden had not sustained an unstable event in the past few months,causey felt that gooden was disabled and could not return to his previous employment.
also provided provident with a job analysis form,which detailed the requirements of gooden job additionally,provident requested all of causey notes regarding gooden,and sent causey a physical capacities form to determine gooden ability to perform his job duties.causey did not fill out the form,but instead referred provident to his earlier letter.
thereafter,provident medical consultant,metcalf,reviewed gooden file and determined that the condition of gooden heart could be verified from his most recent stress test and arteriography based on these results and gooden job responsibilities,metcalf found that gooden was capable of performing all of his job duties.
after causey records arrived,provident sent a letter to gooden informing him that it had denied his claim.provident explained that it based its denial on a review of causey records,gooden hospital records,provident medical staff determination that the objective medical findings did not support gooden disability claim,and the results of gooden most recent stress test indicating that his heart was well within normal limits.further,provident apprized gooden that between the time he returned to work and when he was laid off there was no indication that he could not perform his job duties.
gooden appealed provident decision claiming that provident relied on two erroneous facts that he had returned to work during the weeks prior to his termination,and that his heart was within normal limits to resolve the confusion regarding whether gooden had returned to work,provident contacted.informed provident that after gooden doctor released him to return to work,placed gooden on unassigned employee status,but never assigned him work.explained to provident that unassigned employees are paid to be available for assignment as the need may arise.
next,provident assembled an erisa appeals committee,composed of three of provident employees,to review gooden appeal.the committee upheld the denial of benefits based on the results of gooden stress test,and the fact that he applied for long term disability after he was laid off.provident notified gooden of the appeals committee decision,and the reasons for that decision.furthermore,provident reiterated that it lacked medical documentation buttressing gooden assertion that his condition changed between the time he returned to work and the date he requested ltd forms.provident informed gooden that he would need to submit medical evidence that support ed functional loss for provident to reevaluate its determination.
gooden responded by sending provident two letters,and a copy of the complaint he filed against provident.in the letters he argued that provident did not consider the information he submitted,offered to participate in a deposition of causey,and inquired concerning the appeal period.provident replied by inviting gooden to submit medical findings that suggested his health changed from the time he was released to work until the time he was terminated,and advised him regarding the erisa appeal period.thereafter,gooden proceeded with his claim in district court.
the district court determined that the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et seq,governed gooden claim because the policy fell within the definition of an employee welfare benefit plan.after deciding that it could consider evidence outside the administrative record to determine whether provident investigation was not impartial and unreasonable and whether provident abused its discretion in interpreting the policy terms,the court held that provident abused its discretion.the court predicated its decision on its determination that provident failed to conduct a reasonable and impartial investigation.based on the evidence in the administrative record and the evidence produced at trial,the court concluded that gooden qualified for long term disability benefits.
erisa authorizes our review of provident denial of gooden claim.see a b providing a beneficiary with the right to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.we review provident decision for an abuse of discretion,as gooden policy reserves to provident the discretion to determine gooden entitlement to benefits.see vega life ins,cir en banc reviewing for abuse of discretion when an administrator has discretionary authority.our analysis of whether provident abused its discretion is informed by provident role as both the insurer and administrator of gooden long term disability plan.as such,provident operates under a conflict of interest because it potentially benefits from every denied claim.id.at.therefore,we apply a sliding scale standard and accord provident decision less than full deference.id.at.
when it reviewed gooden claim,the district court did not have the benefit of our decision in vega.in vega,we clarified that a conflicted administrator is not under a duty to reasonably investigate a claim because it would be not only inappropriate but inefficient to require the administrator to obtain information in the claimant control in the absence of the claimant active cooperation.id.at.further,we held that a district court,in most instances,is limited to the administrative record when it reviews an administrator determination.see id.at.as a result,a district court must inquire only whether the record adequately supports the administrator decision from that inquiry it can conclude that the administrator abused its discretion if the administrator denied the claim w ithout some concrete evidence in the administrative record.id.at.
gooden asserts that vega does not alter the validity of the district court decision to consider evidence outside the administrative record.he maintains that our decision in wildbur arco chem,
