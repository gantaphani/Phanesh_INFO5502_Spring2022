opinion of the court 
we decide whether the employee retirement income security act of erisa,gives an ostensibly former employee the right to sue the administrator of his former employer k plan for allegedly mismanaging plan assets and thus reducing his share of benefits.because erisa includes such a plaintiff in its definition of participant,he has statutory standing to assert his claim.
facts and procedural history 
howard graden was a conexant employee until september and a participant in the conexant retirement saving plan until october.like most k plans,conexant is a defined contribution one in which participants and the employer contribute money into the participants individual accounts.participants elect to invest their money in various predetermined investment packages.here,graden directed his money into conexant stock fund b,a package composed entirely of conexant common stock.
conexant develops semiconductor devices for broadband communications equipment,and its common stock trades on the nasdaq.graden claim centers on the period between march and october.on march,conexant common stock closed at a high of per share.by october,when graden voluntarily cashed out,it had plummeted to per share.according to graden,the drop was the result of a risky and ultimately failed merger.conexant he alleges,breached its fiduciary duties to him and other plan participants by offering the stock fund as an investment option despite the fact that it was not and was known not to be a prudent investment,and making false and misleading statements about the merger that caused him to invest in the fund.
the district court dismissed graden action for lack of statutory standing,ruling that he was not a participant for purposes of erisa because he had already cashed out of the plan.because statutory standing is an issue of subject matter jurisdiction,the court stopped after concluding that it had none and did not consider conexant alternative argument that graden failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.

ii.statutory standing 
as noted,the question presented is one of statutory standing.there is no dispute about article iii or prudential standing.though all are termed standing,the differences between statutory,constitutional,and prudential standing are important.constitutional and prudential standing are about,respectively,the constitutional power of a federal court to resolve a dispute and the wisdom of so doing.see presbytery of of the orthodox presbyterian church florio,cir amato wilentz,cir.statutory standing is simply statutory interpretation the question it asks is whether congress has accorded this injured plaintiff the right to sue the defendant to redress his injury.to answer the question,we employ the usual tools of statutory interpretation.we look first at the text of the statute and then,if ambiguous,to other indicia of congressional intent such as the legislative history.see in re mehta,cir.
graden alleges that conexant mismanagement of plan assets caused a loss to the plan that ultimately harmed him and other plan participants.at the pleadings stage where we accept graden allegations as true,this allegation clearly qualifies as a concrete injury traceable to conexant and redressable by a court.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.moreover,we see no prudential concerns that would prevent us from exercising jurisdiction.
it is undisputed that the conexant plan is an employee benefit plan governed by erisa.in addition,we assume for purposes of this appeal that the defendants are fiduciaries of the conexant plan.graden brought this action under a,which accords various parties the right to sue erisa plan fiduciaries for breaches of their fiduciary duties.section a provides the following remedies for such breaches 
mak ing good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach,restor ing to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary,and such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate,including removal of such fiduciary.
as a addresses losses to erisa plans resulting from fiduciary misconduct,the supreme court has held that suits under it are derivative in is,while various parties are entitled to bring suit participants,beneficiaries fiduciaries,and the secretary of labor,they do so on behalf of the plan itself.mut.life ins.russell,d see also in re.erisa litigation,cir.consequently,the plan takes legal title to any recovery,which then inures to the benefit of its participants and beneficiaries.
the analogy that comes to mind quickest is to shareholder derivative litigation,but the roots of a run far deeper when a trustee commits a breach of trust that results in a loss,any beneficiary whose beneficial interests were affected may sue to compel the trustee to make good on the loss.restatement second of trusts cmt.b.when the trustee does so,he restores money to the trust for the benefit of the.see austin scott william fratcher,the law of trusts ed.baker langan,snell equity ed.citing bartlett others barcaly bank tr,ch,unif.tr.code a measuring trustee liability by the amount required to restore the value of the trust property and trust distributions to what they would have been had the breach not occurred.thus,a merely codifies for erisa participants and beneficiaries a classic process for recovering trust losses through a suit on behalf of the trust 
graden claims that he may bring suit as a current participant in the conexant plan erisa defines a participant as any employee or former employee who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.applying this definition,the supreme court has held that the term covers a former employee with a colorable claim for vested benefits.firestone tire rubber bruch,d quoting saladino ret.fund,cir.graden argument is that because conexant breaches improperly reduced the value of plan assets allocable to him,he is entitled to additional benefits that will become available once conexant makes good the loss to the plan.
to evaluate graden argument,we begin with the definition of benefit.the term is not expressly defined in erisa,so we look to its ordinary meaning.a relevant definition is a payment or service provided for under an annuity,pension plan,or insurance policy.online dictionary.essentially,benefits are simply the money to which a person is entitled under an erisa plan.in this context,is what graden seeks a benefit 
the conexant plan is an individual account plan.see.this means that a participant vested benefits are the contents of his account contributions from both the participant and employer plus investment gains minus investment losses and any allocable expenses.in addition,erisa imposes fiduciary duties on plan administrators,so part of a participant entitlement is the value of his account unencumbered by any fiduciary impropriety.in other words,erisa entitles participants not only to what is in their accounts,but also to what should be there given the terms of the plan and erisa fiduciary obligations.
from this,it is not difficult to conclude that graden has standing as a plan participant.as an in the conexant plan,he was entitled to the net value of his account as it should have been in the absence of any fiduciary mismanagement.because he colorably contends that he has yet to receive that amount,he presses a claim for the remainder of his monetary entitlement under his plan and claim for benefits.that he presses it through a is of no moment and,indeed,is sensible here.rather than suing the plan itself under a b which would likely be fruitless,as the very premise of the suit is that the plan itself improperly lost money,he sued the person liable to make good on the loss.if successful,this suit will restore assets to the plan that are allocable to graden account,and he will then get a distribution from that restored account.far from creating problems,this is exactly the process that a borrowing from trust.
our holding accords with the reasoning of our sister courts of appeals on this issue.in harzewski guidant,cir posner,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit decided this very issue the same way.explaining whether stock losses like graden are benefits,it stated 
benefits are benefits in a plan they are the value of the retirement account when the employee retires,and a breach of fiduciary duty that diminishes that value gives rise to a claim for benefits measured by the difference between what the retirement account was worth when the employee retired and cashed it out and what it would have been worth then had it not been for the breach of fiduciary duty.
in coan kaufman,cir,the second circuit court of appeals noted that various courts have held that former employees who accept distributions surrender their participant status and the right to sue for breaches of fiduciary duty.the court recognized,however,that these holdings,while sensible in the context of defined benefit plans are more of a problem in defined contribution plans 
w hether acceptance of a payment terminates a person status as a participant may depend on whether the plan is a defined benefits or a defined contribution plan.coan,unlike the plaintiffs discussed in other circuits case law,participated in a k plan,which is an individual account or defined contribution plan under erisa.see.according to erisa,an individual accrued benefit s under such a plan are simply the balance of the individual account.id.b.arguably,therefore,coan claim that the distribution of her account balance would have been greater absent the defendants breach of fiduciary duty is a claim for benefits which,if colorable,means that she may become eligible for benefits and thus qualifies as a participant under erisa.
id.at.the court ultimately did not decide the question,but its analysis is compelling.
similarly,in crawford lamantia,cir,the first circuit court of appeals adopted the general rule that former employees with claims for additional benefits have standing,but ruled that the particular plaintiff in that case lacked standing because he failed to show that defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duty had a direct and inevitable effect on his benefits.in our case,on the other hand,it is clear that the alleged breach had an effect on graden benefits because their value dropped with the value of conexant common stock.
iii.additional arguments 
while we believe that our reasoning in part ii is sufficient to resolve this case,we continue to respond more fully to conexant and its amicus arguments.specifically,conexant contends that graden claim is better characterized as one for damages rather than benefits.along those same lines,it argues that because graden can not assert a a b claim,he can not make a claim for benefits.in addition,graden alleged loss is,it claims,too speculative or difficult to ascertain to be characterized as benefits.finally,it argues that public policy considerations counsel in favor of its interpretation.we respond to each argument in turn.
the fifth and ninth circuit courts of appeals decided the first important cases in this area,and they both drew a line between claims for benefits and claims for damages.sommers drug stores.employee profit sharing trust corrigan,cir kuntz reese,cir per curiam.having a colorable claim for vested benefits gives a person participant standing,even if his employer has ostensibly cashed him out of the plan.sommers,at.in those cases,the dispute is over whether the employee was properly accorded all of the benefits due him hence,for standing purposes all the employee needs is a colorable claim that he is entitled to additional benefits under the plan.the sommers court,relying on its decision in yancy am.petrofina,cir,contrasted having a claim for benefits with a claim for damages.sommers,at.
however,relying on a dichotomy is unsatisfying 
the distinction between benefits and damages is not clear.this is in part attributable to use of words with overlapping meaning to describe mutually exclusive categories.the statute simply grants rights of recovery only to a distinct and limited type of claim which itself is no more than a suit for damages,albeit personally suffered because participants should have been paid under the plan but were not.clearly,a plaintiff alleging that his benefits were wrongly computed has a claim for vested benefits.payment of the sum sought by such a plaintiff will not increase payments due him.on the other hand,a plaintiff who seeks the recovery for the trust of an unascertainable amount,with no demonstration that the recovery will directly effect payment to him,would state a claim for damages,not benefits.
id.in sommers,the plaintiffs were former employees cashed out of an erisa plan when the trustees sold the assets of the plan shares of the employer common stock for cash in a transaction incident to a merger.the plaintiffs sued under a,alleging that the trustees breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the shares for less than fair market value.like graden,they sued to compel the trustees to make good on the loss caused by their breach.the court concluded that the employees were participants with standing because they ha d a claim for an ascertainable amount allegedly owed them at the time they received their lump sum.id.at.
the ninth circuit court has also clarified that former employees are participants with standing when they sue for disgorgement of a plan fiduciary profits.amalgamated clothing textile workers union murdock,cir.the court held that such profits are vested benefits because under erisa and the common law of trusts the plan has a legal interest in them.thus,erisa allows a district court to order disgorging those profits and placing a constructive trust on them for the ultimate benefit of the plan participants.as the court noted,disgorgement and the imposition of a constructive trust are both classic equitable remedies,hence,they fit easily in erisa remedial scheme.
while we believe that sommers was rightly decided,we can not endorse the distinction it makes between benefits and damages per sommers,suits for miscalculated benefits seek monetary,compensatory relief which is,in common legal parlance,damages.at.yet it is beyond dispute that such relief is at the same time properly characterized as benefits because it merely gives the participant what he is entitled to receive under the plan.with this confusing overlap,the dichotomy breaks down.moreover,the dichotomy appears nowhere in the statute,nor is it necessary to explain the outcomes reached by this line of jurisprudence.in yancy,for example,the plaintiff sought to recover benefits that he argued would have vested had he not retired early.at.yancy claimed that he retired early because the plan administrator intended illegally to reduce future benefits.id.at.the court denied yancy standing,but its reasoning,which implied that he was not seeking benefits,needs clarification because what yancy sought were in fact plan payments.the problem with yancy claim was that he sought benefits for which he could never become eligible because his voluntary retirement occurred before those benefits came into existence 
in reaching its decision,the sommers court did emphasize what the plaintiff was entitled on the day of his retirement.that,we believe,is the question that properly governs these cases.if the plaintiff colorably claims that under the plan and erisa he was entitled to more than he received on the day he cashed out,then he presses a claim for vested benefits and must be accorded participant standing.if,on the other hand,he claims that his benefits were all he was entitled to under the plan the day they were paid but that he should yet recover something more,then he presses a claim for something other than vested benefits and is not entitled to standing 
perhaps a stronger reason not to rely on the dichotomy is the extent to which it causes confusion with the relief dichotomy that is of great import in a claims.unlike a,which specifically imposes personal,monetary liability on trustees for breaches of fiduciary
