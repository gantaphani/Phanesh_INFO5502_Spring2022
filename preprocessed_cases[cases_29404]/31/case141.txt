plaintiffs appellants plaintiffs are former employees of lehman brothers holdings lehman,or its subsidiaries,who participated in the lehman brothers savings plan the plan and,specifically,in the lehman stock fund the lsf.the plan is covered by the employee retirement income security act,et erisa.under the plan,employees of lehman could choose to contribute portions of their salaries to different investment funds to save for retirement.one of the funds,the lsf,is an employee stock ownership plan esop invested exclusively in lehman common stock.though the plan prohibited employees from allocating all of their contributions to the lsf,after lehman declared bankruptcy in september,that portion of plaintiffs retirement savings invested in the lsf was rendered essentially worthless.
arguing that defendants appellees,the members of lehman employee benefit plans committee the benefit committee defendants and the company directors the director defendants who appointed them,breached their fiduciary duties under erisa,plaintiffs instituted this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in october.the district court kaplan,dismissed plaintiffs initial and amended complaints for failure to state a claim.we affirm the district court decisions and hold that plaintiffs failed to plead a plausible claim that defendants breached their erisa fiduciary duties.
background 
i.the plan 
the benefit committee defendants were responsible for administering lehman employee retirement savings plan.lehman directors who served as members of the board compensation committee were directly responsible for appointing individuals to the benefit committee,which the full board endowed with complete authority and discretion to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan.joint app x.
the plan consisted of a trust fund that offered multiple investment funds including the lsf.id.at.during the class period,if a lehman employee failed to designate a fund,the default investment option was a target date mutual fund,not the lsf.scac.were permitted to allocate percent of their plan contributions to the lsf.id.the plan specifies that the lsf shall at all times be invested exclusively in lehman stock except for such reserve invested in fixed income investments or cash as shall be determined to be necessary or advisable for the purpose of maintaining appropriate liquidity joint app x emphasis added.however,the benefit committee retained the right to cease offering the lsf,or to divest some or all of the plan holdings in the lsf,as necessary to comply with erisa fiduciary duties.specifically,the plan provided 
the benefit committee shall have the right to eliminate or curtail investments in lehman stock if and to the extent that the benefit committee determines that such action is required in order to comply with the fiduciary duty rules of section a of erisa,as modified by section a of erisa.
the benefit committee defendants continued to offer the lsf as an investment option throughout the spring and summer of,when lehman stock price fluctuated before falling to less than per share on the last trading day before the company declared bankruptcy on september,years after its founding in.two days later,nyse regulation,suspended trading of lehman stock on the new york stock exchange.
ii.procedural history 
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint the cac on october.the cac alleged that the director defendants,along with wendy uvino,the chair of the benefit committee,breached their erisa fiduciary duties.plaintiffs premised this claim on defendants failure to limit or divest plaintiffs allegedly imprudent investment in the lsf during the class period,which ran from september,through october.plaintiffs lodged three counts against defendants breach of the duties of prudence and loyalty including disclosure obligations breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest and breach of the duties to monitor other fiduciaries and to provide them with accurate information solely against the director defendants.
on february,the district court granted defendants federal rule of civil procedure b motion for failure to state a claim and dismissed the cac in its entirety.in re lehman.sec.erisa,d lehman i.the district court subsequently granted plaintiffs leave to amend plaintiffs filed a second consolidated amended complaint the scac on september.
plaintiffs made three key changes.first,in addition to wendy uvino,plaintiffs named the rest of the benefit committee members as defendants.second,plaintiffs narrowed the class period to march,through june.these dates respectively represent the date that bear stearns was acquired by jpmorgan chase in lieu of total collapse and the date that the benefit committee liquidated shares of lehman stock in the lsf.third,the scac included additional facts purporting to show that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman stock was an imprudent investment for plaintiffs.
the paragraph scac provides a thorough recitation of the financial crisis with a focus on lehman involvement with securities.plaintiffs claim that by no later than the collapse of bear stearns,defendants knew or should have known that the plan heavy investment in lehman stock was imprudent because of,inter alia lehman alleged leverage ratio of more than lehman use of questionable accounting tactics including repo the extent of lehman potential losses from trading in subprime derivatives and lehman inadequate reserves to cover its exposure.scac.
plaintiffs allege that the benefit committee defendants should have been aware of these risks to lehman financial stability as a result of their positions within the company presentations by an outside investment consulting firm,and the numerous published articles and reports that questioned lehman profits and viability during the spring and summer of.plaintiffs also claim that a reasonable investigation by the benefit committee defendants would have revealed probative information,including,for example,the frantic but ultimately unsuccessful efforts made by lehman management,in conjunction with government officials,to seek an outside capital infusion or to arrange a sale of lehman in the weeks prior to bankruptcy.
the district court dismissed the scac pursuant to rule b.in re lehman.sec.erisa,md lak,wl,lehman ii.with respect to plaintiffs duty of prudence claim,the court determined that the complaint failed to plead sufficient facts to show that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman faced a dire situation when bear stearns was sold.id.at.
the district court also dismissed plaintiffs two disclosure claims.id.at.first,the court found that the benefit committee defendants had no affirmative duty to disclose information about plan investments specifically,the status of lehman financial condition in addition to information about the plan itself.id.at.second,while the court recognized that fiduciaries who provided information to had an obligation to provide accurate information,it determined that the benefit committee defendants had not breached this duty by incorporating filings made with the securities and exchange commission the sec into the spd issued to plan participants on january,because this incorporation occurred outside of the class period.id.at.moreover,the court reasoned that although the incorporation was,the benefit committee defendants could not be said to have intentionally connected allegedly misleading,future sec filings to the spd.id.
with respect to plaintiffs claims against the director defendants,the court accepted that the directors were properly considered fiduciaries,but only insofar as they appointed the members of the compensation committee,which in turn appointed the members of the benefit committee.id.at.this meant that plaintiffs claim for breach of the duty of prudence and disclosure was not properly lodged against the director defendants.id.at.the court rejected plaintiffs claim that the director defendants had breached their fiduciary duty to appoint qualified plan managers because it was unsupported by even the barest factual allegations.id.finally,the court dismissed plaintiffs claim that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duty to monitor the benefit committee defendants as derivative of plaintiffs unsuccessful claim for breach of the duty of prudence.id.at.
plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court erred by dismissing the cac and the scac under rule b because plaintiffs plausibly alleged that the benefit committee defendants breached their fiduciary duty of prudence by continuing to offer the lsf as an investment option and by failing to sell lehman stock invested in the lsf the benefit committee defendants breached their fiduciary duty of disclosure by incorporating lehman allegedly inaccurate sec filings into spds sent to and the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties to monitor,appoint and inform the benefit committee defendants in their management of lehman erisa plan 
discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b.in re citigroup erisa,cir.although w e accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint s,t o survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.
duty of prudence 
a.the moench presumption 
under erisa,fiduciaries must discharge their duties with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.ordinarily,erisa fiduciaries must act prudently by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses.id.a c.the primary purpose of an esop,however,is investment in employer securities and employer securities only.see citigroup,at.this is facially inconsistent with erisa requirement that fiduciaries diversify investments.although congress has encouraged esop creation by,for example,exempting esops from erisa prudence requirement,it did so only to the extent that it requires diversification.id.quoting moench robertson,cir a.the possibility of a serious conflict is apparent an erisa fiduciary of an esop can easily become torn between the duties to protect retirement assets and encourag e investment in employer stock.citigroup,at.
in moench,the third circuit proposed a means of resolving this potential dilemma minimal judicial review for challenges to a fiduciary management of an esop.see at.the third circuit reasoned that an esop is simply a trust under which the trustee is directed to invest the assets primarily in the stock of a single company a purpose explicitly approved and encouraged by congress.id.at.the court observed that trustees are under a duty to conform to the terms of the trust,such that i f the trust requires the fiduciary to invest in a particular stock,the trustee must comply unless compliance would be impossible or illegal.id.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.as recently noted by the seventh circuit,an esop fiduciary abuses its discretion under moench if the fiduciary permits investment in employer stock when the fiduciary could not have believed reasonably that continued adherence to the esop direction was in keeping with the settlor expectations of how a prudent trustee would operate.white marshall ilsley,cir hamilton,quoting moench,at.
we recently adopted the moench presumption in citigroup at.this court specifically rejected the argument that the moench presumption should not apply at the pleading stage.id.at.because we view the presumption as a standard of review,rather than an evidentiary presumption,w here plaintiffs do not allege facts sufficient to establish that a plan fiduciary has abused his discretion,there is no reason not to grant a motion to dismiss.pfeil state street bank and trust,cir.
citigroup further endorsed the guiding principle discussed by the ninth circuit in quan computer sciences,cir,that judicial scrutiny should increase with the degree of discretion a plan gives its fiduciaries to invest.citigroup,at quoting quan,at.thus a fiduciary failure to divest from company stock is less likely to constitute an abuse of discretion if the plan terms require rather than merely permit investment in company stock.id.plans that do not give fiduciaries discretion to divest from an esop are more heavily shielded from searching judicial review.accordingly,when an erisa fiduciary is torn between following the terms of a plan requiring investment in employer stock and the provisions of erisa requiring prudent management,we will presume that the fiduciary acted prudently unless the pleads facts sufficient to show that fiduciaries either knew or should have known that the employer was in the sort of dire situation that required them to override plan terms in order to limit participants investments in employer stock.id.at.
moench applies here.although we had not officially adopted it at the time the district court dismissed either of plaintiffs complaints,the court presciently employed this standard of review on both occasions.see lehman i,d at lehman ii,wl,at.plaintiffs argue that the moench presumption is inapplicable or,in the alternative,weak because the plan gives the benefit committee discretion to eliminate or curtail investments in the lsf.appellants br.at.were this the case,plaintiffs would be correct that the moench presumption should apply in limited form.however,contrary to plaintiffs characterization,the plan here does not provide the benefit committee with discretion sufficient to undermine the policies requiring application of the moench presumption.
the lsf must at all times be invested exclusively in lehman stock,with the exception of minor cash reserves,joint app x,and the trust fund shall consist of the lehman stock fund,among others,id.at emphasis added.the plan gives the benefit committee the right to eliminate or curtail investments in lehman stock if and to the extent that the committee determines that such action is required in order to comply with the fiduciary duties rules of section of erisa.id.at emphasis added.this does not equate to discretion to divest from the lsf.see taveras ubs ag,at cir distinguishing between plans differing levels of discretion and finding a plan that offered fiduciaries a means by which to terminate the company fund as an investment option if they so choose was still covered by moench because plan language mandated offering the company fund.the plan here merely states the law fiduciaries must comply with the applicable tenets of erisa.in citigroup,we acknowledged erisa requirement that fiduciaries follow plan terms only to the extent that they are consistent with erisa,thus ensuring that even plans affording zero discretion contain implicit legal limits.see at emphasis added.the limit here is simply made explicit.the moench presumption applies in full force.
before applying the moench presumption in this case,we first address two legal questions implicated by its application.first,can plaintiffs claim that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman stock was an imprudent investment based on material,nonpublic information second,how specific must plaintiffs be with regard to when the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman was in a dire situation 
inside information 
many of the facts that plaintiffs allege gave rise to the benefit committee defendants awareness or actionable ignorance of lehman dire situation,were not public during the class period.for example,plaintiffs claim that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known about private conversations between lehman chief executive officer,defendant richard fuld,ceo fuld,and treasury secretary paulson.
plaintiffs argue that the benefit committee defendants had a duty to investigate whether lehman was in a dire situation,and that any reasonable investigation would have revealed material,nonpublic information sufficient to confirm that lehman was on the verge of collapse in its amicus brief supporting plaintiffs,the secretary of labor the secretary asserts that a reasonable investigation of lehman financial health would have revealed such nonpublic information as lehman use of improper accounting methods and private conversations between ceo fuld and the government about selling lehman or obtaining a capital infusion.amicus br.at.according to the secretary,objectively prudent fiduciaries would have uncovered this type of inside information and acted upon it 
several other circuits have confronted,and rejected,similar arguments.recently,in white,the seventh circuit disposed of any contention that insiders should engage in transactions based on material,nonpublic information,as this would violate federal securities laws.at.in kirschbaum reliant energy,cir,the fifth circuit confirmed that f iduciaries may not trade for the benefit of plan participants based on material information to which the general shareholding public has been denied access,and that this served to reenforce the conclusion that the moench presumption can not be lightly overcome.likewise,in quan,the ninth circuit noted that one reason to adopt the moench presumption is because its high burden gives fiduciaries a safe harbor from failing to use insider information to divest from employer stock.at.we do not construe an erisa fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence to include violating the law to serve a plan beneficiaries.id.at.
fiduciaries are under no obligation to either seek or act upon inside information in the course of fulfilling their duties under erisa.the duty of a fiduciary to prudently discharge his obligations solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries should be read to end with the words within the bounds of the law.a b.the prudent man does not commit insider trading.we recognize that,had the benefit committee defendants sought inside information that revealed the imprudence of continued investment in lehman stock,breaching the terms of the plan by ceasing to offer the lsf as an investment option would not run afoul of federal securities laws given the absence of a purchase or sale of stock.see,harris amgen,wl,at cir.june.
consider,however,that if plan managers are obligated to conduct an investigation into the financial condition of a plan asset that extends to material,nonpublic information,plan managers will face a dilemma if inside information shows that continued investment is imprudent.on the one hand,plan managers will be able to adhere to their duty of prudence by limiting further investment in the improvident asset without breaching securities laws.on the other hand,plan managers will not be able to comply with their duty of prudence by divesting the plan of its investment without risking liability for insider trading.there is no happy solution to this quandary,and particularly when erisa plans are managed internally it is a situation that is bound to occur.given the conflicted state of the law,there seems but one reasonable approach the duty of prudence must not be construed to include an obligation to affirmatively seek out material,nonpublic information pertaining to plan investments.
in lehman i,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claim against the benefit committee defendants for breach of the duty of prudence because plaintiffs failed to allege facts that permit a determination of when lehman financial condition reached the point of imminent corporate collapse.d at.although plaintiffs specified a moment of clarity in the scac march,the sale date for bear stearns the district court was not persuaded that plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to explain why those circumstances alerted or ought to have alerted lehman that it would suffer the same fate as bear stearns.lehman ii,wl,at.
plaintiffs argue that t he district court unprecedented requirement that a complaint must specify the precise moment in time when a company faces imminent collapse or other dire circumstances imposes an impossible pleading burden on a plaintiff.appellants br.at.while such a requirement might well be unduly onerous,see pfeil,at,the district court here did not reject plaintiffs claims solely because plaintiffs failed either to allege any specific point in time in the cac or to allege the correct point in time in the scac when lehman stock became an imprudent investment.instead,the court concluded that plaintiffs did not allege facts sufficient to show that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman was in a dire situation at any point within the class period.see lehman i,d at lehman ii,wl,at.
in lehman i,the district court noted that e ven assuming that the cac sufficiently alleged that lehman collapse became imminent at some time materially before the bankruptcy filing,it contains nothing to support the inference that uvino the only benefit committee defendant knew or should have known that.supp.at.in lehman ii,the district court considered four allegations that plaintiffs claimed indicated the benefit committee defendants necessary knowledge.wl,at.of these,two involve events that took place after bear stearns collapsed,thus indicating that the district court was open to considering the sufficiency of plaintiffs allegations of imprudence throughout the class period.id.at.like the district court,we will consider plaintiffs allegations regarding what the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known throughout the entire class period.we do not demand any particular timing specificity only that the facts alleged,if true,lead to the conclusion that defendants knew or should have known that the company was in a dire situation at some time during the class period.
applying the moench presumption 
there is no rule regarding how much evidence is necessary to rebut the moench presumption.quan,at.it is clear,however,that the moench presumption is very difficult to overcome as it is designed to be.see see also white,at citigroup,at.p roof of the employer impending collapse may not be required,but mere stock fluctuations are insufficient to show that fiduciaries acted imprudently by adhering to the terms of an esop.id.at see also kirschbaum,at citing cases featuring approximately decreases in stock price that did not include facts sufficient to overcome the moench presumption.whether a fiduciary knew or should have known that the employer was in a dire situation is assessed based upon information available to the fiduciary at the time of each investment decision and not from the vantage point of hindsight.citigroup,at citing a b.
thus,the fact that lehman ultimately declared bankruptcy must not be allowed to influence our assessment of whether the benefit committee defendants acted prudently during the class period.armed with the information available in the months preceding bankruptcy,the benefit committee defendants risked liability for action violating the terms of the esop by limiting plaintiffs investment or inaction remaining invested and exposing to what may have been unintended risk.see summers state street bank trust,cir.had the benefit committee sold lehman stock immediately after bear stearns was sold,for example,might have protested and claimed that the fiduciaries erroneously violated the terms of the plan and deprived them of the subsequent increase in the value of lehman stock.although lehman share price exhibited a downward trend overall during the spring and summer of,the daily price per share fluctuated widely.immediately after bear stearns was sold,on march,lehman was trading at per share.six weeks later,on april,lehman stock price had risen to an approximately increase 
during the week before lehman filed for bankruptcy,its stock price fell steadily from per share on monday,september,to per share at the close of business on friday,september.but even then,in lehman final hours,the market arguably viewed the year old company as a going concern by assigning it a positive expected value a fiduciary is not imprudent to assume that a major stock market provides the best estimate of the value of the stocks traded on it.id.at.we realize,of course,that it is not quite that simple.while we do not believe that fiduciaries should be forced to the market valuation of an investment,we understand that although it is empirically impossible to quantify erisa have interests that are distinct from market investors collectively namely,greater.congress,too,recognized this when it enacted erisa.see generally a.however,congress explicitly allows some have said encourages fiduciaries to contract around the basic core of prudent investing diversification.id.a.
here,plaintiffs have not rebutted the moench presumption because they fail to allege facts sufficient to show that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman was in a dire situation based on information that was publicly available during the class period.first,we note that the forced sale of bear stearns alone does not show that lehman specifically was in serious danger.in fact,given that bear stearns was effectively bailed out by the government the events of march,could be construed to cut against plaintiffs claims because the benefit committee defendants may have believed that lehman would be saved as well likewise,the general climate for financial firms in,the collective information known or knowable to the benefit committee defendants by virtue of their positions at lehman,the investment consulting firm presentations,public articles and reports,lehman financial disclosures and lehman declining but still positive stock price do not counter the presumption that these fiduciaries acted prudently by remaining invested in lehman stock.
plaintiffs claim that the benefit committee defendants should have been aware of lehman alleged high leverage ratio,its broad exposure to the subprime mortgage market,its inability to cover the extent of its potential losses and its use of questionable accounting tactics such as repo by virtue of their expertise and their positions at lehman.we agree with the district court that plaintiffs allegations are conclusory,lehman ii,wl,at,and that,regardless,they merely show that the members of the benefit committee would have possessed comparable knowledge to the market analysts and investors who helped maintain lehman substantial market capital even immediately prior to the company bankruptcy.
plaintiffs further allege that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman was an imprudent investment because of presentations by an outside consulting firm showing that the subprime mortgage market was on the verge of collapse.the presentations to the benefit committee defendants,however,did not deal specifically with the potential effects of a credit crunch on lehman.the majority of the investment consulting firm analyses focused on comparing the degree of lehman downward spiral with the decline.based on plaintiffs allegations,which we accept as true,the benefit committee defendants were not obligated,after allegedly being told that lehman was the market,to breach the terms of the plan by refusing to offer the lsf or by divesting lehman stock.
plaintiffs argue that several published articles and reports questioning lehman viability should have alerted the benefit committee defendants to lehman imprudence as an investment.even accepting the truth of plaintiffs allegations,these types of statements in the financial press do not give rise to a plausible assertion that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman was in a dire situation.we agree with plaintiffs that lehman increasingly frequent of losses and the media coverage thereof should have given rise to concern.however,we still can not find that plaintiffs plausibly alleged that the benefit committee defendants knew or should have known that lehman was an imprudent investment given the mixed signals with which the fiduciaries grappled throughout the class period.for example,plaintiffs allege in the scac that lehman materially overstated its liquidity pool when it publicly announced that it was billion on september,just days before the company filed for bankruptcy.scac.it seems that plaintiffs claims are improperly directed the true objects of plaintiffs ire are the lehman executives whom plaintiffs allege made material misstatements regarding the financial health of the company not the erisa fiduciaries who relied on them.
still,plaintiffs claim that even if these indicators could not,standing alone,compel the benefit committee defendants to curtail or eliminate the lsf,the facts alleged should have incited these fiduciaries to conduct an investigation that would have revealed the imprudence of maintaining the investment in the lsf.but plaintiffs recognize that a failure to investigate,on its own,is insufficient to state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence,and that plaintiffs must allege facts that,if proved,would show that an adequate investigation would have revealed to a reasonable fiduciary that the investment at issue was improvident.citigroup,at citing kuper iovenko,cir emphasis added.here,any reasonable investigation undertaken by the benefit committee defendants would not have revealed additional facts sufficient to compel the fiduciaries to break the terms of the plan because they could not have based prudent investment choices on the material,nonpublic information that plaintiffs claim showed that lehman was failing.
we find that the sum of plaintiffs plausible allegations do not overcome the moench presumption.market fluctuations and an price immediately in advance of bankruptcy would not have put a prudent investor on notice that lehman had reached a dire situation.we understand that the of participants in an esop may differ from the of the market as a whole,but portfolios are inherently risky we can not penalize fiduciaries who allow to invest in esops absent very strong indications that fiduciaries knew or should have known that participants no longer desired to remain invested 
ii.duty of disclosure 
plaintiffs also claim that the benefit committee defendants breached their duties of disclosure under erisa by incorporating lehman allegedly inaccurate sec filings into spds sent to.according to plaintiffs,assessing the viability of their claim requires answering three questions whether the benefit committee defendants were acting as fiduciaries when they incorporated the sec filings whether the spds were sent to during the class period and whether the benefit committee defendants knew these sec filings contained misleading information,and,if not,whether they had an obligation to investigate the possibility based on warning signs.appellants br.at.
using plaintiffs proposed framework,first,liability under erisa can arise only from actions taken or duties breached in the performance of erisa obligations.in re worldcom,d,finding that spd incorporation of sec filings was insufficient to transform those documents into a basis for erisa claims against their signatories the directors.in its recent decision in dudenhoefer fifth third,cir,the sixth circuit addressed the previously unanswered question of whether the express incorporation of sec filings into an spd is a fiduciary communication.the court answered this question in the affirmative because selecting the information to convey through the spd is a fiduciary activity.id.at.we agree.the benefit committee defendants in this case were acting as erisa fiduciaries when they incorporated lehman sec filings into the spd distributed to.
second,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred because,although the sec filings were prepared before the class period began,the spds were sent to during the class period.the spds of concern here were issued on january,the class period began on march,as specified by the scac.plaintiffs argument depends on their claim that the spds were sent to plan participants during the class period,but plaintiffs do not plausibly allege this fact.appellants br.at emphasis added.still,as the district court recognized,the incorporation was inasmuch as the spd purported to incorporate future sec filings.lehman ii,wl,at.however,plaintiffs must still articulate a viable claim that the benefit committee defendants knew of false statements contained in or yet to be conta
