opinion of the court 
on this appeal,the sole issue raised by defendant andrew lutyk is whether the record of a trial justified piercing the corporate veil of the american elevator company to impose personal liability on him as its sole shareholder for unpaid contributions the corporation owed to health,benefit,and pension funds established by a collective bargaining agreement.because we believe that the district court did not base its decision on clearly erroneous factual findings,we will affirm.
defendant andrew lutyk was the president,sole director,and sole shareholder of the american elevator company american,a small,corporation which performed elevator service and repair.lutyk incorporated american in late.pursuant to various agreements between american and the international union of elevator constructors,in addition to the regular wages paid to its employees,american was obligated to make monthly contributions to various benefit and pension funds.american was also required to make certain wage deductions from the employees salaries,then remit those deductions to the pension fund.

at this time,american fell behind in meeting its contractual obligations to contribute to the nei funds.in,the board of trustees sued american to recover these unpaid benefit contributions.that civil action culminated in a consent judgment whereby american agreed to pay the nei funds a total of.however,in,american ceased business operations.although subsequent payments were made to the nei funds,american paid only pursuant to the consent judgment,along with that had been deducted from the employees paychecks after the consent judgment,but not immediately paid to the nei funds.
on may,the board of trustees initiated the present lawsuit against defendant lutyk personally,alleging that he was also liable to the nei funds as a fiduciary under of erisa,a.plaintiff sought to recover from lutyk the full amount of what it had been unable to collect from american,as well as additional contributions accrued but never paid by american after the consent judgment.the district court denied plaintiff motion for summary judgment on the erisa claims,concluding that there were material issues of fact in dispute concerning whether the unpaid contributions to the benefit funds were plan assets.tr.of the elevator indus.pension lutyk,d,lutyk i.while reasoning that this potentially prohibited lutyk from having any direct liability under erisa,the district court sua sponte read our opinion in solomon klein,cir,to provide that by piercing the corporate veil,the claims against lutyk might be sustained.lutyk i,d at.although also declining to grant summary judgment on that ground,the district court established piercing the corporate veil as an issue for trial.id.at

in his brief to this court on appeal,lutyk entire summary of argument is as follows 
the district court erred and abused its discretion in the determination to pierce the corporate veil and impose personal liability under erisa without sufficient record support.
we read lutyk to be challenging only the district court application of the legal test for piercing the corporate veil set forth in united states pisani,cir and the related factual findings.our review of the proceedings below indicates that lutyk made no objection,as he did not raise the issue to us in his briefs,with respect to the district court authority to pierce the corporate veil and impose liability on a not directly liable under erisa while our reading of the district court order indicates that the district court purported to pierce the corporate veil pursuant to erisa a,a,and we have some doubts regarding the district court authority to do so i t is well established that failure to raise an issue in the district court constitutes a waiver of the argument in the court of appeals.brenner local,united of carpenters joiners of,cir see also medical protective watkins,cir.likewise,although the district court did not make a specific finding concerning the amount of funds siphoned from american,lutyk has similarly conceded that the imposition on him of the full judgment that remained against american of was appropriate.see peacock,at.declining to address a similar issue because the parties did not raise these issues below and lutyk did not invoke them on appeal,we will assume,without deciding,that these actions of the district court were proper.we consider here only the specific issue raised in this court by lutyk.
in analyzing the conduct of lutyk and applying the alter ego doctrine to determine whether it was appropriate to invoke its remedy to pierce the corporate veil,the district court below reasoned that f ederal law governs liability for a breach of a labor contract between union and employer,including liability based on a theory of corporate veil piercing.lutyk ii,d at citing am.bell fed of.workers of,cir.therefore,the district court applied our pisani decision and the factors outlined therein as a matter of federal common law,at,to determine whether it was appropriate to pierce american corporate veil.
lutyk does not appeal the application of pisani s factors or of federal common law,per se.however,he does dispute the district court failure to require,as an element for establishing that the alter ego doctrine is applicable,that the plaintiff prove that the corporation was intended as a sham or facade to defraud the corporate creditors.because neither party challenges the application of our alter ego doctrine to this case,we will also assume without deciding that those factors apply,and consider whether fraudulent intent is indeed a required element of the analysis.united states bestfoods,d declining to discuss whether the state or federal alter ego doctrine applied to determine derivative liability under cercla.in pearson component tech,cir,this court discussed the factors of the third circuit alter ego test,id.at,and noted some of the differences between our test,and others.one of the most important differences across jurisdictions seem s to reside largely in whether an element of fraudulent intent,inequitable conduct,or injustice is explicitly required id.at.nonetheless,in determining whether to pierce the corporate veil,we considered 
the following factors gross undercapitalization,failure to observe corporate formalities,nonpayment of dividends,insolvency of debtor corporation,siphoning of funds from the debtor corporation by the dominant stockholder,nonfunctioning of officers and directors,absence of corporate records,and whether the corporation is merely a facade for the operations of the dominant stockholder.see american bell,at.
id.at emphasis added.we have never characterized these factors as elements of a rigid test.see,american bell,at these factors are not the exclusive approach pisani,at.what we have done is to essentially inquire into whether the debtor corporation is little more than a legal fiction.pearson,at.while piercing of the corporate veil is an equitable remedy,in re blatstein,at,and therefore the situation must present an element of injustice or fundamental unfairness,a number of these factors can be sufficient to show such unfairness.pisani,at quotation omitted see also fletcher,supra,constructive fraud and avoiding an inequitable result is often enough.because our test does not require proof of actual fraud as a prerequisite for piercing the corporate veil,the district court failure here to require that the plaintiff prove that american was established as a facade was not an error of law 
a lter ego must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.kaplan,at.nonetheless,w hen findings of a district court are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses,rule a demands even greater deference to the trial court findings by the court of appeals.ragan excavating,cir.furthermore,where,as here,the appellant fails to point to specific evidence either in the record or not in the record before the district court which shows that the court findings were made in clear error,id.at,we are inclined to affirm the district court.
the district court reasoned that factual findings with respect to the following factors weighed in favor of piercing the corporate veil the insolvency of the debtor corporation,american undercapitalization,the siphoning of american funds by lutyk,and the dearth of corporate formalities and corporate records,as well as the element that injustice would occur if lutyk was not made responsible.see pisani,at listing factors.we conclude that,with the exception of the district court conclusion regarding american undercapitalization,the district court findings are adequately supported by the record and not clearly erroneous.
the district court finding with respect to american insolvency is well supported by the record.the scant corporate records before the court demonstrated that corporate equity was negative and that liabilities exceeded corporate assets.nonetheless,the very purpose of the corporate form is to limit the liability of investors to the capital they pay in,see zubik zubik,cir insolvency,without more,is not a factor which can justify piercing a corporate veil.see american bell,at requiring specific,unusual circumstances.however,insolvency may raise questions concerning the conduct of corporate officers and shareholders which otherwise would be presumed appropriate,see fletcher,supra,here,it causes us to closely scrutinize the actions of lutyk.
in particular,the district court findings with respect to american insolvency are strong evidence to support the court conclusion that lutyk was siphoning funds.see pisani,at affirming piercing of the corporate veil when the shareholder repaid the shareholder loans to himself with corporate funds while the corporation was failing.the corporate records before the district court indicated that american owed lutyk on loans of at the end of and.over the next year,as american plunged deeper into insolvency and the corporation failed to pay the contributions it owed the nei funds under the collective bargaining agreements,the amount of those shareholder loans dropped precipitously to.while lutyk disputes the fact that those loans were repaid,he points to no evidence in the record indicating that the district court finding was clear error.beyond the loans that lutyk caused american to repay him,american ledgers also show that lutyk directly withdrew increasing amounts of cash from the corporation as it declined.the district court noted that in,lutyk apparently took from the corporation through partner drawings.those drawings increased to in.then,in the first three months of alone,lutyk took from the company a further in that manner.
of course,not every payment to a stockholder during insolvency would justify piercing the corporate veil,kaplan,at,and some portion of those payments may have been legitimate given the finding that american paid its president no salary.however,these irregularly scheduled,erratic,but not insignificant drawings underscore the district court findings and conclusions on two other factors relevant to piercing the corporate veil lutyk substantial disregard of corporate formalities in his management and ownership of american and a significant commingling by lutyk of american assets with his own.the district court noted that it received from lutyk few of american tax returns,accounting ledgers,receipts,or other documents which are commonly maintained by an ordinary corporation in its operations.while lutyk asserts that the lack of formal documentation was due to a storage facility being flooded,the district judge who heard the witnesses testify did not credit this assertion,and nothing was provided by lutyk to corroborate his testimony on this alleged flood.
beyond the partner drawings,lutyk seemed to freely take funds from the company accounts as he saw fit and when he saw fit.that american paid its president no salary,while cutting against siphoning,indicates a lack of respect for the corporate form and of american as a separate entity.evidence before the district court also indicated that american employed members of lutyk family for substantially inflated compensation.his daughter,originally hired by american as an office manager
