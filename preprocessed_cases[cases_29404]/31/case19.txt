this lawsuit arises from a dispute between an erisa disability plan administrator and a beneficiary over the amount by which the monthly disability payments made to the beneficiary should be offset by her other monthly income from social security.the administrator maintains that the disability payments must be offset by the gross amount of social security income,while the beneficiary argues that the payments must be offset by the net amount of social security income.the district court found for the administrator,noting that its interpretation of the plan language to allow for a gross offset was entitled to deference and was,in any event,ultimately reasonable.in addition to contesting this decision,the beneficiary complains that the district court abused its discretion when it denied the beneficiary broad requests for discovery.having made a number of assumptions in the beneficiary favor,we affirm.to be clear,the dispute is not about whether the social security income may offset the disability payments.it is about whether the administrator may use the simple gross amount of the social security payments for offset purposes.
plaintiff debra troiano is a former employee of electric boat corporation,a subsidiary of defendant general dynamics corporation gdc.while working there from to,troiano participated in gdc disability ltd plan,which was funded and administered by defendant aetna life insurance company aetna.
a.the plan structure and documents 
gdc ltd plan is an employee welfare benefits plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.the terms of the plan are set forth in four relevant documents the group policy,which contains general terms and conditions governing the plan the summary of coverage,which details the ltd benefits the booklet,which describes the group coverage plan and the summary plan description spd.gdc issued the spd in compliance with erisa,which requires a plan to provide information written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,and sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.id.a.
the plan itself vests aetna with broad authority to exercise discretion in administering the plan.the group policy explains that aetna is a fiduciary under erisa and has discretionary authority to construe any disputed or doubtful terms of th e policy.the group policy further reserves aetna right to adopt reasonable policies,procedures,rules,and interpretations of th e policy to promote orderly and efficient administration.the spd describes aetna authority in a similarly expansive way,assigning aetna the absolute authority and sole discretion to interpret all terms of the plan and to resolve ambiguities in the plan or the spd.
the relevant documents also provide that a plan participant who suffers a total disability will receive monthly ltd benefits.the amount of such benefits will equal a percentage of the participant predisability earnings,up to a monthly maximum of,minus all other income benefits that are payable for a given month to the participant or to her spouse,children,or dependents.the booklet reiterates that i f other income benefits are payable for a given month,t he monthly benefit payable under th e plan for that month will be the lesser of the scheduled monthly ltd benefit and the maximum monthly benefit minus all other income benefits.it further defines other income benefits to encompass b enefits under the federal social security act.
the spd consistently states that basic monthly earnings are the gross monthly pay paid to you by the company for performing your job in effect immediately before the disability begins.it clearly provides that y our benefit amount from the ltd plan is reduced by any payments you are eligible to receive from other sources,such as b enefits under the federal social security act.it further clarifies that the monthly ltd payments will not be reduced by any increases in other income benefits.
importantly,as an example of how the benefit reduction works,the spd provides a scenario in which tom,a fictional beneficiary,has basic monthly earnings of,bought the level of coverage,becomes eligible for ltd benefits and qualifies for a social security benefit of per month.the spd expressly states that,under this example,tom monthly ltd benefits would be,which equals of,minus in social security benefits.
the spd explains that participants can choose between one of two benefit levels the base level of of predisability earnings or the level of of predisability earnings.the employer pays the premiums for of coverage.participants who choose the level must pay the premium for the additional of coverage.the spd explains that the cost for the additional coverage is deducted from the participant paycheck on an basis.while the participant is taxed on both her own cost and the company contributions,the spd assures that the ltd plan benefit will not be subject to income tax.troiano elected the coverage option.
troiano eligibility for ltd and social security benefits 
troiano became disabled in july and applied for plan benefits.from december,when aetna approved her claim,until april,when aetna began offsetting her monthly ltd benefits by her gross social security income,aetna issued to troiano monthly payments of,which equals of,troiano monthly gross predisability earnings.
in a letter dated june,aetna informed troiano that an application for social security disability insurance ssdi benefits on her behalf was warranted.in fact,troiano had already applied for ssdi benefits in june.after years of administrative wrangling and litigation in federal district court,an administrative law judge determined in october that troiano had been under a disability,as defined by the social security act,since july.an award letter from the social security administration subsequently confirmed that troiano had been entitled to baseline monthly payments of starting in january five calendar months after becoming disabled.it further noted that,in addition to the,troiano was entitled to incrementally greater amounts that took into account annual adjustments colas for each year she received ssdi payments.by december,the monthly ssdi benefits with colas had risen to,which was more than the baseline.the award letter lastly stated that troiano would receive a payment for the amount that had been due to her through january.
in a letter dated april,aetna informed troiano that it had learned of her monthly ssdi award,as well as the retroactive payment.aetna letter reminded troiano that under the provisions of the plan,her ltd benefits were subject to offset by other income benefits,that such benefits included b enefits under the federal social security act,and that aetna had a right to recover overpayments.after recounting the relevant plan provisions,the letter announced that aetna would begin offsetting troiano monthly ltd benefits by,the gross amount of her ssdi benefit.aetna consistently used this amount in all of its calculations regarding the offset.aetna also demanded,and has since received from troiano,full reimbursement of the amount by which it had overpaid troiano between january and march.
fifteen months later,in a letter dated july,troiano,through her counsel,first requested that aetna offset her ltd benefits by the net,rather than the gross,amount of her ssdi benefits.as stated in this letter,it is undisputed that troiano ltd benefits were,whereas she was required to pay federal and state income taxes on her ssdi benefits.following internal communications discussing the exact verbiage that aetna had used in response to such requests before,aetna denied troiano request in a short letter to her counsel dated november,it is industry standard to offset the gross amount and not the net amount.to adjust the ssdi offset,according to net amount,would involve taxes and we do not get involved in taxation.
after another six months,troiano counsel followed up with a second letter.styled as an appeal of aetna decision to apply a gross offset and dated may,this letter articulated troiano argument for why a net offset was proper troiano also requested in the letter that aetna turn over numerous documents that she claimed were relevant to aetna decision to apply a gross offset.she asserted that aetna was obligated to comply with her request under erisa and applicable department of labor regulations.although internal emails reveal that aetna legal team discussed this may letter,aetna never responded to troiano second request.
aetna continues to offset troiano monthly ltd benefits by the gross amount of her baseline monthly ssdi income,as it has always done.
on november,troiano filed suit against aetna and gdc in the district court for the district of rhode island.she alleged that aetna had breached its fiduciary duty and sought a declaration that her past and future ltd benefits should be offset against the ssdi benefits she was awarded minus any income taxes she was assessed on such benefits.we do not recount the procedural history surrounding troiano amended complaint,which is no longer relevant.
defendants gdc and aetna moved for summary judgment in march.on may,the district court held a hearing on troiano motion for an order compelling production of privileged documents and for discovery under federal rule of civil procedure d.the district court denied the motion from the bench.throughout the hearing,the court reminded troiano that discovery wa s the exception in erisa cases and thus that troiano faced a heavy burden of narrowing the discovery request and tailoring it to those bits of information that she need ed in order to respond to the defendants summary judgment motion.the district court ultimately ruled that troiano had failed to meet this burden by seeking a full panoply of discovery with an impermissible scattershot,i want everything approach.the court would not allow troiano fishing expedition,to uncover something that w ould create an ambiguity in the plan language.
at the end of the hearing,the court also denied troiano request for conflict discovery under metropolitan life insurance glenn.the court found that troiano case was not a denial of benefits,as explained below,and that glenn was therefore inapposite.
troiano then filed both a response to the defendants earlier motion for summary judgment and a for summary judgment.the district court resolved the in the defendants favor.as a threshold matter,in both the hearing and the summary judgment opinion,the district court rejected troiano argument that aetna offset of her ltd benefits by the gross amount of her ssdi benefits was a denial or reduction of benefits.it noted first that this case wa s not about the denial of ltd benefits under a b because it was undisputed that aetna approved troiano disability claim and that it paid her more than in unreduced,ltd benefits over a period.troiano aetna life ins,wl,at.
the district court likewise ruled that the offset was not a reduction of benefits because troiano continued to benefit from regular cola increases which,under the terms of the plan,do not contribute to a further reduction of her ltd benefits.id.at.further,the court reasoned that the extent of troiano income tax exposure was beyond aetna control w hether and to what extent troiano ssdi benefits are taxable is really controlled by her own life activities whether she married,whether she has children,whether she adopts children,whether she has a home.i t all going to be determined by factors that are not within the control of aetna.transcript of motion hearing at,troiano,ecf.
rather than an appeal of a benefit denial or reduction,the district court viewed the suit as one involving straightforward interpretation of the plan offset provision namely,whether that provision should be read as providing for a gross or net offset.in approaching this task,the court rejected troiano argument that de novo review should apply.the court instead held that aetna interpretation was reasonable and thus entitled to deference because the plan plain language vested aetna with broad discretionary powers and authority to interpret the provisions of the plan.troiano,wl,at.
first,it observed that the language of the plan which stated that ltd benefits were subject to an offset against any ssdi benefits that were payable to her for a given month,or which she was eligible to receive made no guarantees that troiano would receive a monthly benefit equal to of her gross monthly predisability earnings.id.at.the court also noted that the spd example decreased the fictional beneficiary ltd benefits by in ssdi benefits per month,but that n othing in the example indicates that this is the amount the beneficiary actually receives,nor does the example indicate that the offset includes a calculation of any income tax liability the recipient may incur.id.finally,the court credited aetna argument that including a calculation of each plan participant varying income tax liability would be unreasonably burdensome and preclude the orderly and effective administration of the plan.id.all of these considerations counseled in favor of aetna plan interpretation.
troiano now appeals,challenging both the affirmance of aetna plan interpretation and the denial of discovery under glenn and rule d.
interpretation of plan offset provision 
we review de novo a district court resolution of for summary judgment.rideout gardner,cir.we may affirm the district court decision on any grounds supported by the record.collazo nicholson,cir.quoting assocs.of,cir.
the parties first point of disagreement is the appropriate standard of review that the district court should have applied in resolving their conflicting interpretations of the plan language.troiano maintains that her lawsuit is an appeal of a benefits denial or reduction under a b,and that de novo review should apply.see firestone tire rubber bruch.although she acknowledges that a plan that expressly gives the plan administrator discretionary authority to construe the plan terms enjoys deference even under firestone,see,she argues that aetna forfeited the deference that it would ordinarily enjoy because it violated erisa regulations when it neglected to reply to her may,appeal letter.see bard bos.shipping ass n,cir.aetna responds by reiterating why troiano suit concerns neither a denial nor a reduction in benefits and thus lies altogether outside of the a b framework.in aetna view,the language of the plan,which grants aetna discretionary authority to construe any disputed or doubtful terms of th e policy,should control.
we need not resolve this issue because,even making four key assumptions in troiano favor and applying de novo review,she still loses.we assume for purposes of adjudicating this suit that troiano suit is indeed a challenge to a benefit denial or reduction under a b aetna committed erisa violations and thus forfeited the deferential standard of review it would otherwise have received aetna assumed procedural violations prejudiced troiano and troiano filed a timely appeal within the plan deadline and thus did not forfeit judicial review.see stephanie blue cross blue shield of.hmo blue,cir.requiring showing of prejudice terry bayer,cir.requiring compliance with an erisa plan internal appeal procedures.aetna interpretation of the plan language withstands de novo scrutiny.
the plan language makes clear that troiano reading is unreasonable.the plan repeatedly states that ltd benefits will be offset by other income benefits that are payable to the beneficiary or her dependents if other income benefits are payable for a given month the monthly benefit payable under this plan for that month will be the lesser of the scheduled monthly ltd benefit and the maximum monthly benefit minus all other income benefits,but not less than the minimum monthly benefit.it then defines o ther income benefits to include those,due to your disability or retirement,which are payable to you your spouse your children your dependents.the spd,meanwhile,notes that a beneficiary ltd benefits will be reduced by other payments that she is eligible to receive from other income sources.
both the payable and the eligible to receive language illustrate that the amount that aetna may permissib
