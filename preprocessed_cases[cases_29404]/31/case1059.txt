talana orzechowski challenges aetna life insurance company aetna decision to terminate her disability benefits under a plan created by her employer,the boeing company boeing.under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,we may review a denial of benefits.where a plan grants discretion to an administrator to determine benefits,we ordinarily review for abuse of discretion.by statute,however,california has voided such provisions conferring discretionary authority to erisa plan administrators such as aetna.cal.ins.code a.the district court held that california statute did not apply to boeing plan and upheld aetna denial of benefits to orzechowski.we disagree and hold that a applies here.we reverse the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court to review aetna decision de novo.
background 
boeing erisa plan 
the lawsuit arises from aetna termination of orzechowski benefits under a health and welfare benefits plan that boeing offers to its employees the plan,which is governed by erisa.the principal plan document is the boeing company master welfare plan master plan.this document provides general information about the various benefit plans boeing offers,but does not detail the various benefits payable through the plan.the master plan has a broad grant of discretionary authority,which has been delegated to a service representative,aetna this grant includes the power to determine all questions that may arise including all questions relating to the eligibility of employees and dependents to participate in the plan and amount of benefits to which any participant or dependent may become entitled.
the master plan incorporates by reference various component benefit programs and the applicable governing documents describing the entitlement to benefits under those programs.one such benefit program is the boeing company disability plan pn at issue in this case.the summary plan description,a governing document,is a description of the plan which the plan administrator is required to provide under erisa.boeing summary plan description explains that insured employees are eligible for benefits when they become disabled.for the first months,disabled is defined as the employee inability to perform the material duties of the employee own occupation due to an injury or illness.emphasis added.after months,disability is redefined so that an employee is disabled if she is unable to work at any reasonable occupation for which she may be fitted by training,education,or experience.emphasis added.there are exclusions or limitations on the payment of benefits.relevant here,the benefits plan covers conditions for a maximum of months if the primary cause of the disability is mental illness.
aetna issued two documents,a policy and a certificate,which fund the disability benefits and are governing documents incorporated into the master plan through the aetna life insurance company group life and accident and health insurance policy policy issued to boeing,aetna agreed to fund and administer disability benefits to employees insured under the boeing plan.the policy includes a grant of discretionary authority to aetna to review all denied claims,determine whether and to what extent employees and beneficiaries are entitled to benefits,and construe any disputed or doubtful terms of the policy.the policy further specifies that aetna shall be deemed to have properly exercised such authority unless aetna abuses its discretion by acting arbitrarily and capriciously.
orzechowski becomes disabled 
talana orzechowski worked at boeing until february.in,she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.in january and february,orzechowski began suffering memory problems and increases in fatigue.orzechowski suffered from a number of serious symptoms of largely unknown cause,including fatigue,loss of motor control,spinal and joint pain,and loss of cognitive functioning.some of the symptoms appeared to be psychological in nature,including depression,obsessive compulsions,and suicidal thoughts.other symptoms were more typical of physical illness,such as profuse sweating,muscle and nerve pains,and lung weakness.she also suffered from a wide range of other physical ailments,including fatigue,headaches,tiredness,extended periods of sleeping,asthma,decreasing muscle tone,and nausea.
orzechowski saw numerous doctors to attempt to diagnose and address these issues.in february,orzechowski applied for disability benefits under boeing employee benefits plan,which aetna approved for the maximum duration of six months weeks,until july.aetna then completed a disability review,and approved disability benefits under the own occupation definition of disability effective july.this benefits period would run through july.
in,aetna informed orzechowski that the definition of disability would change from the own occupation to any reasonable occupation standard after her current benefit period ended.aetna requested documentation to support her disability claim under the new standard.
aetna received substantial medical records prepared by orzechowski physicians.it then sent orzechowski file to two physicians to review,a psychiatrist and a neurologist.neither examined her.the psychiatrist agreed with orzechowski physicians that she could perform no work,including even simple,routine and repetitive work duties reliably and safely.his conclusion was based on her psychiatric impairments,and the report noted that potential physical impairment was outside the scope of his expertise.the neurologist acknowledged her extensive diagnoses,including chronic fatigue,mood disorder,adrenal disorder and inflammatory polyarthropathy,and her symptoms of fatigue,depression,memory impairment loss of motor strength and deteriorating motor and cognitive skills,but he,however,concluded she had n o functional limitations on her ability to work and that she can likely perform own occupation light with n o limitations or restrictions.based on these reports,aetna denied orzechowski claim.
in a response to aetna reviewers,orzechowski own treating physician wrote a letter formally disagreeing 
it is concerning to me that a simple common sense review of the multiple historic findings detailed thoroughly in my monthly hour long evaluations of the patient would make it quite clear that this patient is not able to perform any level of work.she has not been able to care for herself without assistance and is unable to even administer her own medication 
and while no specific neurological cause had been discovered for her condition,he noted that if the patient has no neurological disorder,why has she remained so neurologically and functionally impaired it is clear in this case that the absence of evidence does not constitute evidence of absence.
aetna asked its outside reviewing neurologist to examine her file again.after a conference with her doctors,he again concluded that orzechowski symptoms must be psychiatric in origin because there is no definite evidence of a neurologic diagnosis.in july,aetna terminated payment of orzechowski disability benefits based on its determination that her disability is caused by a mental condition,more specifically depressive disorder and mood disorder,which falls under the plan mental health limitation.aetna determined she was physically capable of light work.
orzechowski attorney appealed aetna denial and provided additional documentation showing that orzechowski depression and anxiety symptoms are clearly secondary to her medical conditions.aetna referred orzechowski evidence to yet a third reviewer.he found that orzechowski had no functional impairment that would preclude her ability to perform any reasonable occupation.
orzechowski primary physician sent another letter in disagreement and pointed out the problems with attempting to diagnose orzechowski medical condition based only on a paper review and suggested aetna examine the patient in person 
b asing your assessment solely on the provided documentation is as silly as trying to assess the quality of a meal at a restaurant by reading the menu description without actually tasting the dish.
he also attacked aetna attempts to evaluate the severity of the chronic fatigue orzechowski experienced,through objective evidence,when,by definition,there is no objective evidence of chronic fatigue.
in june,aetna upheld its decision to terminate orzechowski disability benefits,stating that there was insufficient medical evidence to support orzechowski continued disability for the period of july,and beyond based upon any physical conditions.
orzechowski appeals to the district court 
orzechowski sought district court review under erisa,of aetna determination that she fell into the mental health exception and was not totally disabled,as required for a continuation of benefits under boeing long term disability plan.following a bench trial,the district court ruled in favor of boeing.
the district court applied an abuse of discretion standard of review to orzechowski claim,rather than a de novo standard.orzechowski argued that california insurance code voided the discretionary clause contained in the plan.the district court,however,held that does not apply retroactively,and found that the master plan was last issued or renewed january,a year before the statute became effective.therefore,it held that the statute did not render any provision of the master plan void and so abuse of discretion was the appropriate standard of review.applying that standard,the district court held that aetna decision to terminate orzechowski benefits was supported by substantial evidence in the record and was not an abuse of discretion.
this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court choice and application of the standard of review to decisions by erisa fiduciaries pannebecker liberty life assurance of,cir.
iii.discussion 
a denial of erisa benefits challenged under is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch.if an insurance contract has a valid discretionary clause,the decisions of the insurance company are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.see id.at stephan unum life ins.of,cir.
we previously observed that discretionary clauses have been the subject of much controversy.see standard ins.morrision,cir.explaining arguments for and against discretionary clauses.opponents believe such clauses lead to inappropriate claim practices,as insurers may use them as a shield to deny valid claims.id.supporters,meanwhile,argue they keep insurance costs manageable.id.resolving the merits of discretionary clauses is thankfully not before us individual states make that policy determination for themselves.in response to a particularly notorious example of an insurer who had used discretionary clauses to boost its profits by intentionally denying valid claims,a number of states acted via statute,regulation,or administrative action to ban or limit discretionary clauses.see saffon wells fargo.long term disability plan,cir.
california insurance code is one such example of state legislation limiting discretionary clauses.section provides in relevant part 
a if a policy,contract,certificate,or agreement offered,issued,delivered,or renewed,whether or not in california,that provides or funds life insurance or disability insurance coverage for any california resident contains a provision that reserves discretionary authority to the insurer,or an agent of the insurer,to determine eligibility for benefits or coverage,to interpret the terms of the policy,contract,certificate,or agreement,or to provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the laws of this state,that provision is void and unenforceable.
b for purposes of this section,renewed means continued in force on or after the policy anniversary date.
cal.ins.code a,b.the statute,which became effective on january,is thus,if any discretionary provision is covered by the statute,the courts shall treat that provision as void and unenforceable.id.g.
orzechowski argues that the district court erred when it refused to apply a to boeing plan and,accordingly,applied the wrong standard of review.boeing has two responses.first,it argues that erisa preempts the california statute.second,following the district court,boeing argues that even if a is not preempted,it does not apply retroactively to boeing plan.for the reasons explained below,we conclude that a is not preempted and applies to boeing plan the district court should have reviewed orzechowski claim de novo.
california insurance code is saved from erisa preemption 
erisa preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.nevertheless,erisa also has a saving clause that saves from preemption any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.id.b a.so,although erisa has broad preemptive force,its saving clause then reclaims a substantial amount of ground.rush prudential hmo,moran.
no one disputes that the california law comes within the broad terms of the preemption clause because it relate s to any employee benefit plan.a.in order to take advantage of the saving clause in b a,california statute must satisfy the test set forth in kentucky ass of health plans miller.first,the law must be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance,and second,it must substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.id.at.section meets both prongs of the miller test.
the statute is directed toward entities engaged in insurance 
a law is specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance if it is grounded in policy concerns specific to the insurance industry.unum life ins.of am.ward,noting that was key to its decision.boeing asks us to read insurance industry literally boeing,a leading aerospace company,is not engaged in the business of insurance and its master plan is not insurance.the argument is not without some logic,but we think the supreme court decision in miller and our decision in morrison foreclose it.
in miller,the court considered preemption of kentucky any willing provider awp laws,which prevent health insurers from discriminating against providers within their area who are willing to meet the terms and conditions of participation.miller,at.the insurance companies argued that the kentucky law swept too broadly because the awp laws equally prevent providers from entering into limited network contracts with insurers,just as they prevent insurers from creating exclusive networks in the first place.id.at.however,the court found that the saving clause nonetheless applied because r egulations directed toward certain entities will almost always disable other entities from doing,with the regulated entities,what the regulations forbid this does not suffice to place such regulation outside the scope of erisa saving clause.id.at.erisa saving clause saves laws that regulate insurance,not insurers.id.at.
in morrison,we gave effect to a montana statute that required the state auditor to disapprove insurance contracts with a discretionary clause.the insurance c
