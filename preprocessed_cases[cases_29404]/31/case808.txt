machine tool corporation administers an employee stock ownership plan esop for its employees that is governed by the employee retirement and income security act of erisa,et.plan participants john and james hess,brothers and former employees of,each brought suit in federal district court against and the esop,claiming that the plan administrator had wrongfully denied their requests to move their retirement funds from stock into diversified investments.see a b authorizing suits by participants in plans covered by erisa to enforce rights under terms of plan.john hess also sued to enforce his alleged right under the illinois business corporation act to inspect books and records.see ilcs requiring corporations to allow shareholders to examine corporate books and records for a proper purpose.on the parties cross motions for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,and the hesses appeal.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
john hess began working at in,and james hess followed suit two years later in.both resigned in,when they were either or years old we assume from the fact that the hesses have the same birth date that they are twins.at the time they resigned,the hesses had pension benefits in esop.esop are a type of pension plan intended to encourage employers to make their employees stockholders.steinman hicks,cir see also d summers state bank and trust,cir.as we explained in steinman,in the typical esop,the employer contributes the stock to the retirement plan on behalf of its employees.steinman,at.in case,however,before employees were also allowed to contribute on their own behalf by withholding money from their plan terms,salary reduction contributions.
in addition to stock,the esop allowed participants to channel salary reduction contributions into what the plan calls the other investments account,comprised of more diversified investments.before,also made contributions on behalf of plan participants to either the stock fund or the other investments account.the plan explains that plan participants had the right to direct the trustee to invest their contributions or contributions made by on their behalf in either i an employer stock fund or ii the other investments account.esop a.the plan further specifies that the trustee will invest assets in the stock fund primarily in stock and assets in the other investments account in diversified securities and property not including stock.esop b,c.
in,board of directors amended the esop to eliminate employees salary reduction contributions and the lion share of contributions to the esop.previously had matched the total amount of all salary reduction contributions via what the plan calls the employer elective contribution and had also contributed a discretionary matching amount for certain eligible employees.esop a,b.these contributions,together with participants salary reduction contributions,were eliminated as of december,the retroactive effective date of the amendments.esop amended a,b.thus,the only money going into the esop after december was in the form of a discretionary amount contributed by.esop c.
the board amended the plan in this way in preparation for an upcoming change in ownership at.specifically,in david lewellen,who had been the president of and principal shareholder since,sold his majority ownership interest to the esop.this sale coincided with lewellen retirement.thus,in january,timothy turner succeeded lewellen as president of,and lewellen former assistant,lorraine morris,became secretary of.
around this same time,john and james who had left in began inquiring about their options under the pension plan.they wrote identical letters to turner and plan trustee richard bennett,requesting a distribution of their esop money to roll over into an ira account of their choice.craig thomas,the attorney for the esop,replied to the hesses letters.he informed them that they would not be eligible for a distribution until they were years old and enclosed a copy of the plan for their reference.the hesses continued requesting a distribution over the next several months,but steadfastly maintained that they were not yet qualified.
in june,john again wrote bennett the esop trustee,this time requesting to diversify his stock from the stock fund to the other investments account.at some point james hess made a similar request.in support of their request,the hesses relied on amendment i,which had been added to the plan with the amendments eliminating employees salary reduction contributions.although bennett thought the amendment supported the hesses attempts to diversify their stock,turner and thomas the plan attorney disagreed.both maintained that the hesses must first satisfy the diversification requirements located elsewhere in the plan,which included attaining years of age.
the hesses thus requested a hearing on their claim to diversify their contributions to stock.although they had been represented by counsel while corresponding with,a different attorney represented them at the appeal hearing before administrative committee.the committee was comprised of plan administrator and company president turner,morris,and four other corporate officers of.on september,the committee held a hearing on the hesses claim,which was framed as follows whether john and james are entitled to diversify their,contributions into the plan which are currently invested in machine tool stock.although not relevant here,james hess also appealed his claim to a distribution on account of an alleged disability.with the exception of a medical report relating to the disability claim,the hesses presented no evidence at their hearing other than the plan document itself.
just over a month later,the administrative committee denied the hesses claims,reasoning that they were not entitled to diversify their stock because they were not yet years old.see esop g enumerating diversification requirements.although the hesses did not refer to it,the committee also considered section i,the amendment that the hesses previous counsel had relied on to support their diversification claim.the committee concluded,however,that the amendment was intended to allow those participants who had contributed salary reduction contributions into the other investments account to direct the investment of their contributions within that account.thus,reasoned the committee,section i did not advance the hesses claim to diversify their stock.
john and james then each filed suit against and the esop together under section a b of erisa,a b,which allows a participant in a plan governed by erisa to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.each alleged that a decrease in the value of stock between and had caused him to lose money.in particular,the complaints alleged that john saw the value of his shares decrease by more than,and james saw the value of his shares drop by more than parenthetically,we note that we find these allegations puzzling,since james owned approximately as many shares as john,yet is alleged to have lost nearly half as much money.john complaint also included a claim under the illinois business corporation act alleging that wrongfully denied him the opportunity to inspect its corporate books and records.see ilcs.the district court consolidated the hesses suits for decision,and both the hesses and moved for summary judgment.the district court granted motion,concluding that the committee denial of the hesses request to diversify was not arbitrary or capricious and that john claim failed because he was not a shareholder as that term is defined in the illinois business corporation act.

although acknowledging the grant of discretionary authority in esop,the hesses suggest our review should be more searching because the committee that approved the denial of their claims was biased.specifically,they claim that the officers and directors who administer the esop have an inherent conflict of interest because any decision to award benefits will adversely affect bottom line.although the supreme court in firestone recognized that a fiduciary conflict of interest should weigh as a factor in our analysis of the fiduciary decision,id.at,we have repeatedly rejected arguments for a heightened standard of review solely because a corporation or insurer interprets its own plan to deny benefits.see perlman swiss bank.comprehensive disability prot.plan,cir chojnacki,cir chalmers quaker oats,cir.in chalmers we pointed out that erisa endorses the notion of a corporate officer who doubles as a plan administrator,at,and would establish procedures for limiting or prohibiting the practice if it were a cause for concern,see also chojnacki,at accord.moreover,we have recognized that companies have an incentive not to deny meritorious claims because such behavior would negatively impact their reputation and leave employees unsatisfied with their fringe benefits.see mers,at chalmers,at.
the hesses,however,suggest that the bias against their claims is more significant here because lacked sufficient assets to grant their requests for diversification.because is not a publicly traded company,it must buy participants shares of stock from the esop in order to pay out claims from the stock fund.according to the hesses,both turner and morris admitted that would have been unable to buy back the shares to pay the hesses claims.the deposition testimony the hesses rely on,however,does not go that far.when asked if had in excess of cash available to buy the hesses stock,turner said that it did.he conceded however,that paying out that amount would change the whole forecasting going forward as far as what the esop could do with the other plan participants.and morris testified that she did not remember how much had available in liquid assets in when the hesses made their claims and that she was unsure how awarding their claims would affect company assets.
given these acknowledgments,the hesses claim of bias has more teeth to it than similar claims that we have rejected in the past.this is because in those cases in which we have rejected plaintiffs claims of bias,we have done so in part because a decision to award benefits in those cases would have had a minor impact on the companies financial.see perlman,at when the administrator is a large corporation,the firm has a financial interest,but the award in any one case will have only a trivial effect on its operating results.mers,at noting that defendant had consistently been named as one of the fifty largest companies in the fortune listing and that the impact of granting or denying benefits was minuscule compared to defendant bottom line chalmers,at the defendant is a corporation which generates revenues of nearly billion annually and is therefore not likely to flinch at paying out.
however,contrary to the hesses suggestion,the possibility that the committee was operating under a conflict of interest does not change the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.citing two cases from the eleventh circuit,the hesses maintain that the possibility of bias shifts the burden to the fiduciary to prove that played no part in his decision.see levinson reliance standard life ins,cir adams thiokol,cir.to the contrary,we have consistently held that the presence of a conflict of interest does not change the standard of review.hartford life accident ins,cir citing firestone,at.see also perlman,at chojnacki.moreover,unlike the eleventh circuit,we have concluded that the existence of a potential conflict is not enough.mers,at.instead,we require the plan participant to offer specific evidence of actual bias that there is a significant conflict.id.at.we question whether the hesses assertion that may not have had the funds available satisfies this standard.and our reluctance to disturb the presumption that the fiduciary is acting neutrally,is not helped by the hesses failure to provide us with any concrete figures to support their theory.
that said,turner admission that granting the hesses claims would impact operating results gives us pause.given the evidence that the committee decision to deny the hesses claims may have been animated by concerns for finances,we may perform a slightly more penetrating review.manny central states,southeast southwest areas pension health and welfare funds,cir quoting van boxel journal.employees pension trust,cir for proposition that arbitrary and capricious standard in erisa cases is a sliding scale that moves in relationship to the degree of suspicion of partiality.thus,we bear in mind the possibility that the committee had an interest in denying the hesses claim,but the pertinent question remains whether its decision was arbitrary and capricious.
ultimately we can not conclude that the committee decision to deny the hesses claim for diversification was arbitrary and capricious.the committee relied on the following plan provision,which controls diversification of assets in stock 
within the period of days following the end of each plan year,any participant in the plan who has attained age and completed at least ten years of participation in the plan shall be permitted to direct the trustee to diversify up to percent reduced by amounts previously diversified of his accrued benefit in the employer stock fund by investing such amount in investments other than employer stock.
by its terms,that section allows diversification only for those plan participants who are years or older,which the hesses admittedly were not at the time of the hearing.under this provision,there is thus nothing unreasonable about the committee decision to deny the hesses requests to diversify their stock.
the hesses,however,claim that amendment i authorizes diversification.to put their position in perspective,we quote the amendment in its entirety 
notwithstanding any provision of section to the contrary,that on or after december,there shall be no employer elective contribution or matching contributions on or behalf of participants.although participants shall continue to have the right to direct the investment of the participant account as to contributions made on or before november,participants shall have no rights pursuant to section to direct the investment of the participant account made on or after december.
esop amendment i.
this language leaves much to be desired in terms of clarity.it is,however,clear that plan participants continue to have some right.the nature of that continued right provides the primary bone of contention between the hesses and.
the hesses claim that the latter half of section i is intended to assure participants the continued right to direct their investments between stock and the other investments account.the problem with this interpretation is that,once invested in stock,the plan did not generally allow participants to move contributions that had been invested in stock to the other investments account.prior to the amendments,contributions made by participants or to either fund were controlled by section.that section provides that participants may decide whether contributions go into stock or the other account.esop a.their decision,however,may only be made prospectively.id.d,e.thus,the right to move contributions already in stock would be a new right,not a continued right.before the amendment participants were allowed to elect each year whether their future contributions in increments of would be made to either the stock fund or the other investments account.id.a,d,e.because there was no right before to direct funds previously invested in stock into the other investments account,we are unconvinced by the hesses interpretation of section i.
the committee interpretation,however,is also unsatisfying.in its decision the committee asserted that the amendment presumably i,although it is not explicitly cited was added for those plan participants who had contributed their salary reduction contributions to the other investments account.the committee interpreted the amendment as maintaining the rights of participants who had contributed to that account to direct the investment of amounts in these other investments.on this understanding,the committee characterized section i not as a change to the plan,but rather a clarification that participant sic maintained this right.according to,the right the committee is referring to is the right to move funds within the other investments account,which it says contains three diversified funds.this interpretation is problematic because section i by its terms is not limited to the other investments refers simply to the participant account,which presumably would include those assets in stock.and like the hesses,is unable to point to any plan provision explicitly granting participants the right to move their contributions within the other investments account before december,making it questionable whether such a right could be continued on the authority of section i.in short,section i is ambiguous,which leaves us to conclude that the committee interpretation,which is a reasonable way to resolve the ambiguity,was arbitrary or capricious.see gallo amoco,cir when as in this case the plan document does not furnish the answer to the question,the answer given by the plan administrator,when the plan vests him with discretion to interpret it,will ordinarily bind the court.that is implicit in the idea of deferential review of the plan administrator interpretation.
the hesses,however,suggest that the ambiguity should work in their favor.specifically,they argue that because the amendment is ambiguous,it must be constructed against the drafter and in favor of the plaintiffs.but the cases they cite to support this proposition the contra proferentem rule are cases applying general contract law or reviewing interpretations of erisa plans de novo,and are thus inapplicable here.when a plan gives the administrator discretion to interpret it,as does esop,we can not merely apply federal common law principles of contract interpretation,but rather must view the contractual ambiguity through a lens that gives broad discretion to the plan administrator to interpret the plan.dabertin hcr manor care,cir see also ross.state teacher ass ins.trust,cir same.the requirement that we give deference to the plan administrator interpretation is especially applicable when plan language is ambiguous,for that is precisely when the administrator exercises his grant of discretion.see manny,at ambiguous plan language created interpretive task confided to plan trustees.
we also reject the hesses argument that the ambiguity should prompt us to look beyond the plan itself to interpret the amendment.in the district court the hesses submitted an affidavit from lewellen in which he interprets section i to mean that after the amendments,participants could direct the trustee to move contributions from the stock fund to the other investments account.lewellen points out that since the amendments eliminated employee contributions and matching contributions,section i makes no sense unless participants continue to have the right to invest their previous contributions in either stock or the other investments account.the hesses claim that lewellen was the plan administrator at the time of the amendment indeed,they assert that lewellen wrote the amendment.who better,the argument goes,to explain the meaning of the amendment 
there are two problems with their argument.first,they did not present lewellen interpretation at the hearing before the current plan administrator,and we have consistently held that our review is limited to the record before the administrative committee.see vallone cna fin,cir perlman,at deferential review of an administrative decision means review on the administrative record.indeed,the hesses did not advance any argument based on section i to the committee.the committee addressed section only because the hesses had raised the amendment in their previous correspondences requesting diversification.
secondly,we have explicitly rejected the premise that a former plan administrator retains authority to construe plan language,even language he may have drafted.in white sundstrand,cir,a group of plaintiffs seeking benefits under sundstrand pension plan argued that the interpretation of one of the plan drafters should prevail over the plan administrator interpretation.in rejecting their argument,we pointed out that the plan gave discretion to interpret its language to the plan administrator,not the drafter.id.similarly,section of esop gives the plan administrator discretion to interpret it,not lewellen.as we analogized in white,a secretary of labor who drafts and promulgates a rule will have leeway to interpret its language only as long as she remains in office when a new secretary is confirmed,interpretive discretion comes with the job.the may write pieces trying to influence the rule application,but the elbow room that goes with delegated authority belongs to the incumbent,not to the author.id.at.just so with lewellen.although he may have had authority to interpret section i when he administered the esop,that authority passed to turner when lewellen retired.that the new administrator interprets section i differently than lewellen does not render his decision arbitrary and capricious.id.pointing out that new plan administrators may change interpretation of plan because the discretion to interpret plan goes with the office.thus,the fact that lewellen may interpret the amendment in a way that supports the hesses claim does not render the committee contrary interpretation arbitrary and capricious.
the hesses advance several other attacks on the committee decision,but none render it unreasonable.first,they make much of a payout to another former employee,william ray.while lewellen was still president of,he authorized a distribution of ray benefits to him after he was terminated in.at that time,ray who was years old had stock valued at,which was subsequently paid out to him in two installments.the hesses maintain that the inconsistent treatment of ray renders the committee interpretation of their claim arbitrary and capricious.
although we have recognized evidence of inconsistent interpretations as a factor to be considered in determining whether a plan administrator decision is arbitrary and capricious,chojnacki,at,the payout to ray does not render the committee denial of the hesses claim suspect.first of all,ray received a payout,an entirely different benefit than the diversification john and james seek.additionally,the plan treats participants like ray who have less than in the plan differently.section provides that if the vested portion of a terminated employee account is less than
