rhonda rose rose appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of cgi technologies and solutions,cgi in its action seeking appropriate equitable relief under a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.cgi appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of rose counsel and,nelson langer engle,pllc nle,dismissing nle from the action.cgi also appeals the district court grant of proportional fees and costs to nle,deducted from cgi recovery from rose.we affirm in part and reverse in part,remanding the matter to the district court for further proceedings consistent with our decision.
rose was employed by cgi which provides to its employees and their dependents a welfare benefits plan the plan governed by erisa.the plan includes a subrogation and reimbursement clause that expressly gives to cgi the right to full reimbursement for medical expenses paid on behalf of the beneficiary from any funds recovered by the beneficiary from a third party tortfeasor,exempts cgi from responsibility for attorneys fees paid in any such recovery,expressly disclaiming the application of the common fund doctrine and requires full reimbursement to cgi regardless of whether the beneficiary is made whole by the recovery.
in,rose was seriously injured in a car accident with a drunk driver,and consequently she had nerve damage and neck and back injuries that required surgical intervention.from this accident rose also suffered several types of damages including past and future medical expenses,past and future loss of wages,and pain and suffering.the parties stipulated that her personal injury claim was at least.with the assistance of nle,rose recovered a combined total of from her action against the third party tortfeasor and from her underinsured motorist claim with her automobile insurance provider.the parties stipulated that this recovery represents only of rose total damages.
between and,the plan,on behalf of rose,paid about in medical expenses incurred as a result of rose injuries related to the accident.after rose recovery of these damages partially compensating her for her injuries,cgi asserted a first priority of payment and demanded to be reimbursed for the full amount the plan had paid in medical expenses on rose behalf.rose,through her counsel,declined to reimburse the plan,and nle placed the disputed amount in trust.cgi filed suit in the district court against both rose and nle seeking appropriate equitable relief,under a in the form of a constructive trust an equitable lien.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of nle,concluding that the plan reimbursement provision could not be enforced against nle.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of cgi,concluding that under a,cgi,per the express terms of the plan,was entitled to recover the full amount it paid in medical expenses on rose behalf.finally,despite the plan language to the contrary,the district court also ruled that cgi was responsible for a proportional amount of the costs and fees incurred by nle in recovering damages on rose behalf,and that this amount would be deducted from cgi recovery from rose.the parties now.
we consider the parties in turn 
we first address cgi appeal of the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of nle.the district court dismissed nle from the action,concluding that nle was not a proper defendant under a.section a states 
a civil action may be brought by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
a emphasis added.the district court concluded that equitable relief under a could not be enforced against nle because nle,as rose counsel,was not a signatory to the plan with its reimbursement provision.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied principally on hotel employees restaurant employees international union welfare fund gentner,cir.in gentner,we affirmed the district court dismissal of the beneficiary attorney from the plan action for reimbursement under a,deciding that because the attorney was not a signatory to the plan,he was not a proper defendant.id.at.gentner in its holding established a general rule that a plan fiduciary may not assert a claim under a against a beneficiary attorney who is not a signatory of the plan.
here,although we agree with the district court conclusion that cgi may not enforce the plan reimbursement provision against nle,we clarify that gentner holding is no longer valid after the supreme court ruling in harris trust and savings bank salomon smith barney,d.see miller gammie,cir en banc holding that an intervening decision by a court of last resort controls where the relevant court of last resort has undercut the theory or reasoning underlying the prior circuit precedent in such a way that the cases are clearly irreconcilable.in harris trust,the court considered whether a authorized an action against a nonfiduciary party in interest who,acting in concert with a plan fiduciary,violated erisa.noting that t he common law of trusts offers a starting point for analysis of erisa unless it is inconsistent with the language of the statute,its structure,or its purposes,the court stated that under the common law of trusts 
i t has long been settled that when a trustee in breach of his fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries transfers trust property to a third person,the third person takes the property subject to the trust,unless he has purchased the property for value and without notice of the fiduciary breach of duty.the trustee or beneficiaries may then maintain an action for restitution of the property if not already disposed of or disgorgement of proceeds if already disposed of,and disgorgement of the third person profits derived therefrom.
at.accordingly,the court rejected the argument that liability under a depended on whether erisa substantive provisions impose a specific duty on the party being sued,id.at,and concluded that a third party transferee of trust assets could be held liable under erisa provided that it is shown that the transferee had actual or constructive knowledge of the circumstances that rendered the transaction unlawful.id.at.thus,an action for restitution against a transferee of tainted plan assets satisfies the appropriate ness criterion in a.id.at.
harris trust left open the universe of possible defendants in an action for appropriate equitable relief under a,which,contrary to our holding in gentner,could include an attorney who was not a signatory to the plan.id.at.see also cyr reliance standard life ins,cir en banc in short,the court in harris trust did not find a limit in a as to who could be sued.
under the principles of liability expressed in harris trust,we conclude that there is no unlawful transaction that would support cgi action against nle under a.in harris trust,the third party defendant,salomon smith barney,induced the plan fiduciary to enter into a transaction prohibited under another provision of erisa.id.at.the court concluded that salomon smith barney unlawful transaction supported the petitioners a claim seeking rescission,restitution,and disgorgement.here,by contrast,nle engaged in no similar unlawful transaction.nle merely honored rose request that it hold the entire disputed amount in trust subject to the resolution of cgi claim for reimbursement.
the fifth circuit has interpreted harris trust to recognize a cause of action under a against an attorney who,on behalf of his client,holds disputed funds in trust pending adjudication of the rightful owner.in bombardier aerospace employee welfare benefits plan ferrer,poirot and wansbrough,cir,the fifth circuit concluded that harris trust supports a cause of action against a non party in interest when he holds disputed settlement funds on behalf of a client who is a traditional erisa party.id.at.relying on the supreme court decision in great west life annuity ins.knudson,d,the fifth circuit reasoned that the action against the attorney was appropriate under a because it was an in rem action to establish a constructive trust,the beneficiary had constructive possession of the disputed funds,and the attorney held the funds in trust subject to the beneficiary direction to release the funds.at.
we disagree with the fifth circuit on the merits because as harris trust counsels,we find no unlawful transaction on the part of nle to support nle as a defendant.as did the attorneys in bombardier,nle has placed the entire disputed amount in trust pending the outcome of cgi litigation.it has not asserted a right to the specific funds,nor appropriated the funds in any unlawful way nle has agreed that pending the final adjudication of cgi claim,it stands ready to disburse the fund in accordance with the court order.we conclude that this holding of disputed funds in trust is reasonable conduct by the law firm.to conclude otherwise would introduce into erisa a duty on the part of a beneficiary counsel that unreasonably interferes with traditional and lawful interactions.moreover,there is no need to maintain a suit against an attorney who merely acts as a beneficiary agent because naming the beneficiary who has constructive possession over the disputed funds will ensure proper disbursal where the presiding court so orders.because nle did not engage in an unlawful transaction by placing the entire disputed amount in trust while the issue of cgi rightful recovery remained unresolved,we conclude that cgi can not maintain an action against nle under a.
we next consider together rose appeal from the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of cgi and cgi appeal from the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of rose,with respect to cgi responsibility for its proportional share of nle attorneys fees.the plan called for full reimbursement to cgi regardless of whether rose was made whole and disclaimed the application of the common fund doctrine to require cgi to contribute to attorneys fees incurred in recovering funds from a third party tortfeasor.the district court concluded that under a,cgi was entitled to full reimbursement of its outlay of the funds for medical expenses based on the plan express terms,but that notwithstanding the express terms of the plan,cgi was responsible for its proportional share of the attorneys fees that permitted rose recovery on her tort claim.rose argues that full reimbursement was not appropriate equitable relief,as mandated by a,because it amounted to simple contract interpretation,a classic form of legal relief.she contends that appropriate equitable relief must encompass traditional equitable principles,including consideration of applicable traditional equitable defenses such as the doctrine which rose argues should reasonably limit cgi relief to less than full reimbursement cgi argues that the district court was required to honor the express terms of the plan which mandated full reimbursement to cgi and disclaimed the application of traditional equitable defenses.
the parties do not dispute that cgi claim is equitable in nature,as is required for relief under a.see sereboff mid atlantic med,d.much like the respondent plan claim in sereboff,cgi claim is equitable because it is an action to enforce an equitable lien established by agreement.id.at.nor do the parties dispute that cgi is entitled to some form of appropriate equitable relief.the question we must decide,however,is whether in granting appropriate equitable relief,the district court,in its balancing of the equities,should take into account traditional equitable defenses that may limit cgi recovery to less than full reimbursement despite plan terms,or instead give primacy to basic contract interpretation to entitle cgi to full reimbursement and to exempt cgi from responsibility for attorneys fees.
this question of erisa interpretation has not been decided previously by our circuit.section a of erisa describes who may enforce erisa plans by bringing civil actions.a.section a b gives a legal cause of action to plan participants and beneficiaries but excludes plan fiduciaries from similarly enforcing the terms of the plan.a plan fiduciary only means to seek relief is found in a which expressly limits a fiduciary cause of action to one based on equitable principles that govern injunction and other equitable relief.see a b,a knudson,at.noting that erisa only authorizes fiduciaries to seek equitable relief under a.
the supreme court has held that equitable principles must be satisfied for an erisa fiduciary to gain relief under a,but in considering such suits the court has not yet squarely addressed whether the statutory term appropriate equitable relief requires consideration of traditional equitable defenses.stated another way,we do not read the supreme court precedents to have clarified if in giving appropriate equitable relief a court must take into account all or some traditional equitable defenses and considerations.see cigna amara,d affirming that a invokes the equitable powers of the district court,including the power to reform plan terms sereboff mid atlantic medical services,d holding that a contractual right to reimbursement from funds recovered from a third party supported a plan action under a because the clause established an equitable lien by agreement knudson,at.holding that actions under a must be equitable in nature and a did not support a plan action seeking legal restitution namely,a judgment imposing a merely personal liability upon the defendant to pay a sum of money varity howe,d describing a as a catchall provision that offer s appropriate equitable relief for injuries caused by violations that does not elsewhere adequately remedy,and noting that w e should expect that courts,in fashioning appropriate equitable relief,will keep in mind the special nature and purpose of employee benefit plans,and will respect the policy choices reflected in the inclusion of mertens hewitt associates,d holding that e quitable relief in a must mean something less than all relief,and refers only to those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.
the supreme court decisions regarding a highlight the traditional division between law and equity that evokes a authorization of appropriate equitable relief such relief must be based on relief traditionally available at equity.see knudson,at.it is easy to disparage the dichotomy as an ancient classification and an obsolete distinctio n.like it or not,however,that classification and distinction has been specified by the statute and there is no way to give the specification meaning indeed,there is no way to render the unmistakable limitation of the statute a limitation at all except by adverting to the differences between law and equity to which the statute refers.internal citations omitted.
the statutory term appropriate equitable relief thus places an unmistakable limitation on the availability of equitable relief,and the scope of this limitation is set by referring to the differences between law and equity.a court must assess the degree to which the traditional equitable defenses that rose raises here,namely the doctrine and the common fund doctrine,are applicable in delimiting those categories of relief that were typically available in equity and that therefore hem in what is appropriate equitable relief within the meaning of a.
our law previously has set some guidelines about equitable relief in other contexts,but it is not a certainty that each principle thus established should be considered to be incorporated within the limitation of a that equitable relief be appropriate.for example,it is a general equitable principle of insurance law that,absent an agreement to the contrary,an insurance company may not enforce a right to subrogation until the insured has been fully compensated for her injuries,that is,has been made whole.barnes indep.auto.dealers ass of cal.health welfare benefit plan,cir.under the common fund doctrine,a litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney fee from the fund as a whole.boeing van gemert,d.the doctrine reflects the traditional practice in courts of equity,and it stands as a exception to the general principle that requires every litigant to bear his own attorney fees.id.both the doctrine and the common fund doctrine are rooted in concerns about unjust enrichment,a traditional principle of equitable relief.see id.common fund rule chandler state farm mut.auto.ins,cir rule.traditionally at equity,it was within the province of the court to consider concerns of unjust enrichment when fashioning equitable remedies such as an equitable lien or a constructive trust,even where contract terms attempted to limit their application.see,palmer,the law of restitution,at in equity the principal remedy to unjust enrichment is constructive trust but equitable lien,subrogation,and accounting are techniques frequently used to prevent unjust enrichment palmer,the law of restitution d at stating that the principle of unjust enrichment should serve to limit the effectiveness of contract provisions which in terms provide for reimbursement out of the insured tort recovery without regard to whether or the extent to which,that recovery includes medical expense.
relying on our decision in barnes indep.auto.dealers ass of cal.health welfare benefit plan,cgi argues that the district court must remain faithful to the terms of the plan that disclaim the application of traditional equitable defenses.cir.in barnes,we stated that w e would not apply the interpretive rule as a if the subrogation clause in the plan document specifically allowed the plan the right of first reimbursement out of any recovery barnes was able to obtain even if barnes were not made whole.id.at.our discussion in barnes is not dispositive of the question we decide today,however,because the relief sought in barnes was purely legal in nature,namely a beneficiary challenge of the plan denial of benefits,and so appropriately subject to our observation that the parties could contract out of the application of the doctrine.here,however,we consider the scope of appropriate equitable relief under a,and whether the district court is bound by restrictive contract terms in its formulation of equitable relief.neither congress nor the supreme court has said that any such contractual limitation necessarily curtails the district court equitable powers under a.to the contrary,the court in amara reasoned that the district court,sitting as a court of equity in a a action,need not honor the express terms of the plan where traditional notions of equitable relief so require.see amara.at stating that contract reformation is within the equitable powers of the district court see also airways mccutchen,cir the importance of the written benefit plan is not inviolable,but is subject based upon equitable doctrines and principles to modification and,indeed,equitable reformation under a.citing amara.at.
the circuits have split on whether strict adherence to the terms of an erisa plan that disclaims the application of traditional equitable defenses constitutes appropriate equitable relief.several circuits,and notably the eleventh,eighth,seventh and fifth circuits,have stressed the primacy of an erisa plan express language,and have decided that in balancing the equities,simple contract interpretation that provides for full reimbursement per the plain terms of a plan that disclaims the application of traditional equitable defenses such as the doctrine and the common fund doctrine,constitutes appropriate equitable relief under a.see,zurich am.ins,cir stating that the application of federal common law to override the plan controlling language,which expressly provides for reimbursement regardless of whether the beneficiary was made whole by his recovery,would frustrate,rather than effectuate,erisa repeatedly emphasized purpose to protect contractually defined benefits.admin.comm.of wal mart stores.associates health welfare plan shank,cir stating that n othing in the statute suggests congress intended that section a limitation of the plan recovery to appropriate equitable relief would upset these expectations such as a rule disclaimer.indeed,erisa mandate that e very employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,a,establishes the primacy of the written plan administrative committee of wal mart stores.assocs.health welfare plan varco,cir stating that in an action under a,it is inappropriate to fashion a common law rule that would override the express terms of a private plan unless the overridden plan provision conflicts with statutory provisions or other policies underlying erisa those cases which have applied the federal common fund doctrine in the favor of individual erisa participants have done so,correctly,only in the absence of controlling plan language bombardier aerospace employee welfare benefits plan ferrer,poirot and wansbrough,cir stating that the plan terms not only give it the right to recover benefits to the extent of any and all settlement payments,but explicitly state that the participant must bear the fees and costs associated with his tort action neither the federal nor texas common fund doctrine may be invoked to prevent or reduce the plan recovery of the funds that it advanced to the beneficiary up to the full amount of his recovery from the tortfeasor see also wal mart stores.assocs.health and welfare plan wells,cir suggesting that in an action under a,the parties to an erisa plan could,by contract,alter the background of understandings and legal principles such as the common fund doctrine that operate as default rules to govern in the absence of a clear expression of the parties intent that they not govern.
by contrast,only the third circuit,in us airways mccutchen,has concluded that congress intended to limit the equitable relief available under a through the application of equitable defenses and principles that were typically available in equity despite the negation of such defenses and principles in an erisa plan.at.mccutchen,who participated in an employee welfare benefits plan,was injured in a car accident and the plan paid in medical expenses on his behalf.id.at.mccutchen recovered from third parties,and the plan,based on a subrogation clause in the plan requiring full reimbursement,sought to recover the full from mccutchen even though mccutchen net recovery was less than that amount after paying a contingency fee to his attorney.id.at.
like rose here,mccutchen argued that notwithstanding the plan terms,it was unfair to grant the plan full reimbursement because he was not fully compensated for his injuries and the plan did not contribute to attorneys fees and costs.id.at.the third circuit agreed,finding no indication in erisa or in the supreme court jurisprudence that congress intended to limit relief under a to traditional equitable categories yet not limit relief by other equitable doctrines and defenses that were traditionally applicable to those categories.id.at.
we agree with the third circuit that under a,the district court,in granting appropriate equitable relief,may consider traditional equitable defenses notwithstanding express terms disclaiming their application.id.at stating that in equity,contractual language was not as sacrosanct as it is normally considered to be when applying breach of contract principles at common law,and equitable principles can apply even where no one has committed a wrong.while a weighing of the equities,including the consideration of equitable defenses,might support that full reimbursement per the plan terms is appropriate equitable relief,like the third circuit we disagree with the other circuits to the extent that they have held that a categorically excludes the application of traditional equitable defenses where the plan disclaims their application and requires reimbursement as set by the plan.id.at.congress in a empowered district courts to consider equitable principles in granting injunctive relief to a plan fiduciary against a plan benefic
