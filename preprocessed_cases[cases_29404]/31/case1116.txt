steve harris and dennis ramos collectively,plaintiffs sued amgen,amgen and several amgen directors and officers,alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the employee retirement income security act erisa in their operation of two erisa retirement plans.the district court dismissed harris claims on the ground that he lacked standing as an erisa plan participant because he had withdrawn all of his assets from his plan.it also dismissed ramos claims,reasoning that although ramos had standing,he did not allege any claims against defendants who were fiduciaries under the plan.the district court then denied plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.
we reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs complaint.we hold that harris has standing as an erisa plan participant to seek relief under erisa a,codified at a,despite having withdrawn all of his assets from his plan.we also conclude that the district court improperly denied plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to add more factual allegations where necessary and to identify proper fiduciaries of the plaintiffs erisa plans.
amgen is a publicly traded biotechnology company that operates amgen manufacturing,amgen manufacturing as a wholly owned subsidiary.employees of amgen are entitled to participate in the amgen retirement and savings plan the amgen plan,and amgen manufacturing employees may participate in the retirement and savings plan for amgen manufacturing,the manufacturing plan.each plan is a defined contribution plan,defined as a pension plan which provides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount contributed to the participant account.
amgen is a named fiduciary only of the amgen plan and amgen manufacturing is a named fiduciary only of the manufacturing plan.the amgen plan allows the amgen board of directors the board to delegate management and administration of the plan to a fiduciary committee.during the time relevant to this appeal,fiduciary responsibilities for both plans were delegated to the fiduciary committee.
steve harris worked at amgen until january and participated in the amgen plan.his amgen plan holdings sometimes included amgen stock.harris withdrew his assets from his amgen plan account in july.dennis ramos worked at amgen manufacturing until march,participating in the manufacturing plan.his manufacturing plan holdings also sometimes included amgen stock.ramos still has assets in the manufacturing plan.
in august harris and ramos filed a class action complaint the complaint,alleging that during a class period the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the plans to purchase and hold amgen stock while knowing that the stock price was artificially inflated because of improper drug marketing and sales.the complaint asserts that the amgen stock price declined significantly once the activity became public,and harris and ramos claim that the defendants are liable for the resulting losses suffered by the class members.the complaint sought relief under erisa a section a,codified at a,which authorizes a suit by a plan participant for appropriate relief against a plan fiduciary for breach of fiduciary duty.
the complaint names as defendants amgen,amgen chief financial officer,and nine amgen board members collectively,defendants.neither amgen manufacturing nor the fiduciary committee is named as a defendant.however,the complaint does assert claims against a retirement benefits committee of the board of directors of amgen,which it claims has fiduciary responsibilities over both plans.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure rule b,and for failure to state a claim under rule b.the district court granted the motion and dismissed with prejudice all of harris claims,concluding that harris did not have statutory standing as a participant in the amgen plan because he had already cashed out of his plan account.the district court determined that ramos had standing because he still had assets in the manufacturing plan,but it dismissed with prejudice all of ramos claims on the ground that neither amgen,the alleged retirement committee,nor the named defendants were fiduciaries of the manufacturing plan.
the district court also denied plaintiffs request for leave to amend their complaint.the district court reasoned that harris could not cure his lack of standing through amendment and that ramos did not have a viable claim against the named defendants.the district court expressly made no determination as to whether plaintiffs have a viable claim against amgen manufacturing or the members of the fiduciary committee.harris and ramos appeal the dismissal of their claims and the denial of leave to amend.
we first consider whether the district court properly determined that harris lacked standing under section a because he had withdrawn his assets from the amgen plan.we review questions of standing under erisa de novo.stewart thorpe holding.profit sharing plan,cir 
to establish standing to sue under erisa,plaintiffs must show that they are plan participants.poore simpson paper,cir.plaintiffs seek relief under section a,which grants standing to a plan participant to bring an action against a defendant who breaches a fiduciary duty with respect to that plan.see a.an erisa plan participant is any employee or former employee of an employer who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer.this definition encompasses former employees who have a colorable claim to vested benefits.firestone tire rubber bruch,d internal quotation omitted.in contrast,former employees do not have standing if a successful suit would result in a damage award that was not for benefits due under the plan.vaughn bay envtl,cir citing kuntz reese,cir per curiam.
the district court relied on kuntz in concluding that harris was not a participant in the amgen plan.in kuntz,we held that a plaintiff who alleges that a former employer misrepresented the benefits due under a defined benefit erisa plan does not have standing if that plaintiff already received all benefits that were due before filing suit and seeks only a damage award.kuntz,at.the district court reasoned that because harris had cashed out of the amgen plan,any recovery he receives would be a damage recovery,and he would not have prevailed in a suit for benefits,firestone,at,because a damage claim is not a plan benefit.kuntz,at.
when it dismissed harris claims,the district court did not have the benefit of the reasoning and holding in our subsequent decision in vaughn,in which we distinguished kuntz and held that former employees who have received a full distribution of their account balances under a defined contribution pension plan have standing as plan participants under erisa to recover losses occasioned by a breach of fiduciary duty that allegedly reduced the amount of their benefits.vaughn,at.in vaughn the plaintiff sued fiduciaries of his employer defined contribution erisa plans,alleging that the fiduciaries breached their fiduciary duties with respect to the plans when they did not take certain actions despite knowing the plans would be terminated.the plaintiff claimed that he has not received all of the benefits due to him under the plans because his accounts contained less than they would have if the fiduciaries had not breached their duty of prudent investment.id.at.
the district court in vaughn had granted the defendants motion to dismiss based on kuntz,but on the appeal we distinguished kuntz because there the plaintiffs had conceded that they had received all of the benefits due to them under the plan and alleged only that they would not have participated in the plan the defendant misrepresentations about the amount of benefits they would receive.id.we held in vaughn that b ecause the plaintiff alleges that he did not receive everything that was due to him under the plan,he has standing,even under kuntz.id.we also noted that every other circuit to have considered this issue has held that a defined contribution plan plain
