brad kirschbaum kirschbaum,an employee of reliant energy,rei and a participant in the reliant energy savings plan plan,brought this erisa class action against rei and the rei benefits committee collectively,rei defendants representing current and former plan participants on whose behalf the plan purchased or held shares of the reliant energy common stock fund from august,to may.the district court certified the class but granted the rei defendants motion for summary judgment on all claims.we affirm.even if the rei defendants had a fiduciary duty to liquidate the common stock fund and cease purchasing rei shares,notwithstanding the plan express contrary requirements,kirschbaum falls short of bearing his heavy burden to rebut the presumption that the defendants satisfied their legal duties.
background 
the relevant version of the plan was adopted on april.pursuant to a trust agreement adopted simultaneously and incorporated into the plan,all plan assets were held in trust by the northern trust company trustee the trustee,rei,and the benefits committee were all named in the plan as fiduciaries for specific purposes.the plan is an eligible individual account plan eiap under erisa.d.consequently,participants could invest in a number of funds,ranging from riskier,funds to more stable mutual funds.one investment option under the plan was the rei common stock fund common stock fund.with the exception of a small cash component for liquidity purposes,the common stock fund was invested entirely in rei common stock.
participants were permitted to invest up to sixteen percent of their compensation in the plan.rei agreed to match up to the first six percent of an employee contribution with shares of rei common stock allocated to the employee common stock fund account.matching contributions were to remain in the common stock fund for all employees who had not yet attained the age of years with ten years of service with the company.after reaching that benchmark,employees could divest a portion of their holdings in the common stock fund the participants holdings of rei stock and the common stock fund assets thus arose from two sources employees voluntary purchases of the common stock fund as a plan option,and rei matching contributions in the form of rei common stock.
the value of the common stock fund fell when the price per share of rei common stock dropped about forty percent,from on may,to a week later.the drop was occasioned by the disclosure that some rei employees had engaged in energy trades between and.in these sham transactions,rei and another energy trader would sell identical quantities of power or natural gas to each other simultaneously,for the same price.although no gas,power or money ever changed hands,the trades were booked as transactions to inflate rei trading volume.the disclosure occurred in stages.on may,rei withdrew a planned million debt offering in light of the possibility that trading had occurred.on may,rei publicly confirmed that such trades had inflated revenues by about ten percent over a three year period.on may,senior executives implicated in the trading resigned.
in his fourth amended complaint,kirschbaum alleges that the rei defendants are responsible under erisa to make good the losses the plan sustained on rei common stock.counts i and ii both allege the rei defendants should have known,based on information available to them,that rei stock was not a prudent investment.count i focuses on information available to the public,while count ii focuses on information the trades.both counts assert that because rei common stock became an imprudent investment,the rei defendants had a fiduciary duty to a halt all plan purchases of rei common stock,b sell the plan holdings in rei common stock,and c terminate the common stock fund.count iii alleges that the rei defendants breached their fiduciary duties by negligently misrepresenting rei financial condition to plan participants in documents that incorporated the company sec filings.
after certifying the class,the district court granted summary judgment to the rei defendants on all three counts.on counts i and ii,the court reasoned that the rei defendants could be fiduciaries only to the extent they exercised discretionary control over the plan.since the plan afforded them no discretion to terminate the fund or halt investments in it,the district court concluded the rei defendants had no fiduciary duty to do so.as to count iii,the district court held that the alleged misrepresentations were made by rei in its corporate capacity,not its fiduciary capacity,and were not actionable under erisa.kirschbaum has appealed.
discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standards applied by the district court.condrey suntrust bank of georgia,cir.summary judgment is proper when the movant can demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.willis coca cola enterprises,cir.on review of a grant of summary judgment,all facts and inferences must be construed in the light most favorable to the.murray earle,cir.
a brief sketch of the erisa principles underlying the operation of the rei savings plan is in order.erisa provides that an employer who sponsors an employee plan may also serve as a fiduciary of that plan.the statute imposes on the and on those who manage the plan strict statutory duties,including loyalty,prudence,and diversification.see a.under the common law of trusts,an employer could not invest plan assets in its own stock without creating an impermissible conflict of interest.see pegram herdrich,d.but congress,for policy reasons,has encouraged plan ownership of employer stock and has exempted such investments from certain of erisa fiduciary requirements.see,donovan cunningham,cir.in particular,for an eiap like that before us,there is no cap on the percentage of permissible investments in the employer own securities.compare b with a a.further,an eiap fiduciary decision to purchase or hold the employer securities is exempt from the duty to diversify and the related duty of prudence insofar as it concerns asset diversification.a.the fiduciary remains bound,however,by its other statutory fiduciary duties.see,martin feilen,cir.with these general principles in mind,we turn to the discussion of each count.
count available information 
as it happens,the general statutory principles are sufficient to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on count kirschbaum here avers that the rei defendants should have concluded,based on publicly available information,that rei common stock was an imprudent investment.count i alleges that the transformation of rei from a traditional power utility company into a speculative energy trading operation changed rei common stock from a classic long term conservative investment to a risky and volatile one.the company change in business strategy,kirschbaum contends,made it imprudent for the rei defendants to continue investing such massive amounts or such a large percentage of the plan assets in rei common stock.
by its terms,count i asserts that the plan became too heavily weighted in rei stock when the company dove into energy trading.count i faults the rei defendants for failing to maintain an appropriate portfolio mix,and for not evaluating the risk and reward of the common stock fund in the context of all the plan investments.kirschbaum does not claim in count i that rei common stock was an imprudent investment per se,but rather that it was too risky for the plan to hold in large quantities.despite kirschbaum efforts on appeal to recast this as a claim of imprudence,count i clearly states a failure to diversify.see fourth amended complaint,faulting defendants for,inter alia,failing to diversify the assets of the plan see also a c imposing a duty of the diversification so as to minimize the risk of large losses.
the rei defendants correctly observe that erisa exempts an eiap from the duty to diversify with regard to the purchase or holding of company stock.a.the construction of this statutory exemption begins with the language of the statute.hughes aircraft company jacobson,d.and where the statutory language provides a clear answer,it ends there as well.id.the statute states that the diversification requirement and the prudence requirement only to the extent that it requires diversification are not violated by acquisition or holding of qualifying employer real property or qualifying employer securities in an eiap.a.despite the risks inherent in concentrating plan assets in any one security,the express statutory exemption of the diversification duty in relation to an employer stock holdings precludes the recovery kirschbaum seeks under count 
count information 
unlike count i,count ii states a claim for more than failure to diversify.count ii alleges it was imprudent for the plan to hold even one share of rei stock during the period when trading had artificially inflated its price.the diversification exemption stated in a does not exempt eiap fiduciaries from liability for other forms of imprudence.see,in re mckesson hboc.erisa,d.count ii asserts that in light of this inflation,the rei defendants had a fiduciary duty to halt further purchases of rei common stock,sell the plan holdings in the common stock fund,and terminate the fund.three significant issues are presented by these allegations.first,do the terms of the rei plan mandate that company common stock be an available investment option for participants,and that it must be the exclusive vehicle for company matching contributions second,what,if any,fiduciary duties pertain to rei or the benefits committee with respect to investments in the rei common stock fund third,if such duties exist,by what standard should a court review the alleged breaches of duties 
plan requirements concerning rei stock 
the plan documents,considered as a whole,compel that the common stock fund be available as an investment option for require that rei common stock be the basis for the company matching contributions and authorize investment of contributions and dividends to the fund solely in rei common stock.these mandatory provisions are embedded in the plan and could not be terminated or modified absent a plan amendment.section of the plan presumes the existence of the common stock fund and requires the investment of all rei matching contributions into the fund likewise,attachment a,fully incorporated into the plan by section,reflects that the benefits committee had no authority to delete the common stock fund as an investment option.further,the trust agreement,incorporated into the plan by section,states that the plan investment funds shall consist of the reliant energy common stock fund and other such investment funds selected and approved by the committee from time to time.trust agreement,section emphasis added.altering any of these provisions would have required rei,acting in its capacity as a settlor,to amend the plan.
it is clear that the plan required the fund to be invested almost exclusively in rei common stock,preserving only a minimal cash component to maintain liquidity for transactions in the stock.attachment a specifies that the common stock fund is to be primarily invested and reinvested in rei common stock.kirschbaum asserts that this language would have permitted the rei defendants to increase the cash component of the fund up to percent of its total holdings.on the contrary,section a of the trust agreement directs the trustee to invest all contributions to the fund in rei common stock as soon as practicable.the remainder of that section,as well as section,require the trustee to invest the common stock fund exclusively in rei stock,with an exception of a small,cash component as necessary to make any distribution or payment.the statement of investment policy,albeit not a constitutive plan document,reflects these detailed restrictions when it provides that no more than percent to percent of the fund total value may be held in cash.a cash percentage greater than that necessary for minimal liquidity would have contravened plan requirements.
based on all of these provisions,neither rei nor the benefits committee were given express discretion to halt the purchase of rei common stock or invest fund assets in other holdings.
who is a fiduciary 
if plan fiduciaries would violate the plan by deviating from the mandatory retention and acquisition of rei stock in the common stock fund,the district court reasoned,they had no discretion,and hence no fiduciary duty,to deviate.kirschbaum,supported by the department of labor as an amicus,strenuously disagrees that plan managers can,by the expedient of applying mandatory plan provisions,divest themselves of their prudential fiduciary duty not to purchase company stock that they know is artificially inflated.these circumstances raise subtle questions concerning the scope of fiduciary responsibility for employee savings plans that feature company stock as an investment option or a matching contribution 
the supreme court has noted that the first question pertinent to establishing erisa liability is whether the defendant is in fact a fiduciary.pegram,at.at.erisa plan managers bear fiduciary responsibility correlative with the scope of their duties.an erisa fiduciary for one purpose is not necessarily a fiduciary for other purposes.bannistor ullman,cir see also cotton.mut.life company,cir fiduciary status under erisa is not an concept.rather,a person is a fiduciary only to the extent he has or exercises specified authority,discretion,or control over a plan or its assets 
a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.
a.fiduciary duties may thus arise either from the terms of the governing plan or from acts and practices in carrying it out.see also bannistor,at.excluded from fiduciary responsibilities,however,are the decisions of a plan sponsor to modify,amend or terminate the plan such decisions are those of a trust settlor,not a fiduciary.hughes aircraft,at.at.
rei begins its defense with the contention that investments in the rei common stock fund were hard wired into the plan,and that it,as settlor,can not be liable in damages for what would amount to a compelled amendment,termination,or modification of the plan.in interpreting a,the supreme court emphasized that employers or other plan sponsors are generally free under erisa,for any reason at any time,to adopt,modify,or terminate welfare plans.lockheed corporation spink,d internal quotations omitted.this holding was extended to employee retirement plans in hughes aircraft.at.at.the court emphasized that the term fiduciary with respect to a plan encompasses management and administration of the plan,but does not include plan design.id.thus,when employers undertake actions to adopt,modify or terminate a plan,they do not act as fiduciaries but are analogous to the settlors of the trust.spink,at.at internal citations omitted.viewed solely from this perspective,kirschbaum insistence that rei had an obligation to terminate the common stock fund,cease purchasing rei stock for the fund,and liquidate the fund investment in rei common stock seeks no less than systemic modifications of the plan itself.because the plan design was allotted to rei,as settlor,the company had no fiduciary duty concerning such terms.
kirschbaum,for his part,responds that the court has distinguished between the composition or design of the plan itself and the employer fiduciary duties which consist of such actions as the administration of the plan assets.see hughes aircraft,at.at.moreover,rei was involved in the plan administration and asset management because,pursuant to the plan,it was both a named fiduciary and directed the trustee and because it apparently played a part in promulgating a statement of investment policy which detailed how the plan investments would be managed.we may easily reject the first two grounds for rei alleged fiduciary status.the terms of the plan,which named rei as fiduciary and enabled it to direct the trustee,also specifically limited rei authority rei could be a fiduciary to the extent of its carrying out the activities referenced in the plan,but its fiduciary duty status can not be expanded beyond them.
interpreting the statement of investment policy,however,poses a closer question.this is a document formally adopted by the benefits committee for the purpose of establishing the policy for management of plan assets.in its preamble,the policy states 
this statement may be modified,in whole or in part,by reliant energy at any point in time.reliant energy may provide supplemental guidelines for each investment option of the plan.
the statement goes on to declare that the benefits committee has responsibility and authority for the operation of the plan,including administration and investment of the plan assets.further,the benefits committee will serve as the named fiduciary of the plan under erisa with respect to the management and investment of the plan assets.the policy then briefly outlines the investment objectives of the plan the funding requirements the target allocation of assets monitoring and performance guidelines.
on one hand,the statement expressly complies with the provision of the plan making the rei common stock fund a mandatory feature and compelling as close to one hundred percent of its assets as possible to be invested in rei stock.one could also read rei modification authority simply to reflect its position as the plan settlor.this statement is not,however,a plan document.that it reserves to rei the right to provide supplemental guidelines for each investment option might alternatively be construed as going beyond plan design and into discretionary asset management.notwithstanding the arguably reserved power in the statement,when rei eliminated the restrictions on age and tenure that limited employees rights to sell company matching stock that had been allocated to their plans,it amended the plan the mandatory plan provision took precedence,in practice,over the vague language of the statement.in sum,there seems to be a factual issue whether rei had discretionary authority in the management of the plan or exercised any authority respecting management or disposition of its assets.see a i.perhaps the reservation of such authority could give rise to fiduciary duties pertinent to the common stock fund.
the benefits committee,by contrast,is explicitly made a fiduciary in its discretionary authority over plan management and the exercise of actual activities.rei contends that the benefits committee had no fiduciary duties with respect to acquiring and holding rei stock beyond the duty to comply with the plan mandatory guidelines.rei further contends,not without reason,that if the decisions to cease acquiring rei common stock,terminate the fund,and liquidate the rei common stock holdings amount to settlor decisions,then the benefits committee should not have fiduciary duties inconsistent with or broader than those of the settlor.
because the plan requirements to invest in rei stock are mandatory and were treated as such by rei and the benefits committee,we agree with the district court that no fiduciary duties are inherent in the plan other than to follow its terms.whether the statement of investment policy gave rise to implied authority by rei,and whether rei and the benefits committee were subject to broader fiduciary duties under the supervening compulsion of erisa are close questions that we need not definitively resolve in this opinion.
fiduciary duty to override 
kirschbaum asserts that the rei defendants not only had the authority,but on these facts,a fiduciary duty to cease the fund continued investment in rei common stock.bluntly,they had a fiduciary duty to disobey the plain terms of the congress sanction for company stock purchase order to comply with erisa equal duties to invest prudently and not to violate the statute.see a and a d.see also laborers national pension fund trust quantitative advisors,cir a fiduciary may not discharge his duties in a manner inconsistent with erisa provisions.
citing these provisions,is,however,far easier than propounding a test for their violation.one hypothetical frequently cited by both parties is a benefits plan written to require investment in lottery tickets.such an anomalous plan would violate erisa,and a fiduciary would be bound to deviate from the plan requirements.
but shares of rei common stock are neither lottery tickets nor an investment that is intrinsically and in all cases imprudent.kirschbaum contends that the stock became an imprudent investment when the defendants obtained adverse information about the trading.far from being,this claim requires a balance to be struck among competing congressional purposes.see varity howe,d.generally,congress intent in erisa is to balance the protection of employee benefits against creating a system so complex that administrative costs,or litigation expenses,unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the first place.id.moreover,in this particular context congress has expressed a strong preference for plan investment in the employer stock,although this preference may be in tension with erisa general fiduciary duties.see,langbecker data,cir.
the question is how to define when the duty of prudence might require a fiduciary to disobey the clear requirements of an eiap and halt the purchase of employer stock.in this,as in all cases,the test of prudence is one of conduct,not results.donovan,at.the prudence test asks whether the fiduciary selected investments with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.the focus of the inquiry is how the fiduciary acted,not whether his investments succeeded or failed.donovan,at internal citation omitted.the prudence requirement is a flexible standard,and a fiduciary conduct must be evaluated in light of the character and aims of the particular type of plan he serves.id.internal quotation omitted.relevant here are the horizon of retirement investing,as well as the favored status congress has granted to employee stock investments in their own companies.langbecker,at see also varity,at.at courts must interpret erisa fiduciary duties in a manner consistent with the special nature and purpose of employee benefit plans.internal citation omitted.
attempting to strike the proper balance,the third circuit adopted an abuse of discretion standard of review for a fiduciary of an employee stock option plan esop that is designed to invest primarily in an employer stock.moench robertson,cir concerning esops edgar avaya,cir extending moench reasoning to eiaps.the moench court was unwilling to subject these fiduciaries to the strict scrutiny that applies under conventional trust law to a trustee who is simply authorized,but not encouraged or required,to make a particular investment.doing so,it noted,would eviscerate the statutory preference for esops.moench,at.rather,moench concluded that a fiduciary of this sort of plan is entitled to a presumption that his decision to invest in the employer securities was prudent.a plaintiff may rebut the presumption only by showing that owing to circumstances not known to the settlor and not anticipated by him the making of such investment would defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trust.id.at quoting restatement second of trusts,cmt.g.in moench,there was a triable question on this point because the facts showed a continual and precipitous drop in stock price,the fiduciaries knowledge of the company impending collapse,and their internal conflicts over the proper course of action for the esop.
both parties initially disagreed that moench should be the governing authority for this case.kirschbaum contends that the court presumption in favor of continued company stock investment should not apply at all where allegations,like his,relate to the fiduciaries knowing purchases of stock at an artifi
