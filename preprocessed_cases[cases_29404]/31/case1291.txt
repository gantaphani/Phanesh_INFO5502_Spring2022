the central issue in this interlocutory appeal is the proper reach of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.ross glenn moorman,argues that the district court erred in ruling that erisa governed the disability insurance plan provided by unumprovident corporation,unum life insurance company of america unum life,and unum corporation collectively appellees.after careful review of the facts in this case,the relevant case law,and the underlying purposes of erisa,we affirm the district court ruling that erisa governs the plan in this case.as an additional matter,appellees ask us to review moorman claims brought under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et.we decline to review moorman rico claims,which were not certified for appeal by the district court,because the district court has not had an adequate opportunity to address the defenses raised on appeal by the appellees.
background 
quoting liberally and making additions as necessary,we largely adopt the district court statement of the facts in this case in a letter dated october,brian glenn,an agent for unum life,contacted anne rivers carter,the office manager of southeastern steam,southeastern steam to request the opportunity to present the disability insurance plan to the company employees and to solicit enrollment.carter later met with glenn and applied to unum life for group coverages on behalf of southeastern steam.at id.exh.she signed a client information form,through which she selected various eligibility requirements for the disability plan,including a waiting period and a minimum workweek requirement.id.exh.
on april,glenn met with company employees individually to discuss coverage under the plan.exh.at.carter stated that publicity was conducted by word of mouth,like,there a guy coming,if you want disability insurance,you can meet with him he explain it to you.at.no representative from southeastern steam was present during these meetings.the decision on whether to sign up for disability insurance was left to the individual employee.those who wished to enroll completed disability program enrollment forms,which glenn drafted and provided.the forms stated,southeastern steam,is offering a comprehensive disability program to protect you and your family in the event a accident or sickness causes you to miss work.exh.carter,who signed up for the plan,later stated that she never read this statement and that she believed unum life,rather than southeastern steam,was providing the plan.at the meetings,glenn also discussed the benefits and premium amounts with each employee.
carter testified that southeastern steam revised its employee handbook to include a reference to the plan in question,which was the only disability plan offered to the employees during that time.at.under the heading benefits,southeastern steam employee handbook stated the company makes available to employees access to benefits designed to meet the needs of employees and provide protection from financial hardship.these benefits will be reviewed periodically to assure that they keep pace with area practice and employee needs.id.exh.at.in the same section,under the subheading disability insurance,the handbook stated,disability insurance is available to all employees.the premium for this coverage is the sole responsibility of the employee.id.exh.at.
at the time of their enrollment,the participating employees were not provided copies of the plan nor any other written documents,apart from the enrollment forms themselves.the plan booklets and included certificates were later mailed to carter,who filed them in a closet at southeastern steam.carter testified that,while she did not widely distribute the booklets,she gave a booklet to moorman and kept one for herself.id.at.the plan certificate provides,inter alia,that t his policy is delivered in and is governed by the laws of the governing jurisdiction and to the extent applicable by the employee retirement income security act of erisa and any amendments.id.exh.at.the summary plan description designated southeastern steam as the plan administrator and as the agent for service of legal process on the plan.id.exh.at.
enrolled employees were required to pay their entire premium amounts on a basis.carter collected employee premiums from employees by way of payroll deductions and remitted them to unum life by writing a check from southeastern steam account.id.at.while she provided unum life number to certain employees who asked questions regarding their claims and benefits,carter also admitted that she personally may have tried to help employees who had such questions.id.at.carter further stated that she had on file some blank forms that unum life had given her.id.at.when one employee made a claim under the plan,carter provided a form to that employee,and she completed and submitted the employer verification form to unum life.id.at,exh.at.she also submitted an employer verification form for moorman,when he filed his claim.exh.at 
moorman,formerly employed by southeastern steam signed up for the plan during the april meeting with glenn.in february,moorman was diagnosed with rectal cancer.after he initially qualified as disabled under the plan,the appellees determined that he no longer satisfied the definition of disability.moorman disputed the denial of his disability benefits to the appellees but he was unsuccessful.on july,moorman filed the complaint in this case,in which he alleged the wrongful denial of disability benefits and various other state and federal law claims.on august,appellees filed their motion to dismiss.on october,the district court converted the appellees motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether the plan is governed by erisa,which would preempt moorman state law claims.
in a subsequent order on february,from which this appeal is taken,the district court granted appellees converted motion for summary judgment in ruling that the plan was governed by erisa granted appellees motion to dismiss moorman state law claims on grounds of erisa preemption and denied appellees motion to dismiss moorman federal rico claim.on march,moorman filed a motion for reconsideration an alternative motion seeking certification for interlocutory appeal and a motion to stay proceedings.
on july,the district court denied moorman motion for reconsideration granted moorman alternative motion for certification for interlocutory appeal denied appellees request for certification for interlocutory appeal of the district court refusal to dismiss moorman federal rico claims granted moorman motion to stay proceedings denied without prejudice certain discovery motions filed by moorman and ordered that the district court case be administratively terminated until remanded per the instructions of our court.we later granted moorman interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,moorman alleges that the district court committed various errors in determining that erisa governs the plan in this case.specifically,he claims that the district court improperly limited discovery improperly determined that erisa governance was a question of fact for the district court,and not the jury,to decide and made an impermissible credibility determination with regard to a witness,and improperly construed and disregarded other evidence favorable to moorman.with regard to moorman federal rico claims,appellees ask us to review whether this claim should be dismissed.after a brief examination of the relevant background law,we address these issues in turn.

we review de novo the grant of a motion for summary judgment.anderson unum provident,cir.federal rule of civil procedure c requires summary judgment when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.in deciding a summary judgment motion,the court must view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and resolve all disputes and draw all inferences in the nonmovant favor.anderson liberty lobby,d see also burger king weaver,cir.we review the denial of a discovery order for abuse of discretion.burger king,at.
erisa law generally

governance 
erisa governs employee welfare benefit programs provided by an employer.see et.an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa is any plan,fund,or program established or maintained by an employer to provide benefits through an insurance policy.see donovan dillingham,cir.however,no single act in itself necessarily constitutes the establishment of the plan,fund,or program.donovan,at.rather,it is the reality of a plan and not the decision to extend certain benefits that is determinative.id.an erisa plan is established if from the surrounding circumstances a reasonable person could ascertain the intended benefits,a class of beneficiaries,the source of financing,and procedures for receiving benefits.id.
safe harbor exemption 
the united states department of labor explicitly exempts from erisa governance certain group or insurance programs offered by an insurer to employees.j.there are four elements necessary to satisfy the safe harbor exemption n o contributions are made by an employer or employee organization p articipation in the program is completely voluntary for employees or members t he sole functions of the employer with respect to the program are,without endorsing the program,to permit the insurer to publicize the program to employees or members,to collect premiums through payroll deductions or dues checkoffs and to remit them to the insurer and t he employer receives no consideration in the form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program,other than reasonable compensation,excluding any profit,for administrative services.id.
whether the district court made specific errors in determining that erisa governs the plan 
whether the district court improperly limited discovery 
moorman complains that the district court improperly limited his discovery regarding questions of erisa governance and preemption when it denied his motion for leave to depose appellees witnesses and for additional time to submit summary judgment materials.however,moorman never specifically identifies in his brief the issues on which he sought discovery.in denying moorman motion,the district court correctly noted that this new discovery request related to the issue of whether the southeastern steam had contributed to the plan.the court then observed that the appellees had withdrawn any contention that southeastern steam had contributed to the plan.mindful that the standard of review for denials of a discovery order is abuse of discretion,we conclude that moorman argument on this issue fails.
whether erisa governance is a question of fact for the jury 
in addition,moorman argues that the district court erred because it stated that the issue of whether erisa governs the plan is a fact question for the district court to determine.according to moorman,because the district court already has jurisdiction based on other claims,the district court has no need to determine the factual existence of erisa governance for jurisdictional purposes,and therefore this question of fact should be determined by a jury.in its order,however,the district court indicated that it would follow the general restrictions placed on it at the summary judgment stage,resolving issues based on material undisputed facts.at.notwithstanding any arguable errors in applying this standard by the district court,this issue need not be resolved on appeal because the appeal concerns only our de novo review of the threshold question of whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether erisa governs the plan.this question is necessarily for courts,and not juries,to decide.see mackenzie city of rockledge,cir.
whether the district court made an impermissible credibility determination and improperly construed and disregarded other evidence 
insofar as the district court may have erred in making an impermissible credibility determination or in improperly construing and disregarding other evidence favorable to moorman,this analysis is subsumed within our overall de novo review of whether there is a genuine issue of material fact on erisa governance,which is examined below.
whether there is a genuine issue of material fact on erisa governance 
in his brief on appeal,moorman argues that the controlling questions of law in this case are the alleged laundry list of errors by the district court in applying the summary judgment standard of review.see appellant br.at.this misses the point.in applying de novo review,we review the judgment,not the soundness of the district court explanation for it.collado united parcel,cir see also sec ets payphones,cir per curiam we review the district court judgments we do not grade the opinions.thus,even if the district court erred by improperly making a credibility determination or by misconstruing and disregarding certain evidence,moorman still must show that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to erisa governance.
safe harbor analysis 
the requirements for a safe harbor exception under j are strict.see butero royal maccabees life ins,cir noting that the safe harbor regulation explicitly obliges the employer who seeks its safe harbor to refrain from any functions other than permitting the insurer to publicize the program and collecting premiums.thus,the safe harbor analysis is usually conducted before considering whether the plan is governed by erisa using the more analysis under.anderson,at.
appellees concede that three of the four elements of the safe harbor exemption are met.the only element in contention is whether t he sole functions of the employer with respect to the program are,without endorsing the program,to permit the insurer to publicize the program to employees or members,to collect premiums through payroll deductions or dues checkoffs and to remit them to the insurer.j emphasis added.according to the department of labor 
an employee organization will be considered to have endorsed a group or insurance program if the employee organization expresses to its members any positive,normative judgment regarding the program.an employee organization may,in the course of permitting an insurer,insurance agent,or insurance broker to market the group or insurance program to its employees or members,facilitate the publicizing and marketing of the program,but only to an extent short of endorsing the program.an endorsement within the meaning of j occurs if the employee organization urges or encourages member participation in the program or engages in activities that would lead a member reasonably to conclude that the program is part of a benefit arrangement established or maintained by the employee organization.
erisa op.letter,wl july,emphasis added.for our purposes,the analysis turns on whether the employer endorsed or undertook any additional function with respect to the plan within the meaning of j.
in butero,we determined that the employer had endorsed the plan because it had chosen the insurer,decided on key terms,deemed certain employees ineligible for participation,incorporated the policy terms into the summary plan description for its cafeteria plan,and retained the ability to alter compensation reduction for tax purposes.at.while the issue was not appealed to our court,the district court in anderson concluded that an employer actions rose to the level of endorsement when it singled out the unum plan as the sole plan it offers to its hourly employees,played a role in selecting the premium rates,restricted employee eligibility,displayed its corporate logo on the policy documents which it provided to its employees,was named in the policy documents as the plan administrator,and provided a summary plan description to its employees that specifically referred to erisa.anderson,at citing anderson unumprovident,d.
under the mandate of butero,which states that any functions by the employer apart from the two listed exceptions disqualify a plan from the safe harbor exception,the plan at issue in this case does not qualify for this exception.see butero,at.here,even though only one nonlisted employer function would disqualify the plan under the safe harbor exception,several actions by southeastern steam stand out as endorsement for the purposes of j.
first,as the district court noted,it is undisputed that southeastern steam decided on at least one of the eligibility terms under the plan,the waiting period.at.moorman himself concedes in his brief on appeal that southeastern steam determined the waiting period.appellant br.at.
second,similar to the district court analysis in anderson,the plan at issue in this case was the sole long term disability plan offered by southeastern steam to its employees.see d at.specifically,there is no dispute that southeastern steam identified the plan in its employee handbook as part of the company employee benefits.the employee handbook stated that d isability insurance is available to all employees,exh.at.carter testified that southeastern steam did not offer disability insurance prior to the plan at issue in this case,that no other plans were then offered,and that the provision in the handbook was added to account for that policy.id.at.in addition,all but one of the employees of southeastern steam enrolled for disability coverage at the time of the original enrollment.id.at.the enrollment forms were signed by the employees,including carter and moorman,and included the following language southeastern steam,is offering a comprehensive disability program exh.at unnumbered.
third,it is undisputed that southeastern steam maintained a limited supply of claim forms and that carter assisted with the filings of at least one or two claim forms to unum life on behalf of employees.at,exh.at.moorman argues that this was only a ministerial function,and that any submissions to unum life for claims on the part of southeastern steam were the employer verification forms,which were required by the insurer.nevertheless,given butero low threshold for disqualification under the safe harbor exception,the fact that any additional function by the employer with regard to the plan bars the application,this accumulation of extraneous functions by southeastern steam has rendered the safe harbor inapplicable in this case.our discussion in the next section regarding establishment and maintenance incorporates this safe harbor analysis and addresses more fully the depth of southeastern steam involvement with the plan.
establishment and maintenance statutory coverage under 
even if the safe harbor is barred,that does not necessarily mean that the insurance policy is part of an erisa plan.butero,at see also anderson,at a plan that falls outside of the safe harbor exception does not necessarily fall within the jurisdiction of erisa.
the defendants must show five things to establish that an erisa plan governs its relationship with plaintiff a plan,fund,or program that has been established or maintained by an employer for the purpose of providing disability benefits to participants or their beneficiaries.donovan,at internal quotations omitted.the only contested factor is the third,whether the employer,southeastern steam,established or maintained the plan within the meaning of.our inquiry thus necessarily focuses on the employer and its involvement with the administration of the plan.anderson,at.
in butero,we suggested seven factors that may be relevant in determining whether an employee welfare benefits program has been established by an employer.these factors are equally important in determining whether an employer has maintained the plan the employer representations in internally distributed documents the employer oral representations the employer establishment of a fund to pay benefits actual payment of benefits the employer deliberate failure to correct known perceptions of a plan existence the reasonable understanding of employees and the employer intent.id.at quoting butero,at.
we can not help but note that the facts in this case are similar to those in anderson,in which we determined that the employer established and maintained the plan.see id.at.in applying butero seven listed factors to the facts in this case and incorporating our previous analysis concerning the safe harbor exception,we conclude,as we did in anderson,that almost all of the factors provide powerful reasons to conclude as a matter of law that the employer both established and maintained an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa.see id.at.
with regard to the first butero factor,as noted previously,southeastern steam stated in its employee handbook that disability insurance was an available benefit.some courts have concluded that this alone is enough to trigger erisa governance.see,cockey life ins.of,where a plan is presented to employees as one belonging to the employer benefits package,however,as opposed to merely permitting the insurer to publicize the program to employees,the plan is an employee welfare benefit plan under erisa,even though the employees pay the premiums.
with the possible exceptions of the disclosure of unum life number to certain employees and the publicity for the unum life representative visit to the company,which are not particularly probative of whether southeastern steam established or maintained the plan,there are no relevant facts discussed on appeal regarding southeastern steam oral representations to its employees,so we move on to the third butero factor.here,southeastern steam,similar to the employer in anderson,established a fund to pay benefits and selected the unum plan as the sole long term disability plan and limited eligibility to certain employees.see anderson,at citation omitted.by applying for unum life coverage on behalf of its employees,and deciding on key terms in the plan agreement,southeastern steam made the plan a benefit closely tied to the relationship.id.at.
with regard to fourth factor,anderson is once again on point.while southeastern steam did not actually pay benefits,it was directly involved in the payment process because it maintain ed a supply of claim forms and facilitated the payment of benefits.see id.at.moorman disputes the level of participation by southeastern steam and argues that the claim forms were filed away.however,carter admitted that she helped employees who had questions regarding their claims and benefits and that she wrote a check on southeastern steam account to pay for all of the coverages.at.carter also assisted at least one or two employees in the filing of an actual claim.id.at,exh.at.
the fifth and sixth butero factors also favor the appellees.it is not simply the subjective understanding of individual employees like carter who admitted she did not read the enrollment form and moorman,who maintained that they believed southeastern steam was not offering the plan,but rather the viewpoint of the objectively reasonable employee that is the primary consideration in this analysis.see anderson,at johnson watts regulator,cir conducting erisa analysis from the viewpoint of an objectively reasonable employee.here,southeastern steam created and distributed the employee handbook,which referenced the plan in question as an available benefit for all its employees moreover,the employees signed the enrollment forms that indicated southeastern steam was offering the program.though there is no affirmative evidence that southeastern steam knew of any misconceptions regarding the disability plan,there is likewise no evidence that southeastern steam company officials,including carter and moorman,who signed the enrollment forms and who received the erisa plan booklet and certificates,took any steps,over the course of several years,to refute the indications that southeastern steam was offering the plan or to provide any necessary clarifications.see anderson,at finding relevant the fact that company officials did nothing to change the erisa language in any of the documents until
