barbara vercher appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of,aon services corporation,aon risk services,of louisiana formerly known as alexander and alexander,alexander,and metropolitan life insurance company metlife,upholding the denial of vercher claim for disability benefits.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
barbara vercher vercher,began working for alexander in as an accounting clerk.she was first promoted in,then again in,and finally in may of to manager of administrative services.vercher continued to work at alexander until march.
during the course and scope of her employment with alexander,vercher was injured in a motor vehicle accident on february.the accident resulted in injury to her knee,head,and back.in late she began to experience numbness in her arms and legs.she was referred to babson fresh who on october,performed an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with bank bone at on vercher.when vercher returned to fresh in december with continued pain at the base of her neck and in her right arm,fresh assessed that the pain was myofascial,and not nerve root in origin.when fresh released vercher in february of,he declared her at maximum medical improvement.fresh eventually recommended medical retirement on april.another doctor,farley tumbaco,who had treated vercher from september,also recommended medical retirement.
vercher ceased working for alexander on march,because of her alleged disabilities stemming from the accident.vercher had elected coverage under her employer disability plan which did not entitle her to benefits until six months later on august,vercher submitted her application for disability benefits.soon thereafter,alexander entered into an administrative services agreement asa with metlife,which gave metlife authority to perform certain administrative services related to the alexander disability plan.the asa also gave metlife discretionary authority for determining eligibility for disability benefits and for construing plan terms disability under the plan is determined as follows 
you are disabled if,because of injury or sickness 
you are completely unable to perform any and every duty of your regular occupation and 
after benefits have been paid for months,you are completely unable to perform the material duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably suited by training,education,or experience.
metlife denied vercher claim for benefits on november.on january,vercher appealed metlife denial of her claim,maintaining that she was totally disabled and entitled to disability benefits.on november,metlife denied her appeal adhering to its prior determination that she was not disabled.
vercher filed this action in state court on february.appellees then removed the case to federal court on april,asserting exclusive federal jurisdiction over actions for wrongful denial of benefits governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.the parties filed cross motions of partial summary judgment,and the district court disposed of those motions holding that the metlife asa controlled the disposition of the claim,and that metlife decision to deny vercher claim for disability benefits would be reviewed for abuse of discretion.the parties then filed for summary judgment.the district court granted appellees motion,holding that metlife did not abuse its discretion in denying vercher claim for disability benefits.vercher timely appealed.

standard of review 
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.hodges delta airlines,cir en banc.standard summary judgment rules control in erisa cases.see barhan,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when,viewing the evidence and all justifiable inferences in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.hunt cromartie,d see also.c.
metlife and the abuse of discretion standard 
vercher disability plan was sponsored by her employer,alexander.the official plan administrator was the united states benefit administration committee of alexander and alexander services.the plan was not an insurance policy,and there was no insurance policy of which vercher was a beneficiary.the employees paid into the plan monthly according to the character of plan benefit which they had elected and which the employer agreed to provide.until october,benefits under the plan were paid by alexander through an asa with aetna.while the aetna asa provided that aetna would determine benefit claims under the plan,it did not expressly give aetna discretionary authority to construe plan terms.the agreement with aetna was in effect at the time of vercher injury,at the time she stopped working,and at the time she filed her initial claim.after vercher claim for benefits had been filed,but before it had been decided or presented to aetna for determination,alexander entered into the aforementioned asa with metlife,effective october,under the agreement,metlife had the discretionary authority for determining eligibility for disability benefits and for construing plan terms.
vercher asserts that because there was no such discretionary provision in the agreement with aetna,and because the aetna agreement was in effect at the time she submitted her claim,her claim should have been reviewed under the terms of the aetna asa,and in turn,the district court should have applied a de novo,as opposed to an abuse of discretion,standard.
after the initial hearing,in its memorandum ruling of february,the district court determined that the metlife,not the aetna,agreement was controlling,and therefore decided that the standard of review would be abuse of discretion.
in her brief,vercher concedes that if the metlife plan was the appropriate plan under which her claim should have been reviewed,then the arbitrary and capricious standard utilized by the district court was the correct standard.however,vercher disputes the district court decision that the metlife agreement controls.in addition to the fact that she made the required payments to the plan for disability coverage thereunder,was injured,became disabled and filed her claim for benefits while the aetna asa was in effect,vercher asserts that alexander deliberately held her claim until the metlife asa came into effect 
the district court held that because an erisa cause of action accrues at the time the benefits claim is denied,the plan in effect at the time of that denial controls the claim.to support its holding,the district court cited an unpublished fourth circuit opinion,mcwilliams metropolitan life ins,wl,cir,in which the court held that an asa expressly granting metlife the discretion to determine eligibility for disability benefits controlled because it was in effect when the applicant claim was denied,even though it was not in effect when he became disabled 
in the fifth circuit,the proper standard under which a district court is to review a plan administrator benefit determination is governed both by the supreme court decision in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,and our subsequent decision in pierre connecticut general life ins,cir,cert.denied,d,in which we construed and applied firestone.in firestone,the supreme court held that judicial review of the administrator determination of plan terms and eligibility for benefits provisions was to be de novo unless the plan expressly conferred upon the plan administrator discretionary authority in making such determinations.if discretion were granted,the abuse of discretion standard would apply instead.however,in pierre,we held that even where the plan does not expressly give the administrator discretionary authority,for factual determinations under erisa plans,the abuse of discretion standard of review is the appropriate standard emphasis added.at see also southern farm bureau life ins.moore,cir sweatman commercial union ins,cir.therefore,a plan administrator factual determinations are always reviewed for abuse of discretion but its construction of the meaning of plan terms or plan benefit entitlement provisions is reviewed de novo unless there is an express grant of discretionary authority in that respect,and if there is such then review of those decisions is also for abuse of discretion.
in light of this standard,we need not in fact determine which asa controlled vercher claim,because,as we will explain below,we believe that alexander and metlife applied a legally correct construction of the plan and its benefit entitlement provisions 
the administrator construction of the agreement 
vercher claims that the district court erred in its determination that the administrator utilized a legally correct interpretation of the disability provisions of the plan specifically the definition of any and every duty.
in this circuit,we employ a analysis in determining whether a plan administrator abused its discretion in construing plan terms.rhorer raytheon eng rs and const rs,cir.we first determine the legally correct interpretation of the plan and whether the administrator interpretation accords with the proper legal interpretation.id.if the administrator construction is legally sound,then no abuse of discretion occurred and the inquiry ends.id.at.however,if the court concludes that the administrator has not given the plan the legally correct interpretation,the court must then determine whether the administrator interpretation constitutes an abuse of discretion.id.at.
a.the legally correct interpretation 
in order to ascertain the legally correct interpretation of the plan,we must consider whether a uniform construction of the plan has been given by the administrator,whether the interpretation is fair and reasonable,and whether unanticipated costs will result from a different interpretation of the policy.lain unum life ins.of america,cir.applying these factors,the district court correctly determined that the essential inquiry here is whether metlife interpretation of the plan was fair and reasonable,as vercher did not allege that the construction of the plan was not uniform or that there were unanticipated costs 
under alexander disability plan,a person becomes disabled if,because of injury or sickness you are completely unable to perform any and every duty of your regular occupation and after benefits have been paid for months,you are completely unable to perform the material duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably suited by training,education,or experience.the district court correctly determined that vercher claim falls under the first part of this definition,requiring her to be completely unable to perform any and every duty of her regular occupation.
vercher appeals the district court holding as to the legally correct interpretation of any and every.in its memorandum ruling of september,the district court stated that in order to be considered disabled under the plan definition,an employee must be unable to perform all of the duties the employee occupation demands.it is insufficient,under the plan definition,to be unable to perform some of the duties of one regular occupation.to be eligible for long term disability benefits,an employee must be completely unable to work as long as vercher has some ability to work at her position as administrative services manager,she does not meet the required eligibility standard.
we believe that the district court definition of any and every goes too far.in saffle sierra pacific power.bargaining unit long term disability income plan,cir,the ninth circuit examined a similar provision in a long term disability plan containing the phrase each and every.that court determined that the phrase was ambiguous because there were two extreme constructions possible reading each and every literally could mean either that a claimant is not totally disabled if she can perform any single duty of her job,no matter how that a claimant is totally disabled if she can not perform any single duty,no matter how trivial.at.the court then notes that were the phrase to be given the former construction,total disability would only exist if the person were essentially,while the latter effectively convert s benefits for total disability into benefits for partial disability.id.at.
the saffle court held that the benefit committee could reasonably interpret the plan as providing for payment of total occupational disability benefits when the participant is unable to perform all of the substantial and material duties of her regular occupation,each and every duty that mattered.id.at.however,the court found that the committee arbitrarily construed the plan by defining total disability,which for purposes of occupational benefits depends on whether the participant can perform the duties of her regular occupation,to include modifications or accommodations to work available for which she is qualified.id.at.in effect,even though the committee had discretion,the court held that their construction of total disability was not reasonable because premising occupational disability unable to perform each and every duty of her regular occupation on the existence of other work available for which she is qualified that would have accommodated her limitations was inconsistent with the plan.id.
vercher also cites the ninth circuit opinion in mcclure life ins.of north america,cir,where discretion to interpret the plan was not present.in that case,where the erisa policy at issue defined disability in terms of the claimant inability to perform every duty of his occupation,the court determined that every was ambiguous,and that the language should be construed against the insurer.at.the court stated that the provision should be construed in a practical sense to refer to essential duties total disability exists if an employee is unable to perform one of the essential duties of his or her position.id.at.provident life and acc.ins.knott,when total disability is defined as unable to perform the duties of your occupation,a permissible reading is that a person is totally disabled when he is unable to perform all of the important duties of his occupation,and therefore,the plaintiff was not totally disabled because he was able to perform some of his duties.
from our review of the record,it does not appear that the district court definition of any and every was the one that alexander and metlife actually applied when considering vercher disability claim.rather,alexander and metlife seem to have believed that vercher was able to do her job,not just that she could do certain minor or nonessential parts of it 
specifically,in its letter of november,initially denying her claim,metlife wrote to vercher that based on the information provided,you have the ability to perform your regular occupation emphasis added.then,in the november,letter denying her appeal,metlife stated,
it was the opinion of the independent physician reviewer that the documentation we have does not demonstrate the presence of a significant neuromuscular impairment that would prevent you from performing the job activities of an administrative services manager.this occupation is considered sedentary in nature and not physically demanding.depression is a treatable condition and the evidence does not support any ongoing impairment that would prevent work the documentation in your particular case does not support an inability to perform sedentary types of activities emphasis added.
we must also note that vercher in fact stipulated for purposes of this case that the physical demands of plaintiff job were sedentary in nature.
metlife key inquiry was what had changed since,when the accident and injuries occurred,to preclude vercher,in,from working.in a faxed letter to one of vercher doctors,fresh,metlife nurse ferrante wrote information is needed to indicate what precluded her vercher from doing her occupation please provide copies of test results and physical exams done that would support a total disability to her occupation.please indicate what happened to preclude her continuing to work since this condition has been in existence since.
after reviewing her records,metlife petrie assessment was that a review of the medical records provided does not demonstrate the presence of a neuromuscular impairment which would prevent this claimant from performing her previous job activities as an administrative services manager this claimant does not have objective evidence of a neuromuscular or psychiatric impairment which prevents her from working.
we are unable to conclude that metlife applied or utilized other than a legally correct interpretation or definition of plan terms.in deciding that she could perform her regular occupation,it appears that metlife essentially determined that,if there were something she was unable despite reasonable accommodation to do that was indispensable or essential to the proper performance of her regular occupation,she would have received benefits.however,so long as she was able to perform all the substantial and important aspects of her job,with reasonable accommodation,and any aspects of the job that she could not perform with reasonable accommodation were,singularly or together,not indispensable or essential to the job,then she was not disabled.
therefore,under either a de novo or an abuse of discretion standard,we hold that metlife and alexander applied a legally correct,fair,and reasonable construction of the plan terms.because theirs was a legally correct interpretation,we need not determine whether the interpretation itself was an abuse of discretion.see lain,at.
facts and evidence 
though we have determined that a legally correct standard was applied,we still must consider whether the facts before metlife and underlying its decision to deny benefits support that decision or whether its factual determinations were an abuse of discretion.again,in this circuit,factual determinations under erisa plans are examined using the abuse of discretion standard of review federal courts owe due deference to the administrator factual conclusions that reflect a reasonable and impartial judgment.pierre,at.
the district court correctly noted that the administrative record contains evidence that vercher did suffer from some degree of disability for example,fresh,one of vercher doctors,concluded that she suffered from cervical disc herniation,depression,hyperthyroidism,persistent neck and arm pain,and was severely limited in functional capacity and incapable of minimal sedentary activity.additionally,doctors fresh and tumbaco recommended medical retirement for vercher.
however,the district court was also correct in noting that the administrative record also contains evidence that vercher disability did not render her completely unable to perform any and every duty of her regular occupation.metlife had vercher submit to a functional capacity assessment fca in which presented her physical capabilities based upon consistencies and inconsistencies in her performance.the fca concluded that vercher had a workday tolerance of seven to eight hours and was able to work at a sedentary level.
additionally,the district court addressed petrie review of vercher records upon reviewing the fca and the findings of those physicians who had treated vercher,petrie stated in an october,letter that there was no objective evidence of a neuromuscular or psychiatric impairment which prevents employment,and that the less than maximal effort demonstrated on testing of neuromuscular structures during the fca indicate s attempts on the part of an individual to exaggerate impairment.intolerance for prolonged sitting,inability to balance or walk on the heels and toes,and difficulty climbing stairs can not be attributed to previous cervical disk surgery.
there is also other factual evidence in the record supporting the administrator determination that vercher should not receive disability benefits.vercher worked for more than four years after she was initially injured in the accident.she accepted a promotion on may,from manager of accounting to manager of administrative services,and performed under her new position for nearly two years.notably,between march of and march of,vercher had only taken seven days off work due to her illness.though she had depression,which her doctor believed was a result of her injury and related pain,she was not undergoing special psychiatric treatment 
after she left work,vercher listed her daily activities to include light cooking,cleaning,make bed to have weekly help for changing beds walk in my yard or sit outside.elsewhere in the record,it is stated that since leaving work,vercher occasionally works around the yard,which,unlike her job,does not appear to be a sedentary activity 
we agree with the district court that,though medical retirement was recommended by her treating physicians,there was enough evidence in the record to show that alexander and metlife did not abuse their discretion by relying on the fca and petrie conclusions in making their decision to deny vercher claim.see sweatman commercial union ins,cir w e agree with the district court that metlife disability determination was not an abuse of discretion.see donato metropolitan life ins,cir metlife denial of benefits was not arbitrary and capricious when its decision simply came down to a permissible choice between the position of umac,metlife independent medical consultant,and the position of the claimant physicians.
treating physician argument 
finally,vercher contends that the district court erred in determining that it could give no greater weight to the opinions of her treating physicians than to those of the doctors hired by metlife.under salley dupont de nemours,cir and the treating physicians rule,this court held that,under appropriate circumstances,a court is required to defer to a patient treating physician testimony unless there is substantial evidence which contradicts it.
vercher argument that special,determinative deference had to have been given to the opinions of her treating doctors by both metlife and the district court,must fail in light of recent supreme court precedent.in black decker disability plan nord,d,the supreme court held that erisa does not require plan administrators to accord special deference to opinions of treating physicians.the court stated,
p lan administrators may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant reliable evidence,including the opinions of a treating physician.but courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant physician nor may courts impose on administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician evaluation.id.at.
therefore,metlife appropriately considered vercher treating physicians diagnoses,however,it was not required to give those opinions determinative weight.
conclusion 
we need not determine which asa controlled vercher claim,because we hold that alexander and metlife applied a legally correct construction of the plan and its terms.based on our review of the record,we find that the facts underlying metlife decision to deny benefits support that decision,and therefore it was not an abuse of discretion.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the district court grant of summary judgment is 
the plan defined eligibility to receive benefits as follows the plan begins to pay you a monthly benefit after you have been disabled for at least days out of a period,or continuously for a period of days.
prior to october,alexander plan was administered under an asa with the aetna life insurance company aetna.
no metlife insurance policy is involved in this case instead,alexander is required to furnish the money from which metlife pays the benefits.
in a letter to metlife nurse ferrante,sue foard,alexander benefits coordinator,indicated that certain applications,including vercher,were being sent via federal express to metlife.foard then stated,thank you very much for your help on these claims.i had to hold them in my office until everything was finalized between metlife alexander alexander.emphasis added.that is the sole basis for vercher contention in this respect.
a n erisa cause of action based on the denial of benefits accrues at the time benefits are denied,and the plan in effect when the decision to deny benefits is controlling.mcwilliams,id.at.
though we do not decide the question,it may very well be that the metlife agreement d
