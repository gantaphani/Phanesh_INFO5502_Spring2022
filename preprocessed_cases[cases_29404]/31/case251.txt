nickolas zervos suffers from metastatic breast cancer,an essentially incurable condition that often can be held at bay temporarily either by repeated cycles of conventional chemotherapy or by a single cycle of high dosage chemotherapy followed by an autologous blood stem cell transplant hdct.on his physician advice and after being warned that hdct often involves more effects than conventional chemotherapy,zervos elected to use hdct because he believed it gave him a chance at a longer period of remission.however,empire healthchoice,empire,the carrier for zervos health care coverage from his employer,verizon new york,verizon,declined to zervos eligibility for coverage for hdct,finding that the treatment was investigational and experimental.as part of its internal appellate process,empire referred zervos case to an outside reviewer.although that reviewer found that hdct was effective for treatment of zervos condition and that the clinical trial in which he would be treated was,empire again denied time because hdct had not been proven to be superior to conventional chemotherapy.
zervos began this litigation in january and concomitantly requested a preliminary injunction.the district court denied zervos request for injunctive relief and we affirmed.zervos verizon new york,cir zervos ii.in affirming,we noted that zervos might be able to establish that the administrator applied the health insurance plan exclusion erroneously on appeal by defining it in a manner not supported by the language of the plan.id.at.on remand and after a bench trial,the district court found that empire appellate process was arbitrary and capricious and remanded to empire,directing that a different outside consultant review zervos eligibility.because the denial of benefits based on the record at the time of the remand was unreasonable,and the remand did not account for the fact that each day was crucial in this case,we find that the remand was an abuse of discretion and reverse and remand for the entry of an injunction requiring coverage 
background 
request for treatment 
in february,zervos discovered a lump in his right breast.a biopsy demonstrated that the lump was malignant,and the subsequent mastectomy at parkway hospital indicated that the cancer had spread to twelve out of the twelve lymph nodes examined.after further testing,zervos learned that the malignancy probably had infiltrated his sternum based on these findings,parkway referred zervos to columbia presbyterian medical center for more aggressive chemotherapy.on october,charles hesdorffer,zervos physician at columbia presbyterian,requested insurance approval to proceed with hdct following a protocol that he attached.zervos already was receiving standard chemotherapy in the form of adriamycin and cytoxan,which he tolerated well.he subsequently responded to this conventional chemotherapy and to a course of radiation,and his cancer went into remission.zervos verizon new york,wl,march,zervos i.
ii.relevant policy provisions 
the policy covering zervos provided coverage for medically necessary treatments,defined as treatments that are required for the necessary treatment of injury,illness,or pregnancy,as distinct from those which are unnecessary or.under the policy,means services or supplies which are not of proven benefit for the diagnosis or treatment of the covered person condition,or are not generally recognized by the medical community as effective or appropriate for that condition,as determined by the claims administrator.
steven wolinsky,empire medical policy director,testified that he himself decided whether a treatment was experimental or investigational based on literature,research and evidence,or,at his discretion,he referred the decision to empire technology assessment committee tac.the tac consists of empire medical personnel and academic physicians from the new york city or albany area.in determining whether a procedure is of proven benefit,within the meaning of the policy,wolinsky or the tac considers the efficacy of the treatment balanced by the toxicity and whether that net positive health effect compares favorably with other standard treatments.toxicity,in wolinsky view,includes any side effects of the treatment from the most minor to the most toxic.
the policy also provides for an internal appeal,the resolution of which is committed to the discretion of empire,as appeals administrator.empire refers these appeals to an external reviewer,usually the medical care ombudsmen program mcop,an organization that was set up about five years ago to handle appeals of coverage decisions.mcop,which has no ties to empire other than the payment it receives for handling an appeal,refers each case to a doctor who has expertise concerning the insured condition.wolinsky then poses a series of questions to the external consultant,who answers them based on the patient records,his or her own expertise,and the medical literature.wolinsky first told the district court that empire abide s by whatever decision the external reviewer makes.however,at trial,he admitted that empire accepted only the reviewer determination of what the medical literature showed and her clinical expertise on what the best treatment for the patient at the given time.
iii.the evolution of empire hdct policy 
for several years in the and based on the available medical research,empire covered hdct for patients who,like zervos,had metastatic breast cancer and had responded to standard chemotherapy.at that time,several phase ii studies,which are summarized in edward stadtmauer,et,chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy plus autologous hematopoietic transplantation for metastatic breast cancer,new eng.med and one phase iii randomized bezwoda the conclusion that hdct provided an overall survival benefit for patients with metastatic breast cancer however,in may,wolinsky became aware of abstracts that had been presented at an american society of clinical oncology asco meeting.these abstracts discussed controlled,randomized phase iii studies and in wolinsky view did not show an improvement in result for hdct.wolinsky therefore convened a meeting of the tac in july.at that meeting,empire decided to continue coverage based in part on a presentation from zervos treating physician,hesdorffer.
later in evidence of fraud discredited the bezwoda study.in addition,the principal study showing little or no benefit from hdct,the stadtmauer study,had gained greater acceptance in the oncology community.this new information caused wolinsky to again convene the tac.at a meeting in march,diana lake of sloan kettering memorial hospital presented the results of three randomized phase iii studies of the use of hdct in stage iv breast cancer patients the philadelphia trial involved in the stadtmauer article,a french trial,and a study at duke university.the french trial showed a overall survival rate of in the hdct group versus in the control group.the duke study,on the other hand,showed a survival rate of in the hdct patients versus in the control group.the stadtmauer study,which considered the largest population of patients,showed no significant difference in overall survival and mortality between the control group and the hdct group.based on lake presentation,the tac determined to initially deny coverage for hdct for metastatic breast cancer.
wolinsky also testified that at the time of the march tac decision,he was aware of asco position that because there was a lack of persuasive data demonstrating superior effectiveness of hdct,that treatment should only be performed in the context of a high quality clinical trial.he denied that cost played any role in determining whether a treatment was of proven benefit or considered effective or appropriate by the medical community.
since the march tac meeting,empire has denied three of the four requests it received for coverage of hdct.it also initially denied coverage to the fourth applicant,a woman whose cancer was not as advanced as zervos cancer,but reversed its position after receiving a letter from an outside reviewer stating that hdct was as effective for this woman condition as conventional chemotherapy and was the best possible treatment for her because it would be administered in a well designed and randomized clinical trial.the appellate decision to grant coverage was made by empire downs,not wolinsky.
iv.empire action on zervos request 
empire denied hesdorffer request for coverage for zervos on october,because autologous peripheral stem cell is experimental and investigational in breast cancer stage iv.zervos physician appealed,and empire sent zervos records along with a list of questions to thomas spitzer,director of the bone marrow transplant program and deputy chief of the unit at massachussetts general hospital.spitzer indicated,based on available data,that hdct would not improve zervos health outcome however,he also said that h igh dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation appears to be as effective as prolonged combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.a possible benefit of high dose chemotherapy is the avoidance of a protracted course of continuous combination chemotherapy.finally,spitzer indicated that hesdorffer study was well designed.
in reviewing spitzer answers,wolinsky ignored spitzer assertion that hdct was as beneficial as any other treatment because,in wolinsky view,spitzer other answers demonstrated that hdct had not been proven to be beneficial.wolinsky assumed that spitzer had overlooked the toxicity portion of a proven benefit analysis.on october,wolinsky sent zervos a notice reaffirming the initial denial and stating 
there are no convincing data to show that high dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral stem cell transplant is superior to conventional chemotherapy alone for males with metastatic breast cancer.the autologous peripheral stem cell harvest and transplant remains denied as experimental and investigational.
after learning of empire denial,zervos received radiation treatments in an effort to stabilize his condition.as a result of those treatments and conventional chemotherapy,zervos cancer was in remission as of the end of february,and he was eligible to receive hdct in hesdorffer study.
initial district court proceedings 
on january,zervos filed a complaint against empire and verizon in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and moved for a preliminary injunction directing empire to cover the cost of hdct.zervos claimed that empire discriminated against him based on his disability and gender and that its denial of coverage was arbitrary and capricious and thus violated the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.three days after zervos began his lawsuit,the request of a second medical opinion from an mcop outside reviewer,raymond weiss.weiss said that t here is no published evidence that indicates hdct for men with metastatic breast cancer is any more beneficial than any other form of chemotherapy and that hesdorffer study was not well designed.
the district court denied zervos request for a preliminary injunction,finding that his evidence failed to demonstrate irreparable injury because he did not show that hdct would improve his likelihood of survival and that defendants reasonably concluded hdct was experimental and investigational.zervos i,wl,at.
vi.the first appeal 
we affirmed the district court order.we agreed that zervos failed to establish that he had a likelihood of success on any of his claims including the erisa claim,at least insofar as he premised that claim on the administrative record presented to the district court.zervos ii,at.we noted,however,that 
our decision does not necessarily mean that zervos may not be able to develop a successful federal claim zervos may be able to establish that,under the plan,the focus of an arbitrary and capricious inquiry should not be on empire initial decision to deny coverage for is,the decision that empire made after the tac meeting.rather,zervos may be able to show that judicial review here should focus on the final,definitive decision to deny coverage which was all but made by an external reviewer that in this case that decision was the one communicated to zervos by letter dated october,and that that decision was arbitrary and capricious because it was based on a material misunderstanding of what is meant under the plan by the term.compare the plan at defining as services which are not of proven benefit for the treatment of the covered person condition,or are not generally recognized by the medical community as effective or appropriate for that condition with letter from empire to zervos,we are unable to authorize hdct for the following reason there are no convincing data to show that hdct is superior to conventional chemotherapy alone for males with metastatic breast cancer.hdct remains denied as experimental and investigational.
id.at footnote omitted.we also cautioned that i n this it may ultimately can tolerate no substantial delays.id.at.
during the pendency of the appeal,zervos unfortunately suffered a recurrence of his metastatic disease,making him ineligible to receive hdct.a new course of chemotherapy did not reduce the size of the metastatic lesions,which now were in his lung.however,another experimental course of chemotherapy begun in may substantially improved zervos condition.zervos had significant complications from this treatment,including damage to the right lung.
vii.proceedings on remand 
on july,two days after testing that established zervos renewed eligibility to participate in the hesdorffer protocol,zervos renewed his request for a preliminary injunction and asked to combine that application with a trial on the merits.at a conference on august,the district court denied zervos request for an accelerated trial because defendants had made a summary judgment motion.the court heard oral argument on the summary judgment motion on september.on october,the first date of the scheduled trial,judge daniels granted empire motion for summary judgment dismissing zervos ada claim but refused to dismiss his erisa claim.
during the trial,the district court heard testimony from the key players in the formation of empire policy on hdct and from the doctors who played a role in reviewing zervos initial claim and internal appeal.in addition,weiss and several expert witnesses offered their opinions.at the conclusion of the trial,on october,the district court stated that it intended to issue a decision early the following week.however,on october,judge daniels chambers called zervos attorney and asked whether zervos could wait for a decision until the following week.the attorney replied that based on zervos physician advice and the strong likelihood of an appeal to this court by the party,zervos could not wait for a decision beyond october.on october,chambers staff advised zervos that the court had not yet reached a decision and asked how much longer zervos would be eligible to receive hdct.the following day zervos submitted a declaration from hesdorffer who stated that zervos remained eligible for hdct but that within the past month his cancer markers had increased slightly,indicating that the disease was about to bounce back.hesdorffer also said 
u nless the treatment is administered to zervos by the end of october,there is a grave risk that his metastatic disease will return,as it did in march of this year,and he will again become ineligible to receive the treatment.this time,however,because tumor cells develop resistance to chemotherapy with each course of therapy,the chance of finding another that will yield another response sufficient to make him eligible for the treatment a third time is remote at best w ithout hdct,zervos treatment options going forward are fairly limited,and his prognosis,based just on continuing with his current treatment,would be severely limited because there is a limit to the amount of his current treatment that he can ultimately tolerate.
on october,the district court issued two memorandum opinions and orders the first gave the court reasons for dismissing the ada claim,and the second addressed the erisa claim without specifically addressing zervos renewed request for a preliminary injunction.in his second decision,judge daniels found that empire decision to stop covering hdct was not arbitrary and capricious empire initial decision to deny coverage for zervos hdct was not arbitrary and capricious but empire appellate process was conducted in an arbitrary and capricious manner because the questions asked did not directly relate to policy terms and were confusing,wolinsky weighed the answers to the same question by different reviewers inconsistently,and empire sometimes,but not always,covered treatment.zervos verizon new york,wl,at,zervos iii.the court remanded the case to empire for an immediate expedited review within hours of plaintiff submission of current relevant information.id.at.it directed that empire ask a new mcop reviewer to answer questions that elicit a clear and unequivocal response regarding whether the treatment is of proven benefit or generally recognized by the medical community as effective or appropriate.id.at.judge daniels further ordered that the new reviewer be clearly and directly asked whether there is any other medical or clinical reason that the patient should receive the treatment despite its nature.id.the court neither explicitly retained jurisdiction nor explicitly directed the entry of judgment.
viii.the second appeal 
upon receipt of the district court opinion and order,zervos immediately filed a notice of appeal and a motion requesting that we consider that portion of the appeal that contested the appropriateness of the remand on an expedited basis and issue a decision no later than october.the motion was granted,and chief judge walker referred the appeal to this panel.empire from the district court order to the extent that it found empire appellate process to have been arbitrary and capricious.we heard oral argument on october,after which the panel directed the parties to appear before a camp mediator.the settlement discussion failed.on october,judge jacobs issued an order reversing the district court order and directing the entry of an injunction requiring that empire cover the cost of hdct for zervos judge daniels promptly entered an order in compliance with this directive.
on october,empire moved for a stay and for recall of the mandate,and zervos informed the court that empire declined to obey judge daniels order.we unanimously denied empire motion.
zervos asserts that we have jurisdiction of his appeal pursuant to a because the district court,in effect,denied his request for immediate injunctive relief.empire argues that we lack appellate jurisdiction because the district court did not make a final determination on the request for injunctive relief.on the merits,zervos argues that the district court abused its discretion in remanding the case to a plan administrator instead of entering an injunction ordering treatment.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
section a gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction of appeals from i nterlocutory orders of the district courts granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.a.a party may appeal from an order that does not explicitly deny an injunction if it has the practical effect of denying injunctive relief and it has a serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.carson am.brands,d internal quotation marks omitted.in carson,the supreme court held that the court of appeals had jurisdiction over an appeal from a district court order declining to approve a settlement agreement because the order to proceed to trial deprived the plaintiffs of the advantages the settlement agreement conferred,which included immediate injunctive relief.id.at.the court found that these combined circumstances constitute d serious,perhaps irreparable consequences that petitioners can effectually challenge only by an immediate appeal.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.we also have found that we had jurisdiction over an appeal from an interlocutory order that dismissed without leave to amend particular counts on which the plaintiff sought injunctive relief because the denial of injunctive relief pending appeal from a final judgment was likely to have a serious and irreparable impact upon the plaintiffs ability to compete.volvo am.men int l prof l tennis council,cir.
in this case,we find that the practical effect of the district court refusal to order immediate injunctive relief,despite an established violation of erisa the fact that the district court issued its order at a time when the plaintiff cancer could recur at any day and our earlier recognition that time was of the essence,was an effective denial of the plaintiff request for injunctive relief.time has always been a critical factor in this case.as early as june of last year when the plaintiff had not established his erisa claim,we instructed that justice would not tolerate any further substantial delays.then in october,hesdorffer generally predicted that the plaintiff might become ineligible for hdct treatment if it was not administered approximately by the end of october.thus,the record shows that when the district court entered its order towards the end of october,any further delays would increase the risk that the plaintiff would become ineligible for the relief sought.
of course the presence of time pressure alone is insufficient to establish that the district court remand was an effective denial of the plaintiff request for relief.for example,even in cases where time is of the essence,a remand is probably not a final determination when the district court is unable to determine whether there has been a violation of erisa because of an incomplete record.but in this case,the record was sufficiently complete for the district court to find that the appeals process was arbitrary and capricious.as we discuss below at iii,the record also supported coverage for zervos.thus,the main purpose the remand served was to give the defendants an opportunity to remedy their defective appeals process.even assuming that the defendants ordinarily should be allowed this opportunity,here the remand essentially decided that the plaintiff,who had established the predicate condition for relief,and whose cancer could recur at any time,would not receive the treatment for another week or two.we hold that because zervos established that the appeals process was arbitrary and capricious both procedurally and,as we discuss below,substantively,and his request for relief could be rendered moot before he received relief,the delay triggered by the remand effectively denied injunctive relief.
moreover,plaintiff established that this effective denial had a serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.the denial is serious because each delay meant that there was a risk that zervos would become ineligible for hdct.and it is perhaps irreparable because the hesdorffer declaration established that zervos probably has run out of conventional treatment options based on the increase in his cancer markers,the toxicity of his current treatment,and the increasing resistance of his cancer to conventional treatments.at this juncture,hdct may well be the only effective or appropriate treatment available to zervos.
consequently,we find that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.we stress,however,that this holding is limited to the exigent and unique circumstances of this case.we do not reach the issue of whether a remand to a plan administrator is a final judgment within the meaning of and we do not suggest that a district court order granting a remand rather than the preliminary injunctive relief that a party requested ordinarily would be appealable immediately pursuant to section a.
ii.standard of review and definition of the record 
the parties agree that empire had discretion to interpret the provisions of the plan it administered.therefore,reviewing courts can disturb empire interpretations and actions only if they are arbitrary and capricious.miller united welfare fund,cir.a decision is arbitrary and capricious if it is without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.because this standard is highly deferential,we have said that the trial court should not conduct a de novo hearing on a rejected applicant eligibility for benefits.miles new york state teamsters conference pension and retirement fund employee pension benefit plan,cir.we also have implied that the district court should not accept information from the insurer that was not part of the original record unless the insured is instrumental in causing the information to be added to the record.see zuckerbrod phoenix mut.life ins,cir.even where the district court exercises de novo review of the plan administrator determination,the district court ought not to accept additional evidence absent good cause.defelice american int l life assurance of ny,cir.
we review de novo the district court assessment of the plan administrator decision.miller,at.
zervos argues that the district court should have conducted,and we must conduct,a review limited to the administrative record and thus not consider the testimony of empire experts and of weiss.in light of miles,zuckerbrod,and defelice,we agree that our review must be limited to evidence that was before empire when it determined in march that it would deny coverage for hdct,denied zervos coverage on october,or rejected zervos appeal on october.although the incompleteness of an administrative record certain good cause for hearing additional evidence,the record before empire at the time it made the october,decision was not incomplete.rather,empire followed the steps in handling zervos application and appeal that it followed for any other insured up to and including its solicitation of spitzer opinion.the additional information that empire obtained after zervos filed this lawsuit appears to be aimed at bolstering its legal position and not at providing fuller review of zervos claim.therefore,we limit our review of empire decision to the administrative record as it is described by the testimony of wolinsky and by the minutes of the tac meeting.this record includes the written submissions of spitzer and hesdorffer made prior to october.
iii.the merits 
for purposes of this appeal,neither party questions either the tac initial decision to deny coverage for hdct to insureds with metastatic breast cancer or wolinsky october,initial denial of coverage to zervos.therefore,we have no cause to review these determinations,and,in any case,little basis to question them.the studies before the tac reasonably could be read to establish that hdct did not provide a survival benefit over long term conventional chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer.these studies also demonstrated that although hdct conveyed approximately the same survival benefit as very long term conventional chemotherapy,it had more side effects and more serious side effects.the evidence that the tac considered,and particularly asco view that hdct is appropriate in the context of a well designed clinical trial,also supports zervos contention that hdct can be appropriate for individual patients in the context of a well designed clinical trial.the tac took all of this evidence into account by determining to initially deny coverage but to allow coverage if an external reviewer found hdct was appropriate for an individual patient.
thus,we focus our review on the correctness of the district court conclusion that empire appellate process functioned in an arbitrary and capricious manner and the appropriateness of remand rather than injunctive relief as a remedy.
we agree that empire appellate process was arbitrary and capricious,primarily because wolinsky required that a treatment be superior to another existing treatment in order to avoid exclusion under the policy language while the language itself requires only that the treatment be more effective than considered to be appropriate by the relevant medical community.thus,contrary to basic erisa principles,wolinsky in effect added additional language to the policy.see,gallo madera,cir even when trustees of a pension plan are entitled to deference in interpreting the terms of the plan,deference can not be so broad as to permit them to graft additional requirements onto unambiguous plan definitions.wolinsky also acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by refusing to consider spitzer opinion that hdct would benefit zervos as much as conventional chemotherapy.wolinsky testified that the question which produced spitzer favorable response was one of the three which ordinarily carr ied the most weight.because wolinsky basis for rejecting spitzer answer was his unfounded assumption that spitzer had not considered side effects,it was completely lacking in reason.
having adopted the district court view that empire internal appellate process was arbitrary and capricious at least as applied to zervos,we review the district court choice to remand rather than grant injunctive relief for abuse of discretion.see kinek paramount,cir see also halpin grainger,cir reviewing district court choice of remedy for an erisa violation for abuse of discretion.we find that remand in this case was an abuse of discretion.
first,a remand of an erisa action seeking benefits is inappropriate where the difficulty is not that the administrative record was incomplete but that a denial of benefits based on the record was unreasonable.zuckerbrod,at.on october,when wolinsky denied zervos appeal,the evidence in the record did not support a denial.the materials that the tac considered established that hdct and conventional chemotherapy produced essentially the same survival benefit hdct had greater but shorter side effects than repeated cycles of conventional chemotherapy and hdct can be an appropriate therapy only if it is administered in a clinical trial.although zervos did not establish that the trial in which he would participate was of high quality when he made his initial application,the spitzer letter unequivocally stated that the trial was of high quality and that the treatment would be effective and appropriate for zervos.moreover,wolinsky assumption that spitzer failed to consider side effects when he said hdct was as effective as conventional chemotherapy was completely lacking in reason because spitzer specifically referred to the lesser duration of side effects with hdct.because the record was complete and it supported coverage for zervos treatment,we find that the substance of the plan administrator appellate decision also was arbitrary and capricious.
in addition,the remand order was arbitrary and capricious because it did not adequately address the time constraints zervos faced.any delay necessitated by a remand could effectively deny justice in this case,as we observed over half a year earlier even before the plaintiff had established a violation of erisa.because there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the denial of benefits was unreasonable and the record establishes that each day mattered,the district court remand,which served primarily to give the defendants an opportunity to retool a defective system,was an abuse of discretion.here the administrative record did not contain substantial evidence supporting a denial of benefits and in fact could only be read to support granting coverage.therefore,remand was an inappropriate remedy,and the district court should have reversed the determination to deny benefits and directed empire to provide the requested coverage.
conclusion 
because empire argument that the district court conclusion that its appellate process was arbitrary and capricious lacks merit empire decision to deny benefits was also substantively erroneous and seen in the light of the exigency of zervos situation,the flaws in the appellate process,and the lack of support in the record for empire decision,the remand order was an abuse of discretion,the order of the district court is reversed.by our order of october,we have directed the district court to order empire to provide the requested coverage.
i respectfully dissent.in my view,the district court recognized and applied the settled principles that govern this controversy,and was proceeding with admirable dispatch and thoroughness to decide the case.the majority has preempted the district court exercise of discretion,impeached without record support the good faith of the plan administrator,excluded from consideration virtually all the record facts that bear upon the question of medical coverage,and decided the case in a way that illustrates why judicial deference is properly owed to doctors and plan administrators in matters of medical insurance.
i write at some length in order to demonstrate that although the result in this case is wrong,the governing principles are left intact.indeed,this case shows what happens when the patterns of deference mandated by precedent are suspended,even for supposedly unique facts and circumstances,and medical decisions are made by judges who i say with respect have no more medical expertise than i do.the result is that the majority deems arbitrary and capricious a refusal to pay for a treatment the supposed efficacy of which rests on a study acknowledged to be a scientific fraud.
nickolas zervos,who suffers from metastatic stage iv breast cancer,seeks coverage for a medical treatment that involves a single cycle of chemotherapy followed by an autologous blood stem cell transplant hdct.the largest and most phase iii randomized clinical study comparing hdct with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic stage iv breast cancer determined that hdct provides no survival benefit over conventional chemotherapy,hdct actually produces a survival disadvantage for patients such as zervos who are over age,and hdct is significantly more toxic than conventional chemotherapy.see edward stadtmauer et,chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy plus autologous hematopoietic transplantation for metastatic breast cancer,new eng.med.reporting the results of the national cancer study the stadtmauer study.multiple other phase iii,randomized studies have confirmed these finding.
as the majority opinion concedes majority op.at,the only phase iii study to find a survival benefit for bezwoda been exposed as a fraud.
in march the american society of clinical oncology warned given the lack of persuasive data demonstrating superior effectiveness of this very toxic therapy,hdct for breast cancer should only be performed in the context of a high quality clinical trial.see chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant for breast cancer patients,at http march emphasis added.ecri,a health services research institution that studies healthcare technology and healthcare risk,has similarly cautioned that use of hdct should be confined to national cancer randomized phase iii controlled clinical trials.medicare no longer provides coverage of hdct for the treatment of breast cancer.according to testimony at trial,the treatment is no longer offered at memorial sloan kettering hospital and mount sinai medical center in new york and the cancer institute and brigham women hospital in of the world most prestigious cancer institutes.
the columbia journalism review recently cited favorable news coverage about hdct as a horrible example of how lazy reporters can be gulled by and quackery 
throughout the,some women underwent hdct there was no proof that the procedure arrested the disease.in fact,two years ago,results from four clinical trials gave the definitive answer it did not work.

the legal principles governing this case are settled and can be stated briefly.
where,as here,an insurance plan gives its administrator broad discretion to construe the terms of the plan and to determine whether a claimant is entitled to payment of benefits,a court may reverse the administrator decision only if it is arbitrary and capricious.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d zuckerbrod phoenix mut.life ins.a decision is arbitrary and capricious if it is without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.pagan nynex pension plan,cir internal quotations marks omitted.substantial evidence is defined as such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion reached by the administrator and requires more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.miller united welfare fund,cir internal quotations marks omitted.a court is not not free to substitute its own judgment for that of the plan administrator as if it were considering the issue of eligibility anew.pagan,at.while we review de novo the district court assessment of the plan administrator decision,in so doing we must review the administrator decision itself under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see miller,at.and if the defect is insufficiency,the appropriate remedy is a remand 
i f upon review a district court concludes that the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious,it must remand to the administrator with instructions to consider additional evidence unless no new evidence could produce a reasonable conclusion permitting denial of the claim 
the district court findings of fact may not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.see zuckerbrod,at.we review a district court fashioning of the decision to an abuse of discretion standard.see kinek paramount communications,cir.a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon new york,cir zervos ii.
under the terms of the plan covering zervos,empire excludes coverage of procedures that are,which is defined as services or supplies which are not of proven benefit for the diagnosis or treatment of the covered person condition,or are not generally recognized by the medical community as effective or appropriate for that condition,as determined by the claims administrator.in this case,empire considers the relevant medical community to be the general community of academic oncologists.the term proven benefit,which is not further defined in the policy,is construed by empire to mean that what must be proven is a positive net health,the efficacy of the treatment balanced by the toxicity and whether that net positive health effect compares favorably with other standard treatments.
for much of the,empire provided coverage for hdct as a treatment for breast cancer.at a meeting of empire technology assessment committee tac in march,however,empire determined that hdct as a treatment for breast cancer should be as under the terms of the policy.empire principally based this decision on the various studies listed above that found i no survival benefit for hdct over conventional chemotherapy and ii significantly greater toxicity.
empire decision to reclassify hdct as for the treatment of breast cancer is unchallenged in this case the majority concedes that t he studies before the tac reasonably could be read to establish that hdct did not provide a survival benefit over long term conventional chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer and also demonstrated that it had more side effects and more serious side effects.majority op.at.
six months after this change in policy,zervos applied for coverage of hdct for the treatment of his metastatic breast cancer.consistent with the policy it had adopted,empire responded to zervos by denying coverage autologous peripheral stem cell is experimental and investigational in breast cancer stage iv.
at the request of zervos treating physician,empire submitted its decision to an external review.empire refers external reviews to an unaffiliated organization,the medical care ombudsmen program mcop,which selects reviewers on a rotating basis according to the reviewer specialty,clinical experience,and availability.empire plays no role in selecting the reviewer.
empire submits to mcop a series of questions the purpose of which is to elicit the reviewer expert opinion about the current state of the medical literature and about whether the treatment is generally recognized as effective or appropriate for a given patient.the reviewer is not expected to be an expert on the contract or on how the language of the contract applies.empire then examines the answers provided by the reviewer within the context of the policy language and makes a coverage decision.before the review process begins,the treating physician is asked to submit any literature or information he or she would like considered on the appeal.
mcop assigned zervos case to thomas spitzer,director of the bone marrow transplant program at massachusetts general hospital and deputy chief of its unit.asked,does the scientific evidence support a result of improvement in health outcome spitzer answered,no and after outlining the various studies mentioned above,he explained t he conclusions of the stadtmauer study have been widely accepted by the oncology community,and many have advocated abandonment of this therapy as standard of care for metastatic breast cancer.asked,is this a well designed study for which the patient is a good candidate spitzer answered,unable to respond and then added that,while the proposed research protocol is a well designed phase ii study evaluating hdct for metastatic breast cancer,t he protocol title refers to hdct support in women.thus,it is not clear whether zervos is eligible for the study that was enclosed for my review.emphasis in original asked,is the recommended treatment plan the best treatment plan available for this patient at this time spitzer answered,no he then explained there are no convincing data to show that hdct is a superior approach to conventional chemotherapy alone for male patients with metastatic breast cancer.
the only answer given by spitzer that is arguably supportive of hdct is in response to the question is the technology as beneficial as any of the established alternatives spitzer explained that hdct appears to be as effective as prolonged combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.a possible benefit of hdct is the avoidance of a protracted course of continuous combination chemotherapy.the majority wholly relies on this one question and answer,ignoring all of spitzer other responses.
empire considered spitzer answers in light of its view that a proven benefit is a positive net health effect and that the relevant medical community for this case is the general community of academic oncologists.empire again determined that zervos claim should be denied as,and so advised zervos by letter dated october,which quoted spitzer finding that t here are no convincing data to show that hdct is superior to conventional chemotherapy alone for males with metastatic breast cancer.
zervos commenced this litigation on january,seeking a preliminary injunction ordering empire to cover the cost of hdct.after the suit was filed,verizon zervos employer and the payor on the policy asked empire to submit zervos case for a second review.where as here erisa applies,empire always complies when an employer makes such a request.
this time,mcop designated raymond weiss,a clinical professor of medicine and breast cancer specialist at the lombardi cancer center of georgetown university.after outlining the various studies alluded to above,weiss stated that m ost oncologist are of the opinion at this time that transplant therapy is of unproven efficacy and that those who remain convinced of its efficacy are in a distinct minority among oncologists.moreover,weiss observed,the clinical study in which zervos wishes to participate is identified as a study for women,not men.emphasis in original entering a single male who is ineligible for such a study would be considered inappropriate science by most clinicians.weiss conclusion was categorical 
there is absolutely no justification for treating such a patient under this protocol as part of a scientific study,and even more so,there is no scientific justification for treating him with such therapy at all,within or outside any clinical trial.i could perhaps be convinced of the scientific validity of such treatment if he were to be entered on a trial for which he is eligible,one using an innovative therapy,and one focused on stage iv disease.however,this is not the case on all three points.
finally,asked whether the clinical study is a well designed study for which this patient is a good candidate,weiss answered,no,and added 
zervos is not eligible for a study in which women are to be treated in the manner proposed,and there is no evidence that hdct provides a net benefit for women with metastatic breast cancer either.the protocol provided with the records of this patient is a phase ii protocol for women with any stage of breast cancer there is nothing innovative about this protocol,and i do not consider it a well designed study.
once again,empire sent notice to zervos informing him that his claim was denied,quoting many passages from weiss report.
on october,the district court found that empire decision to deny coverage for hdct for breast cancer was based on substantial evidence and is not arbitrary and capricious.zervos verizon new york,wl,at,zervos iii.but the court concluded that empire appeals process was arbitrary and capricious,principally because none of the questions posed to the reviewers are direct questions that elicit a clear and unequivocal response regarding whether the treatment is of proven benefit or generally recognized by the medical community as effective or appropriate for the condition.id.at.nevertheless,the district court held that,
based on the administrative record,this court can not find that the treatment is not as defined in the contract or that there is some other medical or clinical reason that the patient should receive this treatment.this is still a medical determination to be made by a full and fair review by medical experts based on the current state of the medical literature and plaintiff current medical condition and suitability for the proposed treatment.
the district court therefore remanded for the supplementation of the record that it deemed crucial.such a remand is the proper step to take under the principles enunciated by this court in miller i f upon review a district court concludes that the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious,it must remand to the administrator with instructions to consider additional evidence unless no new evidence could produce a reasonable conclusion permitting denial of the claim at.the remand order directed empire to conduct an immediate and accelerated mcop review within hours of zervos submission of current relevant information,the review to include direct questions that elicit a clear and unequivocal response regarding whether the treatment is of proven benefit or generally recognized by the medical community as effective or appropriate as well as whether there is any other medical or clinical reason that the patient should receive the treatment despite its nature.zervos iii,at.the district court signaled that t he totality of the evidence presented does not convince this court that a different determination is necessarily likely or appropriate.however,plaintiff is entitled to a full and fair review.id.
the third mcop review as ordered by the district court was completed on october,days after the district court issued its order and four days before this court heard oral argument on this expedited appeal.this time,mcop designated joyce,a board certified medical oncologist whose primary areas of expertise include high dose chemotherapy for breast and ovarian cancer.asked,is the proposed treatment of proven benefit for the treatment of the patient condition answered,no,adding 
i believe that the available data permit us to conclude that there is no proven clinical benefit associated with hdct compared with standard therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer.the morbidity and mortality of hdct are greater than that associated with standard therapy.hdct does not represent accepted standard care for patients with metastatic breast cancer and is not medically necessary.
asked whether the proposed treatment is generally recognized by the medical community as effective or appropriate for the patient condition,answered,no,adding most medical oncologists feel that hdct is ineffective therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer in general,and for patients like zervos,in particular,who have largely and metastatic breast cancer.she warned i believe that hdct could even be harmful for zervos because he is unlikely to benefit,to achieve a durable remission of his disease,and hdct is substantially more toxic than treatment with conventional chemotherapy agents for metastatic breast cancer.finally,in response to the question if your answer to either of the first two questions is no,is there any other medical or clinical reason that the patient should receive the treatment,despite its nature answered i believe zervos should not receive the proposed hdct because it is highly unlikely to benefit him,and,due to its associated toxicity,may even be harmful i do not think there is a medical or clinical reason for him to receive this therapy.
the district court therefore did what we have mandated i f upon review a district court concludes that the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious,it must remand to the administrator with instructions to consider additional evidence unless no new evidence could produce a reasonable conclusion permitting denial of the claim miller,at.it is certainly hard going for the majority to decide in this case that no new evidence could produce a reasonable conclusion permitting denial of the claim as it happens,the third review,ordered by the district court and rendered before this court hearing of this appeal,was new evidence albeit confirmatory of the earlier medical evidence and did support a reasonable conclusion permitting denial of the claim.
the majority opinion deals with this embarrassment by ruling that the only relevant coverage issue was settled by a single answer given by spitzer to a single question,and that therefore the no supplementation.majority,at citing zuckerbrod phoenix mut.life ins,cir finding a remand to the administrator inappropriate where the difficulty is not that the administrative record was incomplete but that a denial of benefits based on the record was unreasonable.
after thus shrinking the administrative record in this case to a few lines,the majority declares that it can only be read to support granting coverage.majority op.at.
this ruling is premised on several errors.first,the majority reads the policy to furnish any medical procedure that is effective regardless of the toxicity of the treatment.second,the majority truncates the record to omit everything other than spitzer single isolated response.third,the majority rules that the remand order was an abuse of discretion because the district court failed to act with the dispatch required by the medical exigency.id.
the policy wording 
to repeat,the district court ruled that empire appellate process was arbitrary and capricious principally because the questions posed to the reviewers did not track the wording of the exclusion,and therefore according to the district court the answers elicited by these questions did not settle the issue of whether hdct fell under the terms of the exclusion.accordingly,the district court concluded that the record was incomplete and remanded for its completion.
the majority opinion agrees that the appeals process was arbitrary and capricious a point i do not consider,but for a different reason.if the majority agreed that the record was incomplete,the majority would be hard pressed to ignore categorical opinion rendered on remand.instead,the majority finds that the record was in fact complete because the only record evidence that matters is spitzer answer to a single question hdct appears to be as effective as prolonged combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.the majority holds that empire appellate process was arbitrary and capricious because it denied coverage notwithstanding that response 
empire required that a treatment be superior to another existing treatment in order to avoid exclusion under the policy language while the language itself requires only that the treatment be more effective than considered to be appropriate by the relevant medical community.thus,contrary to basic erisa principles,empire in effect added additional language to the policy.
majority op.at citing gallo madera,cir even when trustees of a pension plan are entitled to deference in interpreting the terms of the plan,deference can not be so broad as to permit them to graft additional requirements onto unambiguous plan definitions.
the majority misreads the policy language and fails to give deference to empire reasonable interpretation of it.the actual wording of the policy requires a treatment to be of proven benefit for the claimant condition and to be generally recognized by the medical community as effective or appropriate for that condition.the term proven benefit is not,and lends itself to interpretation.and empire as the plan administrator is entitled to deference in interpreting the terms of the plan.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d miller,at.
empire interprets proven benefit as a proven positive net health,the efficacy of the treatment balanced by the toxicity and whether that net positive health effect compares favorably with other standard treatments.emphasis added the district court concluded that this is a natural reading of the term 
medically,a treatment can not be said to be of proven benefit where its toxicity or side effects outweigh the benefits gained from the treatment.moreover,a treatment can not be said to be of proven benefit where it merely matches the benefits gained from other treatments,but exposes patients to greater harm and potential death.
zervos iii,wl,at.weiss concurred at his deposition if the outcome,the overall survival is the same,yet the treatment is more toxic,you do want to use the more toxic therapy because there is no gain for the cost.zervos own expert witness also agrees if the costs in terms of higher morbidity and mortality rates are much greater,but the benefits are only shown to be slightly greater,then it totally appropriate not to give that treatment over standard therapy.zervos ex.f at 
hdct is a treatment so invasive and verges so closely on killing the patient that the netting out of risks is no minor miscalculation in medicine,as in virtually everything else,a calculation of benefit entails the netting out of the pluses and minuses.otherwise,the concept of benefit becomes absurd if medical benefit were a matter of pure efficacy,regardless of detriment,amputation would be deemed a beneficial therapy for athlete foot.
empire therefore is not graft ing additional requirements onto unambiguous plan definitions.gallo,at.this case is distinguishable from gallo,on which the majority relies.in gallo,the insurance company attempted to add a clause to the eligibility section of a pension plan the insurance company did not claim to be interpreting a provision of that section,but instead wanted to import the clause from another unrelated section.gallo,at.
truncation of the record 
the majority key ruling is that the administrative record in this case can only be read to support granting coverage.majority op.at.in defense of this ruling,the majority has excluded from the record all of what weiss and had to say,has ignored or misinterpreted most of what spitzer had to say,and has seemingly forgotten that empire decision to end funding for hdct was supported by extensive medical learning and is unchallenged.
the majority excludes the second and third mcop reviews from the administrative record on the ground that empire procured these additional reviews to bolster its legal position rather than to provide a fuller review of zervos claim.majority op.at.there simply is no factual support for the idea that,if either review had recommended hdct for zervos condition,empire would have disregarded this recommendation and denied the claim.it is undisputed that the second mcop review by weiss was conducted because verizon asked for it,and empire testified that it always complies with such requests from the claimant employer and the third mcop review by was conducted pursuant to the order of the district court.these second opinions were thus conducted at the behest of the employer who would pay the bill and the district court which could order the bill paid.
these reviews were therefore part of an on
