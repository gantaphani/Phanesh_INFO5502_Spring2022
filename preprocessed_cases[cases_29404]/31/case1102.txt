this case presents the question of how a district court should apply the abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a decision by the administrator of an employee benefits plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,when that administrator has a conflict of interest.we conclude that a reviewing court must take into account the conflict and that this necessarily entails a more complex application of the abuse of discretion standard.specifically,a modicum of evidence in the record supporting the administrator decision will not alone suffice in the face of such a conflict,since this more traditional application of the abuse of discretion standard allows no room for weighing the extent to which the administrator decision may have been motivated by improper considerations.
robert montour appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of hartford life and accident insurance company in his action challenging hartford decision to terminate his disability benefits as an abuse of its discretion.we reverse and,applying the proper standard of review to the facts of this case,conclude that hartford abused its discretion because its conflict of interest too heavily influenced its termination decision.accordingly,we remand to the district court for an order reinstating montour disability benefits.
background 
as an employee of conexant systems,for approximately years,montour participated in his employer group disability insurance plan,which is a welfare benefit plan governed by erisa.hartford is both the insurer and the administrator of the plan.the plan grants hartford,as the administrator,discretionary authority to interpret plan terms and to determine eligibility for benefits and it places the burden of proving both initial and ongoing disability on the claimant.
in july montour took a medical leave of absence from his position as a telecommunications manager after developing symptoms of acute stress disorder.at the time,he was years old.in january,following a period of days during which no benefits were payable under the plan,hartford accepted montour application for benefits under the plan and began paying him disability benefits.
at the outset of his psychiatric illness,montour consulted several times with his primary care physician,samuel park.in september he began regular psychotherapy sessions with a psychiatrist.his last documented psychotherapy session took place in april.
meanwhile,in june montour consulted kenneth kengla,an orthopedic surgeon,about pain in his right knee and his lower back.kengla diagnosed montour with degenerative changes in both regions and notified hartford in september that montour was at that time also suffering from physical disability that prevented him from returning to the labor force.in october kengla performed arthroscopic surgery on montour right knee.the subject of montour back condition did not come up again during their consultations until april.subsequently,montour consulted kengla about his back pain during appointments in december and may.
kengla consistently maintained to hartford that montour remained physically disabled and unable to work in any job as a result of his back and knee impairments.specifically,he listed the following restrictions on montour physical activities no sitting for more than min utes at a time no prolonged walking no standing greater than min utes at a time no lifting or carrying greater than pounds no work at or above shoulder level no moderate pushing activities no moderate pulling activities and no driving greater than min utes at a time.
in november and december hartford hired two outside companies to conduct surveillance on montour over the course of four nonconsecutive days.video footage from this surveillance depicted montour driving his car to perform occasional errands,such as picking up his grandchildren from school,going to the pharmacy,and getting a haircut.he was observed once bending at the waist to reach into his car.
in march a hartford investigator conducted a personal interview with montour at his home,during which montour listed a bad back,an arthritic right knee,and sleep apnea as the disabling medical condition s preventing him from returning to work.he also described an inability to concentrate,which he attributed to the medication he must take to treat his constant pain.the investigator observed that montour remained alert and responsive during the entire hour interview,although he called the investigator by the wrong name about two hours into the interview.montour acknowledged that the surveillance video footage accurately depicted his level of functionality.he was physically able to complete the interview,but he demonstrated signs of pain in front of the investigator,such as moaning when he stood up or twisted,walking around his house stiffly with a slight limp,and complaining of back pain three times during the final two hours.
in may a hartford nurse case manager submitted letters to kengla and park surmising that montour was capable of performing sedentary to light work and soliciting their agreement.park signed and returned the letter,which signified that he either agreed or found no contraindications to this work capacity level.kengla,on the other hand,indicated that he disagreed with hartford conclusions,citing montour persistent orthopedic symptoms and physical restrictions.
in july hartford hired a consulting physician,gale brown,to conduct a file review.brown analyzed montour medical records for the period,including and mris of montour lower back taken in june and may,montour pharmacy records for the period,hartford surveillance video and accompanying reports,and the personal interview report.he also spoke with kengla on the phone.brown concluded that medical evidence supported the existence of a lower back condition called degenerative but that kengla offered restrictions were excessive for this mild to moderate condition and understated montour demonstrated and admitted physical abilities.brown acknowledged that medical evidence supported montour chronic pain but found that montour was nevertheless capable of working with modest restrictions,such as changing positions every thirty to minutes.
hartford next enlisted a vocational rehabilitation expert to compile an employability analysis report,which evaluated montour experience,qualifications,and the physical restrictions identified by brown.that expert concluded that montour was capable of working in a managerial capacity in five different fields.
in august hartford informed montour of its decision to terminate his benefits in light of its conclusion that he no longer met the policy definition of disability.montour appealed this decision internally and included a vocational appraisal report by gene bruno.the bruno report concluded that montour was not employable in any setting and that hartford decision was based on numerous mistakes,including a disregard for the fact that the social security administration ssa considered montour to be totally disabled.
in response,hartford hired renat sukhov to conduct a second file review.sukhov reviewed montour records for evidence of a physical condition that would preclude sedentary work and,like brown,found none.he noted in particular a lack of objective,clinical data demonstrating the extent to which montour pain impacted his functionality.he also noted that montour activities depicted on the surveillance videos exceed the activity requirements of a sedentary job.sukhov concluded that montour could work,at minimum,in a sedentary job with reasonable restrictions,such as avoiding static work posture,not lifting objects weighing more than twenty pounds,and not pushing or pulling loads weighing more than thirty to pounds.
in light of concerns raised in the bruno report,hartford also requested a vocational specialist to conduct an employability analysis report addendum,which reached the same conclusion as the employability analysis report regarding the sedentary nature and thus the feasibility of the five proposed managerial positions.in february a hartford appeal specialist affirmed the company previous decision to terminate montour benefits.
having exhausted his administrative remedies,in june montour and his wife,tina montour,filed suit against hartford in california superior court to recover benefits under erisa a b,a b.the complaint also alleged breach of fiduciary duty,promissory estoppel,invasion of privacy,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and loss of consortium.hartford removed the case to the central district of california and promptly moved to dismiss.the district court dismissed the causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and promissory estoppel,remanded the claims for invasion of privacy,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and loss of consortium back to state court,and proceeded to hold a bench trial on the administrative record for the remaining erisa benefits recovery claim.
in april the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law ordering judgment in favor of hartford.the district court concluded that although hartford had a structural conflict of interest in its position as both the administrator of the insurance policy and the payor of benefits,it did not abuse its discretion in determining that montour failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate disability within the meaning of the policy.
montour timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
the district court findings of fact in a bench trial on the administrative record are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.see pannebecker liberty life assurance of boston,cir see also kearney standard ins,cir en banc.in contrast,we review a district court choice and application of the appropriate standard for reviewing benefits decisions by an erisa plan administrator de novo.sznewajs bancorp amended restated supplemental benefits plan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
as for review of a plan administrator decision,t he supreme court has held that a denial of benefits is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.burke pitney bowes.disability plan,cir quoting firestone tire rubber bruch,d.where,as here,the plan does grant such discretionary authority,we review the administrator decision for abuse of discretion.saffon wells fargo.long term disability plan,cir.the manner in which a reviewing court applies the abuse of discretion standard,however,depends on whether the administrator has a conflicting interest.
in the absence of a conflict,judicial review of a plan administrator benefits determination involves a application of the abuse of discretion standard.see sznewajs,at boyd bert rozelle nfl players ret.plan,cir.in these circumstances,the plan administrator decision can be upheld if it is grounded on any reasonable basis.see sznewajs,at internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,where there is no risk of bias on the part of the administrator,the existence of a single persuasive medical opinion supporting the administrator decision can be sufficient to affirm,so long as the administrator does not construe the language of the plan unreasonably or render its decision without explanation.see boyd,at see also sznewajs at.
commonly,however,the same entity that funds an erisa benefits plan also evaluates claims,as is the case here.see metro.life ins.glenn,d metlife ii under these circumstances,the plan administrator faces a structural conflict of interest since it is also the insurer,benefits are paid out of the administrator own pocket,so by denying benefits,the administrator retains money for itself.application of the abuse of discretion standard therefore requires a more complex analysis.see abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc t he existence of a conflict of interest is relevant to how a court conducts abuse of discretion review.emphasis added.simply construing the terms of the underlying plan and scanning the record for medical evidence supporting the plan administrator decision is not enough,because a reviewing court must take into account the administrator conflict of interest as a factor in the analysis.see metlife ii.at,abatie,at.
more particularly,the court must consider numerous factors,including the administrator conflict of interest,and reach a decision as to whether discretion has been abused by weighing and balancing those factors together.see metlife ii.at describing the garden variety method of review.under this rubric,the extent to which a conflict of interest appears to have motivated an administrator decision is one among potentially many relevant factors that must be considered.other factors that frequently arise in the erisa context include the quality and quantity of the medical evidence,whether the plan administrator subjected the claimant to an medical evaluation or relied instead on a paper review of the claimant existing medical records,whether the administrator provided its independent experts with all of the relevant evidence,and whether the administrator considered a contrary ssa disability determination,if any see metlife ii.at see also saffon,at.
the weight the court assigns to the conflict factor depends on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.for example,the supreme court has explained that this factor 
should prove more important perhaps of great importance where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision,including,but not limited to,cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.it should prove less important perhaps to the vanishing point where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy,for example,by walling off claims administrators from those interested in firm finances,or by imposing management checks that penalize inaccurate decisionmaking irrespective of whom the inaccuracy benefits.
metlife ii.at internal citation omitted and emphases added see also abatie,at holding that in weighing a conflict of interest,the court discretionary review must be informed by the nature,extent,and effect that conflict may have had on the process.
our court has implemented this approach by including the existence of a conflict as a factor to be weighed,adjusting the weight given that factor based on the degree to which the conflict appears improperly to have influenced a plan administrator decision.see abatie,at see also nolan heald college,cir saffon,at.these cases should not be mistaken to imply that the existence of a conflict of interest alters the standard of review itself,rather than merely its application.as abatie explicitly held,if a conflict of interest exists,abuse of discretion review applies and that conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.in fact,abatie conscious ly reject ed the sliding scale metaphor that some other circuits had adopted,which involved adjusting the level of deference or scrutiny in the standard of review itself in proportion to the seriousness of the conflict.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at i n any given case,all the facts and circumstances must be considered,and nothing slides.this comports with the supreme court more recent pronouncement that a reviewing court should consider a conflict as a factor in determining whether the plan administrator has abused its discretion in denying benefits,and that the significance of the factor will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.metlife ii.at.
in any event,abatie explained that the court should adjust the level of skepticism with which it reviews a potentially biased plan administrator explanation for its decision in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the case.see at see also saffon,at.if those facts and circumstances indicate the conflict may have tainted the entire administrative decisionmaking process,the court should review the administrator stated bases for its decision with enhanced skepticism this is functionally equivalent to assigning greater weight to the conflict of interest as a factor in the overall analysis of whether an abuse of discretion occurred.
in clarifying the standard of review,abatie also abrogated a line of cases,including jordan northrop grumman corporation welfare benefit plan,cir,and bendixen standard insurance company,cir,that had directed reviewing courts to disregard structural conflicts of interest and affirm an administrative decision grounded on any reasonable basis,unless a plaintiff could produce sufficient evidence that the conflict was serious.see abatie,at.this more traditional application of the abuse of discretion standard allowed no room for a reviewing court to factor the existence of a conflict of interest into the analysis.see jordan,at bendixen,at.in the wake of abatie,therefore,the traditional application of administrative discretionary review that our court still applies in cases where no conflict exists does not apply to the review of a decision by an inherently conflicted plan administrator.see,sznewajs,at holding that u nder the deferential standard which courts must use to review the administrator interpretation in the absence of any evidence of conflict of interest,the plan administrator decision to deny benefits must be upheld under the abuse of discretion standard if it is based upon a reasonable interpretation of the plan terms and if it was made in good faith internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added.
for this reason,the district court reliance in this case on boyd,another decision in which there was apparently no evidence of a conflict of interest,was incorrect.see at.the district court acknowledged there were signs of bias in hartford determination but,applying boyd,deemed itself capable of reversing hartford decision as an abuse of discretion only if it found clear error in hartford determination that montour failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate his disability.emphasis added.while the district court found that hartford conflict of interest tainted much of the administrative decisionmaking process,its analysis of the plan administrator basis for terminating benefits does not include any discussion of the role that conflict of interest may have played in hartford decision nor appear to give that conflict any weight.metlife i,at.likewise,the court acknowledged the dissonance between the ssa disability determination and hartford contrary conclusion,but it does not appear to have given this factor adequate consideration or weighed it against other factors.instead,the court relied on boyd,a case involving no conflict and thus a less complex application of the abuse of discretion standard,to conclude that no abuse of discretion occurred because the record contained some medical evidence supporting hartford decision to deny benefits.in fact,the language of the district court decision suggests that because of that evidence,the court felt itself obliged to affirm,irrespective of any taint.after abatie,this is incorrect.
as the district court decision did not appropriately balance the pertinent factors,and in particular the conflict factor,we proceed to do so here.judicial review of an erisa plan administrator decision on the merits is limited to the administrative record so we are in the same position as the district court see moapa band of paiute indians dep t of interior,cir see also,e,ranchers cattlemen action legal fund united of am.dep t of,cir reaching the merits in a case requiring administrative record review because the court of appeals faced the same task as the district court did.therefore,while we accept the district court factual findings,we apply the standard of review de novo.see ramstad hodel,cir.
iii.the merits 
we begin with the district court comprehensive description of the signs of bias exhibited by hartford throughout its decisionmaking process 
hartford was both the plan administrator and funder of the plan,and evidence of this conflict of interest appears throughout the record.for example,in its letters to plaintiff,hartford overstates and overrelies on surveillance of plaintiff.plaintiff was observed over forty daylight hours on four days in november and december.during this time,he was observed making two twenty minute trips to pick up or drop off his grandchildren from school and one trip of about two and a half hours conducting errands at various stores.he was also observed to be away from his home on two occasions for about an hour and forty minutes.during this time,he was observed bending once at the waist and picking up a small bag of medication.
this observed activity was brief and consistent with plaintiff limitations.plaintiff admitted that he was able to drive for up to thirty minutes,could walk short distances,and could lift objects lighter than five pounds.yet hartford claimed that plaintiff limitations were not consistent with his observed activities.hartford strung together a laundry list of discrete activities observed over the course of four days,suggesting that plaintiff was capable of sustaining those activities throughout the day,as would be required in a sedentary occupation.however,that plaintiff could perform sedentary activities in bursts spread out over four days does not indicate that he is capable of sustaining activity in a occupation.
furthermore,despite its own internal observation that plaintiff walked in a slightly stiff and slow manner and entered his car in a somewhat slow and deliberate manner,hartford indicates that plaintiff did not show any limitation in his movement and demonstrated no sign of physical distress.this statement is also inconsistent with hartford report on the interview,which noted that plaintiff showed signs of pain and discomfort,moaning the majority of times that he stood or twisted.
hartford attempts to obtain information from plaintiff physicians were marred by this overstatement of the surveillance findings,as well as apparent advocacy for the position that plaintiff was not disabled.in the letter sent to park and kengla,hartford again strung together discrete activities observed in short bursts over several days,stated that he was seen walking at a brisk pace,and noted that his activities were performed without apparent difficulty,hesitation,or the use of assistive devices.instead of noting the observations of pain seen during plaintiff interview,the letter stated that plaintiff displayed minimal physical or mental limitation while participating in the interview.
in response to this letter,park,who saw plaintiff twice a year and was not treating him for his back condition,stated that he either agreed or found no contraindication to the sedentary work capacity suggested by hartford.kengla,who saw plaintiff once a month for the conditions that rendered him disabled,stated that plaintiff remained disabled.park was apparently less familiar with plaintiff condition and thus more apt to be swayed by hartford slanted presentation of the facts.nonetheless,hartford found the disagreement between park and kengla to be significant,and sent plaintiff file to brown for independent review.
although he based his opinion on a number of factors,brown relied on both the surveillance and the conflict of opinion between park and kengla in reaching the conclusion that plaintiff was able to return to work.in conducting a further review of plaintiff medical records after plaintiff appealed the denial of benefits,sukhov again overemphasized the surveillance,stating that the video clearly shows the claimant performing activities above those required for a sedentary job.as noted above,this was clearly not the case.
thus,there is a common theme,both in hartford communications with plaintiff and in the assessments of those professionals hartford hired to evaluate plaintiff condition,of presenting evidence of capability in the best possible light,while failing to subject evidence of capability to the same skepticism and rigorous analysis applied to evidence of disability.
alterations and internal citations omitted.in other words,hartford bias infiltrated the entire administrative decisionmaking process,which leads us to accord significant weight to the conflict.
another factor is har
