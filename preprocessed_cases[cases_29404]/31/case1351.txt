discussion 
standard of review 
we review a trial court ruling on a demurrer independently.citation.liska arns law firm th,d.our task in reviewing a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer is to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action.crowley katleman cal th,d.
ii.ordinary 
statutory framework 
three provisions of erisa expressly address the issue of ordinary preemption 
the preemption clause except as provided in the saving clause,the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter iii of this chapter shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a,as set forth in a.
the saving clause except as provided in the deemer clause,nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.b a,as set forth in b a.
the deemer clause neither an employee benefit plan nor any trust established under such a plan,shall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer,bank,trust company,or investment company or to be engaged in the business of insurance or banking for purposes of any law of any state purporting to regulate insurance companies,insurance contracts,banks,trust companies,or investment companies.b b,as set forth in b b.
for purposes of our analysis,we accept,without deciding,that section relates to employee benefit plans so as to come under the preemption clause of erisa section a.see,barnes cir,which adopted in full the district court decision in the same case,barnes.hence,we must determine the following whether section regulates insurance so as to come under the saving clause of erisa section b a,and if section does regulate insurance,whether it nonetheless is subject to preemption under the deemer clause of erisa section b b.
erisa section b a saving clause 
we turn to whether section regulates insurance so as to fall under the purview of erisa saving clause.
