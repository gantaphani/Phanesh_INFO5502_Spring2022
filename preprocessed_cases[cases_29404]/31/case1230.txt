aileen murphy was a participant in the deloitte touche group insurance plan the plan,an insurance plan governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa.metropolitan life insurance company metlife both insured and administered the plan thus,it operated under an inherent dual role conflict of interest,see weber ge group life assurance,cir.while a participant in the plan,murphy filed a claim for disability benefits,which metlife ultimately denied.
murphy then sought judicial review of metlife decision pursuant to a b and all parties agreed to proceed before a magistrate judge.soon after filing her action,murphy moved for discovery regarding metlife dual role conflict of interest.the magistrate judge denied murphy discovery request because the conflict of interest was apparent on the face of the administrative record,which rendered discovery on that issue unnecessary.then,upon receiving motions for summary judgment from both sides,the magistrate judge granted summary judgment in favor of the plan and metlife.
on appeal,murphy challenges the magistrate judge denial of her discovery request and its grant of summary judgment for the defendants.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we vacate the magistrate judge discovery and summary judgment orders and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
murphy worked as a tax firm director for deloitte touche.her position entailed travel,significant interaction and coordination with others,negotiations with the internal revenue service and clients,advising clients on complex matters,preparation of proposals,and leading client meetings.
while at deloitte touche,murphy participated in the plan,which was governed by erisa and provided disability benefits for plan participants.all parties agree that to receive disability benefits murphy had to satisfy the plan definition of total disability or totally disabled 
d ue to an injury or sickness,you 
are completely and continuously unable to perform each of the material duties of your regular job and 
require the regular care and attendance of a doctor.
however,after the first months of benefit payments,you must also be completely unable to perform the duties of any gainful work or service for which you are reasonably qualified taking into consideration your training,education,experience,and past earnings.
at.the plan requires that the claimant furnish w ritten proof of a claim that describe s the event,the nature,and the extent of the cause for which a claim is made.id.at.to receive disability benefits,the furnished proof must be satisfactory to the plan,and the plan reserves the right to have the claimant examined by doctors of its choice.id.
in august,murphy first submitted a claim for disability benefits under the plan.her primary care physician,frances chavez,provided murphy with two letters supporting her disability claim.in a june letter,chavez diagnosed murphy with ataxic gait and blurred vision and described her symptoms to include loss of balance,parasthesias,difficulty with speech,malaise,memory loss,and blurry vision.id.at.chavez also described murphy as unable to communicate clearly and struggling to recall and focus with numbers.id.
in a subsequent letter dated august,chavez revised her diagnosis,but explicitly restated her conclusion that murphy could not perform any aspect of her job duties.id.at.chavez now diagnosed murphy as suffering from l umbar spinal stenosis and m emory d isturbance.id.at.she described her symptoms to include back pain,leg pain,extreme fatigue,balance and vision problems as well as memory problems,greatly diminished focus and attention,and adversely affected cognitive disabilities.id.chavez noted that she had prescribed murphy oxycontin and that her back and leg pain were currently responding to the painkillers.id.at.
murphy also submitted reports,letters,or notes from a psychiatrist,mustafa ziyalan,a neurologist,elizabeth lakind,and an orthopedic surgeon,claude gelinas.ziyalan noted that murphy had been hospitalized in for suicidal ideation and diagnosed with major depressive disorder and panic disorder,but describes her depression as recurrent,in full remission.id.at.lakind explained that murphy suffered from a lumbar spine disease,but that murphy was now on pain medications with good benefit.id.at.lakind also noted that in june murphy had undergone a cranial mri,an eeg,and a brain spect and each produced normal results,but a cervical mri raised some concerns with her spinal discs.finally,gelinas also diagnosed murphy as suffering from j unctional stenosis and degenerative disc disease in her spine,and he described her as suffering from antalgic gait that significantly limited her range of motion.id.at.
despite this information,metlife denied murphy claim in september.it found no clinical evidence to substantiate the restrictions and limitations described by chavez and no objective clinical evidence or documentation to support murphy subjective complaints.id.at.metlife noted that murphy informed it over the phone that oxycontin controlled her pain,she no longer used a walker,and she had left her job because cognitive problems impaired her performance.metlife further noted that murphy eeg produced normal results,she declined to have surgery to address her back pain,and she failed to have tests to rule out an otologic cause as the source of some of her problems,which an ear,nose,and throat specialist suggested as a possibility.therefore,metlife found no medical documentation to substantiate restrictions and limitations or a level of impairment of such severity that murphy was preclude d from performing her sedentary job.id.at.
murphy appealed metlife decision and supplemented the administrative record with a variety of information.chavez provided additional information confirming murphy disability,and she expanded her diagnosis to include ataxic gait,blurred vision,lumbar spinal stenosis,memory disturbance,major depressive disorder,and anxiety disorder.she also submitted documentation that in october she had a suicidal ideation,was admitted to the hospital where she remained for one week and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder,though she appears not to have obtained psychiatric evaluations despite encouragement from chavez to do so.
additionally,a clinical neuropsychologist,stephen chilulli,provided an evaluation from september in which he found murphy current intellectual function significantly above average.id.at.he explained that t here may be some disruption of murphy attention skills,but he also noted that,even in the attention testing,murphy performed some of the more challenging task sic better than some simple attention tasks,which he felt may be related to anxiety a diagnosis consistent with the results of her personality tests.id.at.ultimately,however,chilulli concluded that t he results of neuropsychological testing are negative for evidence of brain dysfunction,with measures of higher cortical functions often being in the high average to superior range.id.
a separate neurologist,william weng,also concluded that murphy mental status appears to be fluidly intact,though he expressed concern that murphy may suffer from depression and anxiety and that her combination of medications may impact her cognitive function.id.at.
metlife reviewed murphy additional materials but again denied her claim.it enlisted two independent physicians to review murphy neurologist,bruce leforce,and a neuropsychologist,carol walker.both independent physicians reviewed murphy file and concluded that her records did not support her claim for disability,though neither personally examined murphy.the independent physicians acknowledged murphy physical injury to her spine,but noted that her physical pain was controlled by her medication.as to murphy claims of cognitive impairment,the independent physicians concluded that chilulli and weng evaluations did not support murphy claims of cognitive impairment.moreover,walker spoke with chavez by phone in march,and chavez then indicated that murphy cognition appears clear and there are no signs she is.id.at.as to murphy depression and anxiety,walker explained that ziyalan had previously diagnosed murphy depression as in full remission and that while murphy had been subsequently hospitalized for suicidal ideation,her failure to with a psychiatrist left uncertainties as to the ongoing seriousness of the depression and anxiety murphy suffered.id.
murphy subsequently filed this action in federal court seeking a review of metlife decision and both parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge.murphy initially sought discovery,which it describes as limited to metlife dual role conflict as administrator and payor of the plan,but the magistrate judge denied the discovery request.the magistrate judge then granted metlife and the plan motion for summary judgment.murphy now appeals those orders.
discussion 
we first address murphy claim that the district court erred in denying her request for discovery related to metlife dual role conflict of interest.she argues that the supreme court recent decision in metropolitan life insurance glenn,changed the legal landscape for discovery in erisa cases involving dual role conflicts of interest,and the district court failed to apply this new approach.we review de novo whether the district court employed the correct legal standard for discovery.see neiberger fed ex ground package,cir reiterating the general proposition that we review de novo whether the district court applied the proper legal standard at issue.although we disagree with murphy proposition that glenn changed our standard for discovery,we believe the lack of clarity in our case law on this issue and the glenn decision suggest we should clarify the appropriate standard for discovery related to a dual role conflict of interest.
supplementation of the administrative record generally 
in an erisa case where,as here,the plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,we review the administrator decision for an abuse of discretion.holcomb unum life ins.of,cir quoting fought unum life ins.of,cir,abrogated on other grounds by glenn.at see also weber,at describing terms arbitrary and capricious and abuse of discretion as interchangeable in this context.our cases,however,have failed to provide clear guidance to the district court regarding the appropriate standard for resolving discovery requests in these types of cases.see kohut hartford life and accident ins,wl,describing our case law as exhibiting judicial schizophrenia.
as a starting point,we have frequently,consistently,and unequivocally reiterated that,in reviewing a plan administrator decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard,the federal courts are limited to the administrative record.weber,at quoting fought,at see also,holcomb,at cir citing fought,at fought,at citing hall unum life ins.of,cir hall,at citing sandoval aetna life cas.ins,cir,and woolsey marion,cir sandoval,at citing cases woolsey,at citing cases.because we generally restrict district courts review of an administrator decision to the administrative record and because federal rule of civil procedure b permits discovery only where it appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,discovery would generally seem inappropriate.
however,even as we have told district courts to limit their analysis to the administrative record,we have also instructed the district courts to assess the effect of a dual role conflict of interest in a manner that seems incompatible with a flat prohibition on discovery and supplementation.if an administrator operates under a dual role conflict of interest,the district court must always weigh the conflict of interest in its abuse of discretion analysis,but it must allocate the conflict more or less weight depending on its seriousness see weber,at.but,without discovery,a claimant may not have access to the information necessary to establish the seriousness of the conflict.similarly,the administrator may not be fully able to rebut a claim of conflict by showing that it has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy,for example,by walling off claims administrators from those interested in firm finances.glenn.at.and,if the district court can not consider material beyond the administrative record,it may not be able to fulfill its judicial task of allocating the proper weight to the conflict of interest.if the administrative record does not specifically address these issues and if we flatly prohibited the consideration and discovery of information outside the administrative record,the district court may not be able to make a fully informed analysis that properly weighs the conflict of interest 
this seeming tension in our case law,however,naturally resolves itself if we recall the origins of our language that speaks in terms of a flat rule against a district court consideration of information.our first two cases to adopt this restriction from other circuits were woolsey marion laboratories,cir citing perry simplicity engineering,cir,and voliva seafarers pension plan,cir,and sandoval aetna life casualty insurance,cir citing perry,at,and voliva,at.in both sandoval and woolsey,we articulated the rule against supplementation in the context of rejecting a claimant efforts to supplement the record with substantive evidence of his eligibility for benefits,such as additional evidence of disability.see sandoval.at rejecting district court consideration of psychological evaluations not submitted to the plan administrator and explaining that i n effect a curtain falls when the fiduciary completes its review,and for purposes of determining if substantial evidence supported the decision,the district court must evaluate the record as it was at the time of the decision.emphasis added woolsey,at stating in the context of discussing the substantive evidence that supported an administrator decision concerning the disbursement of benefits that,i n determining whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence,we consider only the facts before the administrators at the time of their decision.
in this context,a general prohibition on supplementation makes sense.both a plan participant and an administrator have a fair opportunity to include in the record materials related to the participant eligibility for benefits.because the administrator must base its decision on the materials included in the administrative record,a district court would have no justification for concluding that an administrator abused its discretion by failing to consider materials never submitted to it for inclusion in the administrative record see sandoval,at if a plan participant fails to bring evidence to the attention of the administrator,the participant can not complain of the administrator failure to consider this evidence.as we explained in sandoval,a plan participant is not entitled to a second chance to prove his disability.id.
other policy concerns also support a general rule against supplementation of the record on the merits issue of disability.in particular,congress designed erisa to provide a method for workers and beneficiaries to resolve disputes over benefits inexpensively and expeditiously.id.at quotation omitted.allowing the district court to go beyond its limited scope of review and consider materials would undermine this goal,and both prolong the decisionmaking process and inject greater uncertainty into that process.see id.
although we have frequently used broad language to describe our restriction on discovery and supplementation,the breadth of that language can be misleading,at least to some degree.in fact,in sandoval we did not use the absolutist language that we have shifted towards in some later cases.see id.stating that the district court generally may consider only materials contained in the administrative record emphasis added.while woolsey used more absolute language,as stated previously,it used that language in the context of addressing a district court consideration of substantive evidence of eligibility not included in the record.at.and like both woolsey and sandoval,most of our subsequent cases have employed this restriction with respect to substantive evidence of eligibility,or simply reiterated the restriction in rote form without substantive discussion of its scope.see,holcomb,at reciting general proposition that a court review is limited to the administrative record without further comment weber,at,refusing to consider materials offered to prove substantive eligibility for benefits flinders,at explaining that district court could review reasonableness only of rationale for denying claim that is asserted in the administrative record because the restriction on review of materials also prevents an administrator from submitting materials or theories adamson unum life ins.of,cir noting court limitation to the record under abuse of discretion review without further comment gaither aetna life ins,cir same allison unum life ins.of,cir same finley.employee benefits org.income prot.plan,cir same nance,at rejecting claimant argument that district court should consider substantive evidence of his disability submitted after administrator had issued its final decision hall,at same kimber thiokol,cir same chambers family health plan,cir holding that sandoval prevents review of substantive evidence regarding claimant eligibility for benefits and declining to address whether procedural irregularities affect a district court scope of review.
specifically,the broad language prohibiting discovery is potentially misleading in cases involving a dual role conflict of interests or procedural irregularities.in fact,some of our cases contemplate the possibility that a district court may permit discovery related to a dual role conflict of interest.in wolberg v.at t broadband pension plan.cir unpublished the plan participant argued that the plan administrator had a standard conflict of interest,which meant that the plan participant bore the burden to prove the conflict existed and jeopardized the administrator decisionmaking process.id.at.although we reiterated the general principle that i n erisa cases our review is confined to the administrative record,id.at,we explicitly criticized the plan participant for failing to seek discovery that could have proven the seriousness of the conflict of interest.id.at.because we would not have criticized the plan participant for failing to seek discovery on the conflict of interest if discovery and supplementation of the record on that issue were never available,we necessarily implied that,at least in some circumstances,discovery related to a conflict of interest may be available weber,at noting,in a case involving an administrator with an inherent dual role conflict of interest,that the court was left to its own analytic devices in assessing the administrator reasonableness in lights of its conflict,in part,because the record reveal ed little about the administrator claims assessment process.and district courts within our circuit have recognized that limited discovery for the purpose of determining the scope of a conflict of interest may be appropriate.paul hartford life and accident ins,wl.july,unreported compiling cases and concluding that while it would not be proper to allow plaintiff to conduct discovery directed to the factual merits of his claim,this court will permit limited discovery related to the alleged conflict of interest in this case and to the policies and procedures used by the administrator to make its decision see also,kohut,wl,interpreting tenth circuit law to permit discovery related to the seriousness of a conflict of interest.
more to the point,the supreme court decision in glenn contemplates the possibility of discovery related to a dual role conflict of interest.in glenn,the supreme court explained that a conflict of interest weighs more heavily against an administrator where it has a history of biased claims administration.at.as an example of this situation,glenn cited to a law review article by john langbein that detailed the history of one company biased administration of claims.see id.citing john langbein,trust law as regulatory law the scandal and judicial review of benefit denials under erisa,nw.that article details how various investigations and lawsuits unrelated to benefit denial claims,wrongful termination claims by former employees revealed that an insurer pressured its employees and physicians to deny claims without proper analysis yet instructed them to use language that a court would find adequate to support the denial.langbein,supra,nw.at.this type of pressure was most apparent in cases of subjective illnesses that did not show up on,mris,and other objective medical tests,mental illness,chronic pain,migraines,or even parkinsons.id.at quotation omitted.although the supreme court did not explicitly state that the district court could consider materials or that a claimant could discover materials,it must have contemplated that,at least in some cases,discovery and consideration of materials may be necessary and appropriate as an administrative record is not likely to contain the details of a history of biased administration of claims as discussed in langbein article.see denmark liberty life assurance of boston,cir the majority opinion in glenn fairly can be read as contemplating some discovery on the issue of whether a structural conflict has morphed into an actual conflict.dicta see also id.at lipez,concurring agreeing with majority that glenn contemplates discovery related to a dual role conflict of interest but criticizing the majority for reaching that question unnecessarily and taking an unnecessarily limited view on the availability of discovery johnson.life ins,cir unpublished indicating that glenn is consistent with the sixth circuit prior case law that permits discovery related to a dual role conflict of interest and procedural irregularities wilcox wells fargo.long term disability plan,cir unpublished explaining that glenn permits consideration of evidence outside of the administrative record to determine the appropriate weight to accord the conflict of interest factor.
for the reasons we have discussed above,then,we conclude that our case law prohibits courts from considering materials outside the administrative record where the materials sought to be introduced relate to a claimant eligibility for benefits.see sandoval,at.our cases and the supreme court decision in glenn,however,contemplate that this general restriction does not conclusively prohibit a district court from considering materials related to an administrator dual role conflict of interest.therefore,discovery related to the scope and impact of a dual role conflict of interest may,at times,be appropriate,and we now turn to elucidating the standard for addressing discovery requests related to a dual role conflict of interest.
standard for discovery related to a dual role conflict of interest 
just as our cases have not clearly delineated between supplementation of the record with evidence of a claimant eligibility for benefits and supplementation with evidence of the seriousness of a conflict of interest,our cases have also failed to articulate in plain terms the standard for discovery beyond the administrative record related to a dual role conflict of interest of an erisa plan administrator.the supreme court in glenn counseled against special procedural and evidentiary rules in this context.at.we take that counsel to apply also to discovery rules,which in this case will then be governed by the familiar standards of federal rule of civil procedure b.
as stated previously,in glenn,the supreme court held that the district court weighs a dual role conflict as one factor in its abuse of discretion analysis,allocating it more or less weight depending on its seriousness.at.in reaching this conclusion,the supreme court rejected other approaches to handling a dual role conflict,such as shifting to the administrator the burden of proving its decision was reasonable.see holcomb at explaining that glenn abrogated our scheme.glenn explained that it was not necessary or desirable for courts to create special rules,or other special procedural or evidentiary rules,focused narrowly upon the conflict.at.
we take glenn admonition agains
