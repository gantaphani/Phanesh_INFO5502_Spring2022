the district judge,in this suit by participants in an erisa pension plan,has asked us,and we have agreed,to entertain an interlocutory appeal from a ruling in which she answered in favor of the plaintiffs a potentially controlling question of law that had arisen in the course of the litigation.b.the plaintiffs have,but since they are defending rather than attacking the judge ruling,the is improper,rose acre farms,madigan,cir,and is hereby dismissed.the question is the correct approach to deciding whether an erisa pension this case a plan in which the employer matched contributions that its employees made by means of payroll deductions to individual retirement been partially terminated.
provided that certain requirements are met,the interest or other earnings in an individual retirement account are not taxed as they accrue.john colombo,paying for the sins of the master an analysis of the tax effects of pension plan disqualification and a proposal for reform,see a,a.suppose the employer terminates the plan.were it not for the special rule on terminations that is the focus of this case,an employee whose pension entitlement had not yet fully vested would receive,would be deemed fully vested as to,over and above the vested portion of the employer contribution,only the contributions he had made to his retirement account,plus the earnings on them.the portion of the employer contributions that had not yet vested would revert to the employer,compare a with id.a,yielding it a tax benefit because the amount by which its contributions had grown as a result of the pension plan investing them would have escaped being taxed.but this is where the special rule clicks in in the event of termination the rights of all the participants in the terminated plan vest in full,so that none of the money that the employer contributed is returned to it.d.
the purpose of the rule is to prevent plan terminations motivated by the prospect of a tax windfall.matz household international tax reduction investment plan,cir,vacated on other grounds,d per curiam bruch firestone tire rubber,cir,reversed in part on other grounds,d vincent amoroso et,a policy premise approach to partial terminations,new york university review of employees benefits and executive compensation,thomas veal edward mackiewicz,pension plan terminations ed.we are unconvinced by an alternative rationale sometimes suggested for the protect nonvested employees expectations of receiving pension benefits.tipton kalmbach,commissioner,wl see also matz household international tax reduction investment plan,supra,at halliburton commissioner,wl.until his pension benefits have vested,an employee at will,lacking as he does any job tenure,has no reasonable expectations of receiving benefits.the point of vesting is to create such an expectation.
to prevent evasion,the rule requiring immediate vesting of all participants pension benefits applies to partial terminations as well as to complete ones.the statute does not define partial termination,however,although a treasury regulation tells the irs to base the determination on all the facts and circumstances of a particular case.d b.despite the phrasing of the regulation,and despite their origin in tax law,disputes as to whether a partial termination has occurred rarely involve the irs,which has been a party to only a small minority of the reported cases and rulings.veal mackiewicz,supra,at.this case is not one of the small minority.actually not such a small minority,as the table later in this opinion reveals.the case law has assumed that the regulation is intended to guide adjudicators as well as the irs,and we shall indulge the assumption.
so vague a regulation is no help to anyone.but some years ago the irs,in an amicus curiae brief filed in weil retirement plan administrative committee,cir,suggested that,with an important qualification that we take up at the end of this opinion,a pension plan should be deemed partially terminated if at least percent of the plan participants lose coverage.the irs was putting welcome flesh on a skeletal regulation,and the court in weil deferred to the irs position on the basis of the chevron principle.at.so did we the first time this protracted litigation came before us.matz household international tax reduction investment plan,supra.the supreme court,however,vacated our decision,d per curiam,in light of the united states mead,d,where the court had ruled that informal agency actions are not to receive chevron deference.a position stated in an amicus curiae brief has seemed to us a good example of what the court had in mind.keys barnhart,cir see also matz household international tax reduction investment plan,cir doe mutual of omaha ins,cir in re new times securities services,cir.
on remand from the supreme court,freed from the irs incubus we adopt ed the rule that only participants should be counted in determining whether partial termination of a pension plan has occurred.at.by we meant not fully vested.erisa requires that at least percent of the employee benefits vest at the end of the third year,another percent at the end of the fourth,and so on,so that by the end of seven years the employee is fully vested.a b.the plan can provide for more rapid vesting,d,and this one did vesting was complete in five years rather than seven.the case went back down to the district court,where the question arose whether we had meant that vested participants should be excluded only from the numerator or also from the denominator in deciding how partial the termination had been.the percent figure in the irs amicus brief in weil was the percentage of the plan participants who were terminated,irrespective of how many either of them or of the remaining participants were fully vested.
from a favorable reference in our first opinion,see at,to in re gulf pension litigation,affirmed under the name borst chevron,cir,the district judge inferred that we would exclude from both numerator and denominator all fully vested participants,although we had said that.so if the plan had participants,lost their plan coverage,of those were not fully vested,and the total number of not fully vested participants was,the relevant percentage would be not percent but percent.the judge reasoned that since the effect of termination,either from the participants standpoint or from the tax standpoint,is limited to those who are fully vested,they are the only participants who should be considered in deciding whether a partial termination has occurred.the plan agrees that only participants who were not fully vested should be in the numerator,but it argues that all the participants should be in the denominator,which would change the percentage in our hypothetical example from percent to percent.
which approach is right and what difference does it make in this case,where,as a result of a series of reorganizations of subsidiaries of household,a total of of the participants in household plan ceased to be participants we can and shortly will select what we believe to be the correct approach.but because of unresolved issues in the district court remember that the case is here on interlocutory appeal,we ca use the approach to generate a definite percentage in this case.
one of the unresolved issues is whether the terminations should be treated as a single termination.they were closely related in time all occurred between the end of august and the end of june and appear to have had the same motive,unlike the two partial terminations in administrative committee of sea ray employees stock ownership profit sharing plan robinson,cir,which had unrelated causes.see matz household international tax reduction investment plan,supra,at and at weil retirement plan administrative committee,cir.but there is no actual finding by the district court.
likewise unresolved are whether the figure for participants whose coverage is canceled includes any of the employees who household asserts left voluntarily the plaintiffs claim on the contrary that those employees were constructively discharged and therefore should count in determining whether a partial termination has occurred,sage automation.pension plan trust,cir w
