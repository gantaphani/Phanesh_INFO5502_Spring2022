background 
finley worked for corporation from to november.by november,she suffered from moderately severe right thoracolumbar scoliosis.sponsors the plan,which provides and disability benefits to employees who work more than thirty hours per week.voluntary plan administrators,vpa acts as the plan administrator.vpa is an independent administrator that is compensated solely by a flat quarterly fee.all benefits are paid out of the plan trust funds,not by vpa.
shortly after leaving her job,finley applied to vpa for disability benefits,which were initially denied.after finley administratively appealed with the help of an attorney,she obtained benefits on may.these funds,which were paid retroactively,provided weeks of benefits.
finley,again through counsel,applied to vpa for benefits in july.pursuant to section q ii of the plan benefits distribution document the benefits document,a plan member,after the expiration of benefits,is eligible for benefits only if the member is continuously unable to perform any occupation for which he or she is or may become qualified.emphasis added.thus,finley could not obtain benefits merely by showing her inability to perform her current position.instead,she had to demonstrate through objective medical evidence that she could not perform any job for which she was,or could reasonably become,qualified.
vpa set the date for determining whether finley met this disability criterion at august,a date that finley does not contest.thereafter,finley underwent a battery of medical examinations by her own medical professionals and those hired by vpa.by the end of september,finley sent her final medical records to vpa for its consideration.included among these records were the reports of thomas higgenbottom and john mahan,finley attending physicians.
on march,vpa sent a letter to finley attorney denying benefits.vpa based this decision on several medical reports,including higgenbottom and mahan,that found finley capable of performing sedentary work for which she may become qualified,such as that of a cashier or telephone operator,so long as she could change positions frequently.
on may,finley administratively appealed this decision.included with this appeal was a new medical report,dated may,from mahan.this report states that finley condition had worsened since mahan september examination and that finley severe pain prohibit ed any work.vpa responded on june stating that the appeal submitted no new evidence and requesting that finley supply additional medical evidence.finley counsel called vpa,informed them no more evidence was forthcoming and requested that the appeal proceed.in a july letter,vpa confirmed this phone call and agreed to render a decision within sixty days.vpa sent a letter denying the appeal of the benefits decision on october.
pursuant to the plan benefits document and the department of labor erisa regulations then in effect,an appeal from a denial of benefits must be resolved within sixty days.see h i an administrator may obtain an additional sixty days to respond if a special need exists and the claimant receives notice.id.section c of the benefits document mimics this regulation,stating in no event shall the decision of the claims administrator be rendered more than one hundred twenty days after it receives the request for review.the district court,reasoning that vpa response was due sixty days after its july letter,determined that the due date for vpa response was september,because vpa mailed its response to finley appeal on october,vpa denial of her administrative appeal was days late.therefore,pursuant to both section c of the benefits document and the applicable erisa regulation,finley appeal was deemed denied on september.h i.
finley brought suit in federal court under a b,seeking recovery of her benefits,and under,seeking damages for vpa alleged failure to provide full and fair review of her claims the district court,in granting summary judgment for the plan,applied an arbitrary and capricious review to vpa decision to deny benefits and found no genuine issue of material fact as to whether vpa decision met this standard.finley timely appealed.the plan,arguing that the district court erred by not finding finley claims barred by the benefits document contractual statute of limitations.we need not address the statute of limitations issue because we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the merits.
ii.standard of review 
we review a summary judgment under the same standard a district court applies pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact remains,we view all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.the substantive law regarding a claim identifies which facts are material in a motion for summary judgment.carland metropolitan life ins,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.
iii.discussion 
a.the appropriate standard for review of the plan denial of benefits 
in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the supreme court ruled that a court should review a suit brought under a b under a de novo standard unless the contract gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for such benefits.see jones kodak medical assistance plan,cir.when,as here,the plan administrator has full discretion to determine eligibility for benefits,courts ordinarily review a decision to deny benefits under the arbitrary and capricious standard.id.
finley contends,however,that we owe no deference to vpa decision to deny her benefits because her administrative appeal was merely deemed denied due to vpa tardy issuance of its decision.the district court,citing mcgarrah hartford life,cir,rejected this argument,finding that vpa denial,while late,did not raise serious doubts as to whether the result reached by vpa was the product of an arbitrary decision.id.at.
after the district court issued its summary judgment ruling,we published our opinion in gilbertson allied signal,cir,which we apply here.see davidson america online,cir where a change in law occurs while a case is on appeal,we apply the law in effect at the time of our decision.in gilbertson,the plaintiff appealed to the administrator after denial of her application.two weeks later,the administrator informed her that it had extended the time allowed for both the submission of additional medical information and the determination of her appeal.despite the plaintiff numerous letters containing medical evidence and requests for updates,the administrator never issued a decision denying her appeal or communicated with the plaintiff again,resulting in more than six months of radio silence.gilbertson,at.because of this failure,the plaintiff appeal was deemed denied days after she filed it.id.at.
after the plaintiff in gilbertson filed suit,the district court granted the defendant summary judgment,applying an arbitrary and capricious review to the denial of benefits.we reversed,reasoning that the plan administrator is not entitled to the deference of arbitrary and capricious review when certain appeals are deemed denied because the administrator made no decision to which a court may defer.id.at.as such,we applied de novo review.id.when the administrator fails to exercise his discretion within the requir
