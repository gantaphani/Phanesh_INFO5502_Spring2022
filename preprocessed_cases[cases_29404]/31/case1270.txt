plaintiff bryan nance appeals the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of sun life assurance company of canada sun life on his claim for disability benefits under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.the district court ruled that sun life decision to deny benefits based on plaintiff back condition and depression was not arbitrary or capricious.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm 
background 
louis dreyfus natural gas dreyfus hired plaintiff to work as an accountant in.in july plaintiff was injured in a car accident.because of his injuries,plaintiff left work on september.he never returned.
as an employee of dreyfus,plaintiff was a participant in the company employee disability benefit plan the plan,which was funded and administered by sun life.he received benefits under the plan from september of through march.according to sun life,dreyfus terminated plaintiff employment on march.plaintiff contends that his termination date was march,but our decision does not require choosing between the two dates.
in january plaintiff made a claim for disability benefits based on a diagnosis of,and surgery for,left thoracic outlet syndrome ltos,a compression of the nerves and blood vessels between the collarbone and first rib,causing,among other things,pain in the arms.see the annotated dictionary.after initially denying those benefits,sun life reconsidered and ultimately approved them on april.during the interim between initial denial and approval of benefits,however,one of plaintiff doctors wrote a letter releasing him to return to his regular activities without restrictions.based on this letter sun life limited plaintiff benefits to the period ending one day prior to the date of the doctor release,or july.
on june,while sun life was considering plaintiff claim based on ltos,it received a letter from his surgeon noting that he had become exceedingly depressed.then,two weeks after plaintiff was granted limited benefits,his attorney notified sun life of a possible claim for benefits based on a back condition allegedly caused by the same car accident that caused his ltos.after reviewing additional evidence,sun life denied the back claim on june,because it was based on a congenital condition unrelated to his ltos and the medical records reflected that he did not suffer back pain until after his termination from employment.two months later sun life denied plaintiff depression claim,finding again that the evidence did not support the existence of a disabling condition prior to his termination.in february and march plaintiff forwarded additional material concerning his back pain and depression,but sun life refused to reopen his claim because all levels of appeal had been exhausted.
on april,plaintiff filed suit against sun life,alleging it violated in denying his claim for benefits.the district court granted sun life motion for summary judgment,concluding that sun life decisions to deny plaintiff disability benefits were not arbitrary or capricious.plaintiff has appealed,arguing that the district court erred by using the wrong standard of review the district court erred by limiting its review to the evidence sun life had acquired as of august,the date of the last denial and sun life denial of benefits was based on an unreasonable interpretation of the plan and was not supported by substantial evidence.
ii.standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as should have been applied by the district court in reviewing the decision by sun life to deny benefits.amro boeing,cir.what that standard should be is disputed by the parties on appeal,as it was in district court.plaintiff urges that we review sun life denial of benefits de novo,whereas sun life argues that we must uphold its decision unless we find it to be arbitrary or capricious.
in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the supreme court wrote that a denial of benefits challenged under is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.if the plan grants discretionary authority to the administrator or fiduciary,the exercise of that authority will be set aside only if it is arbitrary or capricious.see chambers family health plan,cir.
in applying firestone,it is essential to focus precisely on what decision is at issue,because a plan may grant the administrator discretion to make some decisions but not others.plaintiff challenges two decisions by sun life in denying him benefits.first,he contends that sun life misconstrued the plan when it decided that he was covered for a disability only if the disability began before his employment with dreyfus was terminated.second,he contends that sun life erred in its factual decision that he was not disabled at the time of termination.depending on the specific language of the plan,the standard for our review of sun life interpretation of the plan and the standard for our review of sun life fact finding may or may not be the same.
unfortunately,the arguments in the parties briefs concerning the standard of review do not distinguish between the two challenged aspects of sun life denial of benefits.in any event,we need address only the standard of review for sun life fact finding.the standard of review does not affect our decision regarding sun life interpretation of the plan with respect to coverage of disabilities.assuming,without deciding,that we should apply de novo review,we confirm sun life interpretation later in this opinion.because sun life interpretation survives the more stringent de novo review,the interpretation could not be arbitrary or capricious.
we now consider whether the plan confers discretion on sun life in finding the facts relating to disability.some plan provisions do not use language suggesting discretion.the plan states that i f sun life receives notice and proof of claim that an employee is totally or partially disabled,a net monthly benefit will be payable,subject to the limitations and exclusions.to receive that benefit,proof of total or partial disability must be given to sun life upon request and at the employee expense.on the other hand,the section concerning claim provisions provides that for all claims proof must be satisfactory to sun life before benefits will be paid,and benefits will be paid for any period for which sun life is liable w hen sun life receives satisfactory proof of claim.in addition,benefits cease under the plan no later than 
the date the employee fails to provide adequate employment earnings information or proof of continuing total or partial disability as requested or for the first months of total disability or for partial disability,the date sun life determines the employee is able to perform on a basis all of the material and substantial duties of his own occupation or after the first months of total disability,the date sun life determines the employee is able to perform on a basis all of the material and substantial duties of any occupation for which he is or becomes reasonably qualified 
relying primarily on the seventh circuit opinion in herzberger standard insurance,cir,plaintiff argues that the language of the plan does not grant the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine facts relating to plaintiff claim.in our view,however,common meaning,tenth circuit precedent,and the weight of authority elsewhere including herzberger support the district court decision.
because the issue before us is whether sun life properly refused to grant disability benefits based on plaintiff depression or back condition,the pertinent language is the requirement that p roof of long term disability must be satisfactory to sun life.to begin our analysis,we distinguish this particular,the words satisfactory to sun life from language in other plans that requires only submission of satisfactory proof,without reference to who must be satisfied.most circuits that have considered the issue have concluded that the mere requirement to submit satisfactory or adequate proof of eligibility does not confer discretion upon an administrator.see herzberger,at kearney standard ins,cir benefits provided upon receipt of satisfactory written proof bounds bell atl.enters.flexible disability plan,cir claims will be paid after the administrator receives adequate proof of loss.to say that proof must be satisfactory may be to say only that it must meet some objective a reasonable person would find to be satisfactory.see herzberger,at kearney,at.construing any ambiguity in plan language in favor of the beneficiary,courts are likely to interpret the term satisfactory as conveying such an objective standard,without granting any deference to the factual determinations of the plan administrator.see kearney,at.indeed,only one circuit by an margin in an en banc decision has held that language requiring submission of satisfactory proof of loss,without specifying who determines the sufficiency of that proof,is by itself adequate to trigger the standard of review.see perez aetna life ins,cir.
going one step further in denying that a plan confers discretion,some courts have held that plan language requiring that a claimant submit satisfactory proof of total disability to the administrator does not confer discretion on the administrator because the language should be construed as stating only to whom the proof must be submitted,not who must be satisfied.see walke group long term disability,cir language requiring insured to submit satisfactory proof of total disability to us kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir same.but see wilcox reliance standard life ins,cir unpublished reaching contrary result with respect to same plan language.
on the other hand,when,as in this case,a plan states that the grant or denial of a particular benefit is to be determined by proof satisfactory to the administrator,courts have said that deferential review is proper.see donato metro.life ins,cir proof must be satisfactory to us herzberger,at describing the language in donato as indicat ing with the requisite if minimum clarity that a discretionary determination is envisaged ferrari teachers ins.annuity ass n,cir describing plan as stating that proof must be satisfactory to the administrator perez,at boggs,dissenting disagreeing with majority opinion that plan language granted discretion,but stating that donato plan language clearly gives discretion to the administrator.
although language in kinstler,at,suggests that the second circuit might disagree we hold that the satisfactory to sun life language suffices to convey discretion to sun life in finding the facts relating to disability.in our view,this language adequately conveys to the plan participants and beneficiaries that the evidence of disability must be persuasive to sun life.furthermore,to hold otherwise would be at odds with our circuit case law.we have been comparatively liberal in construing language to trigger the more deferential standard of review under erisa.in mcgraw prudential insurance of america,cir,we held that the standard governs review of decisions of medical necessity in a plan stating t o be considered needed,a service or supply must be determined by the administrator to meet all of these tests emphasis in original chambers,at finding sufficient discretionary language in plan excluding coverage of certain medical procedures considered experimental in the judgment of the administrator.yet herzberger,which supports a finding of discretion under the plan language in our case,would not find discretion arising from language that merely requires a determination of eligibility or entitlement by the administrator,at,thereby suggesting a view,which we share,that this case is an easier one for finding discretion than mcgraw was.mcgraw also supports our result because the plan language describing when benefits must cease the date sun life determines the employee is able to perform would,under the holding in that case,grant sun life discretion to halt benefits if it had ever authorized benefits for plaintiff depression and back claims 
because the plan gives discretion to sun life in finding the facts relating to disability,we must uphold sun life decisions as a fact finder unless they were arbitrary or capricious.this standard is a difficult one for a claimant to overcome.as we have explained,
when reviewing under the arbitrary and capricious standard,the administrator decision need not be the only logical one nor even the best one.it need only be sufficiently supported by facts within his knowledge to counter a claim that it was arbitrary or capricious.the decision will be upheld unless it is not grounded on any reasonable basis.the reviewing court need only assure that the administrator decision falls somewhere on a continuum of if on the low end.
kimber thiokol,cir citations and quotation marks omitted.even so,the district court concluded,and we agree,that sun life operated the plan under a conflict of interest because it was both the insurer and administrator of the fund.accordingly,we must consider and weigh the conflict as a factor in applying this flexible standard.chambers,at.
iii.scope of record to be reviewed 
plaintiff argues that certain evidence submitted to sun life several months after august,the date of its last denial of benefits,should be considered on review of sun life decision.we disagree.in determining whether the plan administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious,the district court generally may consider only the arguments and evidence before the administrator at the time it made that decision.sandoval aetna life cas.ins,cir see chambers,at.hence,we will not consider the material submitted by plaintiff to sun life after its decision on august,unless sun life acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner by refusing to reopen plaintiff claim to consider additional factual submissions.
we find no such error by sun life.the plan states that for disability benefits,
proof of claim must be given to sun life no later than days after the end of the elimination period the number of days the employee must be disabled before being eligible to start receiving disability benefits.
if it is not possible to give proof within this time limit,it must be given as soon as reasonably possible.proof of claim may not be given later than one year after the time proof is otherwise required unless the individual is legally incompetent.
to give plaintiff the benefit of the latest possible due date for his proof of claim,we assume that his claimed disability caused by a bad back or depression began on the date of his termination of employment in march.we will hold in the next section of this opinion that sun life was correct in deciding that plaintiff was not covered if the claimed disabilities commenced after his termination from employment.because the elimination period under the plan was days,plaintiff proof of claim was due,if possible,within days of his termination from december,long before his submissions in february and march.
in addition,the summary plan description spd in the dreyfus employee handbook states,a ny appeal must be made within days after you receive notice that your claim has been denied or,if the circumstances are such that you can not meet the deadline,as soon as reasonably possible thereafter.on june,sun life denied plaintiff claim for his back condition.on august,it denied his claim for depression.the claim was actually a december appeal of the october denial of his depression claim.thus,the period expired by october.as noted by the district court,the evidence plaintiff sought to submit consists of correspondence in november and december of from plaintiff counsel to sun life requesting copies of documents from the administrative file,and affidavits written by plaintiff and his wife,dated january and march,respectively.plaintiff offers no reason for his delay,and nothing in the record on appeal suggests that sun life foreclosed plaintiff from an opportunity for an appropriate review of the denial of his claim.see setting forth procedural requirements for denial of benefits under employee benefit plans see also sandoval,at addressing claim of violation of.in light of the time limits for submission of a proof of claim and for appealing a denial,sun life did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner by refusing to consider the additional material submitted by plaintiff.
iv.administrator decision to deny benefits 
finally,plaintiff argues that sun life denial of his benefits was based on an unreasonable interpretation of the plan and was not founded on substantial evidence.we first address the claim regarding interpretation of the plan.we need not decide whether sun life had discretion in interpreting the plan provisions at issue,because we can affirm sun life interpretation even under de novo review.
interpretation of plan provisions 
plaintiff asserts that b oth the louis dreyfus employee handbook and the ltd policy provide that his ltd coverage continued while he was disabled,and that he is entitled to ltd benefits for all of the disabilities that began during the period he was disabled under the terms of the ltd plan,from september,to the present.we begin with the policy and then discuss the handbook provisions,which are the pertinent parts of the spd.
the plan definitions include the following 
injury means bodily impairment resulting directly from an accident and independently of all other causes.any injury must occur and any disability must begin while the employee is insured under this policy.
sickness means illness,disease or pregnancy.any disability,because of sickness,must begin while the employee is insured under this policy.
thus,it is not enough that the disability be caused by an occurrence while the employee is insured the disability itself must begin while the employee is insured.to determine when an employee is insured under this policy,one turns to plan section v,entitled termination provisions,which states an employee will cease to be insured on the earliest of the following dates.the date employment terminates we need not decide whether any of the other dates would be earlier.taken as a whole,the quoted language clearly expresses the requirement that disability begin before the employee is terminated.
plaintiff attempts to overcome the clear import of the plan by pointing to additional language,but the language he relies on is irrelevant to his circumstances.first,he claims that he can benefit from an exception that appears in the provision terminating coverage upon termination of employment.the provision,the pertinent part of which was previously quoted,states 
an employee will cease to be insured on the earliest of the following dates 
the date employment terminates.cessation of actively at work will be deemed termination of employment,except 
insurance will be continued for an employee absent due to a disability during 
the elimination period and 
ii.any period the premium is waived under this policy.
plaintiff apparently contends that exception a ii applies to him because section iv,entitled benefit provisions,contains the sentence ltd premium payments for a totally or partially disabled employee are waived during any period ltd benefits are payable under this policy.
plaintiff argument fails,however,because the exception applies only to an employee.it states that insurance will be continued for an employee absent due to a disability emphasis added.the plan defines employee as a person who is employed by the employer,working at least the number of hours shown in section i,schedule of benefits hours per week,and paid regular earnings.the exception benefits an employee who would otherwise be deemed terminated for failure to be actively at work,which,as defined by the plan,generally means working a full workday.plaintiff does not,and could not,argue that he was an employee after his termination in march.
next,plaintiff claims that language in the plan provides for continued disability coverage for successive periods of disability.in particular,he argues that his psychiatric disability should be covered because the medical evidence shows he suffered from depression while still receiving benefits based on his ltos disability.he relies on the following provision of plan section iv,benefit provisions,under the heading successive periods 
successive periods of total or partial disability after a net monthly benefit was payable will be considered a single period if the employee,in the time between the successive periods,was actively at work for less than six months,if due to the same or related causes one day,if due to an entirely unrelated cause.the employee will not have to complete a new elimination period 
plaintiff focuses on the first quoted sentence,ignoring the second.but reading the two sentences together,it is clear that they relate only to how the elimination period is calculated.ordinarily,when an employee becomes totally disabled,the employee can not start receiving disability payments under the plan until the disability has lasted continuous days the elimination period.under the language,however,the employee need not wait that period to begin receiving benefits for a second disability if the new disability has a cause related to the cause of the original disability and begins within six months of the end of the original disability,or the new disability begins within a day of the end of the original disability.this language says nothing about what disabilities are covered by the plan it assumes the second disability is covered and just sets forth an exception to the usual elimination period requirement.in particular,the language applies only if the person suffering the second disability is still an employee.our reading of the provision is confirmed by the spd,which states 
recurring disabilities 
if ltd benefits stop because you are no longer disabled and,within six consecutive months after you return to your regular job,the same or a related disability condition recurs,ltd benefits will resume right away.if the condition recurs after you have been back on the job on a basis for six consecutive months or longer,a new waiting period will apply before ltd benefits start again.
we now turn to plaintiff contention that the spd in the employee handbook confers coverage for disabilities that arise during a prior disability.although he cites to two pages in the handbook,he does not refer to any specific language other than the sentence,all benefits under the program will end for you and your eligible dependents if and when you become a employee or your employment terminates,unless you are eligible for ltd benefits.plaintiff error is to confuse continuation of benefits with continuation of coverage.the quoted sentence merely informs readers that disability continue even after one leaves employment.it does not say that disability after one leaves employment.in other words,once one leaves employment,one is no longer covered for a new disability that arises.indeed,a chart on the same page as the quoted sentence states that for disability,upon termination of employment coverage stops.
furthermore,the handbook declares if there is any discrepancy between this spd and the actual plan documents,the discrepancy is unintentional,and your rights will be determined in accordance with the plan documents.we have held that w here the spd incorrectly describes benefits in the plan,to secure relief,the claimant must show some significant reliance upon,or possible prejudice flowing from,the faulty plan description.chiles ceridian,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.plaintiff has not suggested any detrimental reliance or prejudice.
thus,we agree with sun life that plaintiff is not entitled to coverage under the plan unless his disability began while he was still employed by dreyfus.
sun life fact finding 
having construed the plan provisions,we now address whether sun life was arbitrary or capricious in determining that plaintiff had not satisfied the requirements for coverage of his claimed disabilities arising from a bad back and depression.the issue with respect to each claim is whether plaintiff was disabled by the condition by the time of his termin
