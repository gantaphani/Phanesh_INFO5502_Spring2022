at the heart of this case,which is before us for a second time,see griggs dupont de nemours,cir griggs i,are questions about the propriety of a rescissionary remedy in an action governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,west supp.we conclude that,in general,rescission is a remedy traditionally available in equity and that rescission is therefore a proper remedy under erisa.as to this case,however,we conclude that the district court erred with regard to certain aspects of the equitable relief that it fashioned.accordingly,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
joseph griggs,a employee of dupont de nemours,took early retirement in after learning that he was eligible to participate in dupont temporary pension system tps,a program that paid eligible employees one month salary for every two years of service.all of the tps information that dupont provided to eligible employees stated that the tps benefit could be taken in the form of a lifetime annuity with monthly payments that would be subject to federal tax or as a lump sum that could be rolled over into an ira or other qualified retirement account.griggs elected the distribution,which was calculated to be.before griggs officially retired,however,dupont learned that because of griggs salary level,his lump sum tps benefit could not be rolled over and would be subject to federal tax.dupont never corrected the information it had given griggs and never told griggs that his tps benefit would be taxed.when griggs retired,dupont gave him a check for the amount of his tps benefit,less approximately in federal taxes.griggs ultimately paid approximately in taxes on his tps benefit,leaving griggs with a net tps distribution of.
griggs filed an action in north carolina state court,claiming that dupont negligently misrepresented to him the tax consequences of his tps election.because griggs claims were preempted by erisa,dupont removed the case to federal court.the district court concluded that dupont breached its fiduciary duty by failing to tell griggs that he was ineligible for a lump sum distribution,but that erisa provided no remedy for dupont wrong.
on appeal,this court concluded that some equitable remedy might be available to griggs,perhaps reinstatement of griggs to his prior position,or reinstatement to the benefit plan so that he could make a new tps election.accordingly,we remanded for further proceedings before the district court 
w e remand for further factual development with respect to whether the reinstatement of the parties to the status quo is appropriate.in determining whether such relief is appropriate,the district court consideration should be broader than the question of whether it would be appropriate,or even possible at this point,to reinstate griggs to his job.the district court should also consider whether it would be appropriate,or even possible,to return griggs to his preelection position so that he could make an alternate tps distribution election.in either event,we note that because reinstatement is equitable in nature,griggs is not entitled to a windfall if he is reinstated,we agree with the district court that he must return his tps benefit.indeed,griggs concedes that he would be required to return at least part of his tps distribution.we will leave it to the sound discretion of the district court to consider the subtleties that will surely arise,including what portion of griggs benefit he must return if equitable relief is appropriate,on whom the loss occasioned by the tax liability should fall.
griggs i,at.
after remand,the district court concluded that reinstating griggs to his prior position would not be appropriate.the court noted that griggs had been out of the work force since,and that the changes in the company and technological advancements in the industry would render griggs efficacy in his former position questionable,at best.moreover,reinstating griggs would require the displacement of an incumbent employee.thus,the court declined to order reinstatement.because griggs has not appealed this aspect of the district court order,we will not consider whether reinstatement of griggs to his prior position would have been proper.
the court did,however,conclude that it would be appropriate to allow griggs to rescind his election to take his tps benefit as a and to instead select the lifetime annuity option the court ordered dupont to pay griggs a lump sum of the monthly annuity payments,retroactive to the date of his original tps election.because the monthly annuity payment is fully taxable,the court determined that griggs would be taxed twice on the same money if he were required to repay dupont the gross amount of the tps benefit he recovered.the district court therefore ordered griggs to repay only the amount he actually received,net of taxes.the court ordered griggs to pursue all available avenues for recovering the state and federal taxes paid on the original tps distribution,and the court required griggs to involve dupont in this process,for example,by submitting his proposed tax filings to dupont days before filing with the irs and conferring with dupont about any communication he might receive from the irs.any money that griggs recovered was to be turned over to dupont.by separate order,the district court awarded griggs more than in attorney fees and costs.
dupont appeals.dupont first contends that the rescissionary remedy ordered by the district court is not proper in an erisa action.alternatively,dupont argues that even if rescission might,in general,be an appropriate remedy in some erisa cases,it is not appropriate in this case,because the parties can not be fully restored to their prior positions.finally,dupont challenges the award of attorney fees and costs.
griggs is proceeding under section a of erisa,which authorizes a beneficiary or participant to bring a civil action a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.a west.griggs is not seeking an injunction,but is instead seeking other appropriate equitable relief under section a b.the question,then,is whether the relief griggs sought and was awarded is appropriate equitable relief.
in mertens hewitt associates,d,the supreme court considered the scope of relief available under section a b.while recognizing that erisa roots are grounded in the law of trusts,the court rejected the argument that appropriate equitable relief under section a b should mean whatever relief a court of equity could have granted in a breach of trust case.the court noted that with regard to trust actions,courts of equity could award monetary damages,the quintessential legal remedy,and that courts of equity in other situations could establish purely legal rights and grant legal remedies which would otherwise be beyond the scope of its authority.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.given the broad powers available to equity courts,particularly in breach of trust actions,the supreme court explained that to read section a b as authorizing all relief available for breach of trust at common law would render meaningless congress attempt to limit relief to appropriate equitable relief 
since all relief available for breach of trust could be obtained from a court of equity,limiting the sort of relief obtainable under a to equitable relief in the sense of whatever relief a court of equity could provide in such a case would limit the relief not at all.we will not read the statute to render the modifier superfluous.
id.at.internal footnote omitted.the court therefore concluded that under section a,relief was limited to those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.id.at.
relying on mertens,this court in griggs i concluded that the remedy sought by griggs was typically available in equity and thus generally permissible under section a.see griggs i,at.in this appeal,dupont seeks to reargue this point,contending that it is inconsistent with the supreme court opinion in life annuity insurance knudson,d,which was issued after this court decision in griggs i.as we explain below,we do not believe that requires us to reject the conclusion we reached in griggs 
in,janette knudson,a beneficiary of an employee welfare benefit plan,was injured in a car accident.the plan included a reimbursement provision that provided the plan with the right to recover from the beneficiary any payment for benefits paid by the plan that the beneficiary is entitled to recover from a third party,at.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the plan covered more than of knudson medical expenses,and brought an action under section a seeking restitution of the medical expenses it had paid on knudson behalf.
relying on mertens,the supreme court noted that claim could be brought under erisa only if the relief it was seeking fell within those categories of relief that were typically available in equity.see,at.the court explained that restitution claims can sound in equity or at law,depending on the nature of the relief sought in the particular case 
a plaintiff could seek restitution in equity,ordinarily in the form of a constructive trust or an equitable lien,where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.a court of equity could then order a defendant to transfer title in the case of the constructive trust or to give a security interest in the case of the equitable lien to a plaintiff who was,in the eyes of equity,the true owner.but where the property sought to be recovered or its proceeds have been dissipated so that no product remains,the plaintiff claim is only that of a general creditor,and the plaintiff can not enforce a constructive trust of or an equitable lien upon other property of the defendant.thus,for restitution to lie in equity,the action generally must seek not to impose personal liability on the defendant,but to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant possession.
id.at.internal citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.the supreme court then noted that the funds sought by were not in knudson possession,but instead had been disbursed into a special needs trust to pay for knudson future medical expenses.thus was not seeking equitable relief under section a b,because it was not claiming particular funds that,in good conscience,belong to petitioners,but was instead arguing that it was contractually entitled to some funds for benefits that they conferred.id.at.the court therefore concluded that b ecause petitioners are seeking legal imposition of personal liability on respondents for a contractual obligation to pay money a does not authorize this action.id.at.
at one level,the supreme court in simply applied the rule announced in mertens to a specific category of equitable,a claim for restitution.did not alter the rule announced in mertens,and this court in griggs i reached its conclusion by applying the mertens rule.to that extent,then,griggs i can not be viewed as inconsistent with.
the court did,however,expand upon the mertens rule in a way that is relevant to this case,by focusing for the first time on the differences between restitution at law and restitution in equity i n the days of the divided bench,at.because griggs i was decided before,we did not then consider whether,in the days of the divided bench,the rescission claim asserted by griggs would have fallen on the law or equity side of the divide.we consider that question now.
a rescission is an avoidance of a transaction except as the parties might agree to the contrary,rescission will normally be accompanied by restitution on both sides.dan dobbs,handbook on the law of remedies at west.like the restitution claim involved in,a rescission claim can sound in law or in equity 
broadly speaking,rescission at law occurs when the plaintiff has a right to unilaterally avoid a contract.the rescission itself is effected when the plaintiff gives notice to the defendant that the transaction has been avoided and tenders to the defendant the benefits received by the plaintiff under the contract.see handbook on remedies,at.
once the plaintiff has rescinded,he is entitled to recover back what he gave under the contract.if the defendant does not give it back voluntarily,the plaintiff may sue for it thus the court in cases of rescission at law does not effect the rescission and the court only role is to get back the plaintiff property or its value.
id.at see also acton deliran,utah rescission at law is accomplished without the aid of a court.it is completed when,having grounds justifying rescission,one party to a contract notifies the other party that he intends to rescind the contract and returns that which he received under the contract.
an action for rescission in equity,however,is not a suit based upon the rescission already accomplished by the plaintiff,but a suit to have the court decree a rescission.handbook on remedies at.thus,
i n equity,the rescission is effected by the decree of the equity court which entertains the action for the express purpose of rescinding the contract and rendering a decree granting such relief.in other words,a court of equity grants rescission or cancellation,and its decree wipes out the instrument,and renders it as though it does not exist.
haumont security state bank,see also maumelle eskola,with rescission in equity the affirmative powers of the court of equity are used to rescind,or undo,the contract.omlid sweeney,a rescission action at law is essentially an action for restitution based upon a party prior unilateral rescission whereas an action in equity seeks to have the court terminate the contract and order restoration.resort to a court of equity is typically required if effective restitution can be obtained only through the cancellation or amendment of a document.see handbook on remedies at.
here,griggs can not unilaterally unretire by returning his tps benefit and returning to work.instead,griggs seeks to amend his tps election to select a monthly annuity rather than lump sum payment.thus,in this case,it is clear that the type of rescission involved is equitable,not legal 
dupont,however,contends that because the district court did not require griggs to repay the gross amount of the tps lump sum benefit,this case actually involves partial rescission,which dupont contends is a remedy that was not typically available in a court of equity.thus,dupont argues that prohibits griggs claim.
this argument is premised on an assumption that courts of equity always required full or complete restoration of the benefits exchanged in every case where a plaintiff sought rescission of an instrument.we acknowledge that support for such a proposition can be found in some of the leading commentaries on the subject.see handbook on remedies at the general rule is that the adult plaintiff must make restoration of what he got under the contract in order to get rescission,and his inability to do so will not excuse such restoration.in such a case,he may be permitted to recover damages,but rescission will be barred by his inability to make restoration to the defendant.richard lord,williston on contracts ed.ordinarily,one can not in equity seek to rescind a contract on the ground of fraud and,at the same time,retain the benefits derived from that contract t he decree in such a suit will provide,not simply for the return by the defendant of what was wrongfully acquired,but for the restoration of the consideration by the plaintiff.similar language also appears in many cases discussing equitable rescission.see pinter dahl,d noting that equitable rescission provides for restoration of the status quo by requiring the buyer to return what he received from the seller rexford southern woodland,the duty of one party to a contract,who seeks to rescind,to restore to the other party the amount received by him in part performance,or on account of the contract,is well settled and always enforced.rudman cowles communications,explaining that rescission is an equitable remedy that should be invoked where the status quo may be substantially restored if damages appear adequate and it is impracticable to restore the status quo,rescission is inappropriate national life ins.hanna,a ny person demanding the rescission of a contract to which he is a party must restore or offer to restore to the other party whatever he may have received under the contract in the way of money,property,or other consideration or benefit.quoting black on rescission and cancellation ed.hegarty american commonwealths power,explaining that for rescission to be granted,there must be a restoration of the status quo ante,not only of the complainant but as well of the defendant.it is therefore necessary that the rescinding party should offer or tender such a restoration to the other,and that the court should be able to effectuate it by decree.this is the settled law.citation omitted 
a closer review of the relevant authorities,however,reveals that the requirement is a general one that is subject to certain exceptions.various standards have been articulated when an exception to the rule is warranted.while a few courts speak in formal terms of very specifically delineated exceptions to the general rule requiring complete restoration of benefits it appears that what is most often applied is some form of a requirement to consider the equities of the situation and apply an exception to the general rule where required.see grymes sanders.a court of equity is always reluctant to rescind,unless the parties can be put back in statu quo.if this can not be done,it will give such relief only where the clearest and strongest equity imperatively demands it.kobatake dupont de nemours,cir explaining that in order to rescind,the defrauded party must restore or offer to restore to the other party whatever he has received by virtue of the contract if it is of any value.however,a party need not tender back what he is entitled to keep,and need not offer to restore where the defrauding party has made restoration impossible,or when to do so would be unreasonable.citation and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added ghidoni stone oak,r escission may be allowed without complete restoration where the particular circumstances indicate that to be the more equitable result.braman dodge,smith,so d,where restoration to the status quo is impossible,however,a court may still grant rescission,provided the equities between the parties can be balanced.rafferty heath,if in a particular case a court of equity finds that a condition exists which renders it impossible to restore the parties substantially to their original position,and that to rescind the contract would result in an injustice,the rescission will be refused.emphasis added fairbanks,morse walker,we understand the rule to be that the person who rescinds must always return all benefits received from the contract,and the status quo restored,not absolutely,but so far as possible,or the merits demand.williston on contracts the requirement of restoration,however,is subject to several exceptions w here on the particular facts it seems equitable to allow rescission without complete or perfect restoration of the consideration,the growing tendency favors the relief,and courts of law adopting the more liberal rule in equity no longer adhere to the strict construction generally upheld in the earlier decisions.thus,it is clear to us that courts of equity did not automatically deny relief to a plaintiff seeking rescission in cases where complete restoration of benefits could not be accomplished.instead,courts of equity would order rescission where the equities of the situation so demanded.
although this formulation of the exception is somewhat broad,we believe that it gives federal courts the flexibility necessary to appropriately balance the interests of participants and beneficiaries of erisa plans against the interests and obligations of erisa employers and fiduciaries.see united mcgill stinnett,cir in enacting erisa,congress intended for the judiciary to develop a body of federal common law to supplement the statute express provisions.thomason aetna life ins,cir where the statute is silent,courts must construct a common law that effectuates the policies underlying erisa.a rule generally requiring full restoration of benefits to accompany a grant of rescission protects the financial integrity of erisa plans,while permitting an exception to this rule when the equities of the situation demand provides a necessary incentive for erisa fiduciaries to take seriously their obligations to protect the interests of the participants and beneficiaries.because we conclude as a matter of federal common law that rescission in the erisa context may be granted even if a full restoration of the benefits conferred in the transaction can not be accomplished,we can not agree with dupont contention that the partial rescission ordered in this case means that the remedy is not one typically available in equity within the meaning of.
in light of these conclusions,what remains for our consideration is whether the partial rescission or,perhaps more accurately,the rescission accompanied by less than complete restoration of benefits ordered by the district court was appropriate.see a b authorizing a beneficiary or participant to bring a civil action to obtain other appropriate equitable relief emphasis added griggs i,at explaining that even if the redress sought by a beneficiary under erisa a is a classic form of equitable relief,it must be appropriate under the circumstances.as we explain below,we agree with dupont that it has been prejudiced by griggs delay in seeking a judicial rescission of his tps election.in our view,that prejudice to dupont renders inappropriate the relief fashioned by the district court.
if a plaintiff unreasonably delayed seeking rescissionary relief,courts of equity typically denied relief to the plaintiff.although the authorities are not entirely consistent on this point,the delay must generally have been prejudicial to the defendant to justify denial of relief.see restatement first of restitution an unreasonable delay in manifesting an avoidance of a transaction after the acquisition of knowledge of the facts terminates the power of rescission for fraud or mistake,and the consequent right to restitution,if the interests of the transferee or of a third person are harmed or were likely to be harmed by such delay.see also allen,cir an action for rescission must be initiated without unreasonable delay,unless the delay is caused by the party against whom rescission is sought.citation omitted baumel rosen,cir explaining that r escission is a radical move,and the law exacts the election of that course to be asserted without wait,and concluding that delay precluded plaintiffs request to rescind a stock sale hay albrecht,d,the defense of laches in an action seeking rescission is only applicable if there has been unreasonable delay in asserting a right coupled with prejudice to the opposing party as a result of the delay.dent long,so,though a party has the right to determine whether or not he will rescind a contract,so long as he has made no election,if,while considering,the position of the other party is materially affected or changed,he will be precluded from exercising his right to rescind.
as discussed above,any exception to the general rule of full restoration is dependent upon a determination that the equities of the situation demand making such an exception.if griggs unreasonably delayed seeking rescission and that delay prejudiced dupont,then it would be difficult for us to conclude that the less than complete restoration of benefits ordered by the district court was appropriate.
griggs became aware of dupont breach of fiduciary duty in the fall of,when he received his tps distribution and learned that he could not avoid the tax consequences of the distribution.he did not file suit until january,and even then he did not seek rescission of his tps sought legal damages for dupont negligent misrepresentation of the tax consequences of the tps election.it was not until march,after the district court ruled that griggs claim was preempted by erisa,that griggs first sought equitable relief from dupont.thus,more than four years elapsed between the time that dupont breached its fiduciary duty to griggs and griggs notified dupont that he intended to renounce his tps election.
as dupont points out,federal law requires that an action seeking a refund or credit for overpaid taxes must be filed within three years after the tax return was filed or two years after the tax was actually paid,whichever is later.see a west.assuming that griggs filed his tax return and paid the taxes on april,the statute of limitations under section a would have expired on april.if the action contemplated by section were griggs only means of recourse with regard to the federal taxes,then the district court requirement that griggs try to recover the taxes paid on the distribution would be largely meaningless and dupont quite clearly would have been prejudiced by griggs delay in seeking rescission.
at a june hearing before the district court after our first remand,however,a tax specialist for dupont explained that even at that date there was another avenue that griggs could pursue in the event that rescission were could seek relief under the mitigation provisions of the internal revenue code.see west longiotti united states,cir the mitigation provisions permit the correction of an error made in a prior tax year even though the ordinary limitations period has run.we need not decide whether griggs would in fact be entitled to recoup his tax payments under the mitigation provisions,and the record is not sufficiently developed to allow such a determination to be made even if we were so inclined.for purposes of this opinion it is sufficient to note the time has expired on what would have been griggs most direct path to recoupment of the taxes and that full recovery of the taxes paid is now an uncertain prospect at best.this uncertainty of recovery,which is borne solely by dupont,suggests that griggs delay in seeking rescission has worked to the detriment of dupont.
we should note,however,that griggs complained to dupont about the amount of his tps distribution immediately upon receiving it.thus,it can not be said that dupont had no knowledge of a potential problem with the transaction until griggs filed suit.moreover,the record indicates that around the time that the tps distribution was made,dupont itself considered the possibility of unscrambl ing the omelet by rewiring the money and changing griggs tps election from to monthly annuity.dupont decided against that course of action and took the position throughout the litigation that griggs tps election was irrevocable.
nonetheless,even with these considerations that weigh in griggs favor,we are constrained to conclude that griggs delayed unreasonably in seeking judicial relief.if griggs had promptly filed suit against dupont,the preemptive force of erisa would have been recognized sooner and griggs claims could have been whittled down to the only claim viable under erisa rescission of the tps election for the purposes of making a new election at a point when the surest means of recouping the tax payments would not have been faced with limitations problems.under the district court order,dupont bears the entire and very real risk that griggs will not recover the full amount of his tax payments.we see no way to view that risk,borne solely by dupont,as anything but a real and significant prejudice caused by griggs failure to promptly seek rescission of his tps election.
accordingly,we conclude that the relief fashioned by the district court in this case is not appropriate equitable relief,as required by erisa section a b,because the relief fails to account for the prejudice that griggs delay has worked upon dupont.but contrary to dupont argument,we do not believe that this conclusion compels us to deny griggs any form of rescissionary relief.
griggs delay in seeking rescission has made the ultimate recovery of the taxes paid on the tps distribution much more difficult and uncertain,and it therefore is not appropriate to require dupont to bear the risk that the taxes will not be recovered.griggs delay,however,has prejudiced dupont only because the district court order requires dupont to bear the risk that griggs will be unable at this late date to recoup the full amount of the taxes paid on the tps distribution.that is,dupont has identified no way in which griggs delay has prejudiced it with regard to the most important aspect of the district court requirement that griggs original tps election be rescinded and that griggs be permitted to elect a monthly distribution instead.to refuse to grant rescission to griggs because one aspect of the district court order was inappropriate,as dupont would have us do,would be unduly punitive to griggs and would permit dupont to skirt all responsibility for its breach of fiduciary duty,all without serving any of erisa goals.what we must instead consider is whether a rescissionary remedy can be fashioned that will eliminate the prejudice to dupont stemming from griggs delay in seeking rescission.see williston on contracts where circumstances permit,some courts also have allowed as a substitute for restoration of the consideration a deduction of the amount of it from the recovery against the wrongdoer.this is the most practicable and satisfactory disposition of many cases.henson james barker,so d,in the event restoration to the status quo is impossible,rescission may be granted if the court can balance the equities and fashion an appropriate remedy that would do equity to both parties and afford complete relief.restatement first of restitution the right of a person to restitution for a benefit conferred upon another in a transaction which is voidable for fraud or mistake is dependent upon his return or offer to return to the other party anything which he received as part of the transaction or,where specific restoration is not required under the rule stated in,its value,except where such thing f consists of money which can be credited if restitution is granted.
in our view,such a result can be accomplished by revising the district court order in the following respects.first,griggs must repay to dupont the net amount of tps distribution received by griggs.in return,griggs must be allowed to rescind his initial tps election and opt for a monthly annuity payment instead of a distribution.the amount of that monthly annuity payment,however,must be determined by reference to the tps distribution net of all taxes paid by griggs,rather than by the gross amount of the tps distribution.that is,those actuarial assumptions that yielded an annuity payment of per month based on a distribution amount of should be applied to calculate a monthly payment amount based on the that griggs must repay.because the monthly benefit that dupont must pay is reduced to an amount reflective of the net tps distribution that griggs must repay,the effect of the potential tax loss is borne by griggs,not dupont.thus,under this plan,there would be no reason to require griggs to take steps to recover his tax payments although it is certainly in his interest to do so,and griggs would have no obligation to turn over to dupont any amount that he might recover from the taxing authorities.all other aspects of the district court order would remain in effect,including the requirement that dupont obligation to make the monthly payments is retroactive to griggs original retirement date.
we raised the prospect of this form of relief at oral argument,and we permitted the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the issue.dupont primary argument against this proposal is that the proposed relief is simply another form of partial rescission,which dupont contends is not a typical equitable remedy.however,as we have already explained,the inability to compel full restoration of benefits received under the instrument to be rescinded does not automatically preclude the granting of equitable rescission.dupont argument,therefore,is without merit.
in our view,the relief we have described above is the most equitable remedy available for these unfortunate circumstances.because griggs delay in seeking rescission has lessened the likelihood that he will be able to recover the tax payments made on the distribution,our remedy properly forces griggs,not dupont,to bear the risk that the tax payments will not be fully recovered.under these circumstances,griggs delay in seeking rescission works no prejudice on dupont,thus making it proper and equitable to grant rescission without requiring griggs to make complete restoration of the benefits he received in connection with his initial election.at the same time,because the relief we describe allows griggs to rescind his election and instead receive a monthly payment for life albeit in a lesser amount,dupont breach of fiduciary duty does not go unremedied 
in his supplemental brief griggs counters the arguments made by dupont and contends that the remedy we proposed is a proper form of equitable relief that is appropriate under erisa.griggs,however,is less than enthusiastic about the prospect of the district court order being modified in such a manner.as we have explained in detail above,we believe that griggs delay in seeking rescission makes it inequitable for dupont to bear the risk that the tax payments will not be fully recovered.thus,the district court order as it stands can not be affirmed.dupont,of course,could be relieved of this inappropriate risk by our amending the district court order to require that griggs repay the gross amount of the tps distribution,an option that would likewise eliminate the need to require griggs to try to recover the tax payments or to turn over any such recovery to dupont.although there is no indication in the record that griggs would find this remedy preferable to the one we proposed at oral argument,there is no reason to foreclose that possibility at this stage of the proceedings.thus,on remand griggs will have the option of choosing from the two alternatives we have outlined above.griggs may elect to repay the gross amount of the tps benefit and to receive a monthly annuity based on that amount,or griggs may elect to repay the net amount of the tps benefit and receive a reduced monthly payment.
accordingly,while we affirm the district court decision to rescind griggs tps election,we conclude that it was inappropriate in this erisa action to place upon dupont the entire risk that griggs will be unable to recover the full amount of the taxes paid on the distribution.we therefore vacate the district court order and remand.on remand,the district court shall conduct additional proceedings as necessary to enter a revised order and judgment consistent with the option elected by griggs.
finally,we turn to dupont challenge to the district court award of attorney fees to griggs.erisa provides that in an action brought by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary,the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney fee and costs of action to either party.g.although the statute is silent in this regard,we have interpreted section as authorizing an award of attorney fees only to a prevailing party.see martin blue cross blue shield of,cir o nly a prevailing party is entitled to consideration for attorneys fees in an erisa action.
on appeal,dupont contends that griggs was not a prevailing party.relying on a statement made by griggs during discovery,dupont argues that griggs himself has declared that he would derive no material benefit from the relief fashioned by the district court.dupont claims that if the district court remedy would give griggs no material benefit,then griggs can not be viewed as a prevailing party.this argument is without merit.
we first note that dupont argument depends upon a mischaracterization of griggs statement.griggs did not indicate that he would receive no material benefit from the remedy ordered by the district court he indicated that he would perceive no material benefit if he were required to repay the gross amount of the tps distribution.more importantly,however,whether or not griggs is personally happy with the verdict he receives is not determinative of the legal question of whether he is a prevailing party.see smyth rivero,cir the designation of a party as a prevailing party is a legal determination which we review de novo.
as noted above,section does not include any prevailing party language.we believe,however,that our implied requirement must carry the same meaning as the phrase does when it is an explicit part of a statute.t he term prevailing party is a legal term of art.buckhannon bd.care home,west.dep t of health human resources,d.our respect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail.we have held that even an award of nominal damages suffices under this test.id.citation,internal quotation marks,and alteration omitted.
applying this standard,we conclude that griggs is a prevailing party under the district court original order and under either of the revised orders that we have outlined in our opinion today.griggs has succeeded in rescinding his original tps election and will now receive a monthly annuity payment rather than a taxable distribution.this clearly amounts to some relief on the merits of his claim,thus satisfying the buckhannon definition of a prevailing party.although griggs may not personally be satisfied with the extent of his victory,that fact is simply irrelevant to the question of whether he achieved some success on the merits of his claim.accordingly,we reject dupont claim that griggs general disgruntlement prevents him from being considered a prevailing party.
as to the award of attorney fees and costs,dupont challenges only griggs status as a prevailing party.dupont does not argue that even as a prevailing party,griggs is not entitled to an award of fees,see martin,at denzler questech,cir,nor does dupont challenge the amount of attorney fees awarded.because we conclude that griggs is a prevailing party,we affirm the district court award of attorney fees 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded.
i concur in the majority opinion except to the extent that it affirms the attorney fee award.i would vacate that award and direct the district court to reconsider on remand the issue of griggs entitlement to attorney fees.
from the beginning of this suit,the primary disputed issue has been griggs entitlement to compensation for the unanticipated tax burden he incurred when he received the lump sum distribution.dupont has steadfastly maintained that griggs is not entitled to such compensation or to any other remedy that shifts the risk of tax loss to dupont.when the district court awarded griggs just such a remedy,it also awarded him attorney fees.
in excercising its discretion to award attorney fees to griggs as a prevailing party undererisa,the district court considered five factors,including the relative merits of the parties positions,which the court ruled unquestionably favor ed griggs.ii.in determining the amount of fees to award,the district court considered factors,the most critical being the amount in controversy and the results obtained.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court concluded that griggs was fully successful in this litigation and therefore decline d to reduce griggs attorney fee award to account for limited success in the litigation.id.at.based on all of these factors,the district court awarded griggs in attorney fees,the full amount that griggs had requested.
on appeal,we now hold that the district court erred in shifting the risk of tax loss to dupont,and we therefore vacate the order granting relief and direct the district court to provide an alternative remedy.in so doing,we reverse the district court ruling on the critical issue in this case.indeed,given an opportunity to comment on the alternative remedy that we first proposed at oral argument,griggs stated that because it left the tax loss burden with him,it would fail to restore him to the status quo ante and would place him effectively in the same position he would be in
