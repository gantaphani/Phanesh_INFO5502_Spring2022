sarah metzger participated in a disability plan the plan sponsored by her employer,twin lakes national bank,and administered by unum life insurance company of america unum.the plan is subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.after unum denied metzger claim for benefits and affirmed denial in a subsequent administrative appeal,metzger sought relief in federal district court under erisa civil enforcement provision,a.she challenges both unum appeal procedures and its substantive denial of her claim.we first address whether unum violated h iii by failing to make reviewers reports available prior to a final decision on appeal,then consider metzger substantive claim.we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to unum on both claims,and affirm.
from october until april,metzger worked as a loan secretary at twin lakes national bank.her duties,which included filing,typing,and answering telephone calls,required her to walk intermittently throughout the day.in april,metzger filed a claim for disability benefits with unum.under the terms of the plan,metzger was required to show that she was both under the regular care of a doctor and limited from performing the material and substantial duties of her regular occupation due to sickness or injury.
on the claimant statement form provided by unum,metzger described her disability as type diabetes a muscle disorder.she averred that she had difficulty walking and was unable to lift things.in addition to her own statement,metzger submitted several items in support of her claim.her family doctor,hett,completed an attending physician statement,which listed a diagnosis of diabetes ii,polymyositis,hypertension,depression,and carpal tunnel syndrome.metzger also submitted two documents from her neurologist,abbas an august consultation report indicating that metzger had m uscle weakness,most likely secondary to myopathy,etiology to be determined and a september electromyography test result,in which abbas concluded that metzger muscle tissue suggested mild myopathic changes in both deltoids.metzger further included the results of a november biopsy of her left deltoid muscle,which described her muscle sample as consistent with an inflammatory myopathy but noted that the sample is inadequate to further define the nature of the inflammation.finally,metzger submitted a letter from her husband psychiatric consultant,stating that metzger might be required to take a leave of absence to care for her husband,who had severe psychiatric problems.
after receiving metzger claim,unum requested office notes from both hett and abbas.unum sent these notes and metzger other claim materials to kim brothers,a clinical consultant.brothers noted that metzger electromyography tests suggested only mild changes and that her muscle biopsy did indicate inflammatory myopathy but could not define the natre sic of inflammation.she concluded that it does not appear that metzger is receiving care from a physician for a condition that would impair her ability to work.unum forwarded brothers review to nancy beecher,who summarily commented agree with above.no change in status or finding at dod.it appears that there may be non medical issues impacting her decision to stop work.based on these assessments,unum denied metzger claim.in its formal decision letter,unum gave two reasons for denial metzger did not appear to be under the regular care of a doctor and she was not disabled within the meaning of the plan.
metzger timely filed an administrative appeal and submitted additional materials to unum,including a letter from hett and a statement of her own.hett letter explained that b ecause metzger condition of both the arthritis and myositis is chronic in nature and slowly progressive,he did not find it necessary to evaluate her on a frequent basis,but had talked with her informally at various opportunities while examining other family members.hett also reemphasized metzger weakened muscle tone and limited mobility,concluding that metzger should discontinue working to provide the opportunity for her to regain strength.metzger own statement detailed her difficulties coping with daily life and functioning in the workplace,but included no medical evidence.
unum sent metzger complete file for review to two medical professionals,registered nurse sheri hess and fluter,neither of whom had been involved in the original denial.in their medical reports,both hess and fluter concluded that denial was warranted and determined that hett second letter did not provide objective medical information sufficient to undermine unum initial decision.although the reports analyzed metzger medical evidence,they contained no new factual information and recommended denial on the same grounds as the initial claim determination.on july,unum sent a letter notifying metzger of its decision to uphold the denial of her claim.unum did not allow metzger to view hess or fluter reports until after the final decision on appeal.
metzger filed suit in federal district court seeking judicial review of the adverse decision.her complaint challenged unum denial on both substantive and procedural grounds,arguing that unum had improperly denied her claim and failed to provide a full and fair administrative review.metzger contended that full and fair review necessarily entailed an opportunity to respond to the opinions of hess and fluter during the course of her administrative appeal.
both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.in march,the district court issued a memorandum and order granting and denying each motion in part.it rejected metzger substantive claim,holding that the evidence before unum,or rather the lack thereof,was more than sufficient to support denial of the claim.however,it decided the procedural issue in favor of metzger on the basis that unum had denied her a full and fair review,and remanded so as to allow metzger an opportunity to respond to the opinions of hess and fluter.
pursuant to the remand order,metzger submitted additional materials to unum for a second administrative appeal.unum sent these new materials and the rest of metzger file to a physician,hill,and a vocational consultant for yet another review.both reviewers concluded that denial of the claim was appropriate,and on june,unum again denied metzger appeal.although metzger counsel requested that unum provide copies of any new expert reports prior to its final decision,unum did not furnish the assessments of hill or the vocational consultant until after it denied her second appeal.
on august,metzger filed a motion for order to show cause against unum in the district court,arguing that unum had violated the court prior order by again relying on consultants opinions without providing metzger an opportunity to respond.the court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion because its memorandum and order was a final order.metzger then appealed to this court.we declined to consider whether the order was final,and instead held that a district court has ancillary jurisdiction to enforce its orders and judgments even when final.metzger unum life ins.of america,cir unpublished.we thus remanded the case to the district court with instructions to consider metzger motion for order to show cause.id.
on remand,the district court determined that its prior memorandum and order had incorrectly held that unum review procedures failed to provide full and fair review.in a january memorandum and order,the district court amended its holding on the procedural issue,this time ruling in favor of unum,and denied metzger motion.having previously settled metzger substantive claim in favor of unum,the court dismissed the case.metzger timely appealed.
we initially consider whether we have jurisdiction to address metzger appeal.in denying the motion for order to show cause,the district court effectively amended its memorandum and order,which had previously decided the procedural issue in favor of metzger.although the district court had earlier determined that its order was final,we ultimately hold that the order was interlocutory.
