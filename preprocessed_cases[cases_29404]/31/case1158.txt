we consider whether an oregon prerequisite for state recognition of a proposed apprentice training it be necessary to serve the needs of the various apprenticeable occupations,or.stat,a requirement known as the needs preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.
background 
since the founding of the american republic,states have regulated training programs for individuals seeking to enter skilled crafts,in order to prevent their exploitation by employers.builders contractors of,nunn,cir.oregon has since promoted apprentice training programs by establishing a registration system for programs that meet specified criteria.see or.laws.oregon does not,however,mandate that employers hire only registered apprentices.instead,f or building contractors,a major benefit of hiring registered apprentices is that they can pay them a special rate for work that they perform on public construction projects,nunn,at,typically lower than the prevailing wage established by oregon law.see or.stat.contractors may pay this lower rate only if they hire apprentices from registered programs.id.
in oregon,the registered programs are run by local joint committees,id,in accordance with standards approved by the oregon state apprenticeship and training council council.id.at the heart of this case is the standard prescribing that,i n each locality where apprentices are employed,there shall be formed as many local joint committees as are necessary to serve the needs of the various apprenticeable occupations.id.emphasis added.this needs requirement limits the number of apprenticeship programs in a given geographic area.
the joint aspect of the local joint committees is that they consist of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees.id.employee representatives on joint committees need not be members of a labor organization or a collective bargaining unit.if there is no collective bargaining agreement that covers the trade or occupation that is the subject of the apprenticeship or training program administered by the local joint committee,an employee representative must be,or have been,a skilled practitioner of the particular trade or occupation that is the subject of the apprenticeship or training program administered by the local joint committee.id.
rules issued by oregon bureau of labor and industries further regulate joint apprenticeship committees.relevant to this case is one that explains the application of the needs requirement as follows 
the council will approve the creation of a new local joint committee,in an area already served by a committee in the same trade or craft,only if the applicant for the new program can first demonstrate to the satisfaction of the council by a preponderance of evidence that the existing program fails or refuses to address valid and legitimate needs of the applicant.
or.admin.another pertinent regulation requires that,a ll employers and their apprenticeable employees shall be afforded the opportunity to participate,on a basis,in existing programs.or.admin.
factual and procedural background 
in this case,the oregon columbia brick masons joint apprenticeship training committee and the oregon columbia cement masons joint apprenticeship training committee,two apprenticeship training committees not registered by the council,seek a declaratory judgment that oregon needs requirement for the establishment of new registered apprenticeship training committees is preempted by erisa.the two committees initially sought approval by the council in june.the council standards review subcommittee recommended against council approval three times between then and september,when the council finally denied the plaintiffs application.
in reviewing the appellants application for new registered apprenticeship training committees,a council subcommittee considered whether existing committees could meet the needs identified by appellants for their proposed programs.the existing registered apprenticeship committees represented that they could address all of the identified needs by incorporating some of the appellants proposed curriculum into their programs.they also offered appellants an opportunity to participate in curriculum development.ultimately,the subcommittee recommended that the council deny approval because of perceived deficiencies in appellants proposed curriculum.the subcommittee also doubted that the existing registered apprenticeship committees could not or would not meet appellants stated needs.
before the full council there was extensive debate on the appellants application,but the application was ultimately rejected.appellants argued,first,that they had an unmet need related to philosophical differences,because the existing registered apprenticeship training committees included union members.the council did not recognize this philosophical difference as an unmet need,reasoning that an oregon administrative rule mandates access to existing programs,see or.admin,and thus that it could not sanction a program premised on excluding participants.
second,appellants argued that cost efficient training was a need unmet by the existing programs.the council was not persuaded by this position,as appellants refused to fully document costs or provide cost justifications for their training cost claims,while at the same time acknowledging that all known costs were not included in the original estimates provided to the subcommittee and division staff.
after the council denied their application,the appellants brought this declaratory action in federal court.the plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that oregon revised statute,delineating the needs requirement,and oregon administrative rule are preempted by erisa,and also sought related injunctive relief.both appellants and appellees presented declarations concerning the factual background of appellants rejected application for registration as apprenticeship training committees.in addition,appellees offered undisputed evidence that oregon registered apprenticeship training programs include both programs supported by independent funds created exclusively for that purpose and others supported by alternate arrangements not involving the creation of a separate fund.according to an affidavit from stephen simms,a member of the council,at least apprentice training committees maintain funds for the purpose of financing their training programs,and at least do not.the unfunded committees are supported either directly by the participating employer or employers or have made contractual arrangement for the operation of their programs.
on for summary judgment,the magistrate judge granted summary judgment to the appellees.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
at the core of this case is erisa broadly worded preemption provision.mcclendon,d.it provides 
except as provided in subsection b of this section,the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter iii of this chapter shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section a of this title and not exempt under section b of this title.
a emphasis added.
in california division of labor standards enforcement dillingham construction,d,the supreme court considered whether erisa preempts a california law,similar to the oregon statute,requiring contractors of state public works projects to pay the prevailing wage unless the contractor hires apprentices from approved programs.the court used a inquiry in apply ing the unhelpful text of erisa provision,id.at.first,does the law refer to erisa plans second,if not,does the law have an impermissible connection with erisa plans id.at see also nunn,at applying the dillingham criteria.
appellants maintain that we should not apply the dillingham analysis afresh to this case,as we have already decided,in associated general contractors smith,cir,that a needs requirement for state registration of an apprenticeship program is preempted by erisa.smith,however,relied substantially on our overturned decision in dillingham construction,county of sonoma,cir,rev,d.see smith,at.furthermore,the supreme court,in reversing our decision in dillingham,substantially altered the erisa preemption analysis for apprenticeship plans.consequently,we can not rely on smith,but instead must apply the erisa preemption analysis developed by the supreme court in dillingham to the oregon needs requirement.see miller gammie,cir en banc holding that when intervening supreme court case law is clearly irreconcilable with a prior circuit decision,a panel of this court is bound by the later and controlling authority,and should reject the prior circuit opinion.
dillingham held,first,that california prevailing wage law did not refer to erisa plans because approved apprenticeship programs in california were not necessarily erisa plans.at.the court identified as critical to its analysis the consideration that among california approved programs were both joint apprenticeship committees,those sponsored by the collective efforts of management and organized labor,that must maintain erisa trust funds,and those maintained by a single employer,whose costs can be defrayed out of that employer general assets.id.at.this distinction,id.at,was critical to dillingham holding that california approved apprenticeship programs do not refer to erisa plans.
this distinction first arose in massachusetts morash,d.in morash,the court,interpreting the term employee welfare benefit plan in erisa,see,recognized a distinction between vacation benefits paid out of an accumulated fund and those paid out of an employer general assets.dillingham,at.c ompelled by erisa object and policy,the court concluded that the policy at issue in morash,whereby vacation benefits were paid out of general assets,was not an erisa employee welfare benefit plan.id.
in considering california approval requirement for apprenticeship training committees,dillingham relied on the factual record concerning whether california approved apprenticeship programs maintained trust funds.evidence indicated that california had joint apprenticeship programs and unilateral ones.id.at.although the record did not indicate whether some of the unilateral programs had separate funds,dillingham emphasized that n o party ha d established that all programs d id.id.first emphasis added.the court concluded on this basis that the prevailing wage law function ed irrespective of the existence of an erisa plan.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
similarly,in nunn,we considered whether a california regulation governing the compensation paid registered apprentices working on private construction projects refers to erisa plans.at.we noted that there were unilateral apprenticeship programs,id.at,and that i n the pertinent regulation there is no specific provision that makes erisa plans essential to its operation or that acts immediately or exclusively upon erisa plans.id.at.we concluded that the statute in question survives associated builders challenge under this reference to prong of erisa preemption analysis.id.
the question that we must answer with reference to oregon needs requirement,then,is whether it is indifferent to the funding,and attendant erisa coverage,of apprenticeship programs.dillingham,at.see also nunn,at.appellants argue that although many oregon apprenticeship programs do not in fact maintain trust funds,they are legally required to do so,either by the labor management relations act lmra,or by erisa itself.they maintain that if either argument is correct,then the needs requirement refers to erisa plans and is,therefore,preempted.we disagree.
section a of the lmra provides 
it shall be unlawful for any employer or association of employers or any person who acts as a labor relations expert,adviser,or consultant to an employer or who acts in the interest of an employer to pay,lend,or deliver,or agree to pay,lend,or deliver,any money or other thing of value 
to any representative of any of his employees who are employed in an industry affecting commerce or 
to any labor organization,or any officer or employee thereof,which represents,seeks to represent,or would admit to membership,any of the employees of such employer who are employed in an industry affecting commerce 
a.this general prohibition is not applicable,however,with respect to money or other thing of value paid by any employer to a trust fund established by such representative for the purpose of defraying costs of apprenticeship or other training programs.id.c.thus,while an employer may not pay any money directly to a labor organization or other employee representative,an employer may contribute to an apprenticeship trust fund established by such an organization or representative.if a trust fund is established to comply with the lmra,then erisa governs the implementation and governance of that fund.see dillingham,at.
in general,the purpose of a of the lmra is to prevent corruption of collective bargaining through bribery of employee representatives by employers,extortion by employee representatives,and the possible abuse by union officers of the power which they might achieve if welfare funds were left to their sole control.arroyo united states,d.its coverage extends not just to official bargaining representatives but to any person authorized by the employees to act for them in dealing with their employers.united states ryan.
the appellants maintain that to comply with the lmra,any approved oregon apprenticeship training committee must establish a trust fund to defray the costs of apprenticeship training,even if its employee members are not members of collective bargaining units or traditional labor organizations.they point to no evidence,however,that any oregon apprenticeship training committees not involving union representatives have in fact established lmra trust funds,and we know from the record that at least oregon joint apprenticeships have not.
we seriously doubt the viability of the appellants lmra argument.the lmra core purpose is to prevent corruption of employee representatives who are chosen by,and have a statutory duty to represent the interests of,other employees.although the apprenticeship training committees that include collective bargaining representatives clearly fall within the definition of labor organization set forth in,those committees on which the employee representatives are not collective bargaining representatives do not.employee representatives on committees that do not involve a collective bargaining agreement must only be or have been a skilled practitioner in the particular trade or occupation that is the subject of the apprenticeship or training program administered by the local joint committee.or.stat.emphasis added see also or.admin.a b.moreover,employee representatives need not be employees,and are chosen by the council,not the employees themselves see or.admin.the local joint committees,consequently,are not necessarily organization s in which employees participate,because none of its members need be employees,and employees do not participate in the sense that they select the members of the committees.further,such committees do not raise the concern of corrupting the discharge of duties by employee representatives selected under the processes of the national labor relations act,that is at the core of lmra.
in sum,whether a committee composed of government appointed individuals is a labor organization for purposes of the lmra is at least highly debatable.in any event,there is no reason in this erisa preemption case to decide an entirely hypothetical question concerning a separate statute,the lmra.if the operation of some or all of the unfunded plans in oregon is illegal under the lmra,that is a matter for lmra enforcement.see d e providing for criminal penalties and injunctive relief.nothing in dillingham suggests that its approach to the preemption question depends on the validity of funded or unfunded plans on independent legal grounds.instead,after observing in passing that c of the lmra requires a separate fund for joint apprenticeship committees,dillingham went on to identify t he existence of that fund not whether the lmra might be read to require the existence of a fund that in actuality does not the circumstance that triggers erisa coverage.at.emphasis a
