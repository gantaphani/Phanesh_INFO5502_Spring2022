in this erisa benefits suit for long term disability ltd payments,the sum owed to the plaintiff,jane doe,turns on the year of disability onset,as the prior year earnings determine the monthly benefit amount.the parties disagree on whether doe disability began in or in the insurer has paid doe the benefits owed using a january onset date,but not the benefits owed if the onset date is in november.the difference,we are told,amounts to over in payments.
the wrinkle in the case is that the disability insurance involved is own occupation insurance,for which an additional premium is charged.doe own occupation was environmental lawyer.yet when the insurer assessed whether and when doe became disabled,it chose not to use the material duties of an environmental lawyer,but rather those of a lawyer.in doing so,it eviscerated the own occupation coverage,and its evaluation as to doe disability onset date was based on the wrong standards.its denial of benefits from an onset date no later than november was arbitrary and capricious.the district court entered judgment on the record for the insurer.we reverse.
background 
doe worked at a maine law firm for more than years,and for many years she was an equity partner.in august,doe became a partner and remained employed in that capacity for about six months thereafter.over the course of,doe billed far fewer hours than she had in previous years.
defendant standard insurance company standard is the claim administrator and insurer of the employee welfare benefit plan the plan offered by doe law firm to its employees.the plan was insured by an ltd policy the policy,which was also issued by standard and which covered doe.the policy provides that a claimant is disabled if she is unable to perform with reasonable continuity the material duties of her own occupation.the policy also promises lawyers with at least five years experience that their own occupation is the one legal subject matter area or type of legal practice in which they specialize,provided they have earned at least of their gross professional service fee income in that area or type of practice during the months before disability onset.there is no dispute that doe met these criteria for specialty coverage.the policy defines material duties as the essential tasks,functions and operations,and the skills,abilities,knowledge,training and experience,generally required by employers from those engaged in a particular occupation that can not be reasonably modified or omitted.
under the policy,those who become disabled due to a mental disorder may receive ltd benefits for,at most,months.the monthly benefit amount depends on the claimant predisability earnings.the predisability earnings depend in turn on the claimant income during the prior tax year that is,the calendar year before the year of disability onset.doe income in was only of what it had been in,and so whether she became disabled in or in significantly affects the calculation of her monthly benefit payments.
for context,we recite briefly some of the medical evidence relevant to doe ltd claim.on november,during her regular appointment with her gynecologist,kathleen petersen,doe confessed that she had become bone crushingly exhausted in the preceding year and had lost any interest in life,among other symptoms.petersen suspected that doe was afflicted with a mental health problem.she recommended that doe seek counseling advice that doe resisted and also doubled doe prescribed daily dose of citalopram,an antidepressant,which doe had been taking for roughly four years.
on december,doe met for the first time with frederick white,a clinical psychologist.white notes from that visit state that doe exhibited numerous symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder including suicidal ideation and diminished attention,concentration,and memory and he diagnosed her with that disorder.in two appointments that same month,white observed that doe was having continuing mental disorder with suicidal ideation.
petersen saw doe on january,after having discussed doe condition with white earlier that day.in her notes,petersen observed that doe did not appear to be an imminent suicide risk,but that doe was severely depressed.when petersen asked doe about hospitalization for doe depression,doe responded that she could not,that it would be a severe detriment to her law practice.at appointments later in january,white and petersen continued to observe that doe was dealing with significant depression.
on february,doe met with her primary care physician,donna conkling,for the first time since april.conkling postponed doe scheduled physical exam because doe was close to tears and appear ed anxious,depressed,and exhausted.doe continued to report problems with severe depression and thoughts of or suicide.doe also relayed that h er husband was not completely supportive of her stopping work.doe last day of logging hours of work at the firm was january.
doe filed an ltd claim with standard on or about march.she reported that she had suffered depression for approximately five years but became unable to work in october.as symptoms stemming from her mental health and related psychological disorders,she listed,inter alia,unable to process or think clearly while at work,chronic fatigue,migraine headaches,and inability to function.
in february,petersen,conkling,and white had independently completed attending physician statements in connection with doe ltd claim.each physician diagnosed doe with severe depression.each also stated that he or she recommended doe stop working.
on april,doe former law firm sent standard a job description for doe specific occupation,environmental lawyer.standard had requested the description from the law firm two days earlier,along with doe payroll history and timesheets.the firm also sent doe biography,which outlined doe career accomplishments and specific areas of expertise.standard never told doe or her representatives that the provided description was incomplete or inadequate.
standard asked jan cottrell,one of its vocational case manager s,to evaluate doe claim of disability.on april,cottrell identified doe own occupation under the policy as lawyer,not environmental lawyer.having chosen lawyer,cottrell concluded that the material duties of a lawyer were most reasonably represented by the dictionary of occupational titles dot occupation of lawyer.the dot is a compendium of job descriptions and requirements,formerly published by the department of labor,which aims to define jobs as they are performed in the national economy and is commonly used by insurers.see mcdonough aetna life ins,cir.see also,armani nw.mut.life ins,cir.there is no separate dot job description for an environmental lawyer,and standard did not look elsewhere for a definition.
doe claim specialist at standard next asked cottrell to respond to the job description received from doe law firm.on april,cottrell responded that doe did not meet the policy definition of trial attorney but that doe own occupation would be the one legal subject matter area of environmental law.in spite of that conclusion,cottrell reiterated that the dot lawyer description most reasonably represented doe own occupation.
on june,standard denied doe claim.the claim specialist explained that standard,having used the generic lawyer job description,had found doe to be disabled from january,onward but not disabled beyond the policy day benefit waiting period.on january,doe took her first formal appeal and submitted additional information from white and petersen 
on march,standard told doe that it would approve her claim and that it would use january,as the disability onset date.on may,doe took her second appeal and submitted additional statements from white,who wrote in support of a onset date.
christopher powers,another senior benefits review specialist at standard,sought another vocational review from karol paquette,a vocational case manager at standard.in a memo to powers,dated july,paquette stated that the information in doe file document ed a significant change in the character of doe work activity around november,such as area of specialization or subject matter,or in the
