mary midgett appeals the district court grant of the motion for summary judgment brought by aetna life insurance company,broadspire services,washington group international,and washington group international short term disability plan collectively the defendants on her claim for disability benefits.midgett argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants because she was denied a full and fair review of her disability claim and because the plan administrator denial of her claim was arbitrary and capricious.midgett also appeals the district court dismissal of her claim for disability benefits for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,arguing that seeking disability benefits would have been futile.we reject midgett arguments and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
midgett worked as an assistant contract manager for washington group international,washington group.midgett participated in the company and disability plans,which were governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.broadspire services,was the administrator for washington group disability plan when midgett filed her disability claim,but aetna life insurance company later replaced broadspire as the plan administrator when it purchased broadspire disability unit.pursuant to the washington service agreement,broadspire was responsible for rendering all claim determinations regarding the terms of the disability plan and possessed the discretionary authority to render initial,first and second level appeal claim determinations,including interpreting the terms of the plan and otherwise making eligibility decisions consistent therewith.
the medical evidence in midgett case is extensive and conflicting.ruben tejada wrote a letter to midgett employer in december,observing that midgett had been under his care since and describing her condition as follows she suffers from various physical maladies,including avascular necrosis and fibromyalgia.during the past years she has had two major surgeries and various minor surgeries she is on numerous medications to control her medical problems,but even with the medications will have episodes of fibromyalgia.tejada stated that he had known midgett to work against better judgment in fear of losing her job if absent and recommended that she be accommodated in all ways to ensure she is not subjected to additional stressors.
on march,michael moore,a hand surgeon,opined that midgett clinical history,physical examination,and studies are consistent with degenerative arthritis of the right long finger mp joint.moore noted that midgett was fitted for a splint to wear as needed and that she will buddy tape the index,long,and ring fingers when she uses her right hand.that same day,reginald rutherford,a neurologist,administered a motor nerve conduction study,a sensory nerve conduction study,and a needle examination.the results of these tests were normal,and rutherford stated that t here is no evidence via electrodiagnostic parameters to suggest cervical radiculopathy,brachial plexopathy,ulnar neuropathy or median neuropathy right upper extremity.on march,and march,midgett visited john harris,who concluded that midgett suffered from fatigue and fibromyalgia.
on march,midgett filed a claim for disability benefits,reporting her last day of work as march,and her first day of disability as march.midgett claims examiner informed midgett that her medical information would be forwarded for a peer review.
michael courtney,a chiropractor,examined midgett on march,and opined that midgett was disabled.yvonne sherrer,a rheumatologist,completed a peer review of midgett medical record on march.sherrer reviewed medical information received from harris,including office notes from midgett march and march appointments and a march lab report.sherrer noted that although midgett had a history of fibromyalgia,the march and march progress notes did not document significant abnormalities on musculoskeletal exam or objective functional limitation.sherrer also spoke with harris,who stated that he had been treating midgett for approximately three weeks and did not feel comfortable making a disability determination.sherrer concluded that the record did not support a functional impairment that would prevent midgett from performing her sedentary duties as an assistant contract manager.
following a new patient consultation on april,tamer alsebai,a rheumatologist,stated that he was unsure whether midgett would be able to return to work because of her multiple conditions and medications.mris of midgett lumbar and cervical spine performed that day revealed evidence of grade i degenerative anterior spondylolisthesis and m ultilevel spondyloarthropathic changes.
sherrer reviewed midgett chiropractic records and an additional job description as part of a second peer review completed on april.sherrer concluded that this additional information did not alter her previous determination,noting that although the chiropractic report indicated that midgett suffered from degenerative changes,it failed to document functional abnormalities that would be expected to prevent midgett from doing sedentary or light work.a bone densitometry study conducted on april revealed o steoporosis involving the right hip.
on april,midgett claims examiner informed midgett that broadspire had denied her disability claim but that she was entitled to appeal that decision.midgett appealed broadspire decision on may,submitting additional medical records for review.
following the denial of her disability claim,midgett was examined by a number of other doctors.on april,she was examined by david silas,a neurologist,whose impression was that midgett suffered from lumbar disc disease,cervical degenerative disc disease,essential tremor,and fibromyalgia.in may,harold chakales diagnosed midgett with cervical degenerative disc disease,grade i spondylolisthesis,fibromyalgia,and osteoporosis.he opined that midgett had suffered from total disability since march,and might not be able to return to work.a nerve conduction study conducted on may,revealed normal nerve conduction velocity in midgett left leg and p robable mild chronic bilateral radiculopathies,right worse than left.
four additional peer reviews were completed in july.first,wendy weinstein,an internal medicine specialist,acknowledged midgett fibromyalgia diagnosis but found no functional impairment that precluded midgett from performing her sedentary job duties.second,vaughn cohan,a neurologist,concluded that there was no evidence that midgett could not perform her sedentary job duties despite her fibromyalgia,musculoskeletal pain,and degenerative arthritis.cohan also noted that i t is stated in the literature that patients with fibromyalgia syndrome do much better by remaining active than by allowing themselves to avoid normal activities of daily living and activities.third,lawrence burstein,a psychologist,found that midgett medical record did not support the presence of psychological impairments that would prevent her from performing the core functions of her job.fourth,jacques caldwell,a rheumatologist,concluded that midgett medical record did not reflect the existence of a rheumatologic condition that would prevent her from performing her job duties and that there was no evidence that her medications affected her ability to work.
in a letter dated august,chakales stated that midgett was permanently totally disabled and unable to work,explaining that she was unable to work hours per week,required periods of rest,and must avoid prolonged sitting,stooping,and bending.on august,midgett visited bruce safman,who observed that midgett examination did not demonstrate any significant pathology in the upper or lower extremities or trunk,her pain is under fairly good control,and i t was difficult to discern whether anxiety is playing a role in her symptoms.following an exam on august,tracy phillips reported that midgett could sit for two hours and stand or walk for two hours in an workday and could lift up to ten pounds occasionally and never lift more than ten pounds.broadspire denied midgett appeal on august,and aetna received midgett appeal on october,midgett was awarded social security disability benefits on september.
barry mcdonald,a psychologist,examined midgett on six occasions between february and april of.in his psychological assessment,mcdonald concluded that it is unlikely that midgett could perform her former duties adequately.
in a deposition taken on may,chakales explained that midgett suffered from symptomatic first degree spondylolisthesis,with chronic nerve root compression,primarily on the left side,as well as symptomatic cervical spondylosis.chakales stated that he did not believe that midgett could withstand the rigors of employment,and he reiterated that,in his opinion,midgett was permanently and totally disabled.
lawrence blumberg,an orthopedic surgeon,elana mendelssohn,a neuropsychologist,and jakob ulfarrson,a rheumatologist,completed peer reviews in june.each peer reviewer concluded that the medical evidence did not indicate that midgett was suffering from a condition that would prevent her from performing her job duties.following the completion of these peer reviews,aetna denied midgett appeal.
midgett brought an action against the defendants in federal district court pursuant to,seeking a declaratory judgment that she was entitled to and disability benefits.washington group disability plan moved to intervene,and,along with aetna and broadspire,moved to dismiss midgett disability claim.the district court granted both motions.
midgett and the defendants filed for summary judgment.the district court denied midgett summary judgment motion and granted the defendants summary judgment motion,holding that the plan administrator denial of midgett disability claim was not arbitrary or capricious in light of the following considerations harris,midgett primary care physician,was uncomfortable classifying midgett as disabled numerous treating physicians notes were silent as to disability none of the peer review physicians found midgett disabled and plan administrators need not accord greater weight to treating physicians than peer review physicians.midgett aetna life ins,wl,at.july.

on appeal,midgett argues that the district court erred in granting the defendants motion for summary judgment as to her disability claim and in dismissing her disability claim.

full and fair review 
midgett first argues that the district court erred in granting the defendants motion for summary judgment as to her disability claim because she did not receive the full and fair review of that claim required by.under erisa,employee benefit plans must afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.in accordance with the authority of,sets forth minimum requirements for employee benefit plan procedures pertaining to claims for benefits.a.
following broadspire denial of midgett appeal,blumberg,mendelssohn,and ulfarrson completed peer reviews in which they concluded that the medical evidence did not support the conclusion that midgett was suffering from a condition that would prevent her from performing her job duties.aetna relied on these peer reviews in denying midgett appeal.
midgett alleges that aetna failed to provide her with access to the peer reviews of blumberg,mendelssohn,and ulfarrson until after aetna rendered its decision.according to midgett,she was entitled to review and rebut these peer reviews before aetna denied her appeal.in support of her argument,midgett relies principally on our decision in abram cargill,cir.in abram,the plan administrator denied the claimant disability claim.id.at.on administrative appeal,the claimant submitted a functional capacity evaluation fce supporting her disability claim.id.the plan administrator sent the fce to an independent medical examiner,who concluded that the fce did not establish that the claimant was disabled.id.on the basis of the independent medical examiner report,the plan administrator denied the claimant appeal almost a month after its decision was due.id.the claimant appealed the decision to the district court,which granted summary judgment to the plan administrator.id.
we explained in abram that f ull and fair review includes the right to review all documents,records,and other information relevant to the claimant claim for benefits,and the right to an appeal that takes into account all comments,documents,records,and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim.id.at.the plan administrator solicited the independent medical examiner report after the deadline for an appeals decision had passed and sent the report to the claimant only after the plan issued its final denial decision.id.we stated that t his type of gamesmanship is inconsistent with full and fair review.id.quoting wilczynski lumbermens mut.cas,cir.we concluded that t he process used by the plan was not consistent with a full and fair review because the claimant was not provided access to the report that served as the basis for the plan denial of benefits until after the plan decision.id.noting that a claimant is caught off guard when new information used by the appeals committee emerges only with the final denial,we held that the claimant should have been permitted to review and respond to the report.id.
midgett contends that just as the claimant in abram was denied the opportunity to review and dispute the independent medical examiner report,she was denied the opportunity to review and rebut the peer reviews of blumberg,mendelssohn,and ulfarrson.but this case presents one of those exceptional circumstances where a change in the law renders a prior decision.buchholz aldaya,cir.in,the department of labor amended the minimum procedural requirements for benefit claims under employee benefit plans.the amended requirements apply to claims filed under a group health plan on or after the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after july,but in no event later than january,and to claims filed under other plan s on or after january,july,codified at o.because the claimant in abram filed for benefits in,at,the amended department of labor requirements were inapplicable to her claim.
the regulatory scheme applicable to the claim in abram required employee benefit plans to establish and maintain an appeal procedure under which a claimant was entitled to r eview pertinent documents,g ii,but it did not specify what constituted a pertinent document.in light of the substantial public confusion concerning the meaning of the term pertinent,the department of labor substituted relevant for pertinent and provide d a specific definition of that term in its amendments.the regulatory scheme governing the claim in abram also failed to specify when a claimant was entitled to review pertinent documents.g ii.but the amended regulations set forth specific stages in the claims process at which a claimant is entitled to review the materials relevant to his or her claim.
section h of the amended regulations is entitled appeal of adverse benefit determinations.h.section h requires employee benefit plans to establish and maintain a procedure by which a claimant shall have a reasonable opportunity to appeal an adverse benefit determination.under h iii,a plan only provides a claimant with a full and fair review of a claim and adverse benefit determination if the claims procedures p rovide that the claimant shall be provided,upon request and free of charge,reasonable access to,and copies of,all documents,records,and other information relevant to the claimant claim for benefits.the adverse benefit determination referred to throughout h is the plan administrator initial denial of a claim for benefits.see price xerox,cir stating that the regulation language indicates that only the initial denial of benefits is an adverse benefit determination.accordingly,following an initial denial of a claim for benefits,h iii entitles a claimant to review the materials relevant to his or her claim.midgett concedes that she received copies of her administrative record following broadspire initial denial of her disability claim.
section i of the amended regulations sets forth the time limits within which a claimant must be notified of a benefit determination on review.i emphasis added.section i provides as follows in the case of an adverse benefit determination on review,the plan administrator shall provide such access to,and copies of,documents,records,and other information described in paragraphs j,j,and j of this section as is appropriate.emphasis added.section j,in turn,refers to all documents,records,and other information relevant to the claimant claim for benefits.the inclusion of the language on review in i differentiates the initial adverse benefit determination from later internal appeals of it.price,at.accordingly,following a denial of a or appeal,i entitles a claimant to review the materials relevant to his or her claim on appeal.
midgett does not contend that she was denied the opportunity to review materials in connection with broadspire denial of her appeal indeed,because the peer reviews of blumberg,mendelssohn,and ulfarrson were completed subsequent to the denial of her appeal,they were only relevant to aetna determination of her appeal.see m defining material as relevant if,inter alia,it w as relied upon in making the benefit determination or w as submitted,considered,or generated in the course of making the benefit determination.nor does midgett contend that she was denied access to the peer reviews following aetna denial of her appeal.instead,she argues that she was entitled to review and rebut the peer reviews before aetna denied her appeal.but the amended regulations state that midgett was entitled to access those peer reviews only after aetna made its adverse benefit determination on review.i.
section h iii,another amendment to the department of labor regulations that was inapplicable to the claim in abram,also runs counter to midgett argument that she was entitled to review and rebut the peer reviews of blumberg,mendelssohn,and ulfarrson prior to aetna determination of her appeal.section h iii clarifies the nature of review to which a claimant is entitled.this section states that the claims procedures of a group health plan only provide a claimant with a full and fair review of a claim and adverse benefit determination if the procedures p rovide that,in deciding an appeal of any adverse benefit determination that is based in whole or in part on a medical judgment,the appropriate named fiduciary shall consult with a health care professional.conspicuously absent from h iii is any requirement that the claimant be given the opportunity to review and rebut the health care professional conclusion.
furthermore,we agree with the observation of the tenth circuit that requiring a plan administrator to grant a claimant the opportunity to review and rebut medical opinions generated on administrative appeal would set up an unnecessary cycle of submission,review,and.metzger unum life ins.of,cir.such a cycle would undoubtedly prolong the appeal process,which,under the regulations,should normally be completed within days.id.citing i i.as noted by the tenth circuit,because the amendments to did not apply to the claim in abram,we did not consider the potential for circularity of review in that case.id.at.
finally,our interpretation of the full and fair review to which a claimant is entitled under,as clarified in,is supported by the department of labor rationale for adopting the definition of relevant in m.the department of labor explained that it believes that this specification of the scope of the required disclosure of relevant documents will serve the interests of both claimants and plans by providing clarity as to plans disclosure obligations,while providing claimants with adequate access to the information necessary to determine whether to pursue further appeal,emphasis added.according to the department of labor,the purpose of the production of these documents is to enable a claimant to evaluate whether to appeal an adverse determination.glazer reliance standard life ins,cir.and the determination that claimants are entitled to access to relevant documents generated during the administrative nullify the department explanation.access to documents during the course of an administrative decision would not aid claimants in determining whether to pursue further appeal,because claimants would not yet know if they faced an adverse decision.metzger,at.
the amendments to enacted in,which were inapplicable to the claim in abram,indicate that the full and fair review to which a claimant is entitled under does not include reviewing and rebutting,prior to a determination on appeal,the opinions of peer reviewers solicited on that same level of appeal.therefore,we conclude that midgett was not denied a full and fair review of her claim by aetna failure to provide her the opportunity to review and rebut the peer reviews of blumberg,mendelssohn,and ulfarrson prior to denying her appeal.
midgett remaining contentions in support of her argument that she was denied a full and fair review of her claim are without merit.midgett emphasizes that the peer reviews were performed by physicians who had never examined her the peer reviewers were unidentified other than by name,title,and academic degree the peer reviews appear on a form bearing broadspire corporate logo and the notice she received of aetna denial of her appeal did not specifically address certain evidence supporting her claim.but midgett cites no we are aware of peer reviews to be performed by examining physicians,requiring a plan administrator to provide detailed credentials of peer reviewers,or prohibiting peer reviews from appearing on a plan administrator form.additionally,j sets forth the requisite content of a notification of a benefit determination on review,and it does not require the plan administrator to discuss specific evidence submitted by the claimant.accordingly,we hold that midgett was not denied a full and fair review of her claim.
arbitrary and capricious 
midgett next argues that the district court erred in concluding that the plan administrator denial of her disability claim was not arbitrary and capricious.under the abuse of discretion standard applicable in this case,we will reverse the plan administrator decision only if it is arbitrary and capricious.groves metro.life ins,cir quoting hebert sbc pension benefit plan,cir.to determine whether a plan administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious,we ask whether the decision to deny benefits was supported by substantial evidence,meaning more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.schatz mut.of omaha ins,cir.provided the decision is supported by a reasonable explanation,it should not be disturbed,even though a different reasonable interpretation could have been made.id.quoting cash group health plan,cir.the requirement that the plan administrator decision be reasonable should be read to mean that a decision is reasonable if a reasonable person could have reached a similar decision,given the evidence before him,not that a reasonable person would have reached that decision.jackson metro.life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the crux of midgett argument is that broadspire and aetna improperly disregarded the conclusions of chakales and mcdonald,who had examined her,and relied instead on the conclusions of the peer reviewers,who had not examined her.the supreme court has recognized that treating physicians are not automatically entitled to special weight in disability determinations under erisa
