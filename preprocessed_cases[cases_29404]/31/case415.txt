appellees wheeling hospital and belmont hospital collectively the hospital plaintiffs,along with other medical providers,commenced this putative class action in west virginia state court on may,against the ohio valley health services and education corporation,ohio valley medical center and east ohio regional hospital,collectively,the ov health system parties,and appellant the health plan of the upper ohio valley,the health plan.the plaintiffs sued in order to collect amounts allegedly owed to them by employee benefit plans established by the ov health system parties,for which the health plan acted as administrator.
after pretrial activity described in detail below,the health plan moved to dismiss the claims brought against it by the hospital plaintiffs pursuant to an arbitration agreement between the parties.the district court denied this motion,holding that the health plan had defaulted on its right to arbitrate.this appeal ensued.after assuring ourselves of appellate jurisdiction,we conclude that the district court erred in its determination that the health plan defaulted on its right to arbitrate.we therefore reverse the district court denial of the health plan motion to dismiss.
because this appeal turns on the procedural history of the case in the district court,we begin there.counts i and ii of the complaint set forth breach of contract claims against the ov health system parties.count iii sets forth a separate breach of contract claim against the health plan premised on its alleged unconditional obligation to pay plaintiffs for the health care services provided to persons covered by the relevant employee benefit plans.
on june,the defendants removed the case to federal court.on june,the district court issued an order and notice regarding discovery and scheduling pursuant to rules b and f of the federal rules of civil procedure.on june,the health plan filed an answer to the complaint.
on june,the ov health system parties,but not the health plan,filed a motion to dismiss the claims asserted against them,or in the alternative for summary judgment.they advanced three arguments.first,they argued that the claims should be dismissed pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure because the ovhs e health benefit plan,a purported indispensable party,had not been joined in the action.second,the ov health system parties argued that they did not owe a payment obligation to plaintiffs under the contracts at issue and,as a result,the claims should be dismissed pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.finally,the ov health system parties argued that plaintiffs claims should be dismissed for a purported failure to exhaust administrative remedies set forth in the ovhs e health benefit plan.plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss.
while the motion to dismiss was pending,plaintiffs filed a motion for remand on july,the health plan filed an amended answer that asserted the affirmative defense of arbitration.
that same day,the health plan filed a pleading titled response to motion to dismiss,or in the alternative,motion to join in result.the health plan argued that t o the extent this court is inclined to grant the ov health system parties motion to dismiss,the health plan will be entitled to a dismissal of all claims against it as well.if the district court concluded that the ovhs e health benefit plan was an indispensable party,the health plan contended,the court will have necessarily determined that the court can not accord complete relief among the existing parties to the action.as a consequence,dismissal would be appropriate and in fact required as to all defendants,including the health plan.id.similarly,the motion continued,
if the court is inclined to grant the ov health system parties motion on the basis that plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies the court will have determined that plaintiffs claim for payments can not proceed at this time.this determination would likewise extend to the plaintiffs claims against the health plan since their claims are for these same payments.as a consequence,the health plan should likewise be dismissed pending plaintiffs exhaustion of the aforementioned administrative remedies.
id.at.notably,the health plan did not seek a dismissal on the merits under rule b.
on july,plaintiffs filed a motion to strike the health plan response to the motion to dismiss,and an opposition to its alternative motion to join in result.they argued that the health plan pleading was a belated and unsupported motion to dismiss and a premature and unsupported motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs further contended that the health plan motion should be denied on the merits because,even if the district court were to grant the ov health system parties motion to dismiss,that grant would not preclude or limit plaintiffs breach of contract claim against the health plan.
on july,the parties filed their report of planning conference,in which they were required to consider,inter alia,alternative dispute resolution processes.the report did not mention the health plan intent to compel arbitration of any of the claims asserted against it.the report contained proposed scheduling deadlines,including a proposed november,trial date.on august,the district court entered a scheduling order setting dates for,among other things,the close of discovery august,a pretrial conference october,and trial november.
also on august,the health plan filed a response to plaintiffs motion to strike.therein,it disputed the plaintiffs characterization of its motion,and argued that its motion constituted a timely response to the ohio valley health system defendants motion.
on september,plaintiffs noticed the deposition of two health plan witnesses.on september,plaintiffs served discovery on the health plan in the form of interrogatories and requests for production.they also noticed a b deposition of the health plan.
on december,the district court entered a memorandum opinion and order on outstanding motions.the district court denied the motion for remand.it granted the ov health system parties motion to dismiss under rule b because the plaintiffs can not state a breach of contract action against the ov health system parties either directly or as beneficiaries,this court must dismiss count i and ii of the plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim.the district court denied the ov health system parties motion to dismiss under rule b,however,concluding that complete relief could be provided without joining the employee benefit plans because t he plaintiffs contracted for payment in the hospital service agreements with the health plan.it is the health plan responsibility under the contract to pay the plaintiffs for any health care services provided to participants in the employee benefit plans.turning to the health plan response to the ov health system parties motion,the district court first denied the plaintiffs motion to strike.it then denied the health plan alternative motion to join in result for the same reason it had denied the ov health system parties b motion,holding that under the facts alleged,the health plan was contractually obliged to make payments to the plaintiffs.thus,after the district court ruling,the health plan was the only remaining defendant in the suit.
on january,plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint to add additional plaintiffs,which the district court granted.on january,the health plan filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice.the health plan memorandum in support of this motion divides the named plaintiffs in the amended complaint into three distinct categories physician practice groups individual physicians and hospitals,belmont hospital and wheeling hospital.the health plan argued that it and the hospital plaintiffs had a relationship governed by hospital service agreement contracts.the memorandum contains a background section,which sets forth in detail the terms of those contracts,including the disputes and arbitration clause contained therein.at the conclusion of the background section,the memorandum states,hospital plaintiffs allegations of breach of contract by the health plan by nonpayment is plainly encompassed by this arbitration provision the court should compel separate binding arbitrations for each hospital plaintiff claims.part of the memorandum is titled pursuant to the express terms of the contracts,hospital plaintiffs claims must be submitted to separate,binding arbitrations.it discusses the supreme court case law regarding the enforcement of arbitration agreements,and then argues 
here,to give full effect to the intentions and terms of the agreements between each hospital plaintiff and the health plan,the hospital plaintiffs claims must be submitted to individual arbitration proceedings.these parties have specifically agreed to resolve their disputes in arbitration which must be enforced by this court this agreement must be upheld on its terms,and individual arbitrations ordered.to hold otherwise would rewrite the contracts between the parties.as this litigation violates the hospital plaintiffs agreement to arbitrate all disputes related to compensation,the complaint should be dismissed with prejudice.
plaintiffs opposed the health plan motion to dismiss.they argued,inter alia,that the health plan had defaulted on any right that it may have had to compel arbitration.
on june,the district court denied the health plan motion to dismiss.with respect to the portion of the health plan motion directed at the claims of the hospital plaintiffs,the district court found that it constituted a demand for arbitration 
the federal arbitration act faa requires that a district court,upon motion by any party,stay judicial proceedings involving issues covered by written arbitration agreements.choice hotels,bsr tropicana resort,cir see also.when a party seeks enforcement of the arbitration clause of an agreement during proceedings in a district court,a party sufficiently invoke s the full spectrum of remedies under the faa,including a stay under.id.at.accordingly,this court finds that the health plan motion to dismiss because of the arbitration clause invokes its remedies under the faa,and therefore constitutes a demand for arbitration.
the district court went on to find,however,that health plan had defaulted on its right to arbitration.after reciting the applicable standard for default of the right of arbitration,the district court concluded that the hospital plaintiffs had met their heavy burden to show that allowing arbitration at this point in the litigation would prejudice them.in support of this conclusion,it found that the health plan engaged in over six months of litigation between amending its answer to include the affirmative defense of arbitration and actually demanding arbitration.id.at.during that time,it further found,the hospital plaintiffs had to respond to two dispositive motions by the health plan on the merits,forcing the hospital plaintiffs to reveal their legal strategy in opposing those motions.id.the district court observed,the health plan has participated in oral argument and opposed the hospital plaintiffs motions,arguing that this court has proper jurisdiction over this civil action.the health plan opposed a motion to compel,which the parties subsequently resolved.id.the district court also noted that the plaintiffs assert by affidavit that they incurred more than in legal fees and expenses,but did not adopt this assertion as a finding of fact.
based on the above findings of fact,the district court concluded as follows 
the health plan utilized the litigation machinery in such a way to prejudice the plaintiffs if this court dismissed the action to allow arbitration at this stage in the litigation.because this court finds that the health plan has defaulted on its right to arbitrate,it is not necessary for this court to decide whether it would be unconscionable to permit the health plan to assert arbitration clauses in this matter.accordingly,the health plan motion for summary judgment as to the hospital plaintiffs is denied with prejudice.
id.this appeal followed.
the health plan contends that the district court erred in holding that it had defaulted on its right to arbitrate.before proceeding to the merits of this appeal,however,we must first assure ourselves that we possess appellate jurisdiction,which turns on whether the health plan properly invoked the faa in its motion to dismiss.we first set forth the proper standard for determining our appellate jurisdiction under the faa.we then apply that standard,concluding that we possess appellate jurisdiction over this appeal.
federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,and we presume that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction.barbour int union,cir en banc,abrogated on other grounds by b b.the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.id.
ordinarily,courts of appeals have jurisdiction only over final decisions of district courts.arthur andersen llp carlisle,d quoting.the faa,however,makes an exception to that finality requirement,providing that a n appeal may be taken from an order 
a refusing a stay of any action under section of this title,
b denying a petition under section of this title to order arbitration to proceed,
c denying an application under section of this title to compel arbitration,
d confirming or denying confirmation of an award or partial award,or 
e modifying,correcting or vacating an award.
a.in stedor enter,armtex,cir,we elaborated on the meaning of 
the broad purpose of section was to implement congress deliberate determination that appeal rules should reflect a strong policy favoring arbitration.congress sought to effectuate this policy in two ways.first,an order that favors litigation over arbitration whether it refuses to stay the litigation in deference to arbitration refuses to compel arbitration denies confirmation to or modifies,corrects,or vacates an arbitral award or grants,continues,or modifies an injunction against arbitration is immediately appealable,even if interlocutory in nature.thus,a party who believes that arbitration is required by an agreement between the parties need not suffer the expense and inconvenience of litigation before receiving appellate review of a district court judgment that arbitration was inappropriate.

we have not addressed the exact issue presented here,whether we have appellate jurisdiction to review a denial of a motion to dismiss that demands arbitration without specifically invoking or.however,in choice hotels int,bsr tropicana resort,cir,we addressed a related question,whether a party had properly invoked of the faa,under which a party may seek a stay of proceedings pending arbitration,even though it had styled its motion as a motion to dismiss.id.at.we held that n otwithstanding the terms of,dismissal is a proper remedy when all of the issues presented in a lawsuit are arbitrable.id.moreover,we added,
a hypertechnical reading of the defendant pleadings would be inconsistent with the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.the defendant made it clear during proceedings in the district court that it was seeking enforcement of the arbitration clause of the agreement.this is sufficient to invoke the full spectrum of remedies under the faa,including a stay under.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.notably,choice hotels concerned whether dismissal was an authorized remedy under,and we did not specifically frame our discussion in the terms of appellate jurisdiction,presumably because the appellee did not challenge our jurisdiction.nevertheless,the opinion reasoning with respect to what a defendant must do in order to invoke the full spectrum of remedies under the faa is instructive with regard to our appellate jurisdiction.
although we have not considered the specific question of appellate jurisdiction over a motion to dismiss that does not specifically invoke or,several other circuits have done so.in their analysis,they have adopted an approach similar to the one we articulated in choice hotels,focusing on whether the defendant made it clear that it was seeking enforcement of the arbitration clause contained within an applicable agreement.in conrad phone directories,cir,the tenth circuit adopted a process for determining whether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction under a.
the first,simplest,and surest way to guarantee appellate jurisdiction under a is to caption the motion in the district court as one brought under faa or.see.a every pleading must have a caption with the court name,a title,a file number,and a rule a designation.emphasis added.this simple rule should dispose of the vast majority of cases in this area,and those hoping to avail themselves of the immediate appeal provided for in the faa would do well to follow it.
id.at.although an approach that looks exclusively to the caption of a motion may seem tempting,conrad observed,it would be unworkable because it would violate the spirit of notice pleading embodied in our federal rules of civil procedure and create incentives for litigants to game the captions of their motions in an effort to gain an interlocutory appeal where none is warranted.id.it therefore articulated a second step in the process of determining appellate jurisdiction 
if a motion denied by the district court is not explicitly styled as a motion under the faa,or the court suspects that the motion has been in an attempt to take advantage of a,the court must look beyond the caption to the essential attributes of the motion itself.the goal of this inquiry is to determine whether it is plainly apparent from the four corners of the motion that the movant seeks only the relief provided for in the faa,rather than any other remedy.
id.citations omitted.the tenth circuit favored a focus on the relief requested in the motion,concluding that i f the essence of the movant request is that the issues presented be decided exclusively by an arbitrator and not by any court,then the denial of that motion may be appealed under a.id.at.
if,on the other hand,the movant in the district court requests a judicial remedy that is inconsistent with the position that the issues involved may be decided only by the arbitrator,the movant is no longer proceeding exclusively under the faa and has forfeited their right to interlocutory review under a.
id.at.we find this analysis persuasive.
the second step of the conrad test thus strikes a balance between form and substance,and is in harmony with the other circuits to have considered the issue accordingly,when a motion is not styled in a dispositive manner,we hold that our inquiry into appellate jurisdiction should be based on the principle articulated in choice hotels,as well as conrad.in other words,we must determine whether the health plan made it clear within the four corners of its motion to dismiss that it was seeking enforcement of the arbitration agreement.
so viewed,we conclude that the health plan clearly stated in its motion to dismiss that it was seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement.as already noted,the health plan memorandum,which was incorporated by reference in the motion,set forth in detail the terms of the hospital service agreement contracts between the parties,including the disputes and arbitration clause.the memorandum specifically argued that the court should compel separate binding arbitrations for each hospital plaintiff claims pursuant to the express terms of the contracts between the parties.moreover,the health plan did not request a judicial remedy that was inconsistent with the position that the issues involved may be decided only by the arbitrator.for these reasons,we are satisfied that we possess appellate jurisdiction over this appeal.
turning now to the merits,we must determine whether the health plan defaulted on its right to arbitration.we review a district court decision as to default of arbitration de novo but defer to the district court underlying factual findings.forrester penn lyon homes,cir.we thus review a district court finding of actual prejudice de novo if it is based on a legal determination,but we review it for clear error if it is based on a factual determination.see microstrategy lauricia,cir.
under section of the faa,a party loses its right to a stay of court proceedings in order to arbitrate if it is in default in proceeding with such arbitration.forrester,at quoting.default in this context resembles waiver,but,due to the strong federal policy favoring arbitration,courts have limited the circumstances that can result in statutory default.id d elay and participation in litigation will not alone constitute default.id.at.but a party will default its right to arbitration if it so substantially utilize s the litigation machinery that to subsequently permit arbitration would prejudice the party opposing the stay.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the heavy burden of showing default lies with the party opposing arbitration.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
where a party fails to demand arbitration during pretrial proceedings,and,in the meantime,engages in pretrial activity inconsistent with an intent to arbitrate,the party later opposing a motion to compel arbitration may more easily show that its position has been compromised,prejudiced.fraser,at internal quotation marks omitted.but,even in cases where the party seeking arbitration has invoked the litigation machinery to some degree,the dispositive question is whether the party objecting to arbitration has suffered actual prejudice.microstrategy,at quoting fraser,at patten grading paving,skanska usa,cir same 
in determining what constitutes actual prejudice,we have emphasized that the amount of delay and the extent of the moving party activity are material factors in assessing a plea of prejudice.microstrategy,at.internal quotation marks omitted.we consider each factor in turn.
we first consider the amount of delay.in microstrategy,we concluded that the appellant delay of fewer than six months in seeking arbitration was relatively short,and that nothing in the record suggested that this delay,in and of itself,caused the appellee to suffer actual prejudice.id.at see also patten grading paving,skanska usa,cir finding no prejudice in delay maxum,salus,cir finding no prejudice in delay.accordingly,we concluded that a ny delay by the appellant in asserting its right to arbitration,therefore,is insufficient to support a finding of default.microstrategy,at.
here,too,we have found nothing in the record that supports a finding of prejudice to the hospital plaintiffs based on that ground.indeed,during oral argument,the hospital plaintiffs appeared to recognize that a finding of prejudice could not be based on the delay in this case.thus,the district court,to the extent it based its conclusion of prejudice on the delay,clearly erred in doing so.
whether the health plan defaulted on its right to insist on arbitration by virtue of its litigation activities is a more difficult question.microstrategy,at.we look to our precedent for guidance in this regard.
we have held that a party suffered actual prejudice because it was forced to respond to a number of potentially damaging motions,including a motion for partial summary judgment and three motions to dismiss.fraser,at.in fraser,judgment on several of the claims which the defendant sought to arbitrate was rendered over two years before the defendant made the arbitration.id.further,the passing of two trial dates prior to the date for the hearing on the defendant motion to compel arbitration showed that the plaintiff had to prepare repeatedly for trial rather than arbitration.id.
similarly,in forrester,we found that plaintiffs had suffered actual prejudice where a defendant waited until the eve of the trial before moving to compel arbitration,and b y that time plaintiffs had engaged in extensive pretrial preparations including multiple depositions,a motion for summary judgment,motions in limine,and submission of an array of pleadings.at.this use of the litigation process,we held,caused the plaintiffs actual prejudice because it required them to expend significant time and money,permitted the defendant to defeat several of the plaintiffs claims on summary judgment,and forced the plaintiffs to reveal their trial strategy.id.
by contrast,in patten,we found that no p
