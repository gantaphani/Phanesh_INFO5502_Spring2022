larkin watson,years old and totally disabled due to a heart condition,is unemployed and not receiving long term disability ltd benefits he claims that,at pertinent times when he would have been eligible for ltd coverage through his employer,he was never told of the eligibility.as a result,he made choices about the number of hours he worked,not understanding that a consequence of his choices was that he was no longer eligible for ltd coverage.by the time that watson says he did learn of the ltd policy and submitted his application,that application was denied on a number of grounds had he applied earlier and made different choices,he says he would have been given the ltd benefits he now needs.watson sued his employers and plan administrators under the employee retirement security act of erisa.
watson does not sue the plan for denial of benefits under erisa a b,a b there would be obvious problems in doing so.rather,he attempts to fit his claim into the particular circumstances in which benefits plan participants and beneficiaries may bring claims alleging breach of fiduciary duty by plan administrators and others.see,varity howe,d.
the district court granted judgment for deaconess waltham hospital,watson employer,watson deaconess waltham,d,declined to allow watson to amend his complaint to add previous plan administrators as defendants,watson deaconess waltham.june,and also granted summary judgment for the liberty life assurance of boston,the ltd insurer after january,watson deaconess waltham.june.we affirm the district court decisions,although our reasoning differs in some respects.
we summarize the heart of our reasoning.erisa does require plan administrators to provide certain benefits plan information,such as summary plan descriptions,to all plan participants and beneficiaries.b.erisa also provides limited and specific remedies if an administrator fails to do so.id.a,c b.when erisa itself has specified a duty and a corresponding remedy,we will impose a further duty on fiduciaries only in very narrow circumstances.even assuming deaconess was a fiduciary,watson has not presented facts that fit him into those narrow circumstances.this is not a case in which misrepresentations were made to watson,nor is this a case in which he requested the ltd information and the response was inadequate.
the facts are largely undisputed.the parties agreed that the district court judge should consider the case against deaconess as a case stated.see cont l grain.shipping,cir.the case against the insurer was resolved on summary judgment.
larkin watson first began working for hospital,the predecessor to deaconess hospital,in october,as a employee working hours per week as an addictions counselor.during the orientation on his first day of work,watson reviewed and signed an employee orientation checklist,which included a list of possible benefits.several of the benefit programs are checked off,and others have notations such as not interested or gave decide.on the line for the ltd insurance program is the notation.watson testified in his deposition that he did not know what ltd insurance meant and that the human resources representatives simply told him that it did not apply to him.watson was also given a part time employee benefits summary listing the conditions under which employees became eligible for various types of benefits ltd benefits were not listed or discussed on this form.at that time,the hospital ltd insurance plan was provided through the confederation life insurance company not a party to this action and required that an employee work at least hours per week in order to be eligible.all parties agree that watson was not eligible for ltd plan participation when he began his employment in october.
on november,watson changed his employment status.according to an affidavit of the hospital director of human resources,watson became a addictions counselor at that time.in a letter offering him the position,watson supervisor wrote,f benefits will be available to you.please discuss these issues with the representative from human resources.watson says that he discussed the benefits of the new job with the assistant director of human resources and the human resources benefits coordinator and that,at that time,he opted to enroll in the major medical and dental plans.watson says that no one informed him that,as a employee,he was eligible for ltd benefits,nor was he given any summary plan description or other notice of benefits.the hospital ltd plan was an plan,under which watson automatically became a beneficiary because he was a full time employee working at least hours per week no action was required on his part to enroll.
in late,watson began having health problems related to a heart condition and,as a result,began missing days at work.in early,his supervisor,lynne foster,had several conversations with him,asking him if he would like to reduce his hours to work,because she believed that he was having trouble keeping up with work due to his health condition.watson says that these conversations induced him to change his status to employment at hours per week,effective on march.again,no one informed him that there could be changes in his benefits eligibility as a result of this change.watson says that he contacted someone in human resources to ask how the change would affect his major medical and dental benefits,but that he never requested a listing of benefits for which he was or would be eligible.nor did he ask anyone about any disability benefits.
for the next three years,watson worked as a employee.between june and february,watson repeatedly requested a return to employment.he says that he first became aware of the existence of the ltd policy on about february,when he learned of the policy from a human resources employee.on march,he returned to work,but his medical condition apparently deteriorated.on or about april,his doctor informed the hospital that watson was totally disabled and would be unable to return to work because of his heart condition.as a result,in,watson was a employee for less than a month.
on july,after the expiration of the ltd policy elimination period a waiting period after the onset of the disability before benefits will be paid,watson submitted a disability claim form to liberty life assurance.liberty had taken over as carrier of deaconess waltham ltd policy as of january,and deaconess waltham had renewed the policy with liberty effective january.watson claim was denied on november,because liberty determined that watson disability was due to a condition that predated his plan enrollment 
when watson returned to work in march,the hospital and liberty agreed to waive the standard waiting period for plan eligibility otherwise,watson would not have been covered by the plan at all after only a month worth of employment.after determining that watson april disability was barred by the preexisting condition clause,liberty also considered whether watson was disabled as of december,when he was first hospitalized for his heart problems.liberty determined that a claim based on a december,disability onset date must be denied because although watson was scheduled to work forty hours per week in december,his time cards indicated that he worked only hours per week in the three weeks prior to december and was therefore not eligible as a employee any claim based on a december,disability should have been filed by april,and evidence showed that watson condition improved and he was not disabled after december.watson appealed liberty decision,and liberty again denied his claim.watson filed this federal lawsuit on march.
during the course of watson employment,a series of different ltd policies was in effect.we outline the policies here,and attach an appendix for further clarification.
when watson began working for the hospital,the ltd carrier was confederation,and the hospital then hospital functioned as the plan administrator.on november,northwestern mutual life insurance company became the carrier for the hospital ltd plan.this plan remained in effect until january.the plan administrator under this northwestern mutual policy was the hospital human resources director,fred sussman.effective february,the hospital was bought by pathway health network pathways and became the deaconess waltham hospital the hospital human resources director,sussman,continued as the plan administrator.on january,liberty life assurance became the carrier for the ltd policy the hospital parent company first pathways and then,after october,caregroup was the named sponsor and plan administrator under the liberty life assurance policy.effective january,a new ltd policy came into effect,also carried by liberty life assurance and also with caregroup as the plan administrator.
standards of review 
on appeal,watson argues that,if he had known of the ltd policy and his eligibility for it,he would have taken steps in and to ensure his continued eligibility or he would have applied for partial disability benefits at that time.he argues that his subsequent ineligibility was the result of the hospital and the insurer failure to inform him.this,he says,violated the hospital fiduciary duty under erisa,a,or,in the alternative,violated erisa catch all provision,id.a.second,and for the same reasons,he argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim against caregroup,the hospital parent company,which was designated as the plan administrator under the liberty life assurance policy.
third,he argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to allow him to amend his complaint to add the human resources director and pathways,the predecessor to caregroup,as defendants.
finally,he argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to liberty because liberty was a necessary party for full relief,discovery was needed to ascertain liberty role in failing to inform watson,and the complaint against liberty was timely.
watson and defendant deaconess waltham agreed to have the district court decide their for summary judgment as a case stated.we review de novo a district court legal conclusions in a case stated,but its factual findings,and any inferences that the court drew from the stipulated facts,are subject to only clear error review.see united paperworkers int l union int l paper,cir.watson can prevail on appeal against deaconess only if he shows that the district court factual determinations are clearly erroneous or if the district court made an error of law.
we review the district court grant of liberty life assurance summary judgment motion and caregroup motion to dismiss de novo,making all reasonable factual inferences in favor of watson.rochester ford sales,ford motor,cir martin applied cellular,cir.
as for the denial of watson motion to amend his complaint to add additional defendants,we typically review the district court denial of a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion,keeping in mind rule a mandate that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.a see hatch dep t for children,youth their families,cir.if,however,leave to amend is not sought until after discovery has closed and a summary judgment motion has been docketed,the proposed amendment must be not only theoretically viable but also solidly grounded in the record and supported by substantial evidence.hatch,at.therefore,we will review the district court denial of the motion to amend under the substantial evidence standard of review.
breach of fiduciary duty 
erisa issues can be enormously complicated and this case,in theory,raises at least half a dozen abstruse issues.in the end,the outcome turns on the question of whether there was any breach of any fiduciary duty by deaconess in any of its erisa roles watson.we will streamline the analysis and make certain preliminary assumptions and rulings in watson favor.
the case concerns three different time periods when duties were possibly owed to watson when he took status in when he had discussions with waltham deaconess about his health condition and work hours in and when he took status in.watson asserts two different types of claims first,that there was an absolute fiduciary duty,redressable by this action,to provide him with the ltd benefits information and,second,that,even if his first claim fails,once he made a general inquiry about benefits,there was a duty of disclosure of the ltd plan existence and terms.
these claims need to be understood in context.watson complaint did not allege a cause of action against the plan itself.this is not an action against a plan for a wrongful denial of benefits but against an alleged fiduciary for breaching its duty,invoking the catchall provisions of a.
erisa provides that those who act as fiduciaries have certain duties with respect to welfare plan participants and beneficiaries.a fiduciary must,among other things,follow a prudent man standard of care 
a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.
id.a.a fiduciary may be liable to the plan for violations of this duty.id.see.mut.life ins.russell,d.
in addition,an individual plan participant or beneficiary may bring suit for equitable relief for breach of fiduciary duty under erisa catch all provision,which states that 
a civil action may be brought by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan 
a see varity,at.the supreme court has interpreted a as a safety net,offering appropriate equitable relief for injuries caused by violations that does not elsewhere adequately remedy.varity,at.
deaconess urges us to dispose of this case on the grounds that it was not a fiduciary at any pertinent time.for the first time period,in when watson had status,deaconess had no relationship with watson he worked for hospital,not deaconess.the district court reasoned that watson would have to overcome erisa section b,b,in order to impute any liability on the part of for events in to deaconess.watson,d at.section b states that a successor fiduciary does not,in that capacity,assume liability for breach of fiduciary duty of an earlier fiduciary the district court analysis was misplaced.nothing in section b precludes a later fiduciary from assuming by contract the erisa obligations of a former fiduciary.the district court never ruled on this contract question.the evidence does seem to show that deaconess assumed by contract any liability incurred by,including liability as the plan administrator and fiduciary.
during the period,the human resources director of deaconess,fred sussman,was the named plan administrator.whether that makes deaconess a fiduciary depends on the answer to several questions whether watson has shown that deaconess was responsible for sussman erisa activities whether the facts of that responsibility made deaconess a plan administrator whether a plan administrator is per se a fiduciary or whether instead a functional test should be applied even to plan administrators to decide whether they are fiduciaries and whether,if a functional test must be applied,sussman functions bring deaconess into that fold.we need not decide here whether deaconess bears a fiduciary responsibility by virtue of sussman functions.
the question at the heart of this case is what was the extent of deaconess fiduciary obligations,if any,and whether it failed to meet its obligations.reduced to its essence,watson claim is that the hospital violated its fiduciary obligation by not informing him of the existence of the ltd plan or giving him the proper plan documents when he was eligible for the plan,and by not mentioning the loss of ltd eligibility when he made the change to employment in march,particularly when he asked someone in human resources how the change would affect his medical and dental benefits.this brings together two related strands of erisa cases those involving plaintiffs seeking substantive remedies,such as reinstatement or retroactive benefits,based on a fiduciary failure to comply with erisa technical notice and disclosure requirements and those involving a fiduciary failure to communicate information relevant to the beneficiary employment decisions.watson relies primarily on the latter,while the defendants rely primarily on the former.both must be considered in order to assess watson claim.
failure to comply with erisa notice requirements 
erisa contains specific sections requiring plan administrators to provide participants with information,including a summary plan description.plan participants have a cause of action under a a against plan administrators who fail to comply with a request to provide any such information.section c b specifies the relief available to such plaintiffs,allowing for penalties of per day and such other relief as the court deems proper.these penalties are limited,however,as the court may only order relief if the plan administrator fails to provide the appropriate documentation within thirty days after a participant requests it.id.watson did originally bring a claim under this subsection,but the district court granted summary judgment for deaconess on this claim,because deaconess supplied watson with the most recent plan documentation when he first requested it in.that ruling is not at issue in this appeal.
watson tries to this limitation by saying he now relies only on the equitable relief provision in a.the does not work 
w here erisa itself specifies a notice requirement,courts must be especially cautious in creating additional ones.
absent a promise or misrepresentation,the courts have almost uniformly rejected claims by plan participants or beneficiaries that an erisa administrator has to volunteer individualized information taking account of their peculiar circumstances.this view reflects erisa focus on limited and general reporting and disclosure requirements,and also reflects the enormous burdens an obligation to proffer individualized advice would inflict on plan administrators.in general,increased burdens necessarily increase costs,discourage employers from offering plans,and reduce benefits to employees.
barrs lockheed martin,cir holding that there was no fiduciary breach in failure to provide information to beneficiary not entitled to information under b footnotes and citations omitted.
the supreme court has held that,although a is a catch all remedy,relief is not appropriate within the meaning of this subsection where congress elsewhere provided adequate relief for a beneficiary injury and there is no need for further equitable relief.varity,at.the court has repeatedly emphasized that erisa is a comprehensive and reticulated statute,life annuity ins.knudson,d quoting mertens hewitt,d quoting nachman pension benefit guar,d,and the court has therefore been especially reluctant to tamper with the enforcement scheme embodied in the statute by extending remedies not specifically authorized by its text,id.quoting russell,at.alteration in original.
this court and our sister circuits have taken a narrow approach towards erisa plaintiffs who attempt to assert procedural notice and disclosure violations outside the context of c.we have previously held,in the context of a a b denial of benefits claim,that erisa notice requirements are not meant to create a system of strict liability for formal notice failures,and a plaintiff must show prejudice in order to claim relief.terry bayer,cir see also govoni bricklayers,masons plasterers,cir case law suggests that to secure relief,govoni must show some significant reliance upon,or possible prejudice flowing from,the faulty plan description.
technical violations of erisa notice provisions generally do not give rise to substantive remedies outside c unless there are some exceptional circumstances,such as bad faith,active concealment,or fraud.see,panaras liquid carbonic indus,cir no remedy under a b for technical violations,absent exceptional circumstances such as bad faith,concealment,or induced reliance ackerman warnaco,cir substantive remedies are not available for violation of reporting requirements absent extraordinary circumstances such as bad faith or active concealment kreutzer smith,cir holding that technical violations only warrant a benefits award in cases of bad faith,concealment or unfair administration.one of the few cases to award substantive remedies for a technical disclosure violation,blau del monte corporation,cir,involved a situation where the employer actively concealed its benefits policy from most employees for several years,id.at.
these cases,concerned mostly with denial of benefits claims under a b,do not necessarily dispose of a fiduciary breach claim under a,see jordan federal express,cir finding fiduciary breach for technical violation but no claim under a b,but they are instructive.the fifth circuit,at least,has pursued a similarly narrow approach with regards to alleged fiduciary breaches arising out of technical violations,holding that a f ailure to fulfill procedural requirements of notice does not give rise to a substantive damage remedy for fiduciary breach except when the violations are continuous and amount to substantive harm.hines.mut.life ins,cir.these notice and disclosure cases indicate,at a minimum,that a technical violation in and of itself can not be considered a fiduciary breach.rather,some other circumstance must be present.
the supreme court has cautioned that we must be mindful of the competing congressional purposes behind erisa,such as congress desire to offer employees enhanced protection for their benefits and its desire not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs,or litigation expenses,unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the first place.varity,at.
in this case,there were no extraordinary circumstances indicating that the fiduciary breached its duty.deaconess did not actively conceal its policy,and there are no allegations that it regularly failed to comply with notice requirements.to the contrary,the hospital had an annual benefit fair,scheduled for the open enrollment period,which all of the benefits carriers attended in order to answer employees questions.further,new employees regularly received a checklist of benefits for which they were eligible.indeed,watson was given a sheet indicating that he was not eligible for ltd insurance as a employee.there was no evidence that the hospital acted in bad faith.it appears that watson simply slipped through the cracks in this system when he switched from to employment status,an unfortunate occurrence but not bad faith,concealment,or fraud.
failure to communicate information relevant to employment decision 
watson also argues that,apart from the failure to inform him of the ltd plan when he started employment in november,he should have been informed of the consequences of his employment decision in the course of the discussions about his returning to status,particularly his discussions about benefits in.
there is little evidence about those discussions.watson deposition testimony is as follows 
question in march of when you decided to go on a basis did you discuss with your supervisor the effect of going on part time on your benefits 
answer well,i believe that i would have thought she would know and that i called human resources as to how it affected major medical and delta dental.
question did you do that 
answer i believe so.
the supreme court in varity specifically reserved the question of whether erisa fiduciaries have any fiduciary duty to disclose truthful information on their own initiative,or in response to employee inquiries.at.many of our sister circuits have held that,in certain circumstances,a fiduciary has an obligation to accurately convey material information to beneficiaries,including material information that the beneficiary did not specifically request see griggs dupont de nemours,cir bowerman stores,cir harte bethlehem steel,cir,cert.denied,d krohn huron mem l,cir barker am.mobil power,cir eddy colonial life ins.
there are two limitations on the imposition of an affirmative fiduciary duty to inform beneficiaries of material facts about the plan.first,a duty only arises if there was some particular reason that the fiduciary should have known that his failure to convey the information would be harmful.see,griggs,at fiduciary learned that employee planned rollover election was not possible under tax code,but failed to inform him barker,at fiduciary suspected plan mismanagement and failed to inform beneficiaries eddy,at plaintiff inquired about continuation rights for health insurance and fiduciary failed to inform him of conversion rights.a failure to inform is a fiduciary breach only where the fiduciary knew of the confusion detrimental to the participant generated by its misrepresentations or its silence.uaw skinner engine,cir accord griggs,at a n erisa fiduciary that knows or should know that a beneficiary labors under a material misunderstanding of plan benefits that will inure to his detriment can not remain silent krohn,at t he duty to inform entails an affirmative duty to inform when the trustee knows that silence might be harmful.quoting bixler cent.teamsters health welfare fund,cir shea esensten,cir a n erisa fiduciary has a duty to speak out if it knows that silence might be harmful quoting bixler,at eddy,at once the beneficiary had made clear his situation,the fiduciary had a duty to provide the material information.
second,fiduciaries need not generally provide individualized unsolicited advice.see,griggs,at erisa does not impose a general duty requiring erisa fiduciaries to ascertain on an individual basis whether each beneficiary understands the collateral consequences of his or her particular election.bowerman,at erisa does not require plan administrators to investigate each participant circumstances and prepare advisory opinions for literally thousands of employees.quoting chojnacki,cir maxa john alden life ins,cir finding no fiduciary duty individually to notify participants beneficiaries of the specific impact of the general terms of the plan upon them.it is uncontroversial that a fiduciary does not have to regularly inform beneficiaries every time a plan term affects them.harte,at.
as to the first limitation,there is insufficient evidence in the record to suggest that any of the human resources employees knew or should have known that watson was likely to need ltd benefits in either or.see joyce rjr nabisco holdings,cir we can not say that rjr knew,or had good reason to know,that joyce was likely to be eligible for ltd benefits.sussman testified that,although he discussed watson poor attendance with watson supervisor,he was not aware of watson health problems until.even if the other human resources representatives had information that watson health was poor,they had nothing to indicate that his condition was likely to deteriorate to the point of total disability.after all,watson worked for almost three years from on and sought a job roughly two years after he went to work.
as to the second limitation,neither the human resources employee who responded to watson inquiry about medical benefits,nor the employee who processed his change of employment status paperwork,violated any fiduciary duty by failing to conduct a sua sponte personalized benefits assessment for watson.there is no evidence that either human resources employee had any reason to think that watson was unaware of his benefits and the basic eligibility requirements for them.
watson has a stronger argument that the human resource employees should have known he would be interested in partial disability benefits,which provide income replacement for individuals who must reduce their work schedule due to disability.however,there is scant information in the record about watson conversations with the human resources employees.watson has not pointed to sufficient facts to suggest that they had reason to know of his partial disability or impending full disability.further,there is no evidence that in the defendants knew that watson had not been given the ltd information in,or that he was unaware of ltd insurance altogether.the only thing in the record on this point suggests just the opposite.when he first began employment in october,watson signed a benefits information sheet that listed the ltd insurance program,with a notation.see,joyce,no fiduciary breach in failing to inform employee of ltd benefits where employee had received and read benefits manual.
the only case we have found in which an appeals court held that a failure to adequately inform a plan beneficiary about plan requirements constituted a breach of fiduciary duty where the fiduciary had no reason to know that the beneficiary would be harmed by the lack of information is jordan,at.the jordan court reversed a grant of summary judgment where the employer had failed to provide the employee with an official summary plan description of his retirement benefits and had failed to inform him that retirement elections were nonrevocable after retirement,despite the facts that the employee never inquired about revocability and the employer had no reason to suspect that revocability would be an issue.id.however,in jordan,the plaintiff apparently had no way of knowing that the election was nonrevocable he was provided with information about the plan,which said nothing about the revocability of the election and therefore could be considered misleading.watson,in contrast,has not introduced evidence that the information he was given was in any way misleading,either directly or by omission.see varity,at.eddy,at fiduciary technical distinction between policy conversion and policy continuation was misleading to beneficiary.further,watson could have discovered the existence of the plan if he had attended the annual benefit fair,or if he had asked for a full listing of all benefits for which he was eligible.
watson also alleges that deaconess was in breach of its fiduciary duty by inducing him to reduce his schedule to so that he would lose his disability benefits.there is nothing in the record to support such a claim.the evidence in the record is that his supervisor encouraged him to accept status because of the trouble he had in fulfilling the requirements of his job.although there is evidence that the supervisor spoke with the human resources director,there was no evidence that they discussed watson disability benefits,or even the fact that watson was ill.
c.other appropriate equitable relief under erisa 
watson argues that deaconess may be liable even if it did not act as a fiduciary because the erisa equitable relief provision,a,is not limited to suits for breach of fiduciary duty.he argues that the hospital violated its duty under and to provide him with a summary plan description within ninety days after the employee becomes a plan participant and to notify him of changes in the plan,b a and that a entitled him to seek equitable relief for this violation.
our discussion above disposes of watson claim substantive remedies typically are not available for violations of erisa technical notice and disclosure requirements.for garden variety technical violations,beneficiaries are limited to their remedies under c.watson has no remedy under a.
complaint against caregroup 
the district court granted caregroup rule b motion to dismiss without prejudice to watson,because watson had not pled that caregroup acted in bad faith with regard to the nondisclosure of the policy,and a simple violation of the disclosure requirement did not constitute a fiduciary breach.
caregroup argues that neither caregroup,nor its predecessor pathways,acted as plan administrator prior to january,and that there was no way that either company could have had any duty to watson prior to.caregroup further argues that,under b,it had ninety days after january,to provide watson with information about the plan,if he in fact was a plan participant at that time.watson concedes that he had ceased to be a plan participant before this ninety day period elapsed,and therefore he can have no claim against caregroup for any failure to provide him with
