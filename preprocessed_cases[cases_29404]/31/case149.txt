plaintiffs appellants,four former employees of ubs ag ubs financial services,appeal from a final judgment and a postjudgment order of the district court for the southern district of new york richard sullivan,judge,the first granting defendants motion to dismiss in its entirety,and the second denying plaintiffs motion to alter or amend the judgment and for leave to file a second consolidated amended complaint scac.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in analyzing their claim for breach of the duty of prudence,as it applied a presumption of prudence to the fiduciaries of both investment plans.defendants,the alleged fiduciaries of these two plans,in which plaintiffs invested for retirement,offered the ubs stock fund as an investment option to plan participants and assert that they are entitled to the presumption of prudence,which the district court applied.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court wrongly applied the presumption as to one of the two plans,the savings and investment plan sip,as the sip plan document neither requires nor strongly encourages investment in ubs stock or the ubs stock fund.we hold,however,that the district court correctly applied the presumption of prudence as to the second plan,the plus plan,which requires plan fiduciaries to invest in the ubs stock fund.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal order of the district court in part,vacate in part,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.plaintiffs remaining arguments on appeal are addressed in a companion summary order,filed today.
background 
parties and investment plans 
plaintiffs appellants debra taveras,mary mckevitt,brian ludlum,and brian stanislaus are four former employees of defendants ubs ag ubs ubs financial services ubsfs.they brought a putative class action on behalf of current and former employees of ubs and ubsfs,alleging that defendants appellees violated various fiduciary duties imposed on them by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.
during the class alleged,plaintiffs participated in either the sip or the ubsfs k plus plan plus plan in order to save for their retirement.both the sip and the plus plan are retirement savings plans under which participants hold individual accounts that reflect both the amount contributed as well as the gains and losses on a participant account investments.see a.it is uncontested that both plans are eligible individual account plans eiaps as defined by erisa.see id.b,b,d participants in either plan have the ability to contribute funds from their salaries and to determine how to allocate and invest those funds among the various available investment options selected by certain of the defendants.
the ubs stock fund was an available investment option under both plans during the class period.the sip investment committee,a named defendant,has discretion to add or delete authorized investment funds available to employees participating in the sip,including the ubs stock fund,which tracked the performance of the underlying common stock of ubs.ja.the sip plan document tasks the sip investment committee with the general responsibility to instruct and advise the trustee and the members of the sip as to the addition or deletion of an authorized investment fund.ja.
the plus plan investment committee,another named defendant,is permitted to add or delete any investment fund authorized by the plus plan as an investment option,including the ubs stock fund.the ubs stock fund,however,is identified in the plus plan summary plan description as one of the core tier funds,and the plus plan plan document states that the plus plan investment committee shall provide it as an investment option under the plan.ja ja.
both the sip and the plus plan sustained significant losses due to individual plan participants accounts investment in the ubs stock fund.ubs stock fell some percent between april,when it reached a high,and the last day of the class period,october.it is these losses that provide the foundation for plaintiffs claims that defendants breached their various fiduciary duties under erisa.
defendants are alleged fiduciaries of the plans and include ubs,ubsfs,ubs americas,ubsa the members of ubs executive board,the members of ubsfs executive committee,ubsfs board of directors,members of the sip investment committee,members of the plus plan benefits administration committee plus plan administration committee,and the members of the plus plan investment committee.
ii.allegations of the second consolidated amended complaint 
plaintiffs allegations arise principally out of two decisions ubs made in the years leading up to and including the class period.the first is ubs decision to invest in,and its subsequent exposure to the risks of,more than billion in subprime mortgage backed securities and other fixed income assets.ubs decision to make these investments,often in contravention of its own stated risk policies,has been the subject of an sec investigation,a swiss federal banking commission investigation,and a shareholder report issued by ubs the second related decision is the approximately billion of in assets that ubs undertook between october,and august.
as a result of these,which are alleged to be due in large part to ubs risky subprime investments,plaintiffs allege that ubs found itself on the b rink of c ollapse in.ja.based on these and ubs reported assets,plaintiffs allege that ubs was insolvent,and as such,the swiss government had to bail out ubs by taking on a billion portfolio of illiquid and highly risky assets from the company that had little or no real value.ja.
plaintiffs accordingly filed suit on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,alleging that,during the relevant class period,defendants breached their fiduciary duties under erisa by imprudently continuing to offer participants in both the plus plan and the sip the option to invest in the ubs stock fund because ubs stock and the ubs stock fund were adversely affected by,inter alia,ubs investments in risky subprime mortgage backed securities and other fixed income assets count making misstatements or omissions regarding ubs true financial condition in breach of their duty of candor count failing to adequately monitor other fiduciaries,for liability,and quantum meruit counts,and or secondary liability claims and engaging in wrongful conflicts of interest count.
iii.procedural background 
three separate erisa actions were brought against ubs in the southern district of new york beginning in july.after these actions were consolidated,plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint,followed in november by the consolidated amended complaint ac.after receiving notification that defendants were seeking leave to file a motion to dismiss the ac,plaintiffs elected to stand on the allegations of that complaint.defendants moved to dismiss on january,but the district court stayed disposition of the motion until certain issues in a related action were resolved.
motion to dismiss 
the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the ac in its entirety in an opinion dated march,and entered final judgment on march.see in re ubs ag erisa,civ,wl.
it dismissed count,plaintiffs duty of prudence claim,reasoning that because the plus plan required that investors be offered the option of investing in the ubs stock fund,and the sip strongly encourage d defendants to offer the option to invest in the ubs stock fund,defendants were entitled to a presumption of prudence in accordance with moench robertson,cir.in re ubs ag erisa,wl,at.thus,the district court reviewed defendants decisions to continue offering the ubs stock fund as an investment option under either plan for an abuse of discretion.id.at.it held that the decline of ubs share price,alleged to be approximately percent was insufficient to overcome the presumption of prudence,and that there were no other allegations making it plausible that ubs solvency or viability as a going concern was ever realistically in jeopardy or otherwise setting forth a sufficiently dire situation.id.at.the district court held also that,even if the allegations of the complaint could be viewed as establishing sufficiently dire circumstances for the company,there were no allegations that those circumstances appeared imminent to defendants.id.
as to count,plaintiffs duty of candor claim,the district court held that defendants did not have any duty to disclose to plan participants material information relating to the company financial condition,and that the alleged misstatements were made when defendants were acting in their corporate fiduciary,rather than erisa fiduciary,capacity.id.at.additionally,the district court noted it believed this claim was not pled with the requisite degree of specificity.id.at.it therefore dismissed count.
the remaining counts,those alleging that defendants had breached their duties of care and loyalty by failing to avoid conflicts of interest and for secondary liability,were also dismissed.the court determined that they were nothing more than a rehashing of the other dismissed claims and thus failed as well.id.at.
motion to alter or amend the judgment 
on april,plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and requested leave to file the proposed scac.the district court denied this motion on march,in part because all of the additional allegations in the scac could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment many,even prior to the end of briefing on the motion to dismiss,and the motion was therefore untimely.in re ubs ag erisa,civ,wl,at.in deciding plaintiffs motion to alter or amend the judgment,the district court also considered the merits of the allegations in the scac,determining that although plaintiffs proposed scac contains dozens of amendments,they would not alter the court conclusion that neither the presumption of prudence was overcome nor the duty of candor violated.id.at.thus,the district court concluded that the additional allegations contained in the scac could not cure the deficiencies which had led to dismissal previously,and so the proposed amendment was futile in any event.id.at.
discussion 
presumption of prudencea.standard of review 
as with any review of a rule b motion to dismiss,the district court determination that the moench presumption of prudence applies to the fiduciaries of the two plans is reviewed de novo.see,maloney soc.sec,cir per curiam.we accept as true the facts alleged in the ac and may consider documents it incorporates by reference,as well as documents upon which it relies heavily,in deciding this appeal.difolco msnbc cable,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atl.twombly,d.
b.the moench presumption 
all erisa fiduciaries are required to act in accordance with,inter alia,the duty of prudence,which requires those fiduciaries to make reasonable investment and managerial decisions on behalf of the erisa plan they are overseeing,such that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use similar care,skill,prudence,and diligence.a.in in re citigroup erisa,cir,we adopted a presumption of prudence that applies to fiduciaries of certain plans who invest the plan they are overseeing,or offer participants the option to invest their individual accounts,in the employer stock.see also gearren mcgraw hill,cir gearren ii same.the presumption dictates that,where applicable,a fiduciary decision to invest an employer retirement plan in the employer own stock or to offer plan participants the option to so invest is a presumptively prudent decision in compliance with erisa,and thus the decision to invest in the employer stock is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.in re citigroup erisa,at.an erisa fiduciary appropriately may be found to have exceeded this discretion only where she knew or should have known that the employer,and therefore its stock,was in a dire situation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the moench presumption was created in consideration of the fact that while employee stock ownership plans esops,unlike pension plans,are not intended to guarantee retirement benefits,such esop fiduciaries still must act in accordance with the applicable duties of loyalty and care.moench,at.thus,the third circuit decided that an esop fiduciary who invests the assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with erisa by virtue of that decision.id.at.we have subsequently held that the presumption applies not only to esops,but also to certain eiaps,the kind of plan at issue in this case.see in re citigroup erisa,at adopting presumption,where applicable,with respect to both eiaps and esops.
we have stated,however,that it is not merely investment in employer stock that entitles a defendant to a presumption of prudence.rather,judicial scrutiny should increase with the degree of discretion a plan gives its fiduciaries to invest.thus,a fiduciary failure to divest from company stock is less likely to constitute an abuse of discretion if the plan terms require rather than merely permit investment in company stock.id.citation omitted accord moench,at indicating presumption does not apply where the fiduciary is simply permitted to make investments in an employer securities,but only where the fiduciary presumptively is required to invest in employer securities.
presumption of prudence in the instant case 
the district court found that both the sip and the plus plan sufficiently mandated or encouraged their fiduciaries to provide plan investors the option to invest in the ubs stock fund so as to trigger the presumption of prudence.in re ubs ag erisa,wl,at.because each plan document sets forth different language regarding whether the ubs stock fund was to be offered as an investment option,we examine each in turn.
section of the plus plan plan document states that the purpose of the plan is to attract and retain qualified individuals by providing them with an opportunity to accumulate assets for their retirement and to acquire ubs common stock.ja.section a of the same document states that t he trustee shall invest and reinvest all amounts in each participant accounts from among the investment funds made available by the investment committee one of which shall be the ubs common stock fund.ja,emphasis added.the investment committee is allowed to add or delete any of the available investment funds,presumably including the ubs stock fund,from time to time.id.
this language mirrors the language of the plan document at issue in gearren.there,the plan document provided that the plan shall offer a the stock fund which will be invested primarily in common stock of the corporation.gearren mcgraw hill,d,gearren i.the plan document at issue in gearren provided also that t he pension investment committee is authorized to terminate the existing funds,including the employer own stock fund.brief for plaintiffs appellants at,gearren mcgraw hill,cir cv.
as in gearren,the relevant sections of the plus plan plan document require,at least initially,that the ubs stock plan be offered as an investment option.the plan document does provide the plus plan investment committee a means by which to terminate the company fund as an investment option if it so chooses.but the ability to remove the company fund from those funds available to plan investors existed also in gearren,where we applied the presumption of prudence see gearren ii,at.
as the district court held,b ecause the plus plan plan document clearly and explicitly limits the trustee discretion by requiring that the ubs stock fund be offered as an investment option,the plus plan fiduciaries are entitled to a presumption of prudence.in re ubs ag erisa,wl,at.we agree that the plus plan plan document required the plan fiduciaries to offer the ubs stock fund and,therefore,affirm the district court holding that the fiduciaries of the plus plan are entitled to the presumption of prudence in reviewing their decision to offer the ubs stock fund as an investment option.
unlike the plus plan,the sip plan document contains no language mandating that the ubs stock fund shall be offer
