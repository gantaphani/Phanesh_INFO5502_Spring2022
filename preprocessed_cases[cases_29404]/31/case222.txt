unum life insurance company of america,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york laura taylor swain,judge entered november,finding,after a bench trial,that marianne locher was entitled to disability benefits under a disability plan provided by her employer through an insurance policy issued by,and awarding benefits and attorneys fees and costs.argues that the district court erred in considering evidence outside the administrative record,finding eligible for disability benefits,awarding benefits through the date of judgment,and awarding attorneys fees.we affirm the judgment of the district court and write to clarify the standard to be applied by district courts in determining whether to consider evidence outside the administrative record upon a de novo review of factual issues bearing on an administrator denial of erisa benefits.
background 
the following are facts that the district court found,and that neither party contests as clearly erroneous on appeal.
marianne locher locher,was employed as a legal secretary at katten muchin zavis kmz from march,until april,when her resignation took effect.locher was a participant within the meaning of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,in a disability plan the plan provided by kmz through an insurance policy issued by unum life insurance company of america unum.the parties do not dispute that the plan is an employee benefit welfare plan within the meaning of erisa.the plan provides for a monthly benefit for a period of disability,defined as an inability of the insured to perform each of the material duties of his regular occupation because of injury or sickness.
in november,locher regular physician,david zimmerman,diagnosed locher as suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome cfs.according to locher,she did not disclose her condition to kmz at the time she began working there in march,because she was afraid that kmz would not hire her if it was known that she had cfs.in or about september,locher health began to decline.she began waking up exhausted.she began taking a taxi to work because she did not have the energy to walk to the corner for the bus.as her symptoms became more severe,locher attempted to preserve her energy for work by stopping most activities outside of work.on january,locher saw zimmerman and discussed her symptoms and difficulties with activities.zimmerman advised her to reduce her work schedule.
in early,locher requested that her employee classification be changed from to.by written memorandum on february,a kmz administrator advised locher that kmz would consider her request if she provided a medical certificate attesting to her medical condition and her need for a reduced work schedule.locher had not provided such documentation as of march,and,on that date,locher was counseled for excessive unscheduled absences and for medical appointments scheduled during the work day.locher annual performance evaluation also indicated that absences and tardiness were an issue.locher resigned from kmz on march,effective april.locher did not inform kmz that she was leaving due to the escalation of her cfs but,rather,told her office manager,barbara oxnam,that her reason for resigning was to move on.after locher left kmz,she worked as a temporary employee for fourteen days between april,and june.in june,locher consulted susan levine.after personally evaluating locher during a june,visit and reviewing zimmerman records,levine concluded that locher history and laboratory data support the diagnosis of cfs and fibromyalgia and that locher had become disabled in april 
on july,locher submitted an application for disability benefits to unum,claiming that cfs had rendered her unable to work at kmz beginning april.at the time she filed her application,locher submitted to unum an attending physician statement from zimmerman and a letter from levine,and kmz submitted to unum an employer report of claim,as well as certain of locher employee records,including attendance records,an employee data form,and letters concerning her request for a reduced work schedule.
unum denied the claim on august,maintaining that locher was ineligible for benefits because she work ed up to the day which she resigned sic and was only absent three days in the three months prior to her resignation.locher submitted an administrative appeal on september,supported by additional evidence in the form of a letter report from zimmerman dated september,and a case history report.subsequently,upon unum request,zimmerman provided his office records to unum.unum upheld the denial of locher claim on march,stating that while the medical evidence suggested an inability to work as of july,it did not suggest disability as of the date last worked,april.on march,locher requested reconsideration of this decision and submitted a copy of the march,decision she received from the social security administration granting her disability benefits.on reconsideration,unum reviewed levine office records and asked john dodge,an physician,to review all of the medical evidence in locher claim file.based in part on dodge conclusions,unum denied locher second appeal on november,again on the basis of insufficient evidence to support a finding of inability to work as of april.
in may,locher commenced this action against unum and kmz.the parties subsequently moved for summary judgment based on the administrative record.the district court denied the motions.in may,locher voluntarily dismissed her claims against kmz.
in august,unum sought an in limine ruling to limit the evidence at trial to the administrative record.among other things,unum objected to the proposed testimony of richard podell,whom locher retained in february as an expert witness,and cynthia,a former of locher at kmz.the district court denied unum motion,finding that all of the persons involved in the initial and appellate review of locher claim under the disability plan were unum employees,and thus unum was a conflicted administrator within the meaning of defelice american international life assurance of new york,cir,and that unum had insufficient written procedures for claims review.based on those findings,the court found good cause for the admission of evidence outside the administrative record.the district court also stated that unum conflict of interest was per se good cause for allowing additional evidence at trial.
the district court thereafter conducted a bench trial.six witnesses testified,including locher zimmerman,her regular physician dodge,unum physician and podell,whom locher saw in.podell,who specializes in cfs,testified that he saw locher in february,confirmed the diagnosis of cfs and disability as of april,and found credible locher account of the progress of her illness.the parties also introduced the claim file,deposition transcripts,and various medical and employment records and reports.
on march,the district court issued an opinion and order setting forth its finding that locher was disabled within the meaning of the policy as of april.on november,following a motion for reconsideration by unum and submissions on the amount of benefits,attorneys fees and costs,and prejudgment interest,the district court directed that final judgment be entered in favor of locher finding that she was disabled as of april,and was entitled to benefits under the plan in the monthly amount of for the months of july,august,and september,and a monthly benefit of for each month through june,the month in which judgment was entered.the district court also awarded locher prejudgment interest and attorneys fees and costs.judgment was entered on november,and unum filed a notice of appeal on november.
discussion 
standard of review 
the district court factual findings are reviewed for clear error,and its legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.see krizek cigna group,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.internal quotation marks omitted.clear error review extends to a district court factual findings based on inferences drawn from other facts,as well as findings based on documentary evidence.see id.
ii.consideration of evidence outside the administrative record 
where an erisa plan does not accord an administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,a district court reviews all aspects of an administrator eligibility determination,including fact issues,de novo firestone tire rubber bruch,d see also krizek,at.in masella blue cross blue shield of connecticut,cir,we held that a district court may consider evidence outside the administrative record upon a de novo review of issues of plan interpretation.in defelice american international life assurance company of new york,cir,we addressed whether a district court may consider evidence outside the administrative record upon a de novo review of factual issues.we declined to issue a broad ruling on the permissible range of evidence in any case involving de novo review of factual issues but,rather,decided that,on the facts before us,the consideration of additional evidence was warranted.id.at.we found significant that the appeals committee that reviewed defelice claim was comprised entirely of employees of the administrator,that there existed no established criteria for determining an appeal,and that the committee apparently had a practice of destroying or discarding all records within minutes after hearing an appeal.id.at.in such circumstances,we held,t he policy expressed in perry simplicity engineering,cir,that district courts should not become substitute plan administrators is inappropriate.at.when an administrator is conflicted,we stated,p laintiffs are utterly helpless against the whim of its interpretation of the facts,and the fairness of the erisa appeals process can not be established using only the record before the administrator.id.in such circumstances,we held,district courts must exercise fully their power to review benefits determinations de novo and to be substitute administrators.id.
thus,in defelice,we set forth the principle that the decision whether to admit additional evidence is one which is discretionary with the district court,but which discretion ought not to be exercised in the absence of good cause,and we applied that principle by holding that,upon de novo review,even purely factual interpretation cases may provide a district court with good cause to exercise its discretion to admit evidence not available at the administrative level if the administrator was not disinterested and,i n this situation,the district court may assume an active role in order to ensure a comprehensive and impartial review of the case.at see also id.at a demonstrated conflict of interest in the administrative reviewing body is an example of good cause warranting the introduction of additional evidence.we also held that,in such circumstances,the plaintiff need not demonstrate that the conflict caused her actual prejudice in order for the court to consider the conflict to be good cause.id.at.
several district courts in this the district court interpreted defelice as holding that an administrator dual status as claims reviewer and claims payor is per se good cause for allowing additional evidence upon a de novo review of factual issues.see locher unum life ins.of,d,see also,keiser cdc inv.mgmt,civ,wl,at,t he conflict of interest is per se good cause under defelice for allowing the court to consider evidence that was not before the plan administrator.parker reliance standard life ins,civ,wl,at,i t is undisputed that reliance both makes the eligibility determinations under the p lan and pays the disability benefits.that fact alone makes reliance a conflicted administrator under defelice and its progeny.internal citation omitted.other district courts found no per se rule and held that good cause is established under defelice only if the plaintiff can demonstrate that the administrator was conflicted and that the additional evidence should have been included in the administrative record but was not,because of no fault of the claimant.suozzo bergreen,civ,wl,at,see also unum life ins.of,cv,wl,at april.
we take this opportunity to clarify our holding in defelice and make plain that a conflict of interest does not per se constitute good cause to consider evidence outside of the administrative record upon a de novo review of factual issues bearing on an administrator denial of erisa benefits.as noted above,in defelice,we based our holding not only on a demonstrated conflict of interest,but also upon the procedural problems with the plan administrator appeals process.at.we found significant that the appeals committee had no established criteria for determining an appeal and had a practice of destroying records within minutes after hearing an appeal.see id.
moreover,a per se rule would effectively eliminate the good cause requirement and the discretion afforded to district courts in deciding whether to admit additional evidence,because claims reviewers and payors are almost always either the same entity or financially connected in some other way.defelice,at setting forth requirement of good cause critchlow first unum life ins.of america,cir noting that the decision to consider information outside the administrative record is a discretionary one even where there is good cause,withdrawn and vacated on reconsideration on other grounds,cir.additionally,a per se rule is inconsistent with the congressional purposes and goals of erisa.the primary goals of erisa are to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans,to protect contractually defined benefits,firestone,at.internal quotation marks omitted,and to maintain the premium costs of an erisa system at a reasonable level,c.the supreme court has emphasized both the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans and the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures.pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.
as noted above,because claims reviewers and payors are often interconnected,a per se rule would allow additional evidence to be presented at the district court level in almost every circumstance on the basis of a presumed conflict of interest.a per se rule would also eliminate the appropriate incentive for a claimant to submit all available evidence regarding the claimant condition to the insurance company upon first submitting a claim.masella,at noting claimant obligation at the administrative level to provide particulars regarding the claimant condition.accordingly,a per se rule would undermine the significant erisa policy interests of minimizing costs of claim disputes and ensuring prompt procedures.see pilot life,at.varity howe,d indicating that courts should take into account congress desire not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs,or litigation expenses,unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans hall unum life ins.of,cir by strictly limiting the circumstances in which supplementary evidence may be presented,the risk of increasing decision of deterring employers from providing pension and benefit plans to their controlled.
in keeping with these principles,we held in defelice that good cause existed not merely because the claims reviewer and claims payor were the same entity,but also because the procedures employed in arriving at the claim determination were flawed.at.we have also found that good cause for consulting evidence outside the administrative record existed where an insurer claimed reason for denying a claim was not stated in its notices to the claimant,juliano health maint.org.of new jersey,cir,but did not exist where an insurer gave the claimant ample time to submit additional materials and had already discussed the claimant case with the two treating physicians whose testimony was to be introduced,muller first unum life ins,cir.
despite the district court statement that we had set forth a per se rule in defelice,the district court did consider facts other than the structural conflict in arriving at its good cause determination,namely,that unum had no written proce
