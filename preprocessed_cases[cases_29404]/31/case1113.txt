we consider whether the employee retirement income security act of allows employee benefit plans to recover unpaid contributions from an employer who is not a party to the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
nyca,is an advertising agency based in southern california.along with other advertising agencies,nyca is party to a collective bargaining agreement the commercials contract with the screen actors guild,a union that represents actors.the commercials contract requires signatory advertising agencies,referred to as producers,to contribute to employee health and pension plans.the producers must pay an amount equal to percent of the gross compensation paid to principal performers for acting in commercials.that is to say,when a performer performs,the agreement requires producers to contribute to the plans.
golf company,taylormade,manufacturers products.in,taylormade recruited fred couples,a famous professional golfer,to endorse its products.under this lucrative deal,couples receives a hefty sum for promoting taylormade golf products in television commercials and during personal appearances the endorsement agreement ensures that,in the event payments under a collective bargaining agreement are necessary,taylormade will make the required contributions.significantly,taylormade is not a signatory to the commercials contract.
nyca and taylormade also have their own contractual relationship,which began before taylormade signed the endorsement deal with couples.under this arrangement,nyca acts as taylormade exclusive advertising agent for products and equipment.under one provision of this agreement,taylormade recognize s that nyca is signatory to collective bargaining agreements with the screen actors guild and other union agreements,and that the hiring and use of talent by nyca on behalf will be subject to the terms of such agreements.
as taylormade advertising agent,nyca works with couples to produce golf advertisements.both taylormade and nyca,however,split the considerable bill for couples services.nyca paid couples,while paid couples significantly more.nyca,however,calculated its contribution obligations under the commercials contract with reference only to its own payments to couples,instead of the combined payments made by nyca and taylormade.this resulted in a significantly lower obligation than nyca would otherwise have owed.
not everyone was happy with nyca arithmetic.the trustees of employee benefit plans covered by the commercials contract sued both nyca and taylormade.they claimed that the employee retirement income security act of erisa entitles them to contributions based upon couples total compensation,not merely the portion paid by nyca.the district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.the trustees timely appealed.
the trustees contend that taylormade,which has not signed the commercials contract,is nonetheless liable for unpaid contributions as a joint employer of couples.according to the trustees,nyca and taylormade jointly exercised sufficient control over fred couples employment such that nyca and taylormade are joint employers for purposes of federal labor law.in support of this theory,the trustees identify analogous cases holding companies liable as joint employers under the fair labor standards act of flsa.
this argument presents us with a straightforward issue of statutory interpretation.we begin,as we must,with the text of the statute.erisa requires employers to contribute to employee benefit plans in accordance with the terms of collectively bargained agreements.specifically 
every employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall,to the extent not inconsistent with law,make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan or such agreement.
id.emphasis added thus,we must decide whether an alleged joint employer who is not a signatory to a collective bargaining agreement may nevertheless qualify as an employer who is obligated to make contributions within the meaning of.
before reaching that question,however,we pause to satisfy ourselves that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.at the outset,taylormade challenges our jurisdiction,asserting that we may not hear this case because taylormade is not an employer who is obligated to make contributions with the meaning of.according to taylormade,the district court should have dismissed the trustees action for lack of jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b rather than for failure to state a claim under rule b.the two concepts,of course,are distinct the former determines whether the plaintiff has a right to be in the particular court and the latter is an adjudication as to whether a cognizable legal claim has been stated.wright miller,federal practice and procedure ed.
we disagree with taylormade,and take this opportunity to clear up a persistent procedural confusion that has bedeviled the courts of appeals it is a cardinal principle of federal arising under jurisdiction that a ny assertion of a federal claim suffices to establish federal question jurisdiction,even if that claim is later dismissed on the merits.cement masons health welfare trust fund for cal.stone,cir see also bell hood.if the court exercise s its jurisdiction to determine that the allegations in the complaint do not state a ground for relief,then dismissal of the case would be on the merits,not for want of jurisdiction.
guided by this principle,we clarify today that whether a defendant is an employer who is obligated to make contributions within the meaning of is a question on the merits of the claim,not an issue of jurisdiction.no one suggests that the trustees are attempting to sneak through the courthouse doors on the back of a frivolous federal claim.to the contrary we are satisfied that the trustees have made out a colorable federal claim that properly belongs in federal court.whether the trustees will ultimately prevail,of course,remains to be seen.at this stage,however,the district court correctly analyzed this case under rule b rather than under rule b.
persuaded that we may decide this case,we return to the merits of the trustees claims against taylormade.we need look no further than the plain language of to reach our conclusion.in our view,imposes no independent obligation upon employers it merely provides a federal cause of action to enforce obligations created by collective bargaining agreements.indeed,though clumsily phrased in the passive voice,nonetheless expressly locates the source of the duties imposed on employers in the terms of a collectively bargained agreement,not in any independent provision of federal law.because taylormade has not signed the commercials contract,it follows that it has not incurred any such obligations under.the trustees joint employer theory,by seeking to impose obligations above and beyond those required by collective bargaining agreements,directly conflicts with the plain language of the statute.therefore,we decline the invitation to extend the joint employer theory to the context now before us.
that several other circuits have adopted the same reading of the statutory language supports our conclusion.see cement concrete workers dist.council welfare fund lollo,cir section does not impose a duty to make pension contributions,even on one who qualifies as an employer under the general definition provided in,if the duty to contribute did not previously exist.laborers health welfare fund starrett paving,cir int l of painters allied trades union george kracher,erisa does not require employers to provide pension plans the obligation to do so,and to contribute to them,springs from a contract embodied in a plan or a collective bargaining agreement.thus,we are satisfied that the trustees can not hold taylormade liable under the joint employer theory.
we hasten to point out that an employer may not avoid liability merely by showing that it has not signed the applicable collective bargaining agreement.shareholders and officers of a corporation may be liable for
