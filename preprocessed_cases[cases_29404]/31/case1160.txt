with that amendment we reinstate the mandate.
marc silver claims that he is disabled due to the deteriorating condition of his heart.he argues that,as a result of his disabling heart condition,he is entitled to benefits under an insurance policy issued by the unum life insurance company of america unum.unum claims that silver recovered from his disability and that under the terms of the policy he is therefore not entitled to benefits.following a bench trial,the district court upheld unum decision to deny silver claim.we now reverse.
factual and procedural background 
since,executive car leasing has provided coverage for its employees under a disability insurance policy policy.the policy is administered by unum and governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.it provides benefits to executive car leasing employees who suffer a loss of earnings due to disability.to qualify as disabled under the policy,a claimant must demonstrate that because of injury or sickness he can not perform each of the material duties of his regular occupation.also,because the policy covers only disabilities,it establishes a elimination period,during which time no benefits are payable.thus,to receive benefits under the unum policy,a claimant must establish not only that he is disabled,but also that he is disabled continuously for days following the initial date on which he claims disability.if the claimant fails to show that he is continuously disabled throughout this elimination period and does not return to work after those days,coverage under the policy terminates.
silver,an executive car leasing employee who was covered under the unum policy,has a lengthy history of severe heart disease.he is a records indicate that he smoked up to one and a half packs a day for as many as for nearly as long he has suffered from claudication,or cramping,in his legs,which is a symptom of peripheral heart disease.in,he suffered a myocardial infarction a heart attack.doctors discovered that three vessels in his heart were blocked,and he underwent surgery to circumvent the obstructions.in,he suffered another heart attack when one of the grafts from his bypass surgery became completely obstructed.he returned to the hospital complaining of chest pain in and,and when he returned yet again in,cardiologists found multiple pathways obstructed and conducted another surgery.in november of,doctors again found that several of silver blood vessels were partially or entirely occluded.this time,they performed procedure in which a small balloon is first inserted into the obstructed blood vessel and then inflated to clear the obstruction.
despite these medical problems,silver continued to work as a sales manager at executive car leasing.his job generally required him to work around nine hours a day and demanded that he fulfill sales quotas for the company.silver claims that the work was stressful for him,and unum has conceded that his employment at executive car leasing required him to work under stressful conditions.
the events giving rise to this lawsuit started to unfold when,in december of,he once again started having chest pain.on december,silver sought treatment at western medical center in santa ana,california,after experiencing acute chest pain and angina,or shortness of breath.an initial examination excluded the possibility of another heart attack,but concluded that silver would require a cardiac catheterization his fifth such procedure and possibly another angioplasty procedure.further examination revealed that there were lesions in two of his blood vessels and that several other vessels were occluded,or blocked,with the openings in some of these vessels narrowed by as much as percent.doctors performed another angioplasty on silver,his second.medical reports from this hospitalization indicate that the procedure was successful and that the results from the angioplasty were excellent.upon his release from the hospital,silver consulted his cardiologist,melvin tonkon,who advised him to stop working.silver followed tonkon advice,stopped working,and filed a claim for benefits under the unum policy.he described his disability as heart disease and angioplasty,and he listed his date of disability as december,date on which his second angioplasty procedure had been performed.
in the days that followed his second angioplasty,during the critical elimination period that followed his purported date of disability silver continued to experience complications related to his cardiac condition.he visited a pulmonary specialist,fox,whose records contain mixed news on silver fox noted that there was only mild obstruction of some of silver blood vessels,he also reported that silver complained of shortness of breath,that silver was experiencing decreased blood flow on the left side of his body which another doctor attributed to a partially occluded artery,and that silver had symptoms consistent with chronic bronchitis and emphysema.silver also visited a sleep specialist,who diagnosed silver as having obstructive sleep apnea,a condition related to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular disease that causes its sufferers to stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep,sometime hundreds of times during the night and often for a minute or longer.again during the elimination period silver returned to the emergency room after waking up with sharp,stabbing chest pain.the medical records from this visit contain mixed results.some tests indicated an abnormal resting electrocardiogram and changes of uncertain significance in silver heart condition,including one diagnosis that suspected partial blockage of his left subclavian artery.with other tests,doctors noted that there had been improvement in the area where angioplasty had been performed,and they ultimately released silver from the hospital without change in his medical condition.throughout the elimination period,silver worked with tonkon on a program of cardiac rehabilitation due to concerns about being able to drive safely to and from the proper medical facilities,he pursued this rehabilitation program at home.
following the end of the elimination period,silver cardiac woes continued.he returned to western medical center on may,complaining of chest pain.once again,doctors found his heart in poor condition,with his right coronary artery and his left anterior descending artery nearly completely blocked.again,doctors performed an angioplasty procedure.this third angioplasty procedure was completed with no complications,and silver was again released.thereafter,silver successfully pursued a claim for disability benefits from the social security administration ssa.though the ssa ultimately determined that silver was entitled to benefits as a result of a psychological exam diagnosing him with affective mood disorder,the ssa also determined that silver became disabled under our rules on december,indicating that silver psychological problems were at least related to,if not triggered by,his cardiac condition and the angioplasty procedure that took place on that date.
unum ultimately rejected silver claim,ruling that silver cardiac condition had substantially improved following the angioplasty procedure and that he therefore had not demonstrated that he was continuously disabled during the elimination period,which expired on march.unum letter stated after comprehensive review of the medical information in file,it is our medical department opinion that your cardiac condition was resolved within the elimination period and no longer precludes you from performing the material and substantial duties of your occupation as a sales manager.letter from patrick taylor,associate customer care specialist,unum life insurance company,to marc silver,at may,hereinafter unum letter.unum based its ruling on the conclusions of its medical personnel that silver cardiac condition had stabilized and that t here is no documented indication of continued chest pain.id.at.silver pursued an administrative appeal,which unum denied.
silver then filed this lawsuit to contest unum decision.the district court found that de novo review of unum ruling was appropriate because the erisa plan adopted by executive car leasing did not give unum discretionary authority to make benefit determinations and to interpret the plan.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d bendixen standard ins,cir see also kearney standard ins,cir en banc holding that a policy with similar terms rendered the insurance company decision subject to de novo review.the district court conducted this de novo review of the unum decision with a bench trial following the bench trial,the district court upheld unum decision.in rendering its decision,the district court adopted wholesale and verbatim pages of factual findings and legal conclusions that unum had proposed.
like,more accurately,via unum district court concluded that silver had failed to meet the burden of proving his disability.the court found that,because silver had failed to provide sufficient proof of his disability and had not returned to work after the elimination period,coverage under the policy had terminated.accordingly,the district court entered judgment in favor of unum.
silver appealed the district court decision.we have jurisdiction under.
ii.standard of review 
where,as here,a district court has conducted a de novo review of an erisa plan administrator decision,we review the court factual findings only to determine whether they are clearly erroneous.kearney,at.even when a district court adopts wholesale the findings of fact proposed by one party,as the district court did here,we do not alter this standard of review.see anderson city of bessemer,d e ven when the trial judge adopts proposed findings of fact verbatim,the findings are those of the court and may be reversed only if clearly erroneous.barnett sea land,cir we refuse to apply a stricter standard of review based on the fact that the district court may have adopted certain findings proposed by either party.citing bessemer,at.
nonetheless,the wholesale and verbatim adoption of one party findings requires us to review the record and the district court opinion more thoroughly.the ninth circuit has reiterated,both before and after the supreme court decision in bessemer,that it reviews a district court findings of fact with special scrutiny when a district court engage s in the regrettable practice of adopting the findings drafted by the prevailing party wholesale.sealy,easy living,cir see also in re richards processing,cir quoting sealy,at.thus,we review the district court decision with special scrutiny,sealy,at,to determine whether its findings were clearly erroneous,bessemer,at.while there is some dissonance between the deferential standard of review we now apply and our practice of scrutinizing the findings of a district court that uncritically adopts the proposed opinion of the victorious party,these two lines of authority are not incompatible indeed it is entirely consistent to review a district court conclusions for clear error,while applying that standard of review with a careful inspection of the record.see commodity futures trading comm topworth int l,cir noting that factual findings are reviewed for clear error,but with particularly close scrutiny where the district court adopt s one party proposed findings.
we note that scrutiny is especially warranted when,after conducting de novo review of a decision by an erisa plan administrator,a district court adopts verbatim the administrator proposed factual findings and legal conclusions.we have previously emphasized that,when they conduct de novo review,district courts have a responsibility under the erisa framework to undertake an independent and thorough inspection of an administrator decision.see mongeluzo,at emphasizing the obligation of the district court to conduct a sufficiently thorough review of the record,as well as its authority to introduce additional evidence into the record,in order to enable the full exercise of informed and independent judgment.when a district court adopts wholesale and verbatim the findings and conclusions of an erisa plan administrator,it behooves us to review the district court findings carefully to ensure that the trial court has adequately discharged its responsibility.wariness of a district court verbatim adoption of a plan administrator proposed findings is especially warranted in the erisa context because of the complex and sometimes conflicting roles of plan administrators.see abatie alta health life ins,cir noting that a district court review of an administrator decision must be tempered by skepticism commensurate with the plan administrator conflict of interest in re richards processing,cir noting that courts must be wary of borrowed findings in any event sealy,easy living,cir same.
iii.discussion 
both unum and the district court found that silver was not entitled to benefits under the policy because he had recovered from his disability within the elimination period.we hold that this finding is clearly erroneous.
there can be no dispute that silver was disabled within the meaning of the policy terms when,on december,he went to the emergency room to seek treatment for his cardiac condition.the sole question is whether,during the following three months,silver was able to perform the material functions of an admittedly stressful job,or whether his cardiac condition prevented his return to work during those days.
the district court upheld unum determination that silver was not disabled as of march,the conclusion of the elimination period.much of its reasoning,however,does not withstand scrutiny.for example,the district court reasoned in part that silver was not impaired during the elimination period because he had worked for approximately years with coronary artery disease,and continued to work following bypass surgeries and prior angioplasty procedures.such a finding disregards the progressive and degenerative nature of silver cardiovascular disease,and it overlooks the recommendations of silver treating cardiologist,who had advised silver only in recent visits that he was in no shape to be working.likewise,the findings proposed by unum and adopted by the district court focus myopically on the test results indicating improvement in cardiovascular function following silver angioplasty procedure.while the tests do indeed indicate some improvement in silver condition as to the affected areas of silver heart,they fall short of demonstrating silver ability to return to a stressful work environment,especially given the contemporaneous evidence of ongoing cardiac difficulty.in the same fashion,unum specialists and the distric
