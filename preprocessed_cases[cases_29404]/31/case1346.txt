the laborers health and welfare trust fund for northern california trust fund is an employee health and welfare benefit plan plan subject to the employee retirement income security act of et erisa.in,it paid out in benefits for medical expenses incurred by one of its participants,defendant and respondent jeanne hill hill,who had suffered a punctured bowel during surgery.in,hill received a settlement in the medical malpractice lawsuit she filed against her doctor for his alleged negligence.upon learning of the settlement,the trustees attempted to obtain reimbursement for the medical expenses paid by the trust fund pursuant to the terms of the plan,but hill refused.the trustees then filed a breach of contract claim in state court alleging hill failure to abide by the terms of the plan.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of hill,and the trustees appeal.
preliminarily,we must decide whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear this claim.this,in turn,requires us to determine whether an erisa fiduciary may sue in either state or federal court for reimbursement of benefits paid to a plan participant or beneficiary who recovers personal injury damages from a tortfeasor.we conclude the trustees had a federal erisa claim for reimbursement over which the federal courts exercise exclusive subject matter jurisdiction.further,state courts not only lack concurrent jurisdiction over erisa claims for reimbursement,but their jurisdiction over state law claims is displaced by erisa.as a consequence,we order the judgment vacated and the complaint dismissed.
background 
in december,hill filed a medical malpractice lawsuit in shasta county superior court alleging that her doctor had negligently performed surgery on her on december.in december,hill settled this claim for,a figure that represented compensation for pain and suffering and lost wages 
at the time of the alleged malpractice,hill was a nurse at mercy medical center in redding.her labor union had contracted with the trust fund to provide health and welfare benefits to the employees of mercy medical center,and hill was a participant in the plan.hill claimed in medical bills related to the malpractice,and the trust fund paid in benefits the plan is and does not provide benefits through insurance.under its terms,when benefits are paid due to an illness,injury,or other condition for which a third party is responsible,the trust fund has an automatic lien on any recovery the participant receives for benefits paid by the trust fund as a result of such illness,injury,or condition 
upon learning of hill medical malpractice claim,the trustees sent hill a request to sign a reimbursement agreement.hill did not return this agreement and did not reimburse the trust fund for the amounts paid on her behalf.
on march,the trustees filed an action against hill in san francisco superior court for breach of contract.hill demurred to the complaint on the ground that the trustees action was preempted by erisa and subject matter jurisdiction was exclusive in federal court.the trustees argued the case was not related to erisa and,therefore,it could proceed in state court and under state law.the trial court overruled hill demurrer,finding the cause of action did not relate to the plan and the state court had subject matter jurisdiction.
hill then filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that civil code section of the medical injury compensation reform act of micra applied to her malpractice settlement and precluded the trustees action seeking reimbursement from hill settlement proceeds the trustees took the position that micra was preempted by erisa,and thus the claim was not barred.the trustees moved for judgment on the pleadings as to hill affirmative defenses based on lack of state court subject matter jurisdiction and micra.the trial court reaffirmed its previous jurisdictional finding and granted the trustees motion as to hill affirmative defense contesting the court subject matter jurisdiction.in addition,the trial court concluded that because the trustees breach of contract cause of action did not relate to erisa,erisa could not be used to defeat hill micra defense.the court granted hill motion for summary judgment,and entered judgment in favor of hill.the trustees now appeal from that judgment.
discussion 
hill may raise the issue of subject matter jurisdiction 
in the proceedings below,hill demurred to the trustees complaint on the ground that the trustees breach of contract cause of action was preempted by erisa,and the state court had no subject matter jurisdiction.the trial court overruled hill demurrer,but subsequently granted hill motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of hill.
in their opening brief,the trustees challenge the grant of summary judgment and the entry of judgment in favor of hill.in her opposition brief,hill first asserts a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and then addresses the substance of the trustees argument regarding summary judgment.in their reply,the trustees argue the jurisdictional claim was procedurally barred because,as a nonappealing respondent,hill can not raise claims of error except to show any error claimed by the trustees was harmless.we conclude subject matter jurisdiction may properly be challenged.
lack of jurisdiction in its most fundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case,an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties.citation.abelleira district court of appeal cal d.the adequacy of the court subject matter jurisdiction must be addressed whenever that issue comes to the court attention.keiffer bechtel th,d.
chromy lawrance d.is instructive.in chromy,the defendants filed a demurrer challenging the court subject matter jurisdiction,which the trial court overruled.the defendants did not seek relief by way of a writ,and a jury trial followed,resulting in a defense verdict.the plaintiff appealed and challenged the verdict on several grounds,but neither party discussed subject matter jurisdiction on appeal.id.at.the court of appeal raised the issue sua sponte,found a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,vacated the judgment and ordered the trial court to dismiss the action.as the court explained w here a court is wholly lacking in jurisdiction of the subject matter of an action,jurisdiction may not be conferred by consent,waiver,agreement,acquiescence or estoppel.id.at.we agree with that analysis and conclude hill may raise her jurisdictional challenge.
ii.erisa provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction over the trustees federal claims 
section of title of the united states code provides for methods of civil enforcement under erisa.section a b provides a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary b to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.section a provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
section e provides for jurisdiction except for actions under subsection a b of this section,the district courts of the united states shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this subchapter brought by the secretary or by a participant,beneficiary,fiduciary,or any person referred to in section f state courts of competent jurisdiction and district courts of the united states shall have concurrent jurisdiction of actions under paragraphs b and of subsection a of this section.
pursuant to these provisions,the trustees,as fiduciaries of the plan,could have sought relief under section a in federal court for reimbursement of hill medical expenses paid for by the plan.life ins.krafka th,d krafka.the trustees rely on providence health plan mcdowell cir mcdowell to argue krafka was wrongly decided and section a does not provide the plan a cause of action in federal court.in mcdowell,as here,a health plan sued in state court for reimbursement of benefits paid.the ninth circuit found this breach of contract cause of action for reimbursement was not removable to federal court because it did not fall within erisa civil enforcement scheme.as a fiduciary to the plan providence only vehicle for relief in addressing violations or seeking enforcement of a plan is section a.however,that section allows a fiduciary to seek only equitable relief for violation of the plan.here,providence is seeking ordinary upon contractual remedies that arise under state law.therefore,its claim is not within erisa civil enforcement provisions.citation.mcdowell,at.mcdowell interpreted life annuity ins.knudson,d knudson to hold that section a did not authorize a fiduciary to enforce a reimbursement provision in federal court,and,therefore,a claim for monetary relief based on contractual remedies arising under state law was not within erisa enforcement provisions.mcdowell,at.
in sereboff mid atlantic medical services,d sereboff,the united states supreme court clarified and limited its holding in knudson.sereboff considered the circumstances under which an erisa fiduciary may file a federal suit for reimbursement of medical expenses paid by the erisa plan,when the beneficiaries recovered for their injuries from a third party.in sereboff,the beneficiaries of a health plan covered by erisa suffered injuries in an automobile accident,and the plan paid the medical expenses.sereboff.at.the beneficiaries commenced a tort action in state court against several third parties seeking compensatory damages for their injuries,and eventually settled the claim.id.at.while the tort suit was pending,the plan sent the beneficiaries letters asserting its right to a lien on a portion of any recovery however,after settling their tort claim and receiving their settlement proceeds,the beneficiaries did not reimburse the plan.the plan fiduciary brought suit against the beneficiaries in federal district court under section a,seeking to collect the medical expenses it paid on behalf of the beneficiaries.the fiduciary sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction requiring the beneficiaries to set aside the amount at issue,and the district court approved a stipulation by the parties requiring the beneficiaries to do so until the court ruled on the merits.the district court subsequently ruled in favor of the plan fiduciary and ordered the beneficiaries to reimburse the plan with interest.sereboff,at.the supreme court affirmed the judgment,finding that the plan fiduciary action properly sought equitable relief under section a.sereboff,at.
in reaching its conclusion,the supreme court explained the focus of the inquiry was whether the relief requested by the plan fiduciary was equitable under section a b.sereboff,supra.at.the plan fiduciary sought specifically identifiable funds that were within the possession and control of the beneficiaries.id.at.the court stated,erisa provides for equitable remedies to enforce plan terms,so the fact that the action involves a breach of contract can hardly be enough to prove relief is not equitable.sereboff,at.the court found the basis of the plan fiduciary claim was equitable because the reimbursement provision in the plan specifically identified a particular fund,distinct from the beneficiaries general assets a ll recoveries from a third party whether by lawsuit,settlement,or otherwise and a particular share of that fund to which the plan was entitled that portion of the total recovery which is due the plan for benefits paid.id.at.the plan fiduciary could therefore rely on a familiar rul e of equity to collect for the medical bills it had paid on the beneficiaries behalf and follow a portion of the recovery into the beneficiaries hands as soon as the settlement fund was identified,and impose on that portion a constructive trust or equitable lien.ibid.the court summarized,the plan fiduciary action to enforce the reimbursement provision qualifies as an equitable remedy because it is indistinguishable from an action to enforce an equitable lien established by agreement.id.at.
sereboff distinguished its previous holding in knudson stating,claimed a right to recover in restitution,and the court concluded only that equitable restitution was unavailable because the funds sought were not in knudson possession.sereboff,supra.at,but had instead been placed in a special needs trust under california law,at.thus,under sereboff,a plan fiduciary may enforce its reimbursement provisions by seeking equitable relief in federal courts.in this case,although the trustees chose not to follow the steps taken by the plan fiduciary in sereboff,they could have sought reimbursement under section a.
moreover,section e clearly provides that federal jurisdiction over an erisa plan erisa claim is exclusive.as krafka explained,the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of civil lawsuits under erisa,except for actions under section a b and a state courts have concurrent jurisdiction in matters arising under those subdivisions.section a b and a authorizes actions,respectively by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits and by a state to enforce compliance the p laintiff is not a plan participant or beneficiary,nor is it a state.therefore,the plaintiff is not a proper party to bring an action in state court under erisa,section a b or a.in other words,any action the plaintiff may be able to bring under erisa is not a lawsuit as to which this court can exercise concurrent subject matter jurisdiction.krafka,supra,th at,d.
iii.erisa ousts state courts of subject matter jurisdiction over the trustees state claims 
the trustees have filed state law breach of contract claims,not erisa claims.thus,section e,which allocates state and federal court jurisdiction over erisa claims,does not determine whether a state court has jurisdiction over these state law claims.we conclude,however,that the complete preemption doctrine compels the displacement of state court subject matter jurisdiction over the trustees claims.
a.the complete preemption doctrine 
despite the similarity in nomenclature,complete preemption is quite distinct from ordinary preemption.as explained in professor moore treatise on federal jurisdiction,ordinary preemption is an affirmative defense to the allegations in a plaintiff complaint asserting a state law claim claiming that a state law conflicts with,and is overridden by,a federal law.on the other hand,complete preemption does not constitute a defense at all.rather,it is a narrowly drawn jurisdictional rule for assessing federal removal jurisdiction when a complaint purports to raise only state law claims.it looks beyond the complaint to determine if the suit is actually and entirely a matter of federal law,even if the state law would provide a cause of action in the absence of the federal law.moore manual federal practice and procedure b,fns.omitted see balcorta twentieth film cir.
in metropolitan life insurance taylor,d,the united states supreme court placed complete preemption in its doctrinal context.by statute any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant or the defendants,to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.citation.one category of cases over which the district courts have original jurisdiction are federal question cases that is,those cases arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.citation.it is long settled law that a cause of action arises under federal law only when the plaintiff complaint raises issues of federal law.citations.the complaint rule is the basic principle marking the boundaries of the federal question jurisdiction of the federal district courts.citation.federal is ordinarily a federal defense to the plaintiff suit.as a defense,it does not appear on the face of a complaint,and,therefore,does not authorize removal to
