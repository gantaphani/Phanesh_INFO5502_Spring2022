gary eckelkamp,an employee of melton machine and control company melton,and two former employees,bradley hoemann and ronald kampmann,brought this action against melton,its employee stock ownership plan esop,and four melton officers,alleging breach of fiduciary duty claims under the employee retirement income security act erisa and missouri common law,and a retaliatory discharge claim under erisa.the district court dismissed the state law claim and granted summary judgment to the defendants on the erisa claims.plaintiffs appeal,and we affirm.
in the esop purchased melton from founder vernon melton for million,or per share.at that time melton was transitioning from manufacturing for the bicycle and furniture industries to manufacturing for the automotive industry.this change brought increased sales,and melton achieved annual sales of more than by,when its stock was valued at per share.since,the average annual rate of return on melton stock including dividends and appreciation has been approximately.
the employee owners of melton have shared in the company success.excluding the individual defendants,the average employee earns in excess of in direct cash compensation each over the median market rate for similar positions in other companies.melton also contributes amounts equal to of each employee salary to his or her esop account and puts an additional into another deferred compensation account,the money purchase pension plan mppp.as of september,the average employee with at least one year of service at melton had accounts valued at.the twenty largest employee accounts averaged,again excluding any owned by the individual defendants.
melton stock is allocated to individual esop accounts according to a formula,derived from plan documents and federal regulations,which takes into account tenure with the company and annual eligible compensation.the individual defendants who remain with the company now hold about of melton shares in their esop accounts,and of the shares are concentrated in the accounts of only nine people.in contrast,plaintiff gary eckelkamp and thirty three other employees hold less than one share.
the individual defendants are responsible for managing both melton and the esop.gary rufkahr is the president and is also a director of melton,an esop trustee,and an esop administrative committee member.dennis beste and donald martin now retired,have each been esop fiduciaries,as well as officers and directors of melton.randy folkmann is an officer and an esop administrative committee member.
plaintiffs allege that in performing their functions the individual defendants violated their fiduciary duties by overcompensating themselves and by failing to obtain accurate annual appraisals of melton stock.rufkahr,beste,and martin have been responsible for setting employee salaries including their own,and the defense expert acknowledged that the individual defendants have been compensated at least above the median rate for similar positions in comparable companies.the annual appraisals of the company stock have been performed every year by everett mathews,and his figure for the value per share has been used to calculate the worth of each employee esop account.mathews appraised the value per share for the year at,but plaintiffs expert calculated that the actual value per share was over.
in january,a melton employee named greg cox took some documents from rufkahr briefcase.the documents revealed the compensation paid to melton executives,and cox copied them and shared the information with certain other employees,including plaintiff ronald kampmann.at the annual stockholder meeting on february,cox circulated a public notice containing information on executive compensation and calling for president rufkahr to resign.kampmann was later interviewed about the theft of the documents,but he did not reveal to management that he knew cox had taken them.kampmann was terminated effective march,for failure to cooperate in the investigation of the missing documents and for a pattern of work conduct problems.
plaintiffs brought this action on april.count i alleged that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties under erisa,count ii alleged an equitable claim asking for removal of the individual defendants as esop fiduciaries,count iii alleged that kampmann had been unlawfully terminated for exercising rights protected under erisa,and count iv alleged that the individual defendants had breached fiduciary duties under missouri law.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the state law claim and their motion for summary judgment on the erisa claims.plaintiffs attack these rulings on their appeal,as well as the court denial of two motions related to evidence.
to establish a breach of fiduciary duty claim under erisa,a plaintiff must show a breach of a fiduciary duty and a prima facie case of loss to the plan.see roth lumber,cir see also martin feilen,cir.once the plaintiff has satisfied these burdens,the burden of persuasion shifts to the fiduciary to prove that the loss was not caused by the breach of duty.roth,at quoting martin,at.summary judgment is warranted when there is no genuine issue of material fact,see,and we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,see hammond northland counseling,cir.
plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants breached their erisa fiduciary duties to the esop by using their positions as fiduciaries to overcompensate themselves and by failing to ensure that the annual appraisals were properly conducted.in its summary judgment decision,the district court ruled that the evidence presented on both of these claims was insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.
plaintiffs rely on the report of their expert,daniel callanan of comstock valuation advisors,to establish their erisa breach of fiduciary duty claims.in his report callanan states that the individual defendants are overcompensated and that the annual appraisals have consistently undervalued the company.plaintiffs contend that his opinion is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact on both claims,but summary judgment may be appropriate if an expert opinion is fundamentally unsupported and therefore of no assistance to the trier of fact.see kalamazoo river study group rockwell int l,cir viterbo dow chem,cir.although the district court did not specifically refer to daubert in its analysis of callanan report,it rejected his methodology and concluded that his opinion was of no value and therefore insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.see daubert merrell dow,d see also target market publ g,advo,cir upholding summary judgment where district court implicitly conducted daubert analysis.
in deciding whether expert evidence should be admitted,a district court must determine whether the expert methodology is reliable and can be reasonably applied to the facts of the case.see glastetter novartis,cir affirming exclusion of testimony by medical expert see also daubert,at.focus of rule inquiry is on principles and methodology of expert.here,the district court rejected callanan methodology with respect to both the overcompensation and improper appraisal theories,and we find no abuse of discretion in either determination.see general joiner,d united states dico,cir standard of review.
with respect to callanan overcompensation analysis,the district court found several methodological flaws.callanan failed to take into account the fact that all employees at melton are paid considerably more than market rates and that the compensation for production employees compares more favorably to the relevant market than that of the individual defendants.callanan premised his analysis on comparisons to executive compensation at companies that in many ways were not comparable to melton.many of the companies used for comparison were publicly held,none had achieved melton annual rate of growth,and some were not even profitable.he also did not visit the melton facility,interview its employees,research the job duties of executives at the comparison companies to ensure that their jobs were actually comparable to those of the individual defendants,or
