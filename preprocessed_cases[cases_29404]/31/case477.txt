a jury found william wofford guilty of theft from an employee benefit plan in violation of.section requires that a person embezzle,steal,abstract,or convert funds from an employee benefit plan that is subject to any provision of title i of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.wofford challenges the district court exclusion of his proposed expert testimony regarding whether the plan was tax qualified and thus subject to title i of erisa and the district court inclusion of a jury instruction that a qualified plan that later loses tax qualified status remains subject to title i of erisa,arguing that these actions denied him his right to a jury determination on whether the plan was subject to any provision of title wofford also challenges the district court inclusion of a deliberate ignorance instruction on the basis that its submission was not supported by the evidence.finding no error,we affirm.
on april,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging wofford with embezzlement from an employee benefit plan,in violation of.the indictment stated that premier consulting,owned by wofford,was an employee leasing company,that one of the benefits it provided to its employees was a k retirement benefit plan,known as the premier employer group k plan,and that the plan was an employee pension benefit plan subject to title i of erisa.wofford was the plan trustee and a fiduciary.
according to the indictment,paragraph of the plan contained a prohibition against diversion of funds that prohibited any part of the corpus or income of any trust fund maintained pursuant to the plan or any funds contributed therefore to be used for,or diverted to,purposes other than the exclusive benefit of participants,retired participants,or their beneficiaries.further,the indictment stated that certain provisions of erisa also prohibited self dealing by a plan trustee and fiduciary such as wofford,specifically listing and as forbidding wofford from directly and indirectly borrowing money from the plan and from causing any company that he owned and controlled from borrowing money from the plan.
the indictment asserted that,n otwithstanding these provisions of the plan agreement and of erisa,in the month period between on or about april,and on or about october,wofford directly and indirectly borrowed,withdrew and used,for his own use and benefit and for the use and benefit of companies and entities in which he had a financial interest,those monies,funds and assets of the plan described in counts one through ten of this indictment,in violation of the plan agreement and in violation of erisa.the indictment then charged that o n or about each of the dates set forth in counts one through ten,william wofford,with fraudulent intent,did embezzle,steal and unlawfully and willfully abstract and convert to his own use and the use of another,in the approximate amounts shown in each count,the moneys,funds,securities,premiums,credits,property and other assets of the premier employer group k plan,an employee pension benefit plan that was subject to title i of the employee retirement income security act of,and of a fund connected with said plan,by withdrawing and causing to be withdrawn from the edwards account holding the funds and assets of said employee pension benefit plan the funds represented by the checks described in each count.
before trial,the district court granted the government first amended motion to strike wofford designation of expert witness,precluding wofford from proffering an expert witness,david ralston.the government asserted that the expert proposed testimony was irrelevant and should be excluded under rules of evidence,and.the district court concluded that ralston planned to testify that the plan was not tax qualified,and found this testimony irrelevant because an employee plan is still governed by erisa whether or not it is tax qualified.
the evidence at trial was largely undisputed.the plan was established in and amended in.the plan was administered by administrators until march,when the plan assets were converted to cash and plan administration was turned over to premier.at the time of the transfer,wofford had sold premier consulting.the plan account balance was,and there were individuals with money in the plan.wofford was a plan participant,and his personal balance in the plan was approximately on march.wofford transferred the plan funds to an edwards money market account.
around the same time,wofford wrote letters to the participants informing them that the pension company would no longer be the administrator and that the only investment option available would be a money market account.he also gave instructions for participants to receive distributions and rollovers.many people responded to the letters asking for distributions,and premier paid them.one witness,gabe morris,testified that he received the letter but wanted to keep the money in the money market account.in addition,some of the letters were returned because the addresses were no longer good,and about remained in the edwards account at the end of february.at that time,wofford owned aircraft supply company,asci.he established an employee stock ownership plan esop at asci.wofford filed for personal bankruptcy in february.asci was also struggling financially,and wofford began borrowing money from the plan.
on april,wofford instructed his assistant,patricia dimmitt,to write a check from the edwards account for payable to fobasci esop for the benefit of asci esop.he also had her type up a promissory note from to the plan for.in september,again at wofford direction,dimmitt wrote two more checks payable to asci esop,for and,and also prepared promissory notes for those checks.the check contained the notation loan.in january,dimmitt also prepared checks for and payable to asci at wofford direction.dimmitt prepared a promissory note for for those loans.dimmitt prepared another check for on march,payable to asci and noted it as a loan.she also prepared a promissory note.on may,wofford wrote a check for to asci from the edwards account,but he did not prepare a promissory note.on june,wofford had dimmitt write another check payable to asci in the amount of from the edwards account,without preparing a promissory note.shortly after,wofford wrote another check to asci for.last,on october,wofford instructed dimmitt to prepare a check payable to precision aerospace,a new company wofford had started.thus,some loans had promissory notes and some did not.
wofford initially made interest payments on the loans,but asci eventually was sold,and no interest payments were made on the later loans.four participants in the plan testified that they never received their money.glen swan,an auditor for the attorney office,testified that by february there was less than left in the edwards plan account.swan also testified that wofford owed approximately to the fund at the time of trial.wofford summary witness,dale hogue,testified that over participants had not received their money,and that their money was in loans to acsi and precision aerospace.
the district court charged the jury as follows 
for you to find the defendant guilty of a violation of,you must be convinced that the government has proved each of the following beyond a reasonable doubt 
first that the premier employer group k plan was an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of the statute subject to the requirements of title i of the employee retirement income security act,also known as erisa 
second that the defendant,either acting alone or aided and abetted by others,embezzled,stole,abstracted or converted to his own use or to the use of someone else other than the rightful owner any money,funds,securities,property or other assets of the premier employer group k plan or of any fund connected with such plan and 
third that the defendant acted knowingly and willfully or with fraudulent intent.
employee pension benefit plan 
in order to satisfy the first element of this offense,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the premier employer group k plan was an employee pension benefit plan subject to title i of the employee retirement income security act,also known as erisa.in this regard,an employee pension benefit plan subject to title i of erisa is 
any plan,fund,or program with certain exceptions not applicable in this case,
which is established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,
that by its express terms or as a result of surrounding circumstances either 
a provides retirement income to employees or 
b results in a deferral of income by employees for periods extending to the termination of covered employment or beyond.
for the plan to be covered by erisa,the employer also must be engaged in commerce or any industry or activity affecting commerce.commerce means trade,traffic,commerce,transportation,or communication between any state or any place outside thereof.the term industry or activity affecting commerce means any activity,business,or industry in commerce or in which a labor dispute would hinder or obstruct commerce or the free flow of commerce.
if you find that the premier employer group k plan is an employee benefit plan as i have defined it for you,the first element of the offense is satisfied.
additional instruction first element 
an employee pension benefit plan subject to title i of erisa does not cease being subject to the requirements of title i of erisa because of the failure of a plan sponsor,administrator,or other fiduciary of the plan to maintain the plan in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.therefore,a qualified plan that later loses tax qualified status remains subject to title i of erisa.
the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all ten counts.on january,wofford was sentenced to months on each count,to run concurrently.wofford timely filed a notice of appeal.
wofford first and third issues on appeal relate to whether the plan was an employee pension benefit plan as defined by.wofford correctly contends that the government was required to prove for the first element of the offense that the k plan at issue was an employee pension benefit plan that was subject to any provision of title i of erisa.wofford contends that the district court erred in striking his expert,david ralston,who proposed to testify on this issue,and in including the additional instruction on the first element of the charge.
in his first issue on appeal,wofford challenges the district court exclusion of ralston testimony.we review the district court decision to exclude expert testimony under an abuse of discretion standard.united states dixon,cir.
section provides 
any person who embezzles,steals,or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use or to the use of another,any of the moneys,funds,securities,premiums,credits,property,or other assets of any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan,or of any fund connected therewith,shall be fined under this title,or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
further,section provides that the term any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan means any employee benefit plan subject to any provision of title i of the employee retirement income security act of.id.
it is undisputed that section plain language requires the government to prove that the funds were embezzled from a plan that was subject to any provision of title i of erisa or a fund connected therewith.see,united states jackson,cir explaining that the elements of a violation include that the acts of embezzlement or conversion involve moneys,funds,or assets of an erisa plan,petition for cert.filed,united states helbling,cir united states hook,cir united states furst,cir it is indisputable that one substantive element of is that the account from which funds are embezzled must be one of the two types of accounts defined in the statute if the account is not governed by erisa,section is inapposite.title i of erisa,et,requires administrators of all covered pension plans to file periodic reports with the secretary of labor,mandates minimum participation,vesting and funding schedules,establishes standards of fiduciary conduct for plan administrators,and provides for civil and criminal enforcement of the act.raymond yates,profit sharing plan hendon,d citing nachman pension benefit guaranty,d generally,whether a plan is subject to title i of erisa is an issue of fact to be decided by the jury,guided by applicable legal principles.see helbling,at.a plan is subject to erisa if it fits under a,and is not exempted by b.relevant definitions are provided in.id.
there is no real dispute about whether the plan when established was an employee pension benefit plan subject to title i of erisa.section a provides that,e xcept as provided in subsection b or c of this section and in sections,and of this title,this subchapter shall apply to any employee benefit plan if it is established or maintained by any employer engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce erisa defines an employee pension benefit plan as any plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that by its express terms or as a result of surrounding circumstances such plan,fund,or program i provides retirement income to employees,or ii results in a deferral of income by employees for periods extending to the termination of covered employment or beyond,regardless of the method of calculating the contributions made to the plan,the method of calculating the benefits under the plan or the method of distributing benefits from the plan.a.the evidence indicates that the plan was an erisa plan subject to title i when it was established,and wofford has not challenged this fact.
the dispute centers on whether the plan ceased being subject to any provision of title i of erisa before wofford began taking the loans from the plan account,and whether the exclusion of ralston testimony and the inclusion of the additional instruction on this issue were proper.ralston proposed testimony,as set forth in the memo summarizing his opinions,was to center on the plan failure to remain tax qualified under the internal revenue code requirements and the effects of that failure.specifically,ralston planned to testify that b ecause the gust amendments were not made to the plan,the plan does not meet the requirements of section a of the code and is not a qualified employee pension benefit plan.the response to the amended motion to strike argued that ralston would testify that the plan was out of compliance with the internal revenue code requirements and is not qualified under the code and erisa,that upon the plans sic failure to be a qualified plan,it loses its distinction as being an employee benefit plan,and that the plan was disqualified prior to the acts alleged in the indictment.
section a is part of the internal revenue code,and lists requirements for qualification.assuming the plan failed to satisfy a requirements for qualification at the relevant times,whether it was nevertheless a plan subject to any provision of title i of erisa for purposes of is an issue of first impression in this circuit.however,we have previously held in the bankruptcy context that a plan failure to remain tax qualified does not render erisa title i provisions inapplicable.in re sewell,cir.in reaching that conclusion,we relied upon the seventh circuit decision in in re baker,cir.
in re baker,also decided in the bankruptcy context,involved the issue whether irregular transactions from a pension plan meant that the funds remaining in the debtor pension account were unsheltered by erisa rule.id.at.baker,the debtor,and his family operated bakco data,and when it encountered financial difficulties,they improperly borrowed money from the plan as working capital for bakco.id.at.the loans were not properly documented,exceeded permissible levels,and were not repaid,but the disbursements did not exceed the borrowers vested balances and did not compromise other participants accounts.id.bakco eventually folded and baker filed for bankruptcy protection.id.at.baker creditor sought to have baker pension funds included in his estate,but the bankruptcy court refused.id.the district court and the seventh circuit court of appeals affirmed.
the seventh circuit concluded that the provision protected baker pension funds despite the irregular transactions.in reaching its conclusion,the seventh circuit considered the supreme court use of the term pension plan in patterson shumate,d,noting that the term does not appear in the statute.baker,at.the court reasoned that s ome plans are,a term of art meaning that contributions to the plan are deductible at the corporate level and not taxed to the employee until the plan distributes benefits,but noted that t axation has nothing to do with the question at hand.id.emphasis in original.the seventh circuit concluded that,m ost likely,the court used to mean covered by subchapter i of erisa.id.because subchapter i of erisa covers every employee benefit plan established by an employer engaged in interstate commerce,with five exceptions that did not apply,erisa covered the plan in question despite the improper transactions.id.at.the seventh circuit concluded,v iolations of erisa do not make erisa inapplicable,as the bank believes if extensive violations of a federal law made that law go away,the rules would be chimerical.erisa applied,and was violated for purposes of patterson,what matters is the application of erisa subchapter i,rather than observance of its rules.id.at.
relying primarily on in re baker,we reached the same conclusion in in re sewell,cir.in that case,a bankruptcy trustee appealed the bankruptcy court ruling,affirmed by the district court,that the debtor beneficial interest in her employer erisa retirement plan should be excluded from the property of the estate despite the fact that certain prohibited transactions by the employer or individuals acting for it had caused the plan not to be tax qualified.id.at.the lower courts rejected the trustee contention that to be an pension plan,and thus excludable from the estate under c,the plan had to be tax qualified under the internal revenue code.id.at.we agreed,concluding that tax qualification is not a prerequisite to erisa qualification.id.at.
we explained in sewell that the provisions in title of the identify the various types of erisa plans and specify what must be included in such plans,while the provisions in title specify what must be included in an erisa plan for it to be qualified for tax purposes and thus be subject to special tax provisions that entitle the plan sponsors and participants to tax benefits provided under erisa.id.at.thus,erisa is a largely parallel,dual system,jointly administered by the department of labor and the department of the treasury,and statutorily bifurcated into titles and of the and many provisions and requirements found in title are replicated in title.id.nowhere in erisa,however,is there a requirement that,to be an erisa plan and thus be governed by erisa,a plan must be tax qualified.id.at.indeed,the converse is true an erisa plan that is not or may not be tax qualified nevertheless continues to be governed by erisa for essentially every other purpose.id.as we explained,it would be perverse,indeed,if the negligent or intentional act of an erisa plan sponsor,administrator,or other fiduciary,that results in disqualification for tax purposes could,ipso facto,remove the thus the beneficial interests of the the aegis of erisa and its protections of the very interests for which the legislation was adopted and is administered in parallel by the treasury and labor departments.id.thus,the failure of an erisa plan to remain tax qualified does not mean that the plan is no longer.
the district court concluded that ralston planned to testify that the erisa plan in question was not tax qualified and that this testimony was irrelevant and should be excluded under either fre or.wofford appears to take issue with,but does not directly refute,the district court characterization of ralston proposed testimony as being that the erisa plan in question was not tax qualified and implies that ralston would have testified more generally that the plan was not.however,a close look at the memo summarizing ralston opinions and proposed testimony and the briefing on the motion to strike indicates that ralston opinion testimony was limited to whether the plan remained tax qualified,as the district court concluded.
ralston did not purport to testify that the plan was not or subject to title i of erisa when it was created.he did not propose to testify that,before the activities at issue,the plan had terminated such that title i protections no longer applied.see united states hook,cir holding that u ntil an plan has been terminated,the duties and protections of title i continue to apply to the plan.nor did he opine that the plan had ceased being an erisa plan other than by its failure to remain tax qualified.see,in re lowenschuss,cir holding that a plan that ceases to have any employee participation is not subject to title i.
instead,ralston proposed testimony was essentially that premier consulting established the plan in and amended it in no amendments had been made since the amendment legislation enacted by congress and commonly referred to by the acronym gust significantly changed the requirements that must be satisfied for an employee pension benefit plan to constitute a qualified plan under section a of the code premier never made any amendments to incorporate and comply with the gust requirements b ecause these amendments were not made to the plan,the plan does not meet the requirements of section a of the code and is not a qualified employee pension benefit plan.under baker and sewell,however,the fact that the plan fails to remain tax qualified under the internal revenue code does not mean that it is no longer subject to any provision of title i of erisa thus,the district court correctly concluded that ralston testimony,to the extent it dealt with whether the plan had ceased to be tax qualified or otherwise failed to comply with the internal revenue code,was irrelevant to the issue of whether the plan was subject to any provision of title i of erisa.further,to the extent ralston planned to testify that the plan was no longer due to being out of compliance with the internal revenue code requirements,this testimony was legally incorrect under baker and sewell,and therefore was properly excluded.hook,at holding that expert opinion that plan was no longer an erisa plan for purposes of was inaccurate as a matter of law and thus properly excluded.
wofford also argues that the district court erred in including the additional instruction related to the first element in the jury charge.because wofford did not object to the inclusion of the additional instruction in the district court,we apply a plain error standard of review.see united states ricardo,cir united states maceo,cir.under the standard,this court makes three initial determinations whether the district court committed error whether the error is clear and obvious and whether the error affects substantial rights.united states stevens,cir,cert.denied,d.if these three conditions are satisfied,we have discretion to reverse the district court if we conclude that the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting united states olano,d.
wofford argues that the instruction should not have been given because it was requested only in anticipation of ralston testimony.because ralston testimony was excluded,wofford contends,no factual basis existed for the instruction.though it was the possibility of ralston testimony at trial that initially prompted the government to request the additional instruction,the evidence introduced at trial nevertheless warranted its submission.for example,on by defense counsel,witness angela sampson testified about an irs determination letter on the plan,which stated,continued qualification of the plan under its present form will depend on its effect and operation.sampson was also questioned about a march,letter,sent from the pension companies to premier consulting,that stated,on numerous occasions via numerous media,the pension companies conveyed to you and other membe
