facts and procedural history 
marks was employed by at t capital corporation at t capital in a senior management position.in this capacity,marks participated in a severance plan that entitled him to a substantial cash payment if he was terminated without just cause.in the event of a change of control,marks would also be entitled to benefits if he suffered a qualifying termination of employment during the following two years 
i a termination of a participant employment by the company and its subsidiaries other than a termination for cause or 
ii a termination of employment by a participant prior to the second anniversary of the closing date for one or more of the following reasons a a reduction in base salary b a significant reduction in annual cash target bonus c an elimination or reduction of the participant eligibility to participate in the company benefit plans or programs that is inconsistent with the eligibility of similarly situated employees to participate therein d a significant reduction in the participant duties as they exist immediately after the closing date or e an obligation to relocate 
joint appendix at plan.
newcourt purchased all outstanding shares of at t capital on january.prior to the acquisition,newcourt offered marks continued employment,with duties,responsibilities,authority,and compensation that were substantially identical to his duties and compensation with at t capital.marks accepted newcourt offer,and agreed to purchase shares of the company stock as part of his employment contract.he borrowed to finance the stock purchase.marks continued to be employed in a senior management position that was substantially similar to the position he held with at t.he was still covered by the plan,but he would have to make a claim by october,to be entitled to benefits for suffering a qualifying termination.
during,newcourt allegedly began making changes to marks business unit.marks sought and received assurances through and after october,that these modifications were not intended to reduce his duties or his compensation.he continued to be actively employed by newcourt until february,when he suffered a heart attack and took disability leave.
marks did not assert any rights under the plan before october.in march,marks learned that newcourt had awarded him a bonus that was significantly lower than bonuses he typically received from at t.according to marks,newcourt changed its methods for calculating performance goals before october,but did not make clear that these changes were intended to and did materially reduce marks job responsibilities until may.
marks first sought to exercise his rights under the plan on june,when his attorney informed newcourt that marks was entitled to plan benefits because he had been constructively terminated.marks claim alleged that his job responsibilities had changed in and that newcourt had misrepresented the nature of these changes.the plan administrators,who are responsible for reviewing all claims for benefits,sent marks written notification that his claim had been denied according to the administrators,marks was not entitled to benefits because the plan required an actual termination before october.
marks protested the denial of his claim,arguing that the administrators had imposed a before october,the receipt of benefits that was not contained in the plan.the administrators referred marks protest to the benefits committee,which has sole and complete discretionary authority to determine conclusively for all parties all questions relating to participation of eligible members and eligibility for benefits,determination of all relevant facts,the amount and type of benefits payable to any participant,and construction of all terms of the plan.at plan summ.the committee denied marks appeal,reasoning that he had no claim because newcourt had not terminated his employment and because he had not resigned prior to october.furthermore,the committee reasoned,marks had accepted compensation and benefits for several months after october.
marks filed an action in state court,claiming that newcourt had fraudulently induced him to become employed by newcourt,breached his employment agreement,and wrongfully deprived him of benefits under the plan.marks also alleged that newcourt engaged in fraudulent conduct that reduced his duties and compensation,while continually assuring him that neither was being reduced.marks did not raise any claims under erisa.
newcourt removed the action to federal district court on grounds that erisa preempted marks state law claims and that there was diversity of citizenship.marks then filed an amended complaint stating claims for breach of contract and constructive discharge,fraud and silent fraud,innocent misrepresentation,fraudulent inducement of stock purchase and loan agreement and breach of the at t leadership plan,breach of contract,and breach of fiduciary duties.
newcourt moved for an order upholding the administrators denial of marks claim for plan benefits pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.newcourt also moved to dismiss three of marks claims pursuant to rule b.
marks filed a motion to amend his complaint a second time.he wanted to add an estoppel claim and claims under erisa,alleging violations of,and.the magistrate judge denied marks motion to amend,but granted his motion to add cit group,as a defendant.the magistrate judge order said that the first amended complaint should be broadly construed to state claims for the denial of benefits under erisa.the district court later construed marks first amended complaint to include erisa claims.
marks filed his opposition to newcourt rule motion for judgment and,in doing so,referred to several alleged erisa violations that had not been addressed in the complaint or any earlier briefs.at this point,the parties stipulated that newcourt could voluntarily withdraw its initial rule motion and file a renewed motion that would address marks newly asserted claims and issues.
marks filed a motion for summary judgment as to his erisa claims.newcourt filed a response,and then a renewed motion for entry of judgment.newcourt sought an affirmance of the denial of benefits under the various provisions of erisa and moved that all but one of marks claims be dismissed as preempted by erisa.
f or the purposes of defendant revised rule and b motions only,at order,newcourt stipulated to the following 
e ach of the following alternate factual statements are possibly true and could possibly be proven if complete discovery on these issues is allowed to proceed 
the plan administrators and the benefits committee did not consider plaintiff claim that newcourt lulled him into not filing a claim by october,
the plan administrators and the benefits committee considered the fraudulent lulling claim based on the administrative record but disregarded it as not being material even if true,fraudulent lulling does not matter or not being within the scope of their jurisdiction,fraudulent lulling is wrong but no relief is available under the benefit plan or 
the plan administrators and the benefits committee considered the fraudulent lulling claim based on the administrative record but did not consider it true and thus it did not affect the merits of their decisions.
before ruling on the motions,however,the district judge accepted newcourt designation of the administrative record.newcourt former director of employee relations,kenneth auletta auletta,set forth an affidavit swearing to the materials that were available to the benefits committee for review.over marks objection,the district judge concluded that auletta affidavit was not hearsay,and was sufficient to identify the administrative record.at op.
the district court granted newcourt renewed motion for judgment and denied marks motion for summary judgment.the district court also denied marks motion for reconsideration or leave to amend his complaint.finally,the district court granted newcourt motion for summary judgment as to marks final inducement to purchase newcourt entered final judgment for newcourt.marks filed a timely notice of appeal.

preemption of state law claims 
the district court concluded that marks claims for breach of contract,fraud,and innocent misrepresentation were preempted by erisa,and dismissed them pursuant to rule b.according to the district court,each cause of action relies on plaintiff allegations that defendants deceived him about his job responsibilities and duties,thus inducing him to accept employment with defendants,further inducing him to purchase newcourt stock,and ultimately lulling him into not exercising his rights under the at t plan.at op.however,as marks argues,there is a distinction between alleged lies inducing marks to accept employment with newcourt and alleged lies inducing marks not to file a claim for benefits.
erisa preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.erisa a,a.in the context of erisa,the term state law includes all laws,decisions,rules,regulations,or other state action having the effect of law.id.c.to relate to a benefit plan,a law only need have a connection with or reference to such a plan.shaw delta air lines,d.erisa preemption provisions are deliberately expansive.pilot life ins.dedeaux,d see metro.life ins.massachusetts,d the provision was intended to displace all state laws that fall within its sphere,even including state laws that are consistent with erisa substantive requirements.but see.ass of health plans,miller,d noting that state laws regulating insurance,banking,and securities are saved from by erisa.
in keeping with the supreme court recognition of the broad scope of erisa preemption,the sixth circuit has repeatedly recognized that virtually all state law claims relating to an employee benefit plan are preempted by erisa.cromwell hca,cir,cert.dismissed,d.however,we will not conclude that claims are preempted where their effect on employee benefits plans is merely tenuous,remote or peripheral.id.for example,a action only peripherally affects a plan where a plaintiff refers to a clause in the benefit plan summary to support his employment discrimination claim,or where a plaintiff simply makes reference to specific,ascertainable damages by citing a life insurance contract.wright motors,cir.in deciding whether claims are preempted by erisa,we have focused on the remedy sought by plaintiffs.see lion volunteer blind,automated group,cir.
marks amended complaint alleges that newcourt has wrongfully,arbitrarily and capriciously rejected mark s notice of termination and newcourt has done so solely for selfish reasons,namely,to avoid paying marks more than million that he would otherwise be entitled to under the at t plan.at.for each of his causes of action,marks seeks in damages an amount presently undetermined but believed to exceed.at.because he seeks damages equaling the benefits he would have received under the plan,it seems at first glance that his claims relate to an erisa benefit plan.however,a close reading of marks complaint reveals that the reference to plan benefits was only a way to articulate specific,ascertainable damages.wright,at.
we conclude that the district court erred in finding that marks claims were preempted to the extent that the claims alleged would have a tenuous,remote or peripheral effect on the plan.cromwell,at.marks alleges that,without cause,newcourt significantly altered his duties and reduced his compensation.because this conduct may constitute a breach of marks employment contract irrespective of the plan,the breach of contract claim is not preempted.
moreover,marks fraud and misrepresentation claims are not entirely preempted,even though they clearly relate to erisa insofar as they allege that newcourt conduct induced marks not to exercise his rights under the at t plan until may.at.d.to the extent that marks alleges that fraud or misrepresentation induced him to accept employment as an initial matter,he can state a claim for fraud innocent misrepresentation.marks alleges that newcourt conduct induced him to become employed by newcourt,to purchase shares of newcourt stock,and to borrow to finance that purchase.these allegations clearly do not relate to an erisa plan.therefore,we remand to the district court for adjudication of those aspects of marks fraud and misrepresentation claims not relating to the plan,as well as for adjudication of marks breach of contract claim.
dismissal of erisa claims 
section breach of fiduciary duty 
the district court dismissed marks claim for breach of fiduciary duty,brought pursuant to erisa,as duplicative of his claim.section a states 
a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and 
a for the exclusive purpose of 
i providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and 
ii defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan 
b with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims 
a.section further explains that a fiduciary who breaches his duty is personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach,and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary.a.
an erisa plan participant can seek equitable relief against his plan administrator under a,a,if he has been harmed by the administrator breach of a fiduciary duty.varity howe,d.however,a participant can not seek equitable relief for a breach of fiduciary duty under the catchall provision of a if the alleged violations are adequately remedied under other provisions of.see wilkins baptist healthcare,cir noting the supreme court clear limitation of a relief to beneficiaries who may not avail themselves of other remedies.
in wilkins,we concluded that the plaintiff could not bring a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty pursuant to a where a b provided a remedy for his alleged injury.section a b permitted wilkins to bring a lawsuit to challenge the administrator denial of benefits.in this case,marks is permitted to file and has filed a suit pursuant to the same provision,challenging the newcourt administrative decision to deny him benefits.therefore,because the district court is correct that erisa a b provides plaintiff a remedy for the alleged injury,the denial of benefits,and allows him to bring a lawsuit to challenge the denial of benefits,at op,we affirm the dismissal of marks claim for breach of fiduciary duty 
section discrimination 
the district court dismissed marks claim that newcourt violated erisa,by misleading him about the reduction and change in his job duties thereby lulling him into not exercising his rights under the plan.at op.marks argues that newcourt discriminated against him with the intention of interfering with his attainment of a right to which he might become entitled under the plan.the district court found that such deception did not constitute interference or discrimination within the meaning of.
pursuant to,i t shall be unlawful for any person to discharge,fine,suspend,expel,discipline,or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan this provision of erisa is aimed primarily at preventing unscrupulous employers from discharging or harassing their employees in order to keep them from obtaining vested pension rights.west butler,cir.to violate,discrimination must affect the individual employment relationship in some substantial way.id.at.
to state a prima facie case under,an employee must show that there was prohibited employer conduct taken for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which the employee may become entitled.shahid ford motor,cir quotation omitted.courts have concluded that false statements affecting an employee pension rights do not rise to the level of discrimination found in cases enforcing.see,swanson local pension plan,failing to advise employee of the consequences of retirement was not the kind of direct interference required to establish liability under,aff,cir,goins teamsters local,making false statements about pension rights does not rise to the level of a violation where administrator remarks at most lulled employee into erroneously believing that certain requirements did not apply.such statements stand in stark contrast to the sort of discrimination found in cases enforcing,which usually involve employers discharging or taking reprisals against employees to prevent them from receiving benefits.swanson.at quotation omitted.
marks alleges that newcourt disguised the significance of changes made to the terms and conditions of his employment and fraudulently concealed its true reasons for making the changes.the district court for the southern district of new york has considered whether an employee can state a claim under based on allegations that the employee was misled about the nature of his duties and responsibilities on the facts presented,the most the employee can allege is that she was misled about her duties and responsibilities.this allegation does not give rise to a claim for interference or discrimination under.donnelly bank of,aff,cir.july.this is precisely what marks alleges in this case.thus,construing marks complaint in the light most favorable to him,we conclude that marks failed to state a prima facie case under.because he fails to allege conduct that would fall within the scope of prohibitions,we affirm the district court decision to dismiss this claim.
equitable estoppel 
marks argues that because newcourt fraudulently represented to him that his job duties had not been reduced throughout,and therefore lulled him into not exercising his rights under the plan,newcourt should be estopped from relying on the plan october,deadline.the district court concluded that marks could not prevail on an estoppel theory as a matter of law,because estoppel would contravene the terms of the plan documents,which unambiguously require that plaintiff have experienced a qualifying termination prior to october.at op.
this court has recognized that equitable estoppel may be a viable theory in erisa cases.sprague motors,cir.en banc,cert.denied,d.to set forth a claim for equitable estoppel in the erisa context,a plaintiff must plead five elements 
t here must be conduct or language amounting to a representation of material fact the party to be estopped must be aware of the true facts the party to be estopped must intend that the representation be acted on,or the party asserting the estoppel must reasonably believe that the party to be estopped so intends the party asserting the estoppel must be unaware of the true facts and the party asserting the estoppel must reasonably or justifiably rely on the representation to his detriment.
id.liberally construed,marks complaint alleges each of the five required elements.
a party can not seek to estop the application of an unambiguous written provision in an erisa plan,however.id.at.when a party seeks to estop the application of an unambiguous plan provision,he by necessity argues that he reasonably and justifiably relied on a representation that was inconsistent with the clear terms of the plan.id.moreover,to allow estoppel to override the clear terms of plan documents would be to enforce something other than the plan documents themselves.id.in this case,the plan provision requiring that a participant assert his rights by october,is unambiguous.therefore marks can not rely on an estoppel theory,and the district court did not err in dismissing the argument.
iii.judgment against marks 
erisa challenging the denial of plan benefits 
the district court concluded that marks claim for breach of the plan was actually a claim challenging the denial of benefits brought pursuant to erisa.section a b gives a participant or beneficiary the right to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.
standard of review 
we review de novo a denial of benefits challenged under a b,unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.if a plan affords such discretion to an administrator or fiduciary,we review the denial of benefits only to determine if it was arbitrary and capricious,miller metropolitan life insurance,cir,and will uphold his decision if it is rational in light of the plan provisions,borda hardy,lewis,pollard page,cir quotation omitted.
the plan at issue grants its administrators discretion over determining eligibility for benefits.section,administration,states that t he plan administrator shall make the rules and regulations necessary to administer the plan and shall have the responsibility and discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan,determine eligibility for benefits and to determine the amounts of such benefits.at plan.therefore,we apply the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard in reviewing the decisions of the administrators and the benefits committee to deny marks benefits.we should also take into account,however,the fact that newcourt is acting under a conflict of interest because it both funds and administers the plan.see bruch,at.noting that courts should be attentive to conflicts in this context.hosps.of cleveland emerson.cir recognizing a potential for decisionmaking where,as here,the plan sponsor bears all or most of the risk of paying claims,and also appoints the body designated as the final arbiter of such claims.
administrative record considered on review 
the scope of the district court and this court review of the denial of benefits is limited to the administrative record available to the plan administrators when the final decision was made.miller,at.although newcourt did not identify the administrative record before the magistrate judge,it subsequently presented to the district court what it assert s is the complete administrative record containing all documents reviewed by the benefits committee.at op.marks argues that the district court erred by relying on auletta affidavit to identify the administrative record because auletta was not a member of the benefits committee.
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,affidavits submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment shall be made on personal knowledge,shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence,and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.e.we review for an abuse of discretion all evidentiary rulings of the district court,including its determination of whether testimony is inadmissible hearsay.united states khalil,cir.auletta affidavit claims his personal knowledge of the facts contained in this affidavit and explains that the documents attached were the materials reviewed by the benefits committee in reviewing plaintiff appeal of the plan administrators denial of plaintiff claim.at,auletta aff.auletta was not a plan administrator or a member of the benefits committee,so he did not have personal knowledge of the documents actually considered by the committee.however,auletta could have personal knowledge of what materials were available to the committee when it decided to deny benefits.marks does not contest that auletta,as the of employee relations,was responsible for assembling materials presented to the administrators and the committee for review.therefore,because auletta would have personal knowledge of the administrative record available to the plan administrators at the time of their final decision,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by relying on auletta affidavit to determine the administrative record.
the district court did clearly err,however,in relying on auletta affidavit to designate a piece of electronic mail sent from rob mcfarlane to auletta on august,as part of the administrative record.the benefits committee notified marks that it had denied his appeal on august.clearly mcfarlane electronic mail could not have been available to the administrators when they made their final decision to deny marks claim.therefore,this document should not be considered part of the administrative record.in reviewing marks claim,we will consider the administrative record designated by the district court,with the exception of this electronic mail 
arbitrary and capricious denial of benefits 
marks alleges that newcourt denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious because the administrators impermissibly added a new term to the plan by refusing to treat marks alleged constructive termination before october,as a qualifying termination.according to marks,the plan was ambiguous as to whether constructive termination before october,constitutes a qualifying termination.therefore,marks argues that we should resolve any ambiguity against the drafter of the.see,at.
in their initial denial of marks claim for benefits,the plan administrators explained that marks actual termination was a condition precedent to establishing a qualifying termination under the plan.the plan recognizes two kinds of qualifying terminations termination by the company without cause,and termination by the employee because,among other reasons,the company significantly reduced the employee duties.with respect to marks claim of termination by the company,the administrators interpreted the language of the plan to require actual,not constructive,termination,and found that t o date,no such termination of marks employment by the company has occurred and more than two years have passed since the closing date.at.then,the administrators determined that they could not evaluate marks claim that he terminated his own employment because the company reduced his duties until marks provided written notice of his termination of employment with the company.
the benefits committee offered a similar explanation for its denial of marks claims.after defining and establishing the deadline for a qualifying termination,the committee concluded that marks had not suffered a qualifying termination because the company had not terminated his employment prior to the second anniversary of the closing date,which is october.at benefits comm.decision.marks was employed by the company until june,and continued to accept compensation and benefits from the company for months after october.like the administrators,the committee found that the plan addresses only actual,not constructive,termination,and concluded that marks would have had to resign before october,to establish a benefits claim on grounds that he terminated his employment due to a reduction in duties.
the plan administrators and benefits committee decisions to deny marks benefits in light of their interpretations of qualifying termination under the plan provisions was not arbitrary or capricious.the administrators made the reasonable determination that the provision in question in fact was not ambiguous.they concluded that the plan clearly required either resignation or actual termination of employment prior to october,because marks continued to be actually employed by the company until june,we can only conclude that the administrators and benefits committee offered a reasoned explanation for the denial of benefits.davis,at.we affirm the denial of benefits because the administrators decision is rational in light of the plan provisions,and therefore was not arbitrary and capricious.borda,at.
erisa procedural requirements 
appellant argues that he did not receive the procedural protections established by erisa.pursuant to,
e very employee benefit plan shall 
provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant,and 
afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision for denying the claim.
we review de novo the question of whether the procedure employed by the fiduciary in denying the claim meets the requirements of section.kent united of omaha life ins,cir.for this court to consider a plan claims procedure reasonable,the plan must 
establish a procedure for the filing of claims by participants and beneficiaries,provide for a written notification procedure for denial or partial denial of claims,and provide for an appeal procedure for denied or partially denied claims,see c.b i be described in the summary plan description,see id.b ii not contain any provision and not be administered in a way that unduly inhibits or hampers the initiation or processing of plan claims,id.b iii and provide for a procedure for informing participants in a timely fashion of the time periods for decisions on claims made and the time periods for making appeals and receiving decisions thereon,see id.b iv.
