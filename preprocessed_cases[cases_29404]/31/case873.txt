in this successive appeal,james svec,now a of svec sons funeral home home and majority owner of west suburban livery wsl,two sole proprietorships,challenges the district court determination that home owes contributions on his behalf to a pension fund and a health and welfare fund,both of which have plaintiff thomas moriarty on their respective boards of trustees.in addition,both james and moriarty appeal the amount of attorney fees awarded to moriarty.for the reasons stated herein,we vacate and remand for further consideration.
background 
the facts of this dispute that occurred prior to are recounted in the first decision regarding this case,moriarty svec,cir,and will be restated here only to the extent necessary.james father elmer was the sole owner of home and of wsl until his death on june.james owned the other half of wsl and worked as a funeral director for home.home,as part of the funeral directors services association of greater chicago fdsa,was bound by a collective bargaining agreement cba.the cba required home to make contributions on behalf of its employees,including funeral directors,to a pension fund and a health and welfare fund until the end of,when james caused home to withdraw from the fdsa.in,after an audit of home and wsl,moriarty sued on behalf of these funds to recover contributions that wsl allegedly owed on behalf of its employees claim i and home supposedly owed on behalf of james claim ii.moriarty employed and continues to employ the law firm of jacob,burns,orlove,stanton hernandez jacob,burns to litigate against james.moriarty acknowledges that under the cba contributions are not required for principal owners.after some preliminary investigation,moriarty believed that james became the principal owner of home on april.moriarty then sought contributions in the amounts of for claim i for the period from october to december and for claim ii for the period from january to april,for a total of.
james argued that home did not owe contributions on his behalf because he was a principal owner of home.james also claimed that wsl was not a signatory to the cba and so no contributions were owed for its employees.the district court decided in favor of moriarty on february.in its first decision in this case,the district court held that the cba is unambiguous and that james was an employee of home for purposes of the cba,regardless of his ownership status,because he is a funeral director.thus,home owed contributions on his behalf.the lower court also used the single employer doctrine to find that wsl and home were a single organization for purposes of the cba.because home was bound by the cba,wsl was as well and so contributions were owed for wsl employees.
the district court also awarded attorney fees,as required by the employee retirement income security act erisa,g d,in cases where a plan fiduciary successfully recovers delinquent contributions.moriarty requested hourly rates of and for jacob,burns,which claimed its rates were depressed due to the firm dedication to the labor movement.moriarty apparently did not inform the district court of the rate jacob,burns actually charged.james challenged these rates,but likewise did not submit evidence of jacob,burns actual billing rates to the court.the district court used the rates requested by moriarty in entering a judgment that included in attorney fees.
james appealed.this court rejected james claim that the national labor relations board nlrb has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether home and wsl should be treated as a single employer and affirmed the district court holding that wsl and home should be considered a single organization for purposes of the cba.at.however,the lower court holding that the cba is unambiguous was reversed,and we remanded to the district court to receive extrinsic evidence on how the term employee in the cba should be interpreted.id.at.regarding attorney fees,the opinion notes james objections and states while we realize that this award may have to be adjusted on remand to reflect any additional proceedings,we see no error in any of the cost and fee calculations the court has already ordered.id.at.
on remand,the district court found that the term employee in the cba excludes principal owners from its definition.the court further found that james became a principal owner of home on june,and so moriarty could not recover for claim ii after that date.however,the court ruled in moriarty favor on claim ii for the period from january,to june.james argued that he was not an employee during this truncated time period,claiming that the single employer doctrine and the labor management relations act lmra,which excludes the children of employers from its definition of employee,should be used to interpret the cba.however,the district court rejected these contentions.because moriarty success on claim ii covered a much shorter period of time than it did after the district court first decision,the court reduced moriarty recovery on this claim from to.
moriarty requested attorney fees for the period following the district court first decision,while james asked that the court reduce the fees moriarty had already been awarded and challenged moriarty request for additional fees.the district court used the date of its first decision to divide the case into two phases the first from august until february,phase i,and the second from february,until the present phase ii.james argued that the district court prior phase i award,which was based on moriarty recovering over for claim ii,should be reduced to reflect moriarty lack of success.the district court agreed and divided the phase i award in half,with one half representing the time spent on claim i and the other half representing the time spent on claim ii.the court then reduced the amount of the phase i recovery on claim ii to ten percent,in order to reflect moriarty extremely limited success on this claim.thus,the district court awarded moriarty attorney fees of for phase i,or percent of the original award.
moriarty requested hours of attorney time at rates of and for phase ii.james,now armed with the knowledge that jacob,burns actually charged moriarty,challenged moriarty request on a variety of grounds.james also produced evidence that two other firms that prosecute erisa collection cases for unions charge.the district court decided that was the market rate for prosecuting erisa collection actions,and based its award on that amount.the court also stated that moriarty was not entitled to time spent during phase ii litigating the issue of when james became the funeral home owner because james prevailed on these claims rather than moriarty.the court then awarded for phase ii,indicating that the court credited jacob,burns with hours.both parties appeal the attorney fee awards,and james also appeals the finding that home is liable on claim ii.
ii.discussion 
home contributions on behalf of james 
james has two arguments as to why he was not an employee of home during the first half of the first is that the definition of employee used in lmra,which excludes the children of employers,should be used to interpret the cba.the second is that judicial estoppel requires that the single employer doctrine be used to determine whether he was a principal owner of the combination.
lmra definition.
the lmra provides that,for purposes of determining an appropriate bargaining unit any individual employed by his parent or spouse is not included within the definition of employee.erisa definition of employee is any individual employed by an employer.james claims that lmra definition of employee should be used to interpret the cba rather than erisa because erisa was not passed until well after the trust agreements creating the funds were formed,which was in and.the district court relied on the erisa definition and the cba explicit exclusion of trainees but not children of employers in determining that such children were employees on whose behalf contributions are owed.we review the district court interpretation of pension plan terms de novo.moriarty,at.
we agree with the district court that the definition contained in should not be used to interpret the cba.even assuming without deciding that lmra rather than erisa should be used to interpret the cba,james argument that he is not an employee because he was elmer son would not succeed.within lmra itself,the definition of employee is broader than that contained in when determining whether an employer may make payments to workers by means of a trust fund under c.see reiherzer shannon,cir,abrogated in other part by black tic inv,cir.for example,retired workers are not employees for purposes of but are employees under c.see allied chem.alkali workers of am.pittsburgh plate glass,d.the portion of the cba about which james is arguing concerns a trust fund,and so the broader definition of c should be used to interpret the cba rather than.whether children of employers would be considered employees for purposes of c is unclear.thus,lmra does not support james construction of employee in the cba.
judicial estoppel.
the doctrine of judicial estoppel provides that when a party prevails on one legal or factual ground in a lawsuit,that party can not later repudiate that ground in further litigation based on the same underlying facts.see menominee indian tribe of thompson,cir mcnamara city of chicago,cir.moriarty prevailed on claim i by using the single employer doctrine,which provides that when two are sufficiently integrated these will be treated as a single entity for certain purposes.see moriarty,at.moriarty successfully argued that home and wsl are a single organization such that the employees of wsl would be considered the employees of home for purposes of contributions to the funds under the cba.thus,james is correct that moriarty is now estopped from arguing that the single employer doctrine can not be applied in determining whether james is an employee of home.
both james and moriarty agree that a principal owner rule applies to interpret the cba,under which those who work at one of the firms within the fdsa are not considered employees for purposes of the cba if they own a certain percentage of the firm.because of his in wsl,james could not have been considered an employee of wsl under the principal owner rule.in the current litigation,employees of wsl and home are considered to be the employees of a combined organization for purposes of the contributions required under the cba.a nominal employee of is entitled to show that his or her ownership of wsl or home translates to sufficient ownership of the organization such that the principal owner rule applies and he or she is not considered an employee for purposes of the cba.thus,the lower court erred in not taking account of james partial ownership of this combined organization through his ownership of wsl in determining whether he is an employee of the home part of this combined entity such that home owes contributions on his behalf.
however,two factual questions prevent this court from determining whether james should prevail on claim ii.the first involves the percentage of the combination that james owned.james claims that because he owned half of wsl and there are two entities in this combination,james owned one quarter of during the relevant time period.however,this is not necessarily correct wsl may have been much smaller than home,such that james of wsl amounted to owning only a tiny fraction of.we remand to the district court to determine the relative sizes of home and wsl during the first half of and thus what percentage of james owned by his of wsl.in calculating these sizes,the district court should be guided by the annual revenues of home and wsl,which is what the nlrb uses in its applications of the single employer doctrine.see goodman investment.the second factual question concerns what percentage of ownership is necessary before james is considered a principal owner under the cba.james claims that ten percent ownership is sufficient,but moriarty has an opportunity on remand to show that this figure is incorrect.
attorney fees 
both parties challenge the amount of attorney fees awarded to moriarty in this case.erisa provides for a mandatory award of reasonable attorney fees when a plan fiduciary prevails in an action to collect delinquent contributions.g d.a district court generally has wide discretion in determining a reasonable attorney fee award,and we review only for abuse.see hensley eckerhart,d.however,when fees are adjusted because of a principle of law our review is de novo.see jaffee redmond,cir.
james claims that the approximately awarded to moriarty for phase i is unreasonable.moriarty claims that the lower court made legal errors in reducing the phase i award from approximately to on remand because of moriarty reduced success on claim ii.we conclude that the district court did not err in determining the amount of the phase i award,though an adjustment may have to be made depending on the resolution of claim ii on remand.
james argument can be disposed of quickly.james raised certain objections to the phase i award when this case first appeared before this court at.we rejected his contentions,and since james has not provided any good reason for reconsidering our determination,these objections are barred by the law of the case doctrine.see blue cross and blue shield united of marshfield clinic,cir.any of james remaining claims against the phase i award should have been brought during the prior appeal,and james has forfeited these by failing to do so.see gibson west,cir.
some of moriarty objections require more sustained analysis.moriarty first claim is that any reduction in the phase i fees is prohibited by language in the first opinion of this court,which states that we see no error in any of the cost and fee calculations the district court has already ordered.at.however,immediately preceding this phrase the opinion states that we realize that this award may have to be adjusted on remand to reflect any additional proceedings.id.this language plainly demonstrates that we did not freeze the amount of the phase i award but rather explicitly invited the district court to adjust it in accord with subsequent proceedings.after conducting further proceedings,the lower court determined that moriarty success on claim ii was much less than when it had made the award,and so adjusted the award accordingly.the district court did not violate the law of the case in making such an adjustment.
moriarty next argues that claim i and claim ii are intertwined,such that the attorney fees awarded for the whole action should not have been reduced because of a lack of success regarding claim ii.moriarty claims that jaffee,at,supports his argument and that we should review the district court decision de novo,but he is incorrect on both counts and his argument fails for two independent reasons.
first,claim i and claim ii are not related for purposes of jaffee or hensley,at.jaffee holds that where a party presents multiple claims for relief based on a common core of facts or related legal theories,no legal bar exists against awarding attorney fees for time spent on rejected claims.at.as presented by moriarty,claim i relies on the facts that home is covered by the cba,wsl and home are integrated enterprises,and the legal theory that wsl and home are a single employer.claim ii relies on the facts that james worked at home as a funeral director,the cba requires contributions on behalf of home employees,and the mixed question of law and fact as to whether james was a principal owner of home through his ownership of wsl.the mere circumstance that both of these claims depend on home being covered by the cba is not sufficient to make these interrelated.no dispute existed regarding claim i as to whether home was covered by the cba.for claim ii,the main questions were whether the principal owner rule,which was not an issue in claim i,should be applied to the cba and when james became such an owner.thus,none of the time spent litigating claim ii would have aided moriarty in prevailing on claim therefore,these two claims are distinct,such that if moriarty loses on claim ii,no attorney fees could be rewarded for that claim as a matter of law.see hensley,at.jaffee,at.because these two claims are discrete,moriarty can not leverage his success on claim i into success on claim ii.thus,since moriarty achieved significantly worse results regarding claim ii on remand,the district court did not abuse its discretion in reducing the phase i award for that claim.
second,even if these two claims were related,the district court did not rule as a matter of law that attorney fees could not be awarded for claim ii,as the lower court in jaffee did,at,but rather exercised its discretion in reducing the attorney fees for claim ii.unlike in jaffee,the district court here did in fact award attorney fees to moriarty for claim ii.however,the district court exercised its discretion in reducing the phase i award because of moriarty limited success on that claim.where the prevailing party has achieved only limited success,the standard lodestar method may yield an excessive award and the district court may reduce the lodestar result.see hensley,at.
moriarty final argument is that james withheld evidence of when he became the owner of home,causing the litigation to be prolonged unnecessarily.moriarty claims that the phase i award should not have been reduced because of james tactics.however,the parties fiercely dispute whether moriarty knew or should have known that james became the owner of home on june.james claims that he gave moriarty copies of illinois state court probate documents,which conclusively establish when james became the owner of home,and that moriarty incurred fees attempting an impermissible collateral attack on the probate court judgment.such contested issues of facts are left to the district court.the district court reduction in the phase i award indicates that it found that james did not improperly prolong the litigation,and this finding is not clearly erroneous.in sum,the district court did not abuse its discretion in reducing the phase i award to reflect moriarty lack of success on claim ii.
all of the challenges of both parties to the phase i award have been considered and rejected.any objections to this award that we have not considered are forfeited.on remand,absent a reason that justifies changing the law of the case,the phase i award should not be disturbed if moriarty prevails on claim ii.if james prevails on claim ii,then,as noted above,moriarty can not recover attorney fees for claim ii as a matter of law,and the district court must reduce the phase i award accordingly.
both parties bring myriad challenges to the phase ii attorney fee order.the district court order awarding phase ii fees is terse,but provides sufficient explanation for most of the lower court determinations.we find no error in the explanations that are provided in this order.however,because we can not be certain that the district court considered specific significant objections made by james,we vacate the award and remand to the district court.see hensley,at.
a phase ii attorney fee order.
the district court entered an order regarding attorney fees on october,that dealt with the phase ii award.in this order,the court stated that the evidence the parties provided to it shows that is the market rate for attorneys prosecuting erisa collection actions.the court also stated that moriarty could not recover the time he spent during phase ii litigating over when james became home owner,because james prevailed on that claim.moriarty argues that the rate jacob,burns actually charged him is too low because the district court awarded moriarty a higher rate for phase i and jacob,burns artificially deflates its rate to favor the labor movement.he also claims that the lower court erred by focusing on only the plaintiff side of erisa litigation rather than defense and plaintiff attorneys as a whole.finally,he contends that the hours he requested should not have been reduced because of whatever success james may have had on claim ii.
given the evidence before it,the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that is the hourly rate for jacob,burns work.james produced evidence that two other firms charge multiemployer union pension plans per hour.more importantly,jacob,burns charges between and for all of its clients,and charged moriarty a rate of.the lawyer regular rate is strongly presumed to be the market rate for his or her services.see central states pension fund central cartage,cir gusman unisys,cir.
jacob,burns claim that it and the two other union firms charge less than their market rate is unavailing.if an attorney charges most clients a high fee,and then represents a client pro bono or for a reduced fee,that attorney presumable market rate in the pro bono or case is still the attorney normal high rate.see central cartage,at,gusman,at.jacob,burns case differs because it does not have a high,regular rate from which it deviates to make gifts to unions.james produced evidence that jacob,burns rate to all clients in the various litigation that it undertakes is between and per hour this is the firm presumptive market rate.see central cartage,at t he union lawyer had a low rate for everything that normal rate,we held,is the market rate.james also produced the similar rates of two other firms that engage in the same kinds of litigation as jacob,burns,further supporting his claim that jacob,burns market rate is.moriarty cites the claims of jacob,burns and the two other union firms that all of their market rates are depressed because of their dedication to the labor movement.however,the district court was not required to credit these assertions in the face of their actual market rates for all of their clients.
the district court award of lower rates for phase ii than phase i was likewise not an abuse of discretion.james produced more evidence for the phase ii attorney fee hearing,including jacob,burns actual billing rates and the rates of the other two union erisa firms,than he had done at the phase i hearing.the district court could rely on such new evidence in determining that jacob,burns rate was actually lower than what the court had awarded for phase 
moriarty claim that the district court erred by focusing only on firms that prosecute erisa collection actions is similarly unsuccessful.the district court discretion in determining what is a reasonable attorney fee applies to its determination of what constitutes a market.attorneys who specialize in a specific area of litigation may be paid more or less than lawyers who work in related areas of the law.similarly,certain kinds of litigation defense attorneys may make more than plaintiff lawyers or vice versa.basing fee awards on such distinctions,as long as these are reasonable and supported by the record,are left to the sound discretion of the district court.given the evidence presented to the district court,we do not find an abuse of discretion in determining that jacob,burns was in a market composed of firms prosecuting erisa collection actions.
we also reject moriarty final objection,that the district court erred by reducing the attorney fees because james prevailed on the claims of when james became home owner.while the fee order language is imprecise,the district court did not abuse its discretion.at the time of this order,moriarty had been awarded judgment on claim ii for approximately.this award means that moriarty was still the prevailing on claim ii,see farrar hobby,d holding that a plaintiff who wins any measure of damages is a prevailing party for the purposes of statutes and was entitled to reasonable fees under g d.we do not read the district court order to state that moriarty was not a prevailing party on claim ii at the time of the order.the district court reduced the hours claimed by moriarty from to,a decrease of approximately only thirteen percent.given that the district court apportioned jacob,burns time evenly between claims i and ii in reducing the phase i award,and that the district court could not have awarded any hours on claim ii if james was the prevailing party as explained above,the district court was only reducing the hours claimed by moriarty because of a lack of success rather than stating that moriarty had not prevailed on claim ii.the district court did not abuse its discre
