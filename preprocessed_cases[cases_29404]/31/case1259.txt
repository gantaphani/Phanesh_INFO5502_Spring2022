appropriate equitable relief 
the supreme court has addressed the meaning of appropriate equitable relief under a in several opinions,including life annuity insurance knudson,d,and mertens hewitt associates,d.in both cases,the court unequivocally rejected attempts to impose personal liability for a contractual obligation to pay money under a,holding that the term equitable relief in a refers to those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.mertens,at.see also,at.
in mertens,a class of former steel industry employees participating in a qualified pension plan brought suit against a,seeking monetary relief under a.mertens,at.the court concluded that although the employees often dance around the word,what they in fact seek is nothing other than compensatory damages in the form of monetary relief for damages resulting from the alleged breach of fiduciary duty.id.at.money damages are,of course,the classic form of legal relief.id.
in,the court further elaborated on the meaning of appropriate equitable relief.in that case,provided coverage to the,who was severely injured in a car accident,pursuant to a plan that included a reimbursement provision,at.sought to recover monies paid by a third party to the beneficiary under the reimbursement provision through a.id.at.the court rejected its claim,holding that was merely seeking,in essence,to impose personal liability on respondents for a contractual obligation to pay that was not typically available in equity.id.at.reaffirming its previous holding in mertens,the court stated that we rejected a reading of the statute that would extend the relief obtainable under a to whatever relief a court of equity is empowered to provide in the particular case at issue which could include legal remedies that would otherwise be beyond the scope of the equity court authority.id.citing mertens,at.the court specifically rejected the argument that the monetary payment sought was equitable relief,stating that an injunction to compel the payment of money past due under a contract,or specific performance of a past due monetary obligation,was not typically available in equity.id.at.

in her complaint,callery seeks payment of insurance on the life of john callery in the amount of and equitable relief providing for payment of the insurance on the life of john callery.in her opposition to the rule c motion,she is more specific.she asks the court to enjoin the defendants from not paying her the life insurance benefits.in the alternative,she seeks an order estopping defendant from denying the claim.id.at.she also claims that equitable remedies such as constructive trust or equitable lien might be appropriate,as well as restitution or specific performance.id.at.
callery necessarily avoids the term compensatory damages.as the court explained,a lmost invariably suits seeking whether by judgment,injunction,or declaration to compel the defendant to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff are suits for money damages,as that phrase has traditionally been applied,since they seek no more than compensation for loss resulting from the defendant breach of legal duty.and m oney damages are,of course,the classic form of legal relief,at.internal citations and quotations omitted emphasis in original.
to the extent callery seeks payment of the policy proceeds,such relief is barred under a.to the extent she seeks injunctive relief compelling the payment of the policy proceeds,callery has dismissed the insurance company from the case and has not alleged that her situation satisfies the limitations placed upon the grant of injunctive relief in equity,at.callery claim might be most accurately construed as one for reliance damages,because she claims that the lack of notice prevented her from obtaining life insurance on her former husband from another source.included in the record is callery affidavit suggesting an insurable former husband provided child support for their children.aplee.app.regardless,such relief is compensatory and not typically available in equity.dan dobbs,law of remedies,at see also caffey unum life ins,cir.
