david mccorkle and william pender plaintiffs appeal the district court order dismissing two of their class action claims against bank of america the bank for alleged violations of certain provisions of the employment retirement income security act of erisa.the gravamen of plaintiffs claims is that the bank of america pension plan the plan employed a normal retirement age nra that violated erisa in calculating lump sum distributions and further ran afoul of erisa prohibition of backloading in the calculation of benefit accrual.for the reasons set forth below,we agree with the district court conclusion that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,and we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the claims at issue.
plaintiffs and the class they represent are current and former employees of the bank and participants in the plan the plan is a type of defined benefit plan that uses a cash balance formula to calculate a participant benefit.the seventh circuit has provided a helpful explanation of the differences between a typical defined benefit plan and a cash balance plan like the plan.
the ordinary defined benefit plan entitles the employee to a pension equal to a specified percentage of his salary in the final year or years of his employment.the plan might provide for example that he was entitled to receive percent of his final year salary multiplied by the number of years that he had been employed by the company,so that if he had been employed for years his annual pension would be percent of his final salary.a cash balance plan,in contrast,entitles the employee to a pension equal to a percentage of his salary every year that he is employed plus annual interest on the balance created by each yearly contribution of a percentage of the salary to the employee account,at a specified interest rate these annual increments of interest are called future interest credits.
the reason for the scare quotes in our description of the cash balance plan is that the employee has no actual account,the employer makes no contributions to an employee account,and so there is no account balance to which interest might be added.in a defined contribution plan,the employee pension entitlement is to the value of his retirement account to which contributions whether from the employer,the employee,or both have been made,while in a defined benefit plan,the entitlement is to the pension benefit that the plan promises.the cash balance form of defined benefit plan resembles a defined contribution plan because it provides the employee with a hypothetical account balance.

because the plan is a defined benefit plan,participants earn what erisa describes as an accrued benefit,expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at nra.erisa defines nra as the earlier of a the time a plan participant attains nra under the plan,or b the later of i the time a plan participant turns age,or ii the anniversary of the time a plan participant commenced participation in the plan.
for the years at issue in the case at bar,the plan calculated nra as the first day of the calendar month following the earlier of i the date the participant attains age or ii the date the participant completes sixty months of vesting service.in other words,a participant in the plan attained nra after five years of vesting service,or upon turning age for participants who leave the plan before five years or join the plan after age sixty,whichever occurred first.
the bank candidly admits that the definition of nra in the plan was designed to avoid a phenomenon known as the whipsaw effect in the context of a cash balance plan,whipsaw is trade shorthand for the process by which a lump sum distribution is calculated for a plan participant who departs the plan before nra.as stated by the internal revenue service irs,when an employee withdraws from a plan before nra,the balance of the employee hypothetical account must be projected to nra and then the employee must be paid at least the present value of that projected hypothetical account balance.notice,notice.however,while the departing employee hypothetical account balance is projected forward to nra using the interest crediting rate specified in the plan,it is discounted back to present value using a statutorily defined formula based on the year treasury rate,a factor that fluctuates and may often be markedly lower than the plan interest crediting rate.id.the result of this whipsaw is a potentially large disparity between the employee current hypothetical account balance and the lump sum distribution that the employee would be entitled to receive 
the plan nra avoids the whipsaw effect by providing that plan participants reach nra at the same time as their interests vest five years of service with the statutorily required proviso for those hired past age or who depart before five years of service.
the bank also sought to avoid certain erisa prohibitions on backloading,by including particular provisions in the plan like the nra calculation.pursuant to b,a benefit plan must satisfy the percent test such that the amount a plan participant accrues in any given year is not more than percent of the annual rate at which he accrued benefits the previous year.this antibackloading provision was an effort by congress to ensure than an employer did not provide inordinately low rates of accrual in the employee early years of service when he is most likely to leave the firm and concentrate the accrual of benefits in the employee later years of service when he is most likely to remain with the firm until retirement.laub,cir quoting.reprinted in.the prohibition against backloading,however,does not apply once an employee reaches nra the earlier of age or the normal retirement age specified under the plan b a i.
the parties agree that the plan provided relatively steady minor increases in benefits for employees who had not yet reached nra,and accordingly,that aspect of the plan did not violate erisa rules.for employees who reached nra,however,the plan provided for more substantial increases in benefits for the employees who remained with the bank for longer periods of time.the plan provided that employees who had reached nra would receive an annual compensation credit equal to the product of the participant compensation for the pay period then ended multiplied by the applicable compensation credit percentage.the applicable compensation credit was determined based on unit points,which were in turn the product of the employee age plus years of service.id.
under the terms of the plan,the compensation credit percentage was staggered in ten unit point increments.a participant with less than thirty unit points the lowest tier had a compensation credit percentage of,while a participant with more than unit points the highest tier received an compensation credit percentage four times higher than the lowest applicable rate.plaintiffs allege that this staggered benefit increase violates the prohibition,despite the fact that the staggered benefit increases do not begin until after a participant reaches nra.
plaintiffs filed their first complaint against the bank in in the district court for the southern district of illinois.in,the action was transferred to the western district of north carolina,where plaintiffs eventually filed their third amended complaint.the third amended complaint the complaint contains the relevant allegations for purposes of this appeal.
in the complaint,plaintiffs raise four claims unlawful lump sum benefit calculation in violation of a count one age discrimination count two violation of the rules count three and elimination of protected benefit count four.the thrust of plaintiffs claim with respect to counts one and three is that the plan violated erisa by failing to state a literal age and accordingly,the presumptive nra under the plan was age.see t he nra under the pension plan is age.
the bank filed its amended motion to dismiss in,and after lengthy briefing and oral argument,the district court issued an order granting class certification on counts one,three,and four,denying the motion to dismiss as to count four,and granting the motion to dismiss as to counts one and three the court issued an amended order,from which the instant appeal was ultimately taken.
in the amended order,the district court,relying heavily on fry exelon.cash balance pension plan,cir,concluded that the plan method of calculating nra was permissible under erisa.in fry,the seventh circuit held that a retirement plan that calculates nra based on five years of service as the plan did here meets the definition of nra found at and accordingly does not violate erisa.id.at.
in addition to its reliance on the fry decision,the district court rejected plaintiffs arguments that certain treasury department regulations and rulings demonstrated that the plan nra calculation was unlawful.the court ruled that recently promulgated regulations cited by plaintiffs were prospective in nature,and not applicable to the plan the court also rejected plaintiffs argument that the plan summary plan description spd failed to inform plan participants that the nra was partially based on five years of service,on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to plead actual prejudice.
in resolving count three,unlawful backloading,the district court relied exclusively on a concession made at oral argument by counsel for plaintiffs.in response to queries from the district court as to whether granting the motion to dismiss with respect to count one would be dispositive of count three,plaintiffs counsel stated that o n c ount t hree i did want to say that if the nra is valid on c ount t hree,we as far as i aware,we do not have a theory on c ount t hree that withstands their theory of nra validity.because the court found the plan nra to be valid with respect to count one,it summarily rejected count three based on counsel concession.
plaintiffs moved for reconsideration,arguing that the district court overlook ed plaintiffs alternative backloading theory.pls.mot.for recons,pender bank of america,cv gcm.plaintiffs sought to argue that while count three does not state a claim for backloading,they did not concede that merely because erisa might permit a plan to define nra in terms of years of service,the plan will be able to use such a definition to demonstrate compliance with erisa benefit accrual standards.id.at.in essence,plaintiffs contended on reconsideration that the plan nra violated erisa substantive backloading provisions notwithstanding the court determination that the nra complied with the definition found at.
the district court denied the motion for reconsideration,noting that plaintiffs are attempting to change the slant of their argument in the wake of a ruling against them.nevertheless,the court considered and rejected the substantive argument raised by plaintiffs,again ruling that certain irs notices the plaintiffs relied upon in the motion to reconsider were prospective in nature only and did not apply to the plan provisions at issue in the pre time period.
pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,the bank moved for entry of final judgment the district court,finding no just reason for delay,granted the motion and entered final judgment with respect to the dismissal of counts one and three,and stayed further proceedings pending appeal.plaintiffs noted a timely appeal of the judgment dismissing counts one and three,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

we note at the outset that plaintiffs have abandoned their contention that the plan nra is invalid under because it coincides with years of service,rather than stating an age certain.see reply br.of plaintiffs at plaintiffs do not contest that the plan identified the nra under the plan as that term is defined in.accordingly,plaintiffs have largely abandoned their challenge to the district court dismissal of count one,the claim of unlawful lump sum benefit calculation.
plaintiffs concession is,as the plan nra complies with erisa.irs guidance has long recognized that a retirement plan may specify an nra that is below age.see rul,in view of the definition of nra found in,and in the absence of any statutory prohibition or limitation,a plan may specify any age that is less than as the nra.indeed,the statute itself recognizes that an nra may be the time a plan participant attains nra under the plan.a.
furthermore,we agree with the fry court that nra need not be the same age for all participants in the plan.after parsing the language of,the seventh circuit concluded that five years of service is an age within the meaning of erisa.it is employee specific,to be sure,but age remains an age.it is not as if the plan provided that an employee reaches nra when he owns ten umbrellas.at.thus,we find persuasive that court reasoning that 
t he plan formula not only specifies an age but also is lifted right out of the statute.subsection b ii defines as the highest possible normal retirement age for a person hired at or older the anniversary of the time a plan participant commenced participation in the plan.making that statutory definition of normal retirement age universally applicable ca be rejected on the ground that the formula does not yield an age.erisa does not require the normal retirement age to be the same for every employee b ii shows that too.
insomuch as the plan states a valid nra within the meaning of,there is no longer any substance supporting plaintiffs allegation that the plan violates erisa by failing to engage in the,whipsaw calculation contemplated by notice.accordingly,all that remains of count one is plaintiffs argument,discussed infra at section ii e,that the plan spd inaccurately described the plan method of benefit accrual calculation.
although they have conceded that the plan nra is valid with respect to,plaintiffs maintain that the nra nevertheless violates erisa provisions.in essence,plaintiffs seek to argue that the nra may be valid definitionally,under,but invalid as applied to erisa backloading rules.
plaintiffs abandonment of their definitional contention,however,is highly problematic for their ability to prevail on appeal.as the district court emphasized,plaintiffs conceded below that their theory hinges on a finding that the plan nra is invalid.see plaintiffs concede that count three fails if the plan nra is valid this contingency has come to pass.
as noted supra,the district court was also not persuaded by plaintiffs attempt to clarify the alleged concession.plaintiffs are attempting to change the slant of their argument in the wake of a ruling against them.thus,plaintiffs find themselves in the precarious position of having conceded before the district court that a valid nra would be fatal to their backloading claim,and conceding before this court that the plan nra is valid.
at oral argument before this court,counsel for plaintiffs attempted to downplay the significance of the first concession,characterizing his statement to the district court that we do not have a theory on count three that withstands their theory of nra validity as merely a stray remark.audio recording of oral argument at.counsel further stated that the district court considered the alternative argument,and reached the merits,thus allowing this court to examine in turn the merits of the underlying argument notwithstanding the alleged concession.
our review of the record in the district court,however,suggests the court was appropriately incredulous that plaintiffs alternative argument had been properly raised prior to the motion for reconsideration.again,the district court characterized plaintiffs argument as a new slant not raised prior to reconsideration.the district judge was present when counsel made the concession at issue and was clearly in the best position to determine the import of counsel statements.we will not,on appeal,disturb the court reasonable and supported conclusion with respect to the concession.
plaintiffs vociferously argue,however,that they have not conceded count iii,and out of an abundance of caution,we will briefly address plaintiffs alternative theory that the plan nra violates erisa backloading provisions.when we consider those claims,we find them to lack merit,especially in light of plaintiffs unquestionable concession that the plan states a valid nra pursuant to.
the chief failing of plaintiffs claim is that erisa rules do not apply once a plan participant reaches nra.see b b b b rules govern the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year.emphasis added see also eaton onan,d,comparing erisa antibackloading rules,which take into account only benefits accrued before nra,and rules,found at internal revenue code irc,that consider benefits accrued both before and after nra,the definition of normal retirement age is important in applying rules because those rules are based on the benefit payable at normal retirement age.put another way,if the antibackloading rules only restrict benefit accrual calculations prior to nra,plaintiffs can not plausibly claim that a benefit calculation after nra runs afoul of the backloading provisions of erisa.
in an attempt to circumvent the foregoing,however,plaintiffs cite to a irs notice as well as a department of the treasury regulation which,in plaintiffs view,compel a holding that the plan nra violates erisa notwithstanding the concession that the nra is valid with respect to the erisa definition of nra.
plaintiffs first argue that a irs notice,published in response to the promulgation of certain treasury regulations discusses and rejects as unlawful the type of nra used in the plan.specifically,they argue that irs notice,notice,entitled relief related to plan amendment of definition of normal retirement age,constitutes the agency authoritative position for plan years both before and after the notice publication date.plaintiffs cite language,buried deep within a discussion of safe harbors related to the new regulations,that t he internal revenue service and treasury expect that a plan under which a participant normal retirement age changes to an earlier date upon completion of a stated number of years of service typically will not satisfy the vesting or accrual rules of irc.relying on the deference due under chevron,natural resources defense council,plaintiffs contend the foregoing sentence from the notice establishes the plan violates the treasury regulations.we disagree.
we note first that notice concerns the implications of new treasury regulations that are prospective in nature only.the first paragraph of the notice is clear t his notice provides temporary relief for certain pension plans whose definition of normal retirement age may be required to be changed to comply with the regulations regarding a plan normal retirement age that were recently issued under section a of the irc.id.emphasis added.the obvious thrust of this language is that the violations identified in the notice are related to the newly promulgated regulations as they apply once those regulations are in effect 
plaintiffs argue,though,that the notice purpose section identifies another function t his notice also identifies potential violations of the vesting and accrued benefit requirements for defined benefit plans under irc that may arise from a definition of normal retirement age based on a minimum period of service.id.this purpose,however,must be understood in the context of the notice as a whole.robinson shell oil,when interpreting statutes,courts look at the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.similarly,in the context of interpreting the agency guidance,we are not to read one sentence in a vacuum.
when read in context,the language cited by plaintiffs is simply a warning that the safe harbors described in the notice for future plan years are not available to a plan wherein a participant normal retirement age changes to an earlier date upon completion of a stated number of years of service.the safe harbors,in turn,are related to the implementation of the new treasury regulations that,the parties agree,are prospective in nature only.see opening br.at the regulations are not at issue in this appeal.the notice beginning statement,recited supra,and largely repeated in the purpose section of the notice,confirms that the irs was referring only to the legal status of a changing nra in light of the new regulations.that is,it referred only to how a plan was to be analyzed going forward,not retroactively to plan years already passed and for which remedial efforts were not possible 
plaintiffs note,however,that notice an older treasury regulation reg.b b ii f.the full regulation is entitled accrued benefit requirements,and subpart b ii f is a special rule related to the percent rule.the subpart states that 
a plan shall not satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph the percent rule if the base for the computation of retirement benefits changes solely by reason of an increase in the number of years of participation.thus,for example,a plan will not satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph if it provides a benefit,commencing at normal retirement age,of the sum of percent of average compensation for a participant first years of participation multiplied by his first years of participation or,if less than his total years of participation and percent of average compensation for a participant highest years of participation multiplied by each year of participation subsequent to the year.
reg.b b ii f the regulation.
relying on the regulation,plaintiffs argue that the nra employed by the plan is,in effect,a changing base and is thus an unlawful attempt at backloading.the bank makes two arguments in response.first,it posits that the nra is not a base within the meaning of erisa and second,it contends that even if we were to consider the nra a base,it does not actually change.
we find the bank position convincing.with respect to plaintiffs contention that the nra is a base for purposes of the backloading rules,they are unable to cite any case in which a plan nra has been considered a base within the meaning of erisa.in fact,the authorities cited by plaintiffs support the bank theory that the nra is not a base.
looking first at b b ii f,the example described in the regulation itself is entirely unrelated to nra.rather,the regulation describes a plan wherein the amount by which a benefit formula is multiplied literally becomes a different amount upon completion of ten years of service.in the example,a plan participant base for the first ten years is one percent of average compensation for the participant first three years,and the base for each year after ten years of participation is one percent of average compensation for the participant highest three years.
similarly,carollo cement and concrete workers district council pension plan,cited by plaintiffs,is inapposite.in that case,the plan at issue operated as follows 
f or the first years of service a participant pension benefit accrues at of average monthly earnings,that is,a participant career average pay average earnings.participants who work for years without a break in service longer than two years,will,in their year,have their pension benefit recalculated for all previous years of service at of final average monthly earnings final average earnings.final average earnings is the average pay based not on the career average pay but on a participant highest five years of earnings in the ten years prior to retirement final average earnings.for each year of employment after such a participant year,the benefit accrues at of final average earnings.
id.at.the carollo court found that the plan violated the change the base regulation by,not only increasing a participant benefit base after years,but making
