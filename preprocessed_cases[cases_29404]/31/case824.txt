john stark iii filed this suit seeking a substantial award under a change of control provision in a benefits plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.he also sought what he sees as earned compensation in the form of a bonus.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants and gave them a sizeable attorney fees award of.stark appeals.
stark began working for ppm america,ppma in as and counsel.ppma is part of an umbrella of multinational and diversified entities organized under the british holding company prudential.ppm holdings ppmh is the direct parent of ppma and the sponsor of the erisa plan at issue.
while at ppma,stark had the responsibility for managing the portfolio of jackson national life insurance company,an affiliate of ppma and prudential united states insurance company.in january,ppma hired lori seegers as its general counsel and shifted stark to the position of general counsel for ppma special investments.throughout his time at ppma,stark reported to russell swanson,who was ppma president until november,when leandra knes became president.
on december,seegers and knes met with stark to tell him he had lost their trust and was being relieved of his job responsibilities.knes presented stark with a draft of a separation agreement which provided that his employment would continue until june,that he would be paid his base salary of per year,and after his departure he would receive a lump sum payment of but no bonuses for the years and.two weeks later,the offer was withdrawn because of the discovery of alleged misconduct by stark.on january,stark notified knes that he believed his employment with ppma had been constructively terminated.
stark retained attorneys who negotiated with ppma,but his demands were not met.rather than proceeding through the administrative process for filing a claim,stark filed this action in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,contending that he was entitled to severance pay and a bonus under the ppmh change of control severance plan.he says his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies must be excused because it would have been futile to go that route.
the district court denied stark motion for summary judgment in which he argued that exhaustion would be futile.in the same order,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,finding that there was no basis for severance pay or a bonus.following that order,stark filed a motion for clarification in which he,as defendants put it,proposed an absurdity.he argued that the district court was powerless to reach the merits on his claim because he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.he asked the judge to send the case back to the plan administrator for the exhaustion of administrative remedies.confronted with this,the judge then issued an order saying that the failure to exhaust was excused because the record clearly establishes that plaintiff can not prevail on his benefits claim.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see thiele norfolk ry,cir.
at the outset,we mention briefly that there is considerable doubt whether the change of control severance plan is applicable in the circumstances before us.it is,as the name implies,only applicable if there is,in fact,a change in control of the.stark relies on a provision in the plan which says that a change of control occurs if the ultimate parent in this case prudential plc sells percent of the stock or assets of an employer,a subsidiary.in december,prudential plc restructured its subsidiaries.before the restructuring,ppmh was a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential portfolio managers ppml.in,ppml transferred its stock in ppmh to prudential plc,which then transferred the shares down to other existing prudential plc entities prudential one limited,prudential two limited,and prudential three limited.then ppmh shares were transferred to holborn delaware partnership,in which prudential one,prudential two,and prudential three were partners.finally,on march,ppmh shares were transferred to brooke holdings,which wholly owns holborn delaware.stark contends that these transfers constitute a change of control as set out in the plan.
stark recognizes that an exclusion to the pertinent provision of the plan says there is no change of control under these circumstances if the ultimate parent retains direct control of the business.however,using the definitions in the plan,which may arguably contemplate ownership by corporations only,stark contends that,for purposes of the plan,the exclusion does not apply because the chain of control was broken when partnerships rather than corporations entered the ownership chain.we are skeptical about this argument,but we will assume the plan applies and proceed to the more basic issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies.
despite the fact that the change of control severance plan is very clear that exhaustion is required,stark failed to proceed through administrative process.appendix b to the plan,titled administration,sets out the procedures for handling claims.paragraph provides for a committee which has the power to compute or cause to be computed the amount of benefits which shall be payable to any person in accordance with the provisions of the plan.furthermore,under paragraph,the committee has the sole discretion to determine,among other things,eligibility for benefits under the plan.however,this section also says that the decisions of the committee shall not be entitled to any presumptive validity and,in the event of any dispute between any employer and a participant,be subject to de novo review by a court.although a participant can receive de novo review of a committee decision in court,there are some steps he must take first.paragraph states clearly that the claimant must submit a claim for benefits to the plan administrator.paragraph provides for the review by the committee of the plan administrator denial of a claim.prior to taking those steps,the participant shall have no right to seek review of a denial of benefits,or to bring any action in any court to enforce a claim,prior to his filing a claim and exhausting his rights to review if the claimant does not request review by the committee,he shall have no right to obtain such a review or to bring an action in any court and the denial of the claim shall become final and binding on all persons for all purposes.although the plan requires exhaustion prior to filing a lawsuit,it also provides for de novo review in court.the claimant has nothing to lose and everything to gain by using the procedures.
exhaustion of plan remedies is favored because the plan own review process may resolve a certain number of disputes the facts and the administrator interpretation of the plan may be clarified for the purposes of subsequent judicial review and an exhaustion requirement encourages private resolution of internal employment disputes.ames american can,cir.however,it is also true that we have recognized two circumstances in which a failure to exhaust may be excused.one is if there is a lack of meaningful access to review procedures,and the other applies if pursuing internal remedies would be futile.robyns reliance standard life ins,cir.the decision to require exhaustion before a plaintiff may proceed with a federal lawsuit is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.we will disturb a district court decision only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.powell communications,cir.
stark claims that pursuing the internal remedies would be futile in his situation because the person who terminated him,knes,would have participated in the ultimate decision.he also points out that the settlement negotiations were unsuccessful and the defendants have taken the position in this litigation that he is not entitled to benefits.but if claimants were allowed to skip the administrative procedure,it is hard to imagine that these factors would not be present in almost all cases.once battle is joined,positions calcify.
given the elaborate exhaustion requirements in the severance plan and the rather complex pro
