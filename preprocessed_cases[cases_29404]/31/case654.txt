employee stock ownership plan,and.employee savings plan collectively poni appeal the dismissal of their claims against,miami valley pension mvp and national city national city bank ncb collectively appellees.poni argues that the district court erred in adopting the magistrate judge determination that poni claims against the appellees are preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.the appellees argue in the alternative that either the claims are preempted or the district court was correct to grant their motion for judgment on the pleadings because poni has not alleged any cognizable damages.upon review,we conclude that though poni claims against ncb are preempted by erisa,the claims against mvp are not.furthermore,poni has alleged sufficient cognizable harm to preclude a judgment on the pleadings with respect to its claim against mvp.therefore,the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings is affirmed with regard to ncb and reversed with regard to mvp.we remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the employer has utilized three different retirement plans for its employees over the years a defined benefit pension plan defined benefit plan,an employee stock ownership plan esop,and a savings plan savings plan.the employer established the defined benefit plan on june.mvp served as the record keeper and the broker of the life insurance policies held as assets for the defined benefit plan.on june,the employer established the esop,for which mvp has provided services since its inception.lastly,effective july,the employer established the savings plan.ncb,and its predecessor,the first national bank,have provided,trust,and services to the savings plan since it was established.
the defined benefit plan was terminated on june,at which time all employees except one elected to cash out the insurance portion of their accrued benefits.the one employee,who was a key employee,as defined in the internal revenue code i,elected to roll the value of the insurance policy the key employee insurance policy into the savings plan.in,during a comprehensive review of the operations of both the savings plan and the esop,the employer discovered that the cash value of the key employee insurance policy rolled over from the defined benefit plan to the savings plan had been incorrectly valued by ncb at one dollar.when the key employee insurance policy was properly valued,the employer discovered that both the esop and savings plan were in violation of the limitations for the period of through.
a plan is considered when too great a percentage of the assets are dedicated to key employees,defined as officers earning above a specified compensation level or employees with high salaries and sufficient ownership interests.i a.the seeks to protect employees by ensuring that a minimum amount of the assets from an employer pension plan are dedicated to them.specifically,the defines a plan as one in which the aggregate of the accounts of key employees under the plan exceeds percent of the aggregate of the accounts of all employees under such plan.g a ii.if a plan is determined to be,it must meet vesting and minimum requirements.a.for a defined contribution plan,the minimum employer contribution amount is of the compensation for each of the employee participants.c a.the also provides for the aggregation of the requirements when an employer has multiple plans in effect.g.
as part of their responsibilities,mvp and ncb were required to perform testing to ensure that the esop and savings plan complied with the both mvp and ncb were aware of the existence of the other plan and their respective responsibilities.both the esop and the savings plan documents contain provisions describing the rules of as well as language requiring coordination of the requirements in the event that the employer sponsors more than one plan.in addition,during the period from july,to june,dave smeltzer,a representative of ncb responsible for the savings plan,orally advised the employer that the savings plan did not have a problem.
since it was unaware of the status of the two plans,the employer failed to make any contributions to alter the status as required by the during the years.on may,the employer advised the internal revenue service irs that the esop and the savings plan were in violation of the contribution requirements.the irs did not disqualify either plan,but instead revised the employer contributions and fined the employer.the employer was required to make a minimum contribution of.the employer also incurred an additional in service fees,interest,and legal fees pursuing the settlement with the irs and reimbursement from ncb and mvp.thus,the total amount poni was required to pay as a result of the error was.
poni brought suit in,alleging that ncb breached its fiduciary responsibility as a trustee under erisa.poni also alleged that ncb and mvp materially breached their respective service contracts by utilizing the obviously improper valuation of the key employee insurance policy not recognizing the improper valuation during the annual testing for each respective plan and failing to coordinate the testing of the savings plan and the esop.lastly,poni alleged that ncb and mvp negligently misrepresented their knowledge of the applicable law and their ability to operate the respective plans in conformity with the law,the terms of the plan documents,and industry standards.poni sought damages of.
on april,the district court granted the appellees motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.in its ruling,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendations in its entirety.in the report,the magistrate judge found that poni was not entitled to any relief under erisa and that its claims were preempted.poni appeals only with regard to the claims.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c under the same de novo standard applicable to a motion to dismiss under rule b.ziegler ibp hog market,cir.in reviewing the motion,we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept all of the complaint factual allegations as true,and determine whether the plaintiff undoubtedly can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.id.at.we have noted,however,that we need not accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.mixon ohio,cir.
the first issue poni raises on appeal is that the district court erred in finding that its claims against ncb and mvp were preempted by erisa.upon review,we conclude that poni claim against ncb,the trustee of the savings plan,is preempted under erisa a,but its claim against mvp,a service provider,is not.
erisa preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.erisa a,a.the united states supreme court has dealt with the opaque language in erisa a approximately twenty times over the last years.see de buono med.clinical servs.fund,d noting the numerous attempts by the court to define the boundaries of erisa preemption.in its earlier cases,the supreme court noted that t he clause is conspicuous for its breadth,fmc holliday,d,and deliberately expansive,and designed to establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern,pilot life ins.dedeaux,d internal quotation omitted.more recently,however,the supreme court has narrowed the preemptive scope of erisa,moving away from the broadest meaning of the provision.the court has stated that the phrase insofar as they relate contains words of limitation that were purposefully written into the statute.state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.if the term relate to was allowed to reach to its most logical extension,would never run its course.see also cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d scalia,concurring noting that applying the relate to provision according to its terms was a project doomed to failure,since,as many a curbstone philosopher has observed,everything is related to everything else.the effect of such a broad reading would be to read congress words of limitation as mere sham,and to read the presumption against out of the law whenever congress speaks to the matter with generality.travelers ins,at.
therefore,in interpreting erisa preemption clause,a court must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term,and look instead to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive.id.at.the purpose of erisa preemption was to avoid conflicting federal and state regulation and to create a nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.thus,erisa preempts state laws that mandate employee benefit structures or their administration provide alternate enforcement mechanisms or bind employers or plan administrators to particular choices or preclude uniform administrative practice,thereby functioning as a regulation of an erisa plan itself.coyne delany selman,cir outlining the three categories of state laws recognized in travelers that are preempted by erisa internal citations omitted.congress did not intend,however,for erisa to preempt traditional laws of general applicability that do not implicate the relations among the traditional erisa plan entities,including the principals,the employer,the plan,the plan fiduciaries,and the beneficiaries.leblanc cahill,cir.
since the travelers decision,the supreme court has reiterated the approach of looking to the objectives of erisa to guide its preemption decisions.see,dillingham,at.finding that california prevailing wage law,which has only an indirect economic effect on employee benefit plans,is not preempted by erisa de buono,at.upholding state tax on health care facilities operated by an erisa fund.we too have followed the travelers approach in applying erisa preemption in our recent cases.in smith provident bank,cir,we held that an erisa plan claims against a trustee were preempted because congress established the exclusive means by which fiduciary duties would be enforced.we noted,however,that where an erisa plan relationship with another entity is not governed by erisa,it is subject to state law.id.at.similarly,in marks newcourt credit group,cir,we found that a claim was not preempted where the conduct at issue related to the employment contract irrespective of the plan even though resolution of the claim affected the plaintiff right to plan benefits.though we have yet to address the issue specifically,other courts of appeals have followed a similar approach and held that erisa does not preempt claims brought against service providers in connection with professional services rendered to an erisa plan.see,gerosa savasta,cir concluding that erisa does not preempt plan claim against an actuary which resulted in severe of erisa plan,cert.denied,d and cert.denied,d.state carpenters pension trust fund citibank,cir concluding that a plan could bring a claim for breach of custodial agreement against a bank as service provider coyne delany,at,holding that state malpractice claims against insurer for negligently failing to obtain replacement insurance plan was not preempted airparts custom benefit,cir concluding that trustee suit against outside financial consultant is not preempted.
applying these principles to this case,we conclude that the magistrate judge erred in his analysis of poni claims against ncb and mvp.the magistrate judge found that because poni claims arise out of obligations relating to the servicing of erisa plans,the claims against both ncb and mvp are preempted.the mere fact that an employee benefit plan is implicated in the dispute,however,is not dispositive of whether the claims are preempted.poni argues that its claims relate solely to the appellees services and should be viewed separately from the plans themselves.with regard to the claim against ncb,we find that argument to be unpersuasive.
ncb serves as trustee to the savings plan and also provides and services.ncb obligations arise out of the savings plan itself,which contains provisions outlining the rules and requiring coordination of testing among multiple plans in the prior cases in which the courts have found that erisa does not preempt claims against service providers,a service agreement or contract separate and distinct from the erisa qualified plan served as the basis for the claim.see marks,at allowing suit for breach of employment contract gerosa,at permitting suit on actuarial contract.state carpenters,at allowing claim for breach of custodial agreement coyne delany,at permitting malpractice claim on contract to design benefit plan airparts,at permitting suit on a consulting contract.in this case,by contrast,all of ncb obligations arise from the plan itself,and thus the claim is necessarily a claim that a fiduciary breached the terms of the erisa plan.
poni argues that even if the contract upon which it is suing ncb is the erisa plan,preemption does not apply to a claim for ncb failure to perform its duties under the plan.poni correctly contends that an entity may serve both in a fiduciary and capacity,because fiduciary status under erisa turns on function rather than form.pegram herdrich,d.indeed,where the alleged conduct by the fiduciary is entirely unrelated to and outside the scope of the fiduciary duties under the plan or in carrying out the terms of the plan,courts have found that erisa core objectives are not implicated and claims may proceed.darcangelo verizon communications,cir see also dishman unum life ins,cir holding that erisa does not provide fiduciaries with blanket immunity from garden variety torts which only peripherally impact daily plan administration.in this case,however,because the contract at issue in the claim is the erisa plan itself,the claim is clearly preempted.darcangelo,at.erisa civil enforcement scheme does not limit claims to only those of a fiduciary nature,but rather permits a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary to enjoin any act or practice which violates the terms of the plan.erisa a a,a a emphasis added.therefore,a cause of action to enforce the terms of the contract necessarily conflicts with congress carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme.mertens hewitt,d.because the claim would create an alternate enforcement mechanism for ncb performance under the erisa plan,we conclude that the claim is preempted under a.
by contrast,poni arguments with regard to its claim against mvp are more compelling.first,mvp does not serve as a fiduciary to either the defined benefit plan,the savings plan,or the esop mvp sole relationship with poni is as a service provider,charged with performing services for the esop second,the cause of action does not fall within any of the three recognized categories which courts have generally found erisa preemption.coyne delany,at.specifically,poni suit against mvp will not result in mandating a specific employment benefit structure,providing an alternate enforcement mechanism of an erisa plan,or regulating an erisa plan itself.thus,the sole remaining issue is whether the claim would implicate relations among the traditional erisa plan entities.leblanc,at.
traditional erisa plan entities are defined as the principals,the employer,the plan,the plan fiduciaries and the beneficiaries.see also firestone tire rubber neusser,cir.while poni is certainly a traditional erisa plan entity,mvp is clearly not.mvp sole responsibility is to provide services for poni pursuant to the parties oral agreement.we have previously stated that w hen an erisa plan relationship with another entity is not governed by erisa,it is subject to state law.provident bank,at.specifically,the erisa plan acquire s the same rights of action under state law as other entities not created by erisa.see also am.life ins.castonguay,cir holding that erisa does purport to regulate those relationships where a plan operates just like any other commercial entity.
mvp argues that even if it is not a principal erisa entity itself,poni claim should still be preempted because it would clearly affect relations between principal erisa entities.mvp br.at we fi
