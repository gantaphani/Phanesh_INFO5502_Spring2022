background 
donald jebian,now,worked as a software engineer for hewlett packard continuously from to may.in he began to suffer from a series of orthopedic impairments that caused him pain and made it difficult for him to move normally.
jebian first developed bilateral shoulder pain.it turned out that he had a massive rotator cuff defect in his right shoulder,which was not diagnosed until.in,jebian also began to experience back pain.doctors determined that the cause was lumbar spinal stenosis his doctors agree that his stenosis is congenital rather than the result of injury.later,jebian was diagnosed with lumbar degenerative disc disease,which exacerbated his back pain.
jebian stopped work in may because of intractable back pain.he had a lumbar discectomy in june,the first of several surgeries.because his back pain persisted after the surgery,he had a second surgery on his back in the fall of.stark,who examined jebian at hewlett packard request with regard to a worker compensation claim in october,predicted that jebian would need yet another surgery on his back.jebian also underwent two surgeries on his shoulders in,one on each.
jebian was a participant in an employee benefit plan the plan covered by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.the plan,by hewlett packard and administered by an independent claims administrator,voluntary plan administrator vpa,offers both and disability leave.disability benefits last up to weeks.an applicant for short term disability benefits must show that following the onset of the injury or sickness,the member is continuously unable to perform each and every duty of his or her occupation.
after weeks,an employee still unable to work must apply separately for disability benefits.benefits are granted under the plan if the member is continuously unable to perform any occupation for which he or she is or may become qualified by reason of his or her education,training or experience emphasis added.the plan stipulates that disability determinations for either long or benefits are to be made by the claims administrator on the basis of objective medical evidence.
after first leaving work in may jebian applied for and received disability benefits.he applied for benefits after the requisite weeks of benefits.vpa initially denied the application,but on appeal reversed its decision.by the time of that reversal,jebian had returned to work,so benefits were granted retroactively only for the period before jebian returned to work.
jebian shortly left work once again due to the same medical conditions.he tried to return to work in may,but within a matter of weeks left work for a third time,this time not to return.
vpa found jebian eligible for disability benefits when he left work in june.in february,with the week of his benefits approaching,jebian again applied for benefits.vpa denied jebian application for disability benefits on august.
vpa letter of denial based its decision on two reports that it had commissioned concerning jebian condition a work capacities assessment conducted by physical therapists employed by healthsouth,a company that conducts such physical assessments for insurers and employers,and an employability assessment report conducted by a vocational consultant employed by rehab west,a company that provides vocational assessments.
vpa denial letter relied largely on healthsouth representation that jebian could tolerate sitting,walking,trunk bending,overhead reaching,squatting,and other functions,though the healthsouth report had noted that jebian had substantive limitations in his ability to carry out these functions.the letter also cited and adopted rehab west conclusion that jebian was professionally and physically qualified to perform four support analyst,data processing auditor,sales representative for computers and electronic data processing systems,and technical training instructor.the rehab west report was identical to one that had formed the basis for the decision to deny jebian disability benefits two years earlier a decision that,as noted,was retracted by vpa on appeal.rehab west did not conduct its own medical exam of jebian.rather,the rehab west report concluded,in one sentence,that i t also appears that these occupations are within his physical capabilities as per the medical reports provided.it is not clear from the record which medical documents were provided to rehab west.precisely the same sentence regarding medical reports had appeared in the rehab west report,although jebian medical circumstances had changed greatly by further,the rehab west report does not indicate that any of the jobs it suggests could be done by a person who can sit or stand for only limited time periods 
in november,jebian appealed the denial of benefits.he argued that crucial records were not considered,that some medical records were misread,and that the alternative employment recommendations were based on erroneous readings of the medical information.enclosed with his appeal was a letter from james landes.landes,who had examined jebian in september,reviewed medical records,the healthsouth and rehab west reports,and the denial letter emphasized that jebian is incapable of prolonged sitting or standing and pointed out that the four jobs recommended by rehab west all involve one or the other.landes urged vpa to reconsider its decision.
under the plan language,jebian claim shall be deemed to have been denied on review if vpa neither responds within sixty days nor informs the claimant that it could take up to sixty days longer to respond.on march,days after receiving jebian appeal,vpa wrote to jebian,responding to his objections but leaving the appeal pending to consider further medical documentation.vpa wrote to jebian again in june,stating that it was still awaiting some medical records and that the appeal therefore remained pending.
on september,jebian filed his complaint in district court.only after that,on november,did vpa send jebian a letter finally denying his claim for disability benefits.
the district court reviewed vpa decision for abuse of discretion and granted summary judgment to the plan.we reverse.we conclude that the proper standard of review of vpa decision in this case is de novo,and remand for reconsideration of jebian claim accordingly.
discussion 
a challenge to an erisa plan denial of benefits is reviewed de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.if a plan does grant such discretion,a reviewing court applies an abuse of discretion amounts to the same arbitrary and capricious standard.see taft equitable life assurance soc y,cir.
the plan before us explicitly grants discretion to decide appeals from denials of claims for benefits to the plan administrator.the pertinent language reads the claims administrator shall have the discretionary authority to construe the language of the plan and make the decision on review on behalf of the organization.
the primary question before us,of first impression in this circuit,is whether a plan administrator decision,otherwise within the administrator discretion,can be accorded judicial deference when the purported final,discretionary decision is not made until after the claim is,according to both the terms of the plan and department of labor dol regulations,already automatically deemed denied on review.we conclude that where,according to plan and regulatory language,a claim is deemed denied on review after the expiration of a given time period,there is no opportunity for the exercise of discretion and the denial is usually to be reviewed de novo.while deference may be due to a plan administrator that is engaged in a good faith attempt to comply with its deadlines when they lapse,this is not such a case.
jebian letter appealing the denial of benefits is dated november,and was received by vpa on november.vpa did not respond until march,vpa decision after that lapse in time was in violation of both the department of labor dol erisa regulations and plan language.both the plan and a dol regulation,h i required some written notice in response to an appeal within sixty if only to establish an extension,available only where special circumstances require.id.the plan also stated 
if a claimant has not received written notice that additional time is required for review within sixty days of the date his or her request for review is received by the claims administrator,the claim shall be deemed to have been denied on review.
see also h similarly providing that appeals neither timely decided nor extended are deemed denied.so any appeal not responded to within the requisite time limit was deemed denied.
the regulation and the plan further required in all instances a final determination within days sixty days plus the allowable extension of the appeal.again,the regulation and the plan deemed any claim denied unless there was a final determination within that time limit.the plan stated 
if a claimant receives proper and timely notice that additional time is required for review,but does not receive written notice of the claims administrator decision with respect to his or her claim within one hundred twenty days after the date the claims administrator receives the request for review,the claim shall be deemed to have been denied on review.
see also h similarly providing that claims neither timely decided nor extended on review are deemed denied.
vpa gave no written notice to jebian between the filing of his appeal and its march letter,written a day before the limit expired.the letter responded to jebian objections but left the case open to consider further medical documentation,without specifying until later what information might be useful.thus even if we ignore the initial failure to respond,according to the regulation and the plan terms,jebian claim,the appeal of which was not decided within days,was deemed denied on march.
vpa asks us,in effect,to ignore the deemed denied language in the regulation and the plan and treat its march letter as a good faith component of the meaningful dialogue between erisa plan administrators and their beneficiaries.booton lockheed med.benefit plan,cir.by engaging in such dialogue,vpa argues,it was in substantial compliance with the deadline regime,see gilbertson allied signal,cir,and thereby retained its discretion to determine the claim.we do not agree.
firestone directs us to abide by the principle from trust law that a court of equity will not interfere to control trustees in the exercise of a discretion vested in them by the instrument under which they act.firestone,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the instrument in this case does vest discretion,but the same instrument and the regulation that governed it set time boundaries within which that discretion must be exercised.we are just as bound by the plan language deeming denial in the event that time limits are exceeded as we are bound by the plan language that grants discretion to the plan administrator.decisions made outside the boundaries of conferred discretion are not exercises of discretion,the substance of the decisions notwithstanding.
more practically,if we were to accept vpa suggestion,use of the language of is,providing reasons and asking for more become a talisman by which administrators could ensure deference even when they are expressly precluded by the trust agreement from exercising discretion because the time for doing so has passed.also,a contrary rule would allow claimants,who are entitled to sue once a claim had been deemed denied,to be sandbagged by a rationale the plan administrator adduces only after the suit has commenced.see marolt alliant techsystems,cir.our refusal to subject claimants to that eventuality parallels the general rule that an agency order must be upheld,if at all,on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself,not a subsequent rationale articulated by counsel.federal power comm texaco,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
analogously to the rule we adopt here,this court has interpreted a statute that imposes a deadline for united states fish and wildlife service action to preclude the agency from gaining additional time to make discretionary findings.see biodiversity legal found.badgley,cir the exercise of discretion is foreclosed when statutorily imposed deadlines are not met.our holding is consistent as well with the rule in at least three other circuits on a similar,although separate,issue.those circuits considered whether deference is owed to a decision to revoke benefits when that decision is made by a body other than the one authorized by the procedures set forth in a benefits plan.sanford harvard,cir sharkey ultramar energy,cir chase manhattan bank,cir.all three circuits concluded that no deference is owed under these circumstances.
the principle underlying these wrong cases is that although firestone directs courts to defer to the decisions of plans in which their language grants discretionary authority,that deference applies only when the decision is made by the body vested with discretion.when an unauthorized body that does not have fiduciary discretion to determine benefits eligibility renders such a decision deferential review is not warranted.sanford,at.similarly,we will not defer when a decision is,under the plan,necessarily the mechanical result of a time expiration rather than an exercise of discretion.
we note that the principle we apply in this case may apply more generally to decisions made in violation of procedures prescribed by applicable regulations or the plan itself.sanford explained that t he logic behind the cases denying deference to plan decisions made by a body other than the one granted discretion is that deferential review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is merited for decisions regarding benefits when they are made in compliance with plan procedures emphasis added.at.when decisions are not in compliance with regulatory and plan procedures,deference may not be warranted.
we have held previously that procedural violations can affect the merits determination concerning whether an abuse of discretion has taken place.blau del monte,cir abrogation on other grounds recognized by dytrt mountain state,cir,ruled that o rdinarily,a claimant who suffers because of a fiduciary failure to comply with erisa procedural requirements is entitled to no substantive remedy,but that if procedural violations result in substantive harm,then a court must consider such violations in determining whether the decision to deny benefits in a particular case was arbitrary and capricious.blau,at.blau left open the question whether procedural violations influence the standard of review.at.moreover,blau was decided before firestone,when our default standard for reviewing erisa plan decisions was arbitrary and capricious rather than de novo.
for present purposes,however,we leave the more general issue open and decide only that where the plan itself provides that a particular procedural violation results in an automatic decision rather than one calling for the exercise of the administrator discretion,that provision is as enforceable as the provision giving the administrator discretionary authority under other circumstances.deference to an exercise of discretion requires discretion actually to have been exercised.see mansker tmg life ins,cir w here an erisa plan gives a plan administrator or fiduciary discretion to decide certain issues,the fact that the administrator or fiduciary fails to address or decide those issues does not exempt those issues from de novo review by the district court on summary judgment.deemed denials are not exercises of discretion.they are therefore undeserving of deference under firestone,and a de novo standard of review applies 
the precise question in this case has not had extensive treatment in other circuits,and conclusions in similar cases vary.in gritzer cbs,cir,the third circuit applied de novo review to a plan that otherwise granted discretion to the administration because under the plan the employee pension claim was deemed denied.turning to the analogy between erisa plans and trusts,the third circuit stated where a trustee fails to act or to exercise his or her discretion,de novo review is appropriate because the trustee has forfeited the privilege to apply his or her discretion it is the trustee analysis,not his or her right to use discretion or a mere arbitrary denial,to which a court should defer.id.citation omitted.gritzer was a slightly different case from ours,however,because there the plan did not respond at all,either early or late,to the employees claims.
in a case more akin to ours,the tenth circuit recently held,in gilbertson allied signal,cir,that firestone seems to require de novo review of deemed denials.t o be entitled to deferential review,not only must the administrator be given discretion by the plan,but the administrator decision in a given case must be a valid exercise of that discretion.id.gilbertson noted it was in harmony with our initial opinion,since withdrawn,in this case.id.at 
the fifth circuit stated without discussion in southern farm bureau life insurance moore,cir,that i n our view,the standard of review is no different whether the claim is actually denied or is deemed denied.in daniel eaton,cir,which was decided before firestone,the sixth circuit stated that the standard of review is no different whether the appeal is actually denied or is deemed denied.more recently,however,the sixth circuit,while noting daniel,commented that there is undeniable logic in the view that a plan administrator should forfeit deferential review by failing to exercise its discretion in a timely manner.university hosps.of cleveland emerson,cir.university hospitals left open the standard of review question,as it did not matter to the result.id.
finally,in mcgarrah hartford life insurance,cir,the eighth circuit refused to consider the failure to respond to an appeal as affecting the standard of review.there is nothing in mcgarrah,however,indicating that the plan in question contained the deemed denied language at issue here.further,here,the plan administrator did purport to decide the appeal,albeit late,and is asking us to defer to its decision on review rather than to its original denial of benefits which did not,of course,consider jebian submissions on appeal.see gilbertson,at arguing that mcgarrah should be followed,if at all,only where the claimant does not provide meaningful new evidence or raise significant new issues in the appeal.
of these cases,we find the reasoning in gilbertson and the observation in university hospitals most illuminating,for all the reasons already surveyed.
vpa maintains that even if de novo review applies to deemed denials where the administrator has wholly failed to comply with the plan or regulations procedures,vpa deserves deference here because it was engaged in an ongoing meaningful dialogue with jebian during the decision period.see booton lockheed med.benefit plan,cir.just as there is good reason to avoid giving talismanic power to the language of discretion,there is reason as well to avoid endowing the sixty or deadlines with such significance that manipulation of deadlines could be employed tactically by either erisa claimants or plan administrators.as the tenth circuit recently noted in gilbertson,erisa is designed to promote a bilateral exchange of information on the merits of claims,not hasty decisionmaking by administrators so as to slip under the wire or delay by claimants so as to ensure a deemed denial.gilbertson,at.we agree with the gilbertson court that inconsequential violations of the deadlines would not entitle the claimant to de novo review,in the context of an ongoing,good faith exchange of information between the administrator and the claimant.id.
the procedural violations here were far from inconsequential,however,and there was no such ongoing,good faith exchange.under the plan and the regulations then in force,vpa should have either decided the appeal within sixty days or informed jebian that,because of special circumstances,it needed sixty more days.see h i.it did neither.nor did vpa request any further information until the day,one day short of the deadline.one hundred nineteen days of radio silence,gilbertson,at,is neither productive nor reasonably informative to the claimant.accordingly,while our holding regarding the appropriate standard of review on deemed denied claims may be tempered in cases where a delinquent plan is nonetheless in substantial compliance with prescribed procedures,this is not such a case.
because we recognize the same caveat gilbertson adopted,we also reject vpa more general policy argument that the prospect of de novo review for claims deemed denied through administrative inaction is apt to lead to more denials,as administrators precipitously decide claims before sixty or days have lapsed in order to secure deferential review.absent unusual circumstances,an administrator engaged in a genuine,productive,ongoing dialogue that substantially complies with a plan and the regulations timelines should remain entitled to whatever discretion the plan documentation gives it.hence,administrators in substantial compliance have no need to rush to judgment.we also note that,even for timely denials on the merits,it is an abuse of discretion for erisa plan administrators to render decisions without any explanation.bendixen standard ins,cir citing eley boeing,cir.the prospect of de novo review of untimely decisions should therefore only spur administrators into producing timely,reasoned what erisa aims to achieve.
on the merits of the denial of benefits,jebian points out that although the plan requires that disability determinations be based on objective medical evidence,vpa never had him examined by,or his medical records reviewed by,a doctor.neither of the evaluations upon which vpa based its decision was prepared by a doctor.the healthsouth assessment was conducted by physical therapists.the rehab west report was prepared by a vocational consultant.
rehab west found jebian to be capable of four occupations.the report first describes those occupations as ones jebian can do within his education and vocational background.the report adds it also appears that these occupations are within his physical capabilities as per the medical records provided,but,as noted,it is not clear from the record which medical records were reviewed by rehab west,and rehab west issued identical reports in and despite changes in jebian medical circumstances.
jebian stresses,furthermore,that vpa decision is in tension with the opinions of several doctors,including the doctors who treated him,all of whom agree that jebian can neither sit nor stand except for a very short time and is therefore permanently disabled.james stark examined jebian at hewlett packard request with regard to a workers compensation claim.stark wrote in october,after jebian had undergone his second back surgery,that jebian is not capable of working at this time because of his sitting and standing limitations.it is not clear whether he will ever be able to compete in the open labor market because of pain related physical limitations.
lu,who has treated jebian since february,filled out a physician certification of disability for jebian in september.lu noted on that form that jebian has tried to rtw return to work twice,but was unable to tolerate sitting more than a few minutes at a time,or standing.lu filled out another hewlett packard company form on january.this time lu checked a box stating that his patient is now totally disabled from any other work.lu checked another box indicating that he did not expect a fundamental or marked change in the future.lu commented on the form that jebian is subject to a s evere limitation of sitting and standing maximum minutes at a time and has too much pain to sit or stand more than a few minutes at a time.
landes,who began treating jebian in september after jebian moved to a new area,stated in his november letter in support of jebian appeal that patients with his condition are permanently precluded from activities requiring prolonged sitting or prolonged standing,and that h is current physical exam findings confirm the information in the records and support his claim of permanent disability,limiting him to sedentary work.landes also reviewed in his letter the particular occupations cited by the rehab west report,concluding that jebian could not stand or sit for sufficiently sustained periods to perform the jobs recommended.even the healthsouth report relied upon by vpa,for that matter,seems to indicate that jebian can only sit for twenty minutes at a time and stand for thirty minutes at a time.additionally,there was medical corroboration of jebian constant pain,in the form of extensive records concerning his participation in a study,supervised by lacy,of a new pain medication.to obtain the medication,jebian was required to keep a diary and visit lacy office frequently,which he did.
vpa chose,despite this evidence,to deny jebian benefits in accord with the suggestion of the rehab west report that there were four occupations in the market that jebian was capable of performing.the district court found that vpa did not abuse its discretion in doing so.
in light of this record evidence,applying de novo review to the district court grant of summary judgment leads us to conclude that there is a genuine issue of fact concerning whether jebian is disabled.see kearney standard ins,cir en banc.there is medical evidence in the record from jebian treating physicians documenting the physiological basis for his back pain the aggressive surgical treatment he underwent the persistence of the pain,necessitating continued treatment with innovative painkillers and professional assessments that jebian was functionally precluded from standing or sitting for more than a few minutes at a time 
vpa argues that jebian extensive medical evidence does not pertain to the relevant moment,which is the end of the temporary disability benefit period,march.a trier of fact,reviewing the entire record submitted to vpa,could conclude otherwise.for example,although vpa rejected records from as immaterial to jebian disability in march,in fact those records are pertinent,although certainly not determinative.they both trace the history of jebian back injury and indicate that it is capable of causing total disability.jebian treating physician,lu,certified on january,that jebian remained severely functionally limited due to his back injury.lu opinion was based on a june office visit and over two years experience in treating jebian back ailment.finally,landes,contrary to the district court understanding,did examine jebian himself,in september,and based his october letter in part on that examination.
a trier of fact,reviewing the evidence before vpa de novo,could infer that functional limitations confirmed by treating physicians in june,may,and september,more likely than not existed in march as well,rather than disappearing before march and reappearing thereafter.
while under an abuse of discretion standard our review is limited to the record before the plan administrator,mckenzie general,cir,this limitation does not apply to de novo review.mongeluzo baxter travenol long term disability benefit plan,cir on remand,district court has discretion to take additional evidence when circumstances clearly establish that additional evidence is necessary to conduct an adequate de novo review of the benefit decision now that we have clarified that de novo review is appropriate,the trial court must have an opportunity to determined whether to admit such additional evidence so as to enable the full exercise of informed and independent judgment.id.at see also id.at a change in the posture of the case can justify taking additional evidence on de novo review.we therefore remand to the district court to allow consideration of further developments of the record under the mongeluzo standard and de novo review of the denial of the benefits claim 
conclusion 
we reverse the grant of summary judgment to vpa and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
i dissent because the majority forfeits an independent erisa administrator authority to exercise its discretion when ruling on a plan member claim,simply because the administrator was late in ruling on a claim for benefits and,in doing so,creates an conflict.the majority acknowledges that the plan explicitly grants discretion to decide appeals from denials of claims for benefits to the plan administrator.op.at.further,the record reveals that the independent plan administrator,voluntary plan administrator vpa,did exercise its discretion in denying jebian appeal.to apply the,de novo standard of review solely because of a procedural irregularity is an extreme measure warranted neither by the facts of this case nor by the cases on which the majority relies.as i explain below,all of those cases involved circumstances very different from those presented here.on the contrary,the majority conclusion conflicts with all but one of the decisions that have dealt with the precise issue we face,as well as with the reasoning of our own precedent regarding the effect of procedural violations.
jebian letter appealing the denial of benefits is dated november,and was received by vpa on november.vpa responded on march,with a letter denying some of jebian claims and asking for further information regarding two of his claims.the letter explained in detail the reasons for vpa decision.this letter was sent after the period required by h i,but before the limit.on june,vpa wrote to jebian to inform him that it had received some,but not all,of the medical records it had requested,and that the medical offices stated that jebian had not returned the medical authorization forms they needed in order to release the rest of the records.vpa indicated that it would assume the claims were pending until it received the records.jebian responded by filing this action on september.on november,vpa sent jebian a letter again explaining the reasons for the denial of benefits and giving further explanations based on the records it had received.
the cases cited by the majority do not support its conclusion to strip the plan administrator of its discretion.for example,in chase manhattan bank,cir,the decision regarding benefits was made by someone who was not authorized by the plan to make that decision.likewise,in sanford harvard,cir,the court affirmed the district court determination that it was not the authorized party that made the benefits determination,but the company at a meeting prompted by a union grievance held under the auspices of the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.thus,in both and sanford,unlike this case,the decision regarding benefits was made by someone who was not given discretionary authority by the plan.the first and sixth circuits therefore properly upheld the district courts use of the de novo standard of review rather than the abuse of discretion standard,at.finally,in sharkey ultramar energy,cir,the court stated that the denial of benefits is reviewed de novo if an unauthorized party makes the determination,but found that there was insufficient evidence of who actually made the determination in order to uphold the grant of summary judgment.it therefore reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded.id.at.
unlike,sanford,and sharkey,the instant case does not involve an unauthorized party making the benefits determination.vpa,as the majority concedes,is the party granted the discretionary authority by the plan to decide claim appeals.in cases in which the party that is given discretionary authority by the plan did not actually exercise its discretion,such as those cited by the majority,it makes sense to apply the de novo standard of review.here,however,the discretion was exercised by the party in whom it was vested by the plan,vpa,albeit in an untimely manner 
the eighth circuit addressed the precise question we face in a case with facts similar to those presented here,mcgarrah hartford life ins,cir.in mcgarrah,the eighth circuit rejected the claimant argument that the insurance company failure to respond to his appeal from an adverse decision entitled the claimant to a less deferential standard of review.id.at.the insurance company in mcgarrah completely failed to respond to the claimant appeal.the court acknowledged that the company failure to respond was a serious procedural irregularity.id.at citing h.it relied,however,on its decision in buttram cent.states,areas health welfare fund,cir,in which it stated that procedural irregularities must have some connection to the substantive decision reached,they must cause the actual decision to be a breach of the plan trustee fiduciary obligations.id.at.reasoning that the insurance company had made a thorough investigation and adequately explained the basis for its decision,the court in mcgarrah concluded that the claimant failed to meet his burden of presenting evidence that the irregularity raised serious doubts about the integrity of the decision making process.mcgarrah,at.the court therefore held that the district court properly applied the deferential abuse of discretion standard see also tillery hoffman enclosures,cir upholding the district court decision to review the decision for an abuse of discretion where the administrator failure to provide the beneficiaries with timely notice of the denial and of their appeal rights resulted in a procedural irregularity,but the irregularity did not so undermine the decision of the plan administrator as to render it suspect clapp citibank,disability plan,cir stating that a standard of review is appropriate only if the claimant presents material,probative evidence demonstrating a palpable conflict of interest or serious procedural irregularity that caused a serious breach of fiduciary duty,and concluding that a less deferential standard of review was not warranted.
here,vpa response detailed the reasons for the denial of jebian appeal.there is no evidence in the record that vpa relinquished the discretion granted it in the plan or that the untimeliness of its response raised doubts about the integrity of the process 
ordinarily,a claimant who suffers because of a fiduciary failure to comply with erisa procedural requirements is entitled to no substantive remedy.blau del monte,cir citation omitted see also kent united of omaha life ins,cir generally,the courts have recognized in cases that procedural violations entail substantive remedies only when some useful purpose would be served.as the majority observes,the question of whether procedural violations influence the standard of review was left open in blau in blau,there was no summary plan description,no claims procedure,and no provision to inform participants in writing of anything in short,the employer failed to comply with virtually every applicable mandate of erisa.at.we reasoned that the egregious procedural violations work ed a substantive harm by alter ing the substantive relationship between employer and employee that disclosure,reporting and fiduciary duties sought to balance somewhat more equally.id.at.thus,in reviewing an administrator decision,a court must consider continuing procedural violations in determining whether the decision to deny benefits in a particular case was arbitrary and capricious.id.
while blau left the question open,we have since required claimants to show that a violation of erisa procedural requirements caused a substantive violation or themselves worked a substantive harm.parker bankamerica,cir quoting bogue ampex,cir mckenzie,cir reasoning that the insurance company procedural violation did not prejudice the claimant opportunity to obtain a full and fair review of his claim,and consequently affirming the district court holding that the violation did not cause the claimant substantive harm bogue,at concluding that the claimant ha d not met his requirement of showing that any procedural defects caused him substantive harm or involved a substantive violation of erisa.thus,even though blau and its progeny deal with whether the claimant was entitled to a substantive remedy,rather than whether a less deferential standard of review should apply,the question we faced in blau is the same as that we face is,what should be the consequence of a procedural violation 
similar to blau,our sister circuits have adopted a rule of substantial compliance in determining whether violations of claims procedures warrant relief that is,a decision regarding benefits will not be upset for procedural violations if the company has substantially complied with procedural requirements such that the claimant has all the necessary information at a time when the participant still has a meaningful opportunity for appeal and for full and fair review.schleibaum kmart,cir citations omitted see,perrino bell,cir stating that claimants should not be able to avoid the exhaustion requirement if technical deficiencies in a claims procedure do not hinder effective administrative review of their claims terry bayer,cir rejecting a claim for relief from an adverse decision regarding benefits where no prejudice resulted from inadequate notice of the denial,stating that erisa notice requirements are not meant to create a system of strict liability for formal notice failures heller fortis benefits ins,reasoning that,although the initial letter from the insurance company informing the claimant of the denial of her disability benefits did not conform to the requirements of the regulations,the communication between the company,the claimant,and her lawyer insured that she understood the reasons for the denial of benefits and her right to appeal the decision kent,at adopting the rule that a decision will be upheld even if procedures have been violated,if the claimant is notified of the reasons for the denial of the claim and has a fair opportunity for review hines.mut.life ins,cir stating that the f ailure to fulfill procedural requirements generally does not give rise to a substantive damage remedy,except when the violations are continuous and amount to substantive harm,and citing blau sheppard enoch pratt,travelers ins,cir finding no prejudice in a plan administrator violations of requirements of a timely and specific response,stating that the notice substantially complied with the regulation donato metro.life ins,cir stating that substantial compliance with the regulations is sufficient,and concluding that the claimant had received information sufficient to permit effective review.
thus,although blau left open the issue of the applicable standard of review when erisa procedural requirements have been violated,it also set forth the principle that the claimant must show some type of prejudice or harm that results from a procedural violation of erisa.we have relied on that principle in affirming benefits decisions,see,parker,at mckenzie,at,and other circuits have engaged in a similar analysis in determining the effect of procedural violations of erisa,as the cases cited above demonstrate.
our line of cases following blau firmly establishes the law of the circuit that a showing of prejudice from a procedural violation of erisa,that the violation caused the claimant substantive harm,is required before relief can be granted based on such a violation.parker,at mckenzie,at bogue,at.the majority decision today literally disregards circuit precedent that is clearly relevant to the instan
