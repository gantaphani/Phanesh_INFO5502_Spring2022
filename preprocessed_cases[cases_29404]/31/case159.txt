in november,kombassan,a turkish corporation,entered into a stock purchase agreement with hom,a women clothing retailer based in massachusetts,to acquire of hom.article of the stock purchase agreement provided that kombassan may assign all or part of this agreement to one or more of its affiliates or subsidiaries,including acar hydraulic machines,kongaz petroleum,koveka textile.and makas marble mining,without prior written consent provided however that such assignment shall not relieve kombassan of any obligation or liability hereunder.at the time of closing,kombassan assigned the stock purchase agreement to the four turkish corporations the assignees listed in article as follows to acar hydraulic machines,to kongaz petroleum,to koveka textile,and to makas marble mining.hasim bayram,the chairman of kombassan,signed the assignment agreement five times,once on behalf of kombassan and four times as chairman of each of the four assignees.the purpose of the stock assignment was to circumvent turkish law,which prohibited turkish companies from investing more than million outside turkey without the permission of the turkish government.the four original assignees were all companies involved in industries separate from retail fashion.although bayram served as chairman of all these assignees,each corporation had separate offices,separate employees,and separate bank accounts.kombassan was not a majority shareholder in most of the companies that were assignees during the relevant period.
early in,bayram hired donna moore as hom president.moore testified that during her tenure as president of hom she communicated with and reported to bayram on a weekly basis.moore testified that she reported solely to bayram and believed that kombassan owned hom because that is what bayram led her to believe.according to moore,bayram made all the decisions for hom in the name of kombassan only.to the extent that she knew hom had additional equity interest holders,moore believed those companies were simply part of the kombassan conglomerate.when hom faced increasing financial difficulties during the spring of,moore turned to bayram for assistance.
in june,moore wrote bayram several letters,informing him that hom needed cash infusions to pay its creditors,back rents,and expenses she continued to seek such funds from bayram in subsequent months.that fall,moore called bayram to inform him that hom did not have sufficient funds to make payroll and that,absent a cash infusion,hom would likely have to seek bankruptcy protection.shortly thereafter,in november,hom filed a voluntary chapter petition thereby commencing bankruptcy proceedings.the disclosure statement filed in connection with the hom bankruptcy proceedings identified ten hom equity interest holders,including kombassan and the four initial assignees.
in january,kombassan agreed to provide million in operating costs to hom,which kombassan identified as its wholly owned indirect subsidiary.approximately two months later,however,hom ceased its operations,thereby ending its erisa obligation to continue making contributions to the plan.in filings made with the bankruptcy court during the course of the hom bankruptcy proceeding,kombassan made the following representations about its relationship to hom that it controlled the board of directors of hom,that kombassan holds directly or indirectly one hundred percent of the shares of the common stock of hom,and that kombassan is a turkish conglomerate engaged in the retail of,inter alia,women clothing and holds directly or indirectly all of the issued and outstanding stock of hom.in addition,at trial,kombassan general counsel testified that he agreed that hom was wholly owned by kombassan and a kombassan sister company and agreed that kombassan controlled the board of directors.finally,kombassan held itself out to the public as the purchaser of hom,stating on its website that the purchase of hom marked an important step in kombassan holding international strategy.
after the plan was notified that hom had ceased operations and had completely withdr a w n from the plan,the plan informed kombassan that it considered kombassan to be responsible for hom withdrawal liability under erisa common control doctrine.the plan determined that kombassan owed in withdrawal liability,all of which remains outstanding and is the subject of the instant suit.
after a bench trial,the district court found that kombassan was liable for the full of withdrawal liability as the alter ego of the hom equity interest holders and on the basis of judicial estoppel.the district court also ordered kombassan to pay prejudgment interest in the amount of and attorneys fees,to be calculated following appeal.
addressing the issue of judicial estoppel first,the district court held that kombassan myriad representations made to the bankruptcy court that hom was its wholly owned indirect subsidiary were binding on kombassan holding,because the representations were in some manner relied upon or adopted by,in this case,the bankruptcy court.accordingly,applying those representations to the present case,the district court held that kombassan was directly liable for hom withdrawal liability under erisa single employer common control approach to withdrawal liability set forth in erisa section b,codified at b.
the district court next concluded that the alter ego approach to liability provided an alternative and independent basis for liability.noting that the second circuit applies the alter ego approach broadly in the erisa context,the district court held that because kombassan and the assignees were under the common control of bayram and because the assignment of hom stock was done with a common purpose of avoiding problems for kombassan under turkish law,there was sufficient evidence that the assignees were alter egos of kombassan so that kombassan was the real entity in control of hom,notwithstanding the assignment of stock.the district court noted in addition that the representations made in the bankruptcy court further reinforced the application of the alter ego approach because they conveyed unequivocally the message that so far as hom was concerned,these various assignees were simply the handmaidens of kombassan holding and its chairperson.
the court also determined that the plan calculation and ass
