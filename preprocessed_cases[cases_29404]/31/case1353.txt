in this case we hold that state claims are not preempted by the employee retirement income security act erisa if the claims are against a entity medical services provider for declination to provide medical treatment to an erisa plan participant for nonmedical reasons other than plan eligibility or plan administration considerations.
appellant guadalupe benitez complaint against respondent doctors and their employer alleged that the doctors treated her for infertility for an period,but then refused to provide her with additional infertility treatments because of her sexual orientation.she sought damages and injunctive relief against respondents under various state statutory and common law theories.respondents demurred to the complaint,asserting that because benitez received her infertility treatments under an employee health benefit plan,her state claims were preempted by erisa.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed benitez complaint.
we reverse because we conclude erisa does not preempt the state claims alleged by benitez.
factual and procedural background 
because this matter is before us from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend,our factual background accepts as true the facts alleged in the complaint,together with facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.marshall gibson,dunn crutcher th,d.we do not accept as true contentions or conclusions of fact or law.blank kirwan cal d.our factual recitation is largely derived from benitez first amended complaint.
a.the parties 
benitez was employed by sharp mission park and,as a benefit of her employment,was enrolled in the sharp health plan.respondent north coast women care medical group,ncwc contracted with sharp mission health plan sharp to provide obstetrical and gynecological services to sharp participants,including benitez,who lived in north san diego county.respondents christine brody and douglas fenton,both of whom are licensed medical doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology,were employed by ncwc.
b.the alleged misconduct 
benitez began receiving infertility treatments from ncwc and brody in august and continued receiving treatment for the next months,including the period during which benitez was a participant in sharp.benitez told brody that benitez was lesbian but asked brody to keep this information confidential.brody agreed not to include any reference to benitez sexual orientation in her chart brody told benitez that brody had objections to treating homosexuals to help them conceive children by artificial insemination,but nevertheless agreed to provide her medical services,and there would be no problem for another ncwc physician to perform artificial insemination.
during the next eight months,benitez took oral fertility drugs and,under brody instructions,attempted intravaginal insemination at home with donor sperm.these efforts were unsuccessful,and in april brody performed laproscopic surgery on benitez as a prerequisite to intrauterine artificial insemination iui.during the week of may,benitez twice visited ncwc for monitoring and preparation for the iui.on the second visit,brody told benitez we ready to go,and then left the examination room to make arrangements for another physician to perform the iui.however,when brody returned she stated she had bad news california required a tissue license to inseminate sperm,and ncwc did not have that license.accordingly,instead of receiving the iui scheduled for the following day,benitez was instructed to again attempt intravaginal insemination.
on july,benitez visited brody and received a negative pregnancy test.brody encouraged benitez to make arrangements for the iui,and was told to inform brody as soon as benitez menstrual cycle resumed so benitez could timely resume taking clomid a fertility drug.on july,benitez menstrual cycle began and she telephoned ncwc to obtain a refill of her clomid prescription.the receptionist told benitez that brody was on vacation and that benitez request would be relayed to brody colleague,fenton.however,benitez later received a telephone call from shirley at ncwc who stated she was sorry but fenton would not be able to help benitez with the procedure or to authorize benitez to refill the prescription.benitez demanded to speak to fenton.benitez later received a telephone call from fenton,who stated that because of the beliefs held by brody and other unidentified members of the staff,he would be unable to help benitez.he explained that brody and some of her staff were uncomfortable with benitez sexual orientation and that,because of their beliefs,benitez would not be treated fairly at ncwc and would not receive timely care from staff members holding those beliefs.
on august,benitez filed a complaint with the california department of fair employment and housing dfeh.brody apparently learned of the complaint because she contacted benitez and tried to convince her to drop the complaint,telling her it was ruining brody career,causing her stress,and making it difficult for her to work.when benitez told brody that fenton could have performed the procedure because he said he had no objection to treating homosexuals,brody replied in essence that fenton would not have said he had no problem because he attended the same church as did brody.thereafter,benitez asked a dfeh investigator to inform brody not to contact her further.
benitez obtained authorization from sharp to obtain infertility treatment from kettel,an physician kettel performed several iui on benitez,which did not result in pregnancy,and thereafter performed in vitro fertilization that succeeded in impregnating benitez.
c.the trial court proceedings 
on july,benitez filed her complaint,which alleged claims against respondents violation of the unruh civil rights act hereafter act,breach of contract,breach of implied contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligence,negligent infliction of emotional distress,intentional infliction of emotional distress,deceit and fraud,tortious interference with prospective advantage,and invasion of privacy.respondents filed a general demurrer to the complaint on the sole ground that benitez claims arose from and directly related to her employee health benefit plan and were therefore preempted by erisa.the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
benitez then filed her first amended complaint,which added the allegation that respondents were not erisa entities,and reasserted the same claims against respondents respondents again demurred,asserting that the gravamen of her claims was that respondents improperly refused to provide her with medical services available under her employee health benefit plan,and therefore her claims were preempted by erisa regardless of whether she mentioned her employee health benefit plan in her claims.the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,dismissed benitez complaint and entered judgment in favor of respondents benitez timely appealed.
the issue is whether benitez state law claims against respondents are preempted by federal law because they relate to an employee benefit plan subject to erisa.respondents argue the claims are preempted because they are rooted in respondents decision to deny benitez benefits to which she is entitled under an erisa plan.benitez argues erisa preemption applies only when the state law claims are based on the denial of erisa benefits and made against defendants whose actionable conduct occurred while acting in an erisa capacity,and neither predicate to preemption is present here.
a.the erisa scheme and preemption 
erisa is a comprehensive federal law designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee pension and benefit plans.shaw delta air lines,d.as a part of this integrated regulatory system,congress enacted various safeguards to preclude abuse and to secure the rights and expectations that erisa confers.a prominent safeguard under erisa is united states code section,subdivision a hereafter section,an expansive preemption provision that preempts any and all state laws insofar as they relate to any employee benefit plan mcclendon,d.
in shaw delta air lines,supra,d,the united states supreme court construed erisa preemption clause expansively by interpreting the relates to language as preempting any claim under state law that has a connection with or reference to an employee benefit plan governed by erisa.however,more recent decisions of the united states supreme court have narrowed the preemptive scope of erisa.in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d travelers,the court recognized at page.that i f relate to were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,then for all practical purposes would never run its course,for r eally,universally,relations stop nowhere,james,roderick hudson xli new york,world classics.the travelers court stated,o ur past cases have recognized that the supremacy clause,art.vi,may entail of state law either by express provision,by implication,or by a conflict between federal and state law.citations.and yet,despite the variety of these opportunities for federal preeminence,we have never assumed lightly that congress has derogated state regulation,but instead have addressed claims of with the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law.id.at.travelers,recognizing that the limiting phrase,insofar as they relate to,contained in section,does not give us much help in delineating the limitations of erisa preemption id.at,decided that it must look beyond the unhelpful text of section and look instead to the objectives of the erisa statute id.at.to assure that the phrase relate to is considered practically and not stretched indeterminately.id.at.accordingly,travelers developed new tests narrowing the scope of erisa preemption of state laws 
travelers concluded that erisa preempts only those state laws having a connection with or reference to employee benefit plans that affect the nature of the plans and the objectives of erisa.travelers,supra,at.travelers noted that the objective of congress in passing erisa was to insure national uniformity in the administration of the employee benefit plans it covers.id.at.accord,california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d.accordingly,travelers sought to avoid preemption of state laws having only a tenuous,remote,or peripheral connection with covered plans,as is the case with many laws of general applicability.travelers,at.by narrowing the scope of erisa preemption to state laws that interfere with national uniformity in the administration of the employee benefit plans,travelers sought to enforce the legislative purpose of erisa without unnecessarily infringing on matters subject to traditional state regulation.
in pegram herdrich,d,the court considered the obverse issue whether erisa created a federal claim for breach of fiduciary duty against a medical practitioner whose treatment decisions,traditionally actionable under state malpractice law,had the incidental effect of granting or denying a patient the benefits of medical treatment under an erisa plan.the court distinguished pure eligibility decisions which depend on the plan coverage of a particular condition or procedure from pure treatment decisions which are those medical determinations of the appropriate response to the patient condition id.at,and concluded that erisa regulates claims based on pure unmixed eligibility decisions but was not intended to federalize malpractice litigation.id.at.under pegram the scope of erisa preemption is not determined by whether the conduct of a person employed to provide services under a plan has adversely affected a plan beneficiary interests,but instead is whether the conduct was an decision regulated by erisa.
benitez claims are not preempted by erisa 
benitez act and common law claims are based on the allegation that respondents refused to provide her medical treatment for reasons unrelated to her eligibility for that treatment under her erisa plan.in closely analogous contexts,courts in other jurisdictions have concluded that under travelers state law claims against medical practitioners based on omissions or commissions unrelated to eligibility or administrative determinations are not preempted by erisa even though the patient was referred to the physician under an erisa plan.
in pryzbowski healthcare,cir,the plaintiff was a patient enrolled in a health maintenance organization hmo under an erisa plan.she sought treatment from her primary care provider the pcp,who had contracted with the hmo to provide medical services to the hmo participants.she suffered injuries as the result of delay in approving treatment by an physician,and she sued the hmo for delaying the authorization and the pcp for in essence medical malpractice.the court concluded that,under pegram,supra,the preemption analysis must distinguish claims involving improper handling of eligibility decisions from claims involving improper treatment decisions.the former type of claim challenges the administration of or eligibility for benefits under an erisa plan and is therefore subject to erisa preemption.however,the latter class of claims contests the quality of the treatment and may be the subject of a claim under state law.pryzbowski,at.pryzbowski concluded the plaintiff claim against the hmo was preempted because it involved mishandling of an eligibility decision.id.at.however,pryzbowski concluded the claims against the pcp,which challenged the quality of care rendered by the pcp,were not preempted by section.id.at.
a similar rationale was applied in roach mail handlers ben.plan cir,in which the court evaluated a preemption statute,subd.m containing language analogous to erisa preemption language.the issue in roach was whether a state law malpractice claim against a preferred provider was preempted.the roach court,relying on the rationales articulated in travelers and pegram,as well as the statement in rush prudential hmo,moran,d that there is a presumption against a congressional intent to preempt the quintessentially standards of reasonable medical care.at,reasoned that the courts have created a divide between claims based on a denial of benefits,which are preempted,and claims based on medical malpractice,which are not.citations.we believe this division protects the federal interest of uniformity of plan interpretation and preserves the traditional state interest in the quality of medical care.accordingly,we hold that denial of benefit claims are preempted but malpractice claims are not.roach,at.the roach court also rejected the defendants argument that preemption applied merely because the plaintiff malpractice claim references her benefit plan in explaining why plaintiff contacted the defendant medical practitioner.but referencing the existence of a benefit plan in a state law not endanger the uniform interpretation of that plan.citations.id.at.
finally,in bui american telephone telegraph,cir,the plaintiff alleged a claim for malpractice against a medical provider hired by his employer plan to provide emergency medical services.the court held erisa preemption turns on the gravamen of the defendant conduct.if the actionable conduct is the denial of benefits based on administrative decisions,erisa preemption applies if the claim alleges other conduct,state standards are not preempted.id.at.bui specifically considered a claim against the medical provider based on the failure to provide a covered service emergency evacuation in a timely manner.the court concluded that if the reason the service was not provided was because of delays,erisa would preempt the claim,but if the failure to provide the service was based on decisions made by the service provider in its medical capacity,erisa would not preempt the claim.id.at.
these cases reflect an emerging recognition that erisa plans do not provide medical treatment,but instead provide employees with economic benefits in the form of coverage for all or part of the costs of treatment.because erisa regulates the administration of benefits under its plans,but does not purport to federalize the law governing relationships among every person who might ultima
