this is another effort by central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund to collect interim withdrawal liability payments,this time from bomar national,an indiana corporation.this action was brought in the northern district of illinois,pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,as amended by the pension plan amendments act of mppaa,et.the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff central states,and we now affirm.
central states,not a stranger to litigation,is a pension plan within the meaning of and a of erisa,a.defendants bomar national,dispatch,and b m properties,are corporations organized and existing under indiana law,with their principal places of business in indiana.as of march,bomar owned percent of the stock of and b bomar,and b m are therefore a single employer within the meaning of b of erisa for the remainder of this opinion,they will be referred to collectively as.until its permanent cessation of operations,provided regulated,transportation services in interstate and intrastate commerce.pursuant to several collective bargaining agreements to which it was a party,made pension contributions to central states for its drivers and mechanics domiciled in marion,indiana.the most recent of these agreements expired on march.according to,it began to meet with union representatives to negotiate a successor agreement as the expiration date approached during the negotiations,advised the union representatives that the license plates of its trucks would expire on march,and that because of the cost would not be able to purchase new license plates until a new labor agreement had been negotiated.without the new license plates,would be forced to cease operations.thus informed its drivers that if no agreement was reached before march,there could be a short shut down of operations until the vehicles were.no agreement materialized.the drivers were instructed by to return their equipment to the marion domicile by march.after,when a scheduled negotiations session was canceled,there were no further communications between and the union representatives until november.at that time,a meeting was scheduled for december,and after the meeting ceased all operations permanently.
central states determined that,on or about march,had ceased permanently to have an obligation to contribute to the pension fund,thus effecting a complete withdrawal within the meaning of section of erisa.it based this determination on information from a union representative that was no longer in business and that its bargaining unit employees were no longer employed.when an employer withdraws from a plan,it incurs withdrawal liability under the mppaa.see.to collect what is due,a pension fund must determine the amount of withdrawal liability owed by a withdrawing employer,and send the employer a notice and demand for payment of that amount,b.central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund ditello,cir.thus,central states issued a notice of withdrawal liability and demand for payment,which received on about june.claims that this action was premature,because it had not withdrawn as of june.rather,it had temporarily ceased operations on march due to the labor dispute,but did not effect a complete withdrawal until december,when it agreed to a permanent cessation of operations during its final meeting with union representatives.
central states filed a complaint in the district court in january,alleging that incurred withdrawal liability as of march.claiming that owed it delinquent interim withdrawal liability payments,central states sought past due amounts,interest,attorneys fees,costs and liquidated damages,as well as an order directing to make all future interim withdrawal liability payments.in response,claimed that central states had notified it of its withdrawal liability prematurely,and therefore was not entitled to receive interim payments.
the district court concluded that,even when an employer disputes the fact that it had withdrawn at the time the pension fund claims,it is still liable for interim withdrawal liability payments.the merits of the dispute regarding withdrawal liability,including the date of its incurrence,must be referred to arbitration.see a.but,the court concluded,even when such an arbitration has not yet occurred,the employer remains liable to make interim payments.of course,if the arbitrator finds that there is no withdrawal liability,interim payments may be refunded.the court here ordered to make all past due interim withdrawal liability payments,all future payments according to the schedule determined by central states,costs,attorneys fees and liquidated damages.appeals.
the mppaa imposes withdrawal liability on an employer withdrawing from a multiemployer pension plan.see.congress wanted to ensure that withdrawing employer s would not leave a plan with vested pension obligations that were only partially funded.central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund bell transit,cir citing robbins lady baltimore foods,cir.thus,employers who withdraw from pension plans must still pay their proportionate share of the unfunded vested benefits.a,b.this withdrawal liability ensures that the financial burden of the employees vested pension benefits will not be shifted to the other employers in the plan and,ultimately,to the pension benefit guaranty corporation,which insures such benefits.bell transit,at quoting central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund slotky,cir.in order to collect withdrawal liability,a pension fund must determine the amount of withdrawal liability owed by a withdrawing employer,and send the employer a notice and demand for payment of that amount,b.central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund ditello,cir.employers who disagree with the assessment of withdrawal liability may first ask the plan to review its assessment,and then may initiate arbitration.see b,a.however,the initiation of arbitration proceedings does not suspend the employer obligation to pay in accordance with the schedule of payments assessed by the plan.bell transit,at citing jaspan certified industries.rather,the mppaa establishes a pay now,dispute later scheme,under which an employer must make interim payments until liability is finally determined.see central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund nitehawk express,cir.specifically,the mppaa provides that w ithdrawal liability shall be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor notwithstanding any request for review or appeal of determinations of the amount of such liability or schedule.c.this provision serves the dual purpose of reducing the risk that an employer will not pay and of encouraging speedy adjudication by requiring immediate arbitration before the courts become involved in the merits of the dispute.see trustees of chicago truck drivers central transport,cir.
first challenges the claimed timing of its withdrawal and asserts that central states may only assess liability after withdrawal from the pension fund.argues that congressional intent and the statutory language establish an intent that no funds be collected from the employer until withdrawal has taken place.points to a,which provides that i f an employer withdraws from a multiemployer plan in a complete withdrawal or a partial withdrawal,then the employer is liable to the plan in the amount determined under this part to be the withdrawal liability.attempts to draw further support from,which provides that the plan sponsor shall determine the amount of,issue notice of,and collect withdrawal liability w hen an employer withdraws from a multiemployer plan.it is,of course,true that withdrawal liability does not arise until a withdrawal has occurred,but whether and when there has been a withdrawal is part of the merits,which,under the mppaa,must be resolved in arbitration.contends that the language of the act makes it clear that there must be actual and uncontested withdrawal from a plan before an employer can issue any notice of withdrawal interim liability.this is incorrect.such a policy would be directly at odds with the mandate of the mppaa that,until the merits of a dispute about withdrawal are decided,an employer is liable for interim payments subject,of course,to refund if he prevails.
next argument is unavailing for similar reasons.contends that,because it was involved in a labor dispute during the relevant time period,it had not yet withdrawn and was therefore not liable for withdrawal payments.the mppaa does delineate certain exceptions to the definition of complete withdrawal.for example,of the act provides that an employer shall not be considered to have withdrawn solely because an employer suspends contributions under the plan during a labor dispute involving its employees.but whether situation fits within this exception is not for this court to decide any dispute between an employer and the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan concerning a determination made under sections through of this title must be resolved through arbitration.a.the question before us is not whether met the criteria for the labor dispute exception,thus entitling it to refuse to make withdrawal liability payments,but whether,when arbitration of such a matter is pending and unresolved,must make interim withdrawal liability payments.arbitration has been sought,the arbitrator finds that was involved in a labor dispute from march,to december,so that it fits within the will be deemed not liable for withdrawal payments during that time period.but for now,must continue to pay in accordance with the schedule of payments provided by central states.see bell transit,at.our holding in bell transit is mppaa dictates a pay now,dispute later procedure in situations like the one before us.see see also central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund lady baltimore foods,cir t he employer may not defer withdrawal liability payments pending arbitration.if he wins the arbitration he will get back whatever he has paid but the rule is pay first,arbitrate after.
next step is to argue that there are exceptions to the pay now,dispute later procedure under the mppaa.one exception articulated by this court is that we may excuse interim payments pending arbitration if the employer can show both that the pension fund lacks a colorable claim and that the employer will suffer severe financial hardship if compelled to make interim payments.see trustees of the chicago truck drivers,helpers warehouse workers union indep.pension fund rentar,cir central transport,at robbins mcnicholas transportation,cir.wisely chooses not to argue that its case fits within this frivolous claim exception.but it unwisely contends that a second exception outlined in central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund hunt truck lines,cir,governs.
in hunt truck lines,we affirmed a district court determination that it could not order an employer to make interim payments with respect to its withdrawal liability.see at.there,unlike here,the parties agreed that the pension fund assessment of withdrawal liability was premature.both this court and the district court concluded that,because the parties agreed that the withdrawal liability assessment was premature,the court could decline to award the plaintiff interim payments.hunt truck lines did not carve out a second exception to the mppaa,but rather addressed a limited factual scenario in which an award of interim liability payments would be senseless the parties agreed that the notice was premature.the parties in hunt truck lines had agreed on a withdrawal date,and the withdrawal date was subsequent to the fund issuance of notice and demand for payment.thus,we were able to avoid reading the mppaa to allow funds to arbitrarily assess withdrawal liability without undercutting the statute dispute resolution mechanism.id.at.in other words,because it was obvious that the assessment of liability was premature,we were not undermining the mppaa by refusing to award interim payments.we could not award payments that the fund entitled to collect.
would have us interpret hunt truck lines as fashioning a new exception to the pay now,dispute later scheme of the mppaa.but the new exception,based on a premature claim,would be exactly the same as the frivolous claim exception.the claim in hunt truck lines was not just premature it was also frivolous.this court was careful to note that if the fund could not honestly plead that it assessed the employer liability after withdrawal,it could not enforce an assessment that was not envisioned by the statute.id.at.thus,hunt truck lines represents the very unique situation in which the pension fund has conceded that its assessment of liability is premature.the pension fund has not made such a concession here.thus,even if we were to create a hunt truck lines premature claim exception to complement the frivolous claim exception which we decline to do,would not fit within it.
makes a feeble effort to conform with hunt truck lines narrow factual scenario by arguing that the pension fund admitted,through procedural errors,that had not withdrawn at the end of march.
first,argues that central states effectively admitted,in its response to statement of material facts,that the withdrawal date was december.the background for this is that the local rules of the district court require that parties moving for summary judgment serve and file a statement of material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.local rule a.the opposing party must then file a response containing any disagreement,as well as a reference to evidence supporting that disagreement.local rule b a.rule b b provides that a ll material facts set forth in the statement required of the moving party will be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the statement of the opposing party.in response to paragraphs and of statement of material facts,which are intended to support argument regarding the timing of its withdrawal,central states asserted that the facts recited were irrelevant and were unknown to central states because discovery on those issues had not commenced in the arbitration proceeding.these facts detailed the status of labor negotiations,such as communications between and the union representatives communications between and its drivers assessment of the progress of the negotiations and the scheduling of meetings among the parties.central states failure to flatly deny the existence of these facts,argues,constitutes an admission that central states withdrawal liability assessment was premature.
this argument is unconvincing.central states reply does not constitute an admission.local rule a of the northern district of illinois requires moving parties to file a statement of material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue and that entitle the moving party to a judgment as a matter of law.the question at issue is not when withdrew,but rather whether there is a dispute as to when it withdrew.central states response asserting that the facts were irrelevant is sufficient because the local rule requires a moving party to submit material facts.in this motion for summary judgment while arbitration was pending,the only information material to the assessment of interim payments was whether the parties disagreed as to the withdrawal date.the facts asserted in paragraphs of filing go to the merits,which must be resolved by the arbitrator and not by the district court.because the facts cited by were not material,central states failure to deny them,but instead to assert their irrelevance,was not an admission.to characterize central states response in this manner as an admission would be ludicrous.argument is therefore without merit.
second effort to create an agreement on the withdrawal date is premised on an argument that central states denial of paragraph of statement of material facts was legally insufficient,and therefore paragraph is admitted.paragraph reads 
the parties continued negotiations after march.did not permanently cease its operations and did not permanently cease to have an obligation to contribute to the pension fund on march.
