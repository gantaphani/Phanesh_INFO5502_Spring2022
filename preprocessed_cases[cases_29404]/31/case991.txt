this case comes to us following a bench trial of randall koons claims for severance benefits under a b and for interference with his ability to attain such benefits under.the trial court found for the defendants,the aventis integration separation plan for hmr associates the plan and aventis pharmaceuticals,aventis,on both claims and entered judgment accordingly.koons appeals,claiming the trial court erred in finding that he was not entitled to severance benefits and that he was not terminated by aventis with the intent to interfere with his ability to claim severance benefits.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
randall koons had worked for aventis and its predecessor companies since.he was terminated on october,from his position as head of security.aventis was in the midst of reorganizing its corporate structure and operations as part of a merger,which included moving koons kansas city office to new jersey.as part of the reorganization,it provided a severance plan to associates,including koons,whom the move affected.after koons termination,aventis refused to pay koons any severance benefits.the reasons cited by aventis for koons termination and its refusal to pay severance benefits under the plan were violations of company policy that koons committed in the months preceding the termination.
by all indications,koons performance had been generally positive until near the end of his employment.the record is replete with praise and favorable performance evaluations.in october,koons first learned that his kansas city office was going to be moved to new jersey.because koons did not want to relocate to new jersey,he and mark shaw,his supervisor at the time,established his end date as december.koons was made aware of the severance benefits that were available.
jan kneib and kurt waier worked in the security division of aventis under koons supervision.kneib was also unwilling to locate to new jersey and established an end date of december.however,in march,because the transition budget was running million per month in the red,shaw moved kneib end date up to april.koons objected and voiced his concerns not only to shaw,but also to among others jerry belle,the president of north american operations for aventis.this upset shaw,who felt koons had departed from protocol and gone over his head.notwithstanding koons objection,shaw ended kneib employment on april.after her termination,koons allowed kneib to retain her cell phone.waier remained in aventis employ.
in may,shaw hired brian keller as koons replacement.keller immediate supervisor was shaw.after keller was hired,koons responsibilities were limited to security at the kansas city site.
in june,keller met with koons and urged koons to retire because there was nothing left for him to do.koons refused,but the two agreed on a new end.keller and koons also agreed that koons would work from home,rather than coming into the office.keller sent a letter to koons,dated july,memorializing this agreement and reminding koons to contact jerry johnson,the human resources manager,in early november regarding his severance pay.this letter also advised koons that he should continue to be available through his cell phone.a memorandum sent from human resources to koons one week later confirmed the changed end date and outlined koons anticipated severance benefits.
through july and august,koons worked from home and came into the office on a regular basis.koons was pursuing a career while still on aventis payroll.shaw,johnson and keller were all aware of this and approved.in august,koons charged minutes to his cell phone despite the fact he was doing little aventis work.waier received the august invoice and noticed the high number of minutes attributed to koons phone and that kneib was also using a phone.he forwarded the invoice to keller,noting his observations.around this time,johnson also notified keller of complaints he had received from individuals who had gotten notices in the mail of koons status as a agent.koons had used a list of associate addresses,which aventis had marked as confidential,to mail out these advertisements.
keller contacted shaw regarding koons use when he received the invoice.he later went to see shaw and told him of the kneib situation,showing him the invoice.shaw had also received a complaint from an employee who received one of koons mailings.
at some point,johnson investigated the propriety of using cell phones for personal use within the security division.he contacted steve krohne,who was koons supervisor and the head of security until early,and waier.each stated that the personal use of cell phones was permissible,so long as within reason.according to johnson,he kept notes of the investigation on his computer and forwarded them to new jersey in paper form.aventis was unable to locate this document and the electronic media upon which it was stored was destroyed.
keller and johnson met with koons in early october and questioned koons about what they had discovered.koons offered no explanation and contended that all of his actions were allowed under company policy.
johnson,keller,shaw,and kathleen clever aventis corporate counsel met on october,and discussed the koons situation.by all indications,those at the meeting understood that koons would not be entitled to severance benefits if he was terminated.the decision to terminate koons was made and his employment ended october,approximately one month before his november end date.
aventis cited three instances of misconduct in a service letter to koons explaining why he was terminated.this letter is required at the employee request under missouri law.see.west.koons later requested his severance benefits.aventis responded in a letter from clever stating that aventis would not pay severance benefits given the circumstances of koons termination.
at trial,aventis adduced evidence concerning the various policies that it thought koons had violated.first,there was an unwritten policy concerning reasonable personal use of cell phones.and there was a written business conduct policy which addressed the permissible use of aventis communications systems.the written policy stated,while it is recognized that associates will occasionally use the systems for personal communications,it is expected that such exceptions will be kept to a minimum aventis concluded koons personal use violated these policies.and,by allowing kneib to retain her cell phone and make excessive personal calls,aventis concluded koons had further violated company policy.second,the business conduct policy admonished employees to avoid conflicts of interest and stated a conflict may exist if y ou use the company confidential information for your personal benefit.aventis concluded koons use of the confidential associate address list violated this policy.shaw also cited written policies concerning standards of business conduct and recordkeeping and data integrity,and an unwritten policy prohibiting acts of dishonesty or falsification,as having been violated by koons conduct.
the trial court found koons had been terminated for violating company policy,which,under the terms of the plan,made him ineligible for benefits.the trial court also concluded that koons termination for misconduct was a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for his discharge,and,because koons had not shown that this reason was a pretext for an intent to interfere with koons severance benefits,his claim under also failed.
ii.discussion 
entitlement to severance benefits 
the trial court conducted a de novo review of koons claim for severance benefits.that standard of review is unchallenged here and we express no opinion on its use.after a bench trial in an erisa case in which the trial court conducts a de novo review,we review the trial court factfinding for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.donatelli home ins,cir.a.
koons entitlement to severance benefits turns on both questions of fact and of law.the trial court found that koons was terminated for violating company policy.under the terms of the plan,as construed by the trial court,those who were terminated for violating company policy were ineligible for severance benefits.koons challenges the trial court finding that he violated company policy and its construction of the plan terms.
we review the trial court interpretation of the plan de novo.melvin yale indus,cir.the plan description states 
a participant is eligible for a separation package if the participant employment is terminated by the company as a direct result of the elimination of his or her position due to the company reorganization and such termination is not a direct result of the associate voluntary resignation,death,disability,unsatisfactory performance or violation of company policy.
koons argues that if he was terminated for violating company policy,he should still be eligible for severance benefits under the plan because the summary plan description spd does not contain the same language.the spd states that eligible associates include those who are terminated as a result of the reorganization and goes on to state 
note in order to receive benefits under the separation plan,eligible associates must perform satisfactorily during the notice period 
koons argument rests on the notion of conflicting plan documents.that is,where an spd conflicts with the terms of another plan document,it has often been said that the spd governs,jensen sipco,cir.this general rule,though,is qualified.specifically,this rule of construction does not apply when the plan document is specific and the spd is silent on a particular matter.id.and,if the spd does conflict with other plan documents,a participant must generally show that he relied on or was prejudiced by the spd description of the plan benefits.dodson woodmen of the world life ins.soc y,cir.reliance or prejudice,however,is not required if the spd is not faulty.palmisano allina health,cir.
we see no conflict between these two descriptions of the plan eligibility requirements.on the issue of whether being terminated for a violation of company policy is a condition of eligibility,the plan description includes such a condition,while the spd is silent,as it is with death,disability,and resignation.
even if we define the relevant issue more broadly,the outcome does not change.koons claims the issue of eligibility was addressed in both the spd and the plan description.he argues that,to the extent the spd stated fewer eligibility requirements,it should govern.as support,he cites to,claiming the spd was inadequate.this regulation provides that an spd for an employee benefit welfare plan like the one involved here must include a statement of the conditions pertaining to eligibility to receive benefits.id.at j.and the spd must contain a statement clearly identifying circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial,loss,or forfeiture of any benefits that a participant or beneficiary might otherwise reasonably expect the plan to provide on the basis of the description of benefits required by paragraph j.id.at l.these regulations clarify the statutory spd requirements of.
aventis spd likely violates erisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder.this makes the spd faulty.marolt alliant techsystems,cir.neither erisa nor the regulations state the consequences of issuing such a faulty spd.our cases,though,have clearly established that a claimant can only recover under a faulty spd if he can show reliance on or prejudice from the faulty plan description.see palmisano,at collecting cases.koons testified that he knew from the plan description,despite the spd purportedly to the contrary,that if he was terminated for violating company policy,he would not be entitled to severance benefits.the fact he did not refrain from his misconduct despite this knowledge,may indicate he did not know his conduct violated company policy the existence of which we address below,but it in no way establishes reliance on or prejudice from the faulty spd.
thus,under the terms of the plan,koons would be entitled to severance benefits if he was terminated as a direct result of the elimination of his position due to the company reorganization and his termination was not a direct result of his violation s of company policy.
koons was terminated.and his termination likely would not have occurred had aventis not reorganized and relocated the security division to new jersey.the fighting issue is whether koons violated company policy.
the trial court concluded that koons had violated company policy by allowing jan kneib to retain her cell phone after her employment was terminated,by using his cell phone for an inordinate amount of personal calls,and by using a confidential list of associate addresses to mail out promotional material concerning his endeavors.we review this factfinding exercise for clear error.donatelli,at.
there is abundant evidence in the record in support of the trial court findings,at least with regard to koons personal use of his cell phone and his unauthorized personal use of the associate address list.as to each,a reasonable factfinder could conclude that there was a policy in place and that the policy was violated.therefore,we can not conclude that the trial court clearly erred in finding that koons violated company policy.
as to aventis disagreement with koons decision to allow jan kneib to retain her cell phone after her termination date,we believe the record only establishes that koons did not exceed his authority in making this decision.aventis allowed various employees to retain cell phones.and koons himself was allowed to retain his cell phone after he began working from home.while each situation does not present the same circumstances as kneib,each does show the propriety of the business necessity that koons felt justified his decision with regard to stay in touch with those individuals who are no longer around and who have knowledge that is useful to the company.while this finding may be clearly erroneous,the trial court factfinding with regard to the other violations of company policy is not,and those violations adequately support the result reached.we therefore conclude that the trial court properly held that koons had violated company policy.
koons claims at various points in his brief that the decision to terminate him was arbitrary and capricious or otherwise unreasonable.we pause to note that we are not charged with evaluating the wisdom of the particular employment action.see hutson mcdonnell douglas,cir.erisa,through its protection of certain benefits,is not a mechanism through which general claims of wrongful termination can be brought.whether the decision to terminate koons was arbitrary and capricious is irrelevant to whether koons was entitled to benefits under the plan.the ability to claim benefits is set by the plan terms and,here,koons was simply not entitled to benefits because the trial court found his termination,however unfair or unwise,was for violating company policy.
interference with the attainment of severance benefits 
a certain sort of claim,however,can be brought through erisa.erisa,states that it is unlawful for any person to discharge or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan.to succeed,koons had to prove that aventis terminated his employment with the specific intent to interfere with his severance benefits.jefferson vickers,cir.this specific intent is present where the employee future or present entitlement to protected benefits is a motivating factor in the employer decision.see regel,cir.a factor is motivating if it can be said that it has a determinative influence on the outcome.reeves sanderson plumbing prods,d quotation omitted.in other words,koons had to show that he would not have been terminated had he not been entitled to benefits 
because this standard of causation is an inquiry concerning the employer intent,the mcdonnell douglas framework applies.jefferson,at.on appeal from a factfinder verdict though,the three stages of mcdonnell douglas fade and we focus on the ultimate question of whether the plaintiff carried his burden of proof as to the employer intent.see mary honor ctr.hicks,d t rial cour
