we are asked principally to determine whether the,nancy barrs,was entitled under erisa,et,to notice of certain changes made by her,james barrs,to two life insurance policies maintained by him through his employer,ford aerospace communications ford.ford eventually became part of lockheed martin lockheed.the facts are undisputed except as otherwise indicated.
pursuant to a separation agreement executed by the barrses in september and adopted by maryland court decree in december,james barrs promised to make nancy barrs the irrevocable beneficiary of all of his life insurance policies.included in the list of policies were a basic policy and an optional policy issued by john hancock mutual life insurance company hancock and administered by ford as part of its employee benefits plan.the decree also required james barrs to make all premium payments on both policies.
in february,the barrses informed ford of the decree and executed a document provided by ford which assigned to nancy barrs the absolute right to designate the beneficiary under both policies.on february,ford acknowledged receipt of the assignment and returned a copy to nancy barrs at her existing maryland address with a letter stating that her husband file had been flagged for this information and promising to notify her within hours by registered mail if his employment was terminated.hancock later endorsed the assignment,and nancy barrs then sent hancock a form designating herself as primary beneficiary of both policies.
loral western development labs loral acquired ford in october and replaced the previous hancock policies with new hancock basic and optional policies issued to loral,which retained the status of all irrevocable assignees under the old policies.then,in january,loral replaced the hancock optional policy with one offered by connecticut general life insurance company cigna while retaining the hancock basic policy.james barrs,as a plan participant,received notice of the change he then applied for the new cigna policy,designating his elaine as beneficiary.no notice of the change in policy or the new beneficiary designation was sent to nancy barrs.
james barrs was terminated from loral on january.upon his termination,he opted to continue the cigna optional policy with elaine now his wife as beneficiary but declined to continue the hancock basic policy.the next business day,february,loral sent to nancy barrs maryland address a letter notifying her of her former husband termination and indicating that she could convert the hancock basic policy to an individual policy within days.the letter was sent by certified mail rather than registered mail as promised in the february,letter in any event,nancy barrs never received the letter because she had moved to florida in june.
nancy barrs did not discover that her former husband had been terminated until a conversation with her daughter nearly two months later,in march.when nancy barrs confronted james barrs about the policies,he falsely assured her that he had continued both policies and kept her as the beneficiary.relying on these assurances,nancy barrs did not seek to verify the status of either policy with either loral or hancock until after james barrs death on april.only then did she discover that the hancock optional policy had been replaced by the cigna policy listing elaine barrs as the beneficiary and that the hancock basic policy had not been continued after james barrs termination.
in april,nancy barrs brought suit in federal court in massachusetts against both hancock and loral loral merged into lockheed,which has assumed the defense of the case.excluding counts later dropped,nancy barrs complaint sought payment of benefits under both policies,a b damages for failure to provide requested plan information,id.c and equitable redress for defendants breach of their fiduciary duty,id.a.in rulings unchallenged on appeal,the district court granted summary judgment to hancock and lockheed on the first two claims 
the district court also held that nancy barrs fiduciary breach claim against hancock was precluded because she had an express remedy against hancock for denial of benefits under a b nancy barrs does not contest this ruling in her initial brief on appeal,instead arguing only that hancock is liable as a,see id.we need not deal with this claim given nancy barrs failure to address the district court independent and sufficient ground for barring the fiduciary duty claim against hancock.see keeler putnam fiduciary trust,cir.
this left open nancy barrs claim for breach of fiduciary duty against lockheed based on its failure to notify her when the hancock optional policy was replaced by the cigna policy and,separately,its failure to assure her receipt of notice of her husband termination.on summary judgment,the district court held that lockheed had no obligation to provide nancy barrs with notice of either event,beyond its affirmative promise in the february,letter.after a bench trial,it held that the company had substantially fulfilled this promise by its certified mailing to nancy barrs maryland address.
nancy barrs now appeals,challenging the district court ruling on both of her fiduciary obligation claims against lockheed and on her claim that the company did not comply with its promise to notify her by registered mail further,she contests the district court finding at the bench trial that the company did not receive a change of address card.we review de novo the district court determinations on summary judgment its factual findings at the bench trial are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.educ.ass ret.bd.of the employees ret.system,cir.
the optional policy.nancy barrs first argues that lockheed had a fiduciary duty to inform her of the substitution of the cigna optional policy for the hancock optional policy.the cigna policy was not covered by the divorce decree or the assignment form,so lockheed change in policy effectively eliminated any rights she had as an of the hancock policy.nancy barrs argues,on several different theories,that as an she had the same right as her husband,the plan participant,to be informed of a change that could result in her loss of benefits.
at the threshold,lockheed argues that such a claim is not permitted by the enforcement provision invoked by nancy barrs,namely,a,which allows only suits seeking other appropriate equitable relief.traditionally a court of equity could require a fiduciary to pay damages to repair a breach of trust.see,scott fratcher,iii scott on trusts.but in mertens hewitt associates,d,the supreme court read the statutory phrase more narrowly as limited to forms of relief traditionally viewed as equitable such as mandamus or injunctions and as excluding money damages.id.at.
the district court said that nancy barrs claim could be viewed as one for equitable reinstatement of beneficiary status,langdon maryland cas,in the alternative,nancy barrs says that she is entitled to equitable restitution.there are problems with both to the latter,see life annuity ins.knudson,d but we need not definitively resolve the mertens remedy issue.this is so because we conclude that no breach of fiduciary duty occurred.
it is common ground that the life insurance policies at issue were part of a welfare benefit plan governed by erisa.a.lockheed,as the named administrator of the plan,is a fiduciary under erisa.id.a.and both sides agree that nancy barrs has standing as a prospective beneficiary under erisa,id,to enforce whatever fiduciary duty may be owed to a beneficiary.id,a.the disputed issue as to the optional policy is whether erisa obligated lockheed to inform nancy barrs of the replacement of the hancock optional policy by the cigna policy.
in arguing that erisa does impose such a duty,nancy barrs employs three different theories.first,erisa imposes specified obligations on fiduciaries,mostly regarding the management of plan assets,and the disclosure of general plan information,id.among the latter is a requirement that the plan administrator publish within a specified period all modifications and changes to the plan to each participant,and each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan.id.b.nancy barrs briefly argues that this last provision entitled her to notice of the switch from hancock to cigna.
it does not.nancy barrs was not receiving benefits at the time of the change,and so section b does not appear to apply to her.in any event,the department of labor has power under a to exempt welfare benefit opposed to pension section b reporting and disclosure requirements,and it has by regulation made the requirement inapplicable to beneficiaries under welfare benefit plans.a b.
nancy barrs next argues in her brief that,even without a specific erisa directive,plan administrators have a general fiduciary obligation to communicate facts affecting the interest of a beneficiary which the fiduciary knows the beneficiary does not know and which the beneficiary needs to know in order to protect her interest.specifically,she contends that the obvious intent of the divorce decree was to maintain her interest in her husband life insurance,and thus lockheed had to notify her as an of events that eliminated her benefits under an existing policy.this is the central issue in this case.
erisa specific statutory duties are not meant to be exhaustive of a fiduciary obligations federal courts are expected to flesh out erisa general fiduciary duty clause,a.cent.states,areas pension fund cent,d franchise tax bd.of cal.const.laborers vacation trust,d.this exercise takes account of traditional trust law but necessarily adapts it to conform with erisa specific provisions and underlying purpose.varity,at.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.
if this case involved a traditional trustee responsible for managing the financial interests of an individual beneficiary,nancy barrs demand for personalized information would have some basis.see restatement second of trusts cmt.d.however,under erisa the administrator is not a personal trustee but rather a fiduciary for the limited purpose of overseeing whatever plan it creates for what may be thousands of employees and other beneficiaries.see a iii.ordinary trust principles can not be transferred wholesale,and,where erisa itself specifies a notice requirement,courts must be especially cautious in creating additional ones 
absent a promise or misrepresentation,the courts have almost uniformly rejected claims by plan participants or beneficiaries that an erisa administrator has to volunteer individualized information taking account of their peculiar circumstances this view reflects erisa focus on limited and general reporting and disclosure requirements,and also reflects the enormous burdens an obligation to proffer individualized advice would inflict on plan administrators.in general,increased burdens necessarily increase costs,discourage employers from offering plans,and reduce benefits to employees.see varity,at.mertens,at.
our case illustrates the point.all lockheed knew was that nancy barrs was the irrevocable beneficiary under the existing hancock optional policy.the implication of her position is that when the company decided for business reasons to adopt the substitute cigna policy,it had to look in each employee file,look at any assignments that were made which in nancy barrs case did not cover substitute policies,look further to the underlying divorce decree which also did not cover substitute policies,and then surmise that nancy barrs might want to seek to reform the decree to reach successor policies.
finally,nancy barrs argues that a special fiduciary obligation can be derived from provisions added to erisa in giving special status to qualified domestic relations orders qdros.see retirement equity act of.d,stat.prior to the amendments,erisa provided for a general ban on assignment of pension plan rights,d,stat.and while there was no corresponding ban on assignment of welfare plan benefits,erisa broad preemption of all state laws that relate to any employee benefit plan,id.a,created uncertainty about how far contracts or decrees assigning erisa benefits would be given effect 
the amendments eliminated both obstacles for assignments of plan benefit rights that meet the substantive and procedural requirements for a valid qdro,see d b e.such orders are made an exception to the provision covering pension plan benefits,id.d a,and they are exempted from the general preemption section that has been the basis of court rulings broadly preempting assignments of benefits,id.b.boggs boggs,d mackey,at,supra,at,reprinted in at,
a beneficiary named in a state decree assigning pension plan benefits called an alternate payee is entitled to be notified of the company procedures for determining whether the decree is qualified and its ultimate decision as to qualification.d g.taken literally,these provisions do not apply to assignees of welfare plan benefits in light of a subsequent provision making the entire paragraph establishing plan duties relating to qdros inapplicable to plans not subject to the provision,which is limited to pension plans.id.d l.
nevertheless,assuming these qdro notice provisions do apply,note,above,nothing in them or in any precedent cited to us imposes any general fiduciary obligation on the plan administrator to provide personalized information or advice.in general,a qdro beneficiary is simply entitled to be paid in accordance with the decree,d a,and to be treated as an erisa beneficiary like any other,id.d j.nothing suggests that qdro beneficiaries were being given broader protection than those beneficiaries who were already protected by the erisa statute.
in our case,the qdro entitled nancy barrs to be treated as the beneficiary of whatever payments were due under the covered policies.however,under the hancock optional policy,none were due to anyone that policy had been superceded by the cigna policy which was not named in the qdro nor was nancy barrs the beneficiary.similarly,none were due under the basic policy,since her former husband as policyholder had allowed the policy to lapse on his termination.in short,the assignments as to the named policies were respected,which is all the qdro required the problem lay in other contingencies for which no adequate provision had been made.
it is easy to be wise after the fact presumably if nancy barrs matrimonial lawyer faced the same problem again,he or she would include in the settlement agreement a provision covering successor policies arranging for effective notification as to key events,termination,nonpayment of premiums would be more difficult,since it would probably require cooperation from the plan administrator as well as imaginative drafting.in default of such protection,regular inquiries by the beneficiary to the company and insurer would probably be necessary.
yet these are the commonplace problems of contracts in general and divorce agreements in particular.imagine that there were no erisa plan but simply a divorce decree requiring that james barrs maintain in force a life insurance policy for the benefit of nancy barrs.assuring compliance would require nancy barrs to guard against the very same threats of lapses in the policy,change of beneficiary,and against dishonest replies from the obligated husband.erisa simply does not provide insurance against such risks.
the basic policy.with respect to the basic policy,the problem for nancy barrs is not a change of beneficiary under a replacement policy but rather her husband failure to continue paying premiums after his termination by the company.nancy barrs says that she should have been assured notice of this termination.insofar as this claim rests on a general fiduciary duty independent of the company specific promise,our prior discussion as to why no affirmative obligation existed covers the basic policy as well.
however,in its february,letter to nancy barrs acknowledging her divorce decree,ford promised to notify her within hours by registered mail if her husband was terminated nancy barrs claims that lockheed failed to keep this inherited promise and this caused her to forfeit her benefits under the hancock basic policy.both sides assume that through this letter,lockheed assumed a specific fiduciary obligation enforceable under erisa.where the employer makes a specific commitment
