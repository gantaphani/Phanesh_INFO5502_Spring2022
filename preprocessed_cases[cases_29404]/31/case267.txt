opinion of the court 
introduction 
this appeal arises from a disagreement between c s wholesale grocers,woodbridge logistics llc woodbridge and the board of trustees of the ibt local pension fund the board about the amount that woodbridge should pay annually after withdrawing from the ibt local pension fund the fund in at the time of its withdrawal from the fund,woodbridge was the largest wholesale grocery distributor by revenue in the united states.the board administers the fund,which is a multiemployer pension subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.before withdrawing from the fund,woodbridge had been contributing to it pursuant to three collective bargaining agreements cbas 
as a result of amendments to erisa in the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of mppaa,employers can not withdraw from multiemployer pension plans without consequence.instead,they still must pay the share of the fund total unfunded vested benefits allocable to them.the parties here agree that the total amount that woodbridge owes is.because woodbridge has elected to satisfy this withdrawal liability through annual payments instead of a lump sum,the amount of those payments is at the heart of this dispute.
one of the provisions added to erisa by the mppaa,c c i,provides that the annual payments must be based on the the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan the first point of disagreement between the parties is the meaning of highest contribution rate.the board seeks to select the single highest rate from the multiple contribution rates established in the three cbas under which woodbridge was contributing to the fund.woodbridge contends that it is responsible only for a weighted average of all of the contribution rates it is obligated to pay under the cbas.the second point of disagreement is whether woodbridge annual payment should include a percent surcharge that woodbridge had been paying pursuant to e a before withdrawing from the fund.this subsection is part of another amendment to erisa,the pension protection act of ppa.the board claims this surcharge should be included in the annual payment that woodbridge owes.woodbridge disagrees.
after an unsuccessful attempt at arbitration,both parties filed suit in the district court.thereafter,the district court partially granted and partially denied the parties cross motions for summary judgment.the court ruled that the annual withdrawal liability payment should be based on the single highest contribution rate rather than averaging the rates in woodbridge cbas,but should not include the surcharge.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court order and hold that the highest contribution rate means the single highest contribution rate established under any of the three cbas,and the annual payment does not include the percent surcharge.
ii.statutory background 
congress designed erisa to regulate both single employer and multiemployer private pension plans.et.in enacting erisa,congress sought to guarantee that if a worker has been promised a defined pension benefit upon retirement and if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit he actually will receive it.nachman pension benefit guar,d.as mentioned above,this dispute focuses on multiemployer plans.
a significant drawback of multiemployer pension plans is that the possibility of liability upon termination of a plan create s an incentive for employers to withdraw from weak multiemployer plans.concrete pipe prods.of,contr.laborers pension tr.for.when an employer withdraws from a pension plan before fully funding the amounts attributable to its employees,the plan contribution base is reduced and the remaining contributing employers have no choice but to absorb the higher costs through increased contribution rates.see connolly pension benefit guar,d.this may jeopardize the plan survival because the remaining employers have an increased incentive to also withdraw.id.the mppaa was enacted to mitigate the incentives that employers would otherwise have to withdraw from multiemployer pension plans mired in financial difficulty.see concrete pipe,at.
under the mppaa,when an employer completely withdraws from a multiemployer pension plan,it incurs withdrawal liability that corresponds to the value of the benefits in the plan that have vested and are attributable to its employees c,provides the formula with which a plan actuaries are to calculate the amount of this liability in short,this liability is the employer proportionate share of the plan unfunded vested benefits,calculated as the difference between the present value of vested benefits and the current value of the plan assets.pension benefit guar.gray,d citing and in explaining that the withdrawal liability is a fixed and certain debt to the pension plan.an employer may make a onetime payment to satisfy its entire withdrawal liability or it may amortize the debt in equal annual payments under section c a the formula for calculating the amount of each of these annual payments is provided in c c i 
except as provided in subparagraph e,the amount of each annual payment shall be the product of 
i the average annual number of contribution base units for the period of consecutive plan years,during the period of consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs,in which the number of contribution base units for which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan is the highest,and 
ii the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan during the plan years ending with the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs.
the contribution base units mentioned in section c c i i are generally the compensable or paid hours for which an employer contributes to the plan on behalf of its employees.see huber casablanca,cir describing contribution base units as,hours worked,weeks worked,tons of coal,abrogated on other grounds by milwaukee brewery workers pension plan joseph schlitz brewing,d.the term obligation to contribute,in c c i ii,is defined in a as an obligation arising either under one or more collective bargaining or related agreements,or as a result of a duty under applicable relations law.
in,congress amended erisa again.it enacted the ppa to protect and restore multiemployer pension plans in danger of being unable to meet their pension distribution obligations in the near future.trs.of the local pension tr.fund honerkamp,cir.under section b a,which was added by the ppa,a multiemployer pension plan that is less than percent funded is in critical status.when a plan is in critical status,section a requires the plan sponsor to adopt and implement a rehabilitation plan.this rehabilitation plan must set forth new schedules of reduced benefits and increased contributions,from which participating employers and unions may choose when it is time to negotiate successor cbas.honerkamp,at.
in addition to requiring a rehabilitation plan,the ppa imposes an automatic surcharge from days after the employer has been notified that the plan is in critical status until the adoption of a new cba in accordance with the rehabilitation plan.e c d.in the first year,the surcharge is equal to five percent of the contributions required under the cba.id.e a.in subsequent years,the surcharge is fixed at percent of the contributions.id.under section e b,surcharges are due and payable on the same schedule as the contributions on which the surcharges are based.any failure to make a surcharge payment shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under section e b,in turn provides that a ny surcharges under paragraph shall be disregarded in determining the allocation of unfunded vested benefits to an employer under section,except for purposes of determining the unfunded vested benefits attributable to an employer under section c or a comparable method approved under section c.
on december,congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act of mpra,div.o,stat,amending the ppa,and,among other things.as amended by the mpra,e b now states 
any surcharges under subsection e shall be disregarded in determining the allocation of unfunded vested benefits to an employer under section and in determining the highest contribution rate under section c,except for purposes of determining the unfunded vested benefits attributable to an employer under section c or a comparable method approved under section c.
this amendment does not affect the surcharges here as they accrued before december.thus,unless specifically noted,the statutory references and language in this opinion refer to erisa as it was before the mpra.
iii.factual and procedural history 
in february,woodbridge completely withdrew from the fund after closing its northern new jersey facilities for economic reasons.the three cbas under which woodbridge contributed to the fund established multiple hourly contribution rates ranging from to per hour.since the plan year beginning on september,the fund had been in critical status,as defined by section b a i of the ppa.accordingly,woodbridge had been paying the fund a surcharge for over two years before withdrawing.the surcharge was fixed at percent of woodbridge contributions by the time woodbridge withdrew.
once woodbridge withdrew from the fund,it fell to the board to determine the total amount of unfunded vested benefits that woodbridge owed pursuant to section c.the parties do not dispute that the correct amount is.because woodbridge opted to make annual payments,rather than extinguishing the debt with a single payment,the board also calculated the amount of these annual payments using the formula in section c c i.in interpreting the highest contribution rate mentioned in that subsection,the board selected the single highest contribution rate in the cbas.that rate was per hour established in the warehouse cba.the board also interpreted the text of a and its definition of the obligation to contribute mentioned in section c c i ii as including the surcharge that woodbridge had been paying.thus,the board added percent to per hour and arrived at a total contribution rate of per hour.the resulting calculation pursuant to section c c i resulted in an annual withdrawal liability payment of.this amount far exceeded the highest annual payment that woodbridge had ever made before withdrawing from the fund.
woodbridge disputed the board methodology.it argued that the board should not have used the single highest contribution rate in all of the cbas or included the percent surcharge in calculating its withdrawal liability.thus,the parties submitted the following issues to an arbitrator 
did the fund comply with erisa section c c.c c and the regulations promulgated thereunder when it calculated woodbridge withdrawal liability payment schedule by taking into account the highest contribution rate at which woodbridge was obligated to contribute to the fund,notwithstanding the fact that the last bargaining agreements in effect allowed lower contribution rates for some employee classifications

the arbitrator found that the term the highest contribution rate as used in section c c i ii was ambiguous.he resolved this ambiguity by consulting legislative history and the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc opinion letter based on those two sources,he ruled that the board should have adopted a weighted average of the different contribution rates established in each of the three cbas,instead of selecting the single highest contribution rate of the arbitrator rejected woodbridge challenge to inclusion of the percent surcharge,reasoning that e b indicates that surcharges are contributions because they are treated as delinquent contributions.he believed section e b reinforced the conclusion that surcharges paid by woodbridge should be included in the highest contribution rate by negative implication.ibt local pension fund,d at.
both parties filed complaints in the district court.the district court reversed both of the arbitrator rulings in an order resolving the parties cross motions for summary judgment.the court held that the single highest contribution rate in the three cbas the per hour rate in the warehouse cba applied.the court concluded that section c c i ii is plain and unambiguous in referring to a single contribution rate the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan.see ibt local pension fund,d at citing section c c i ii.accordingly,the court declined to rely on sources beyond the statutory text.the court interpreted the statute as contemplating multiple cbas in directing that the highest contribution rate be used because the definition of obligation to contribute in a refers to one or more cbas.id.at.
the court also held that the arbitrator should not have included the surcharge in calculating woodbridge annual withdrawal liability payment.the court reasoned that the obligation to contribute under section a included only amounts arising under the cbas and the cbas in question did not include the surcharge.the court recognized that,under section a,the highest contribution rate is also that at which the employer had an obligation to contribute as a result of a duty under applicable relations law.it explained,however,that it was not aware of any such law and the board had not argued that the surcharge arose under such a law.the court also pointed out that,while contribution rates inform the value of contributions,contributions are separate from and do not determine contribution rates.thus,even if contributions and surcharges are one and the same,the court reasoned,the surcharge would not change the cbas underlying contribution rates.
this appeal and cross appeal followed.woodbridge appeals the court decision to apply the single highest contribution rate provided in the cbas,and the board appeals the court decision to disallow the surcharge in calculating woodbridge annual withdrawal liability payment 
iii.the highest contribution rate 
we begin our analysis by discussing the meaning of the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under section c c i ii where there are multiple cbas and multiple contribution rates for different classes of employees.as discussed above,the district court selected the single rate of per hour which was the highest contribution rate under any of the employer three cbas.see ibt local pension fund,d at.the court reasoned that section a reference to one or more collective bargaining or related agreements shows that congress contemplated the possibility of multiple cbas in directing in section c c i ii that the single highest contribution rate be used.we agree.accordingly,we hold that,even where there are multiple contribution rates under multiple cbas,section c c i ii requires that the single highest rate determine the amount of an employer annual withdrawal liability payment.
woodbridge makes several unpersuasive arguments in support of its contrary position.first,woodbridge contends that section has no bearing on the meaning of highest contribution rate because it contains neither the term highest contribution rate,nor contribution rate.woodbridge reading is far too restrictive.section c c i ii,plainly refers to the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan.thus,the meaning of obligation to contribute is essential to understanding this subsection.section a,defines obligation to contribute for purposes of section and other provisions of erisa relating to employer withdrawals.see a stating that it provides a definition f or purposes of this part.
second,woodbridge argues that there is an ambiguity in the statute where multiple cbas call for different contribution rates.in order to resolve this ambiguity,woodbridge offers both the legislative history and the aforementioned pbgc opinion letter.it characterizes the pbgc letter as endorsing a approach under which its annual withdrawal liability would be the sum of the products described in section c c i computed separately for each of the employer contracts.wl,at.woodbridge argues that when both the legislative history and the pbgc letter are read together,they establish that the board must consider the highest contribution rate for each class of employees,rather than the single highest contribution rate overall.because we disagree that the statute is ambiguous,we are not at liberty to examine the legislative history and the pbgc letter see ex rel.durrell lower merion sch,cir legislative history has never been permitted to override the plain meaning of a statute.
statutory interpretation begins with the plain language of the statute and when the language is clear,the court must enforce it according to its terms.jimenez quarterman,d.a statute is ambiguous only where the disputed language is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.in re phila.newspapers,llc,cir.the mention of one or more collective bargaining or related agreements in section a makes clear that congress contemplated a situation,such as the one before us,in which there would be multiple cbas.in such a situation,section c c i ii expressly directs that the highest contribution rate be used.there is no ambiguity in the definite article the.in short,when sections and are read together,it is clear that congress appreciated that an employer might contribute at different rates under multiple plans and designated the highest rate as the appropriate rate to apply in calculating annual payments of the withdrawal liability.
woodbridge last argument is that applying only the single highest contribution rate will lead to an unduly harsh result in which its annual withdrawal liability payment will be greater than the annual payments it was making when it was participating in the plan.we agree that that is the result but we do not agree that it is unduly harsh.moreover,we must enforce a statute according to its terms.we are not at liberty to rewrite it to address woodbridge perceived inequity.see lamie,d w hen the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms our unwillingness to soften the import of congress chosen words even if we believe the words lead to a harsh outcome is longstanding.in addition,as we have just noted,we do not agree that the higher annual contributions following withdrawal are necessarily inequitable or that congress was unaware that this could be the result of selecting the highest contribution rate of multiple cbas.woodbridge equitable argument ignores the fact that under section c c i,its annual payments are capped at years even if more than annual payments would be required to completely satisfy woodbridge withdrawal liability.thus,woodbridge will not necessarily pay more following withdrawal than it would have had it remained in the fund.yet the higher annual payment for years clearly deters employers from withdrawing from multiemployer funds without fully funding their share of the liability.
we do not believe that congress intended that a withdrawing employer pay only the amounts that would ordinarily be due under the pension plan.indeed,the supreme court has noted that it is not convinced that mppaa aims to make withdrawing employers pay an actuarially perfect fair share,namely,a set of payments in amounts that,when invested,would theoretically produce on the plan actuarial assumptions a sum precisely sufficient to pay the employer proportional share of a plan estimated vested future benefits.milwaukee brewery,at.features of the mppaa,such as the statute forgiveness of de minimis amounts under section and the waiving of the balance after years of annual payments under section c b,all indicate that congress contemplated a scheme under which withdrawal payments would not correspond exactly to the employer allocable unfunded amounts under the plan.see id.also noting that these features mean that if an employer normal annual contribution was low compared to the withdrawal charge,the presence or absence of interest which shows up at the end of the payment schedule will make no difference for the last payments will never be made.see also bay area laundry dry cleaning pension tr.fund ferbar of,d payments are set at a level that approximates the periodic contributions the employer had made before withdrawing from the plan emphasis added.
iv.the surcharge 
the remaining issue which we must resolve is whether the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute includes the percent surcharge imposed by section e a as discussed above,the district court concluded that the surcharge should not be included in the annual withdrawal liability payment.section a expands on the sources of the obligation to contribute,stating the term obligation to contribute means an obligation to contribute arising under one or more collective bargaining or related agreements,or as a result of a duty under applicable relations law thus,we must decide if the surcharge arises under either the cbas or an applicable relations law.we conclude that the surcharge does not arise under either.
a.the surcharge does not arise under the cbas 
the board argues that,because section e b makes surcharges due and payable on the same schedule as the contributions and provides that failure to pay a surcharge shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under section,the statute regards both cba and ppamandated employer contributions,and their respective rates,in an identical manner.appellant br.section governs delinquent contributions and states that e very employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan or such agreement.as the supreme court has observed,t he text of plainly describes the employer contractual obligation to make contributions but omits any reference to a noncontractual obligation.laborers health welfare tr.fund for cal.advanced lightweight concrete,d.because surcharges are noncontractual obligations created by section e,they are not within the scope of section.indeed,this is precisely why section e b is necessary to ensure that surcharges are treated similarly to contributions when delinquent.
in addition,the phrase treated as in section e b is telling.congress would hardly need to inform a plan actuaries that surcharges are to be treated as contributions when delinquent if surcharges and contributions were already identical for all purposes,including calculating annual withdrawal payments.in other words,if surcharges were contributions already,then section e b would be rendered redundant and meaningless.it is well established,however,that legislative enactments should not be construed to render their provisions mere surplusage.dunn commodity futures trading comm n,d.in order to give effect to section e b,surcharges can not be treated as contributions except when delinquent.thus,the surcharge established in section does not arise under the cbas.
b.the surcharge is not part of the highest contribution rate 
under section a,an obligation to contribute may also arise as a result of a duty under applicable relations law.woodbridge argues that the only applicable relations law is the national labor relations act nlra.the board contends that section is also such a law woodbridge also argues that the board waived this argument.assuming arguendo that the issue is not waived,the board position is not persuasive because it fails to distinguish between contributions and contribution rates.even if,as the board argues,the surcharge arises under the ppa and assuming that the ppa is an applicable relations law,the surcharge can not be added to woodbridge annual payments unless it is part of the highest contribution rate.
section c c i ii,specifies that the annual payments be based on the highest contribution rate at
