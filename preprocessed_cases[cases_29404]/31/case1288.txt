throughout his judicial career holmes relished challenging cases.while on massachusetts highest court he confessed to a friend that although none of the cases he had handled that year had been of universal interest,there is always the pleasure of unraveling a difficulty.a decade and a half later,while on the supreme court,he told the same friend that he had few cases of general interest that term,but t here is always the fun of untying a knot and trying to do it in good compact form.it is a pity that holmes did not live to see erisa cases.
wendell gilley was employed by monsanto company,from august,through february,at its sand mountain textile plant in northeast alabama.monsanto closed the plant in march of,but gilley remained on the payroll in layoff status until february when he was finally let go.although the period of his employment was under years,gilley claims that with the overtime that he worked in,he acquired the necessary ten years of vested service to merit pension benefits.
under monsanto salaried employees pension plan,certain employees are entitled to benefits if they are able to meet the vesting requirements of the plan.although monsanto has amended its pension plan several times over the years,all relevant versions of the plan set out the same basic vesting requirements an eligible employee must reach retirement age,and the employee must acquire at least ten years of vested service.an employee earns a year of vested service when he completes hours of service,defined as all hours of employment for which an employee is directly or indirectly compensated,during that year.the manner in which hours of service are calculated has varied as monsanto has amended its pension plan.
when gilley began work at monsanto,the plan was in effect.the pension plan was amended in to comply with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of,et,which went into effect,for our purposes,in according to monsanto,both the plan and the plan utilized the elapsed time method to calculate vested service for pension purposes.under this method,an employee is credited with the hours that result from dividing the total number of calendar days of employment,including weekends and holidays,by and then multiplying that number by the total hours in a standard work year based on a work week.in other words,an employee hours of service are determined based on the fraction of the year he is employed,multiplied by the standard work an individual is employed for days out of the year,he would be entitled to hours of service or one year of vested service.
sometime between and,the plan committee decided to change the way hours of service are determined,adopting the rule and incorporating it into the amendments to the plan.under this calculation method,the provider credits all employees with hours of service for each period they are employed,regardless of the actual hours worked.the rule expressly excludes additional credit for overtime hours,embodying the assumption that the fifteen extra hours of service credited on a basis assuming a week or hours every two weeks is a fair way to cover any overtime hours worked.in addition to adopting the rule,the plan stated that an employee benefit rights are to be determined according to the pension plan in effect at the time that the employee separates from monsanto.
believing that he had acquired ten years of vested service,even though he had only worked for monsanto for nine full years and part of two other years and,gilley applied for pension benefits in.monsanto denied his request,because it concluded that gilley vested service fell short of the requisite ten years.gilley filed an administrative appeal,and the monsanto plan committee denied his petition.it applied the plan and the rule to determine that gilley was only entitled to years of vested service.
gilley filed suit claiming that monsanto had arbitrarily and capriciously denied his claim for benefits,in violation of erisa,made oral and written assurances that all employees hired at the sand mountain plant after september were vested and,therefore,is equitably estopped from denying gilley benefits now under erisa intentionally closed the sand mountain plant right before the employees would reach the mark,in violation of erisa,amended the plan to retroactively reduce or eliminate the amount of accrued hours of service in violation of erisa g,g and breached its fiduciary duty by failing to act in the best interest of plan participants,in violation of erisa.monsanto filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the plan governed the determination of gilley credit,and that under the plan gilley lacked the requisite ten years of vested service.the district court denied the motion to dismiss.
gilley then filed an amended complaint,specifically restating all of his claims under the equitable relief section of erisa,a,a,and adding a claim under c,c,and,asserting that monsanto had interfered with his attempts to attain benefits by refusing to provide him with requested documents.the amended complaint alleged that the rule should not be applied because,according to gilley,it is less favorable to him than the plan method of calculating hours of service.
monsanto filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that erisa a,a,only permits equitable relief and does not apply when a party is seeking purely legal relief,as monsanto claimed gilley was doing additionally,monsanto restated its argument that gilley can not prove the ten years of vesting service necessary to merit benefits.it put before the court social security records indicating that gilley had earned a total of in,and other records showing that in his base salary had been monthly,or annually.gilley argued that the figure actually included overtime pay and that his monthly base salary was really only,which would have been annually.
based on all of those records,monsanto argued that even if the district court calculated hours of service based on the actual hours gilley worked,gilley still was not entitled to a pension.using the figure,a monthly base salary,and the hour standard work year set out in the plan,monsanto asserted that gilley could have actually worked only hours in if all hours were compensated equally,well short of the hours needed.monsanto also pointed out that because the salary gilley earned in included compensation for some overtime and holiday hours,which would have been paid at a premium rate,gilley actual hours worked would be much less.what more,even if gilley claimed monthly salary figure and the resulting annual salary figure are accepted,the maximum it appears gilley could have worked in based on the social security records is hours assuming all hours were compensated at the same hourly wage.still,the district court denied monsanto motion,finding that a trial was warranted based on the closeness of the vesting issue.
a bench trial was conducted solely to decide the number of hours of service credit gilley was entitled to receive for his employment in.after trial,the district court ordered gilley to submit an itemized,succinct list showing exactly how he would arrive at a minimum of h ours of s ervice in.in response,gilley offered three equivalencies,claiming that each showed he was entitled to benefits.erisa gives a plan the option of using equivalencies in order to simplify the record keeping and calculation burdens associated with determining hours of service,a.a list of equivalencies from which a plan may choose is contained in the regulation,id.d,e.
the district court accepted two of the three equivalencies that gilley suggested.one of those two calculates hours of service based on hours worked under d,granting hours of service if hours are worked.the other calculates hours of service based on regular time hours under d,granting hours of service if regular time hours are worked.the parties dispute whether gilley would be entitled to a pension under either or both of the two equivalencies the district court adopted.the math involved with both equivalencies is dense,enough so that during oral argument counsel had difficulty answering some of our questions about the numbers and formulas used during the trial.
the more fundamental point that monsanto stressed,however,is that the plan never included either of the two equivalencies that the district court used at gilley urging.instead,the plan included the rule,another equivalency permitted by erisa.see id.e iii.we will spare the reader the details of how the rule plays out in gilley circumstances,except to say that everyone agrees that under it gilley would not be entitled to a pension.
in its findings of fact and conclusions of law,the district court refused to apply the rule set out in the plan.its reasoning was that later amendments to the plan should not have an effect on the calculations if they impact adversely on plaintiff entitlement.even though the two equivalencies that were more favorable to gilley had never been part of the plan,the district court justified their use on the grounds that monsanto had not kept adequate records of the hours gilley worked in.it said that gilley was entitled to the benefit of the doubt because monsanto had failed to keep adequate records from that year.applying the two equivalencies that gilley preferred,the court determined that he did have the requisite hours of service to receive a full year of credit for,giving him ten years of vested service which entitled him to a pension.throughout its reasoning,the court applied a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of deference,because it concluded that the plan committee had a conflict of interest in making benefit decisions.
the court judgment ordered monsanto to pay gilley his past due pension benefits,plus appropriate interest,and to pay additional retirement benefits as they accrue in the future.monsanto filed a motion to alter or amend the district court judgment,asserting multiple mathematical and legal errors in the application of the two equivalencies the district court used.after the court denied that motion,monsanto filed this appeal.
we initially had some doubt about our jurisdiction to decide this appeal because,while the district court ordered monsanto to pay appropriate interest on the award of past benefits,it did not specify the rate of interest or the date from which the interest would be calculated.we were concerned that the judgment might not be final under for purposes of appellate review.
the district court failure to set an interest rate for calculating prejudgment interest might have been a problem for the purpose of our jurisdiction if the judgment had no injunctive aspects.see sec carrillo,cir per curiam noting that if the judgment amount,the prejudgment interest rate,or the date from which prejudgment interest accrues is unclear,the calculation of prejudgment interest is no longer a ministerial act and the court order is not final but see moon am.home assurance,cir addressing the merits but remanding the case back to the district court for clarification on the questions of whether prejudgment interest was intended and the rate at which any such interest should be calculated.however,the judgment here does include injunctive relief,because it requires monsanto to continue to pay pension benefits as they accrue in the future.under a,we have jurisdiction over orders granting injunctive relief.the district court judgment here is injunctive enough in nature to give us jurisdiction over the appeal.
on the merits,both sides agree that gilley must have ten years of credit to be entitled to a pension,and they agree that he earned at least nine years of credit for his work at the plant from to.their disagreement is about whether gilley gets a full year of credit for,his first year on the job,when he actually worked only four months for monsanto.if gilley is credited with a full year for working those four months,he gets a pension.
the district court conclusion that gilley should be treated as having worked a full year in was based on its belief that instead of the rule in the plan,the hours worked or regular time hours equivalencies,which gilley proposed,should be used.the parties disagree about whether gilley is entitled to a pension even if those two equivalencies are used,but they do agree that he is not entitled to a pension under the plan rule.the question that determines the issues we address in this appeal is whether the rule is the equivalency that should be applied.
the parties think that the answer to that question might depend on the standard of deference applicable to the plan committee decision to deny gilley pension benefits.monsanto argues that the arbitrary and capricious standard applies,while gilley thinks the district court was correct to apply a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard.given the nature of the issue on which this case turns,we doubt that the standard of deference makes any difference.to the extent that it does,however,the proper standard is arbitrary and capricious.
erisa does not explicitly establish the standard of review to be applied to a plan administrator decision.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.following the supreme court direction,however,we have adopted three different standards to guide us de novo review applies where the plan administrator has been given no discretion in deciding claims arbitrary and capricious review applies where the plan administrator has discretion in deciding claims and does not suffer from a conflict of interest and heightened arbitrary and capricious review applies where the plan administrator has discretion but suffers from a conflict of interest.hca health servs.of,employers health ins,cir.for purposes of that third standard,a conflict of interest exists when a provider has to pay benefit claims out of its own assets,making it directly advantageous to the provider for the claims to be denied.these three standards have been broadly applied to both the administrator interpretation of plan provisions as well as the administrator decision to grant or deny benefits.williams bellsouth,cir paramore delta air lines,cir.
our circuit law is clear that no conflict of interest exists where benefits are paid from a trust that is funded through periodic contributions so that the provider incurs no immediate expense as a result of paying benefits.see buckley metro.life,cir.only when benefits are paid from a provider assets,so that benefit decisions have a direct and immediate impact on the provider profit margin,does the heightened standard come into play.see williams,at.
in this case,the plan gave the plan committee discretion to make benefits decisions.the record clearly establishes that benefits were paid out of a trust instead of from monsanto own assets.in buckley,we specifically considered the standard of deference to be applied when benefits are paid out of a trust funded by periodic,contributions.at.we held that where the company neither incurs a direct expense in paying benefits nor directly profits from denying or discontinuing benefits,there is no conflict of interest.id.at.that holding has been reiterated in subsequent cases.see,turner delta disability survivorship plan,cir per curiam a,periodic trust eradicates any alleged conflict of interest so that the arbitrary or capricious standard of review applies.the fact that the company is responsible for replenishing the funds of the trust is not enough to create a conflict of interest.id.
for these reasons,the district court erred in applying the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard.to the extent that a deference standard applies,the ordinary arbitrary and capricious standard is the one.
the district court also erred in forcing on the plan two equivalencies that the plan had never adopted.the court based its substitution of the equivalencies,gilley favored for the one in the plan on its view that monsanto had failed to keep adequate records of the hours gilley worked in.we have some doubts about whether a court generally can impose on a plan equivalencies that the plan did not choose simply because of the absence of adequate records.
we have no doubt,however,that a plan can not be forced to use an equivalency that is different from the one the plan chose simply because it or the company did not keep adequate records for erisa purposes be
