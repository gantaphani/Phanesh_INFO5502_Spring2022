background 
sharon thurber worked at quest diagnostics quest as a client services representative from through august.as a quest employee,thurber was enrolled in quest employee retirement income security act erisa disability benefits plan,administered by aetna life insurance company aetna.under the plan,thurber was entitled to disability benefits if a disabling condition rendered her unable to perform the material and substantial duties of her occupation.according to thurber supervisor,her position as a client services representative consisted of sitting for approximately of her shift and alternately standing and walking a short distance for the remaining of the time.
in,thurber broke both of her legs in a car accident her right leg is shorter than her left leg as a result.on or about august,thurber was involved in another car accident,in which she hit a cement barrier twice while driving on the new york state thruway.she has not worked since that accident.aetna approved thurber initial claim for disability benefits for traumatic arthritis in both knees.she received disability benefits for six months,ending on february.
thurber then submitted a claim for disability benefits.at this time,she informed aetna that she had received other income in the form of insurance payments of per month while receiving disability benefits from aetna.under the plan,aetna may reduce disability benefits if a beneficiary receives other income benefits,including insurance payments.ar.in addition,any i ncome earned from a return to work at quest will result in a reduction of benefits.id.the plan also authorizes aetna to require the return of overpayments cease paying benefits until overpayments are recovered pursue legal action to recover overpayments or p lace a lien in the amount of the overpayment on the proceeds of any other income.id.at.
in support of thurber claim for disability benefits based on her intermittent,unpredictable pain,thurber orthopedist,michael grant,completed a capabilities and limitations worksheet clw in november.grant indicated that thurber could engage in occasional sitting and occasional walking,but not in standing,stooping,climbing,crawling,kneeling or twisting,among other limitations.in january,grant opined that thurber remains totally disabled due to being persistently symptomatic in regards to severe arthritis of her knees bilaterally.id.at.two months later,another of thurber physicians,anthony bianchi,completed a second clw and found that thurber could frequently of an day sit,stand and walk.bianchi noted that thurber was still very symptomatic at times,but recommended that she slowly work up to an hour work day.id.at.
based on this information,aetna denied thurber claim for disability benefits on march.aetna denial letter summarized the medical reports provided by thurber doctors before concluding that the information did not demonstrate that thurber was unable to perform the functions of her position as a client services representative.aetna informed thurber that she could submit any additional information she desired and gave a list of the types of tests and records that might prove helpful.thurber appealed the denial of benefits in april.
on april,thurber underwent arthroscopic knee surgery,as suggested by grant.aetna then forwarded thurber claim file for an independent medical review by lawrence blumberg,a board certified orthopedic surgeon.blumberg summarized the medical information provided by thurber physicians,but his report wrongly attributed the march,clw to grant,rather than to bianchi.blumberg determined that i n spite of claimant subjective complaints,she has an adequate range of motion to perform sedentary activities,as required by her job,because t here is no evidence that she can not stand,sit,or ambulate.id.at.in late may,aetna denied thurber claim on appeal and upheld its original decision.
although the internal appeals process offers only one level of review,thurber requested reconsideration of her appeal.she subsequently submitted medical information regarding spinal problems in october,specifically,the results of a static emg scan.aetna forwarded thurber claim file for two additional independent medical reviews,both conducted by board certified orthopedic surgeons.the second independent review physician,james wallquist,reviewed thurber medical reports and correctly attributed the march,clw to bianchi.both wallquist and leela rangaswamy,aetna third independent review physician,concluded that thurber was functionally impaired from the date of her arthroscopic surgery and for six weeks of recovery thereafter,but not during the periods prior or subsequent.on december,aetna completed the of its denial of thurber claim for benefits and its initial denial.
thurber filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of new york skretny,challenging aetna denial of benefits under erisa,a b.aetna counterclaimed for equitable restitution of in overpaid plan benefits under a.aetna moved for summary judgment on thurber claim and its counterclaim.on january,the district court granted aetna motion for summary judgment with respect to thurber claims but denied and dismissed aetna counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under erisa because it was legal,rather than equitable,in nature.
thurber appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment to aetna on thurber claim for disability benefits aetna from the district court denial of its counterclaim.
discussion 
standard of review 
thurber argues that the district court should have reviewed her claim de novo because she allegedly never received the plan documents that clearly reserved aetna discretion to assess her eligibility for disability benefits.we disagree.
when an erisa plan participant challenges a denial of benefits,the proper standard of review is de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to assess a participant eligibility.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.if the plan does reserve discretion,the denial is subject to arbitrary and capricious review and will be overturned only if it is without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir quoting pagan nynex pension plan,cir.although we do not require the plan to employ any particular language to reserve discretion,the chosen words must clearly convey the administrator intent.see nichols prudential ins.of,cir kinstler,at.
thurber conceded at oral argument that the plan itself and the summary plan description spd both include language that is sufficient to reserve discretion to aetna to assess participants eligibility for benefits thurber argues,however,that there is no evidence in the record showing that she actually received either of these plan documents and that,therefore,she can not be bound by language contained therein.according to thurber,the only plan document that she received the booklet does not clearly reserve discretion to aetna 
thurber relies on the seventh circuit decision in herzberger standard insurance,cir,for her assertion that she must have received actual notice of aetna reservation of discretion before aetna denial of benefits is entitled to deferential review.in herzberger,the seventh circuit reversed and remanded two district court decisions granting summary judgment to plan administrators after the lower courts reviewed eligibility determinations under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see id.at.the court held that neither plan at issue clearly reserved discretion to the respective plan administrators.id.the court analysis rested fully on the language of the plan itself,and concluded that language that simply provided that the administrator had to determine eligibility did not imbue the administrator with discretion.see id.in explicating this holding,the court further noted that t he employees are entitled to know what they getting into,and so if the employer is going to reserve a broad,unchanneled discretion to deny claims,the employees should be told about this,and told clearly.id.
contrary to thurber reading,the case did not in any way involve,and the court language did not address,a situation in which the plan language did unambiguously provide for discretion as did the spd,but the employee seeking benefits had not received a copy of either document.that a court will review benefits determinations de novo unless the plan documents clearly specify a reservation of discretion does not imply that such a reservation must be specifically conveyed to all members of the plan.in any event,to the extent that the language in herzberger could be read to require actual notice of the insurer purported reservation of discretion,we can not detect any basis in law or the statute to support this position.indeed,the supreme court decision in firestone merely establishes that review under the arbitrary and capricious standard will be inappropriate unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility.at emphasis added.firestone says nothing about whether the spd or other plan documents must contain language clearly reserving discretion firestone refers to the plan itself.although plan participants are entitled to receive copies of the spd,pursuant to,and,the administrator of an erisa plan has no obligation to ensure that participants receive copies of the plan itself.
thus,unless erisa requires the spd to contain language setting the standard of review,we see no reason why a plan administrator must actually notify a participant of its reservation of discretion.erisa contains no such edict.see b.accordingly,to the extent that the seventh circuit has articulated an actual notice requirement,we disagree that erisa imposes such an obligation on an insurer that endeavors to reserve discretion.
here,the language contained in aetna plan and the spd clearly reserves discretion to aetna for determining participants eligibility for disability benefits.that thurber did not have actual notice of aetna reservation of discretion is of no consequence.there may be strong arguments that plan provisions that affect the basic terms of the plan,or ones that affect what an applicant must do to become eligible for benefits,should be conveyed directly to plan beneficiaries and not buried in a lengthy and technical contract.however,those arguments do not apply to a provision that is effectively addressed not to the beneficiary,but only to a reviewing court that must act only after an application has been denied.moreover,a standard that focuses on the language of the plan raises a purely legal standard of review for all participants in the same plan.in contrast,an actual notice standard would make the standard of review different for each individual applicant,based on resolution by reviewing courts of factual disputes which will frequently pit a participant fallible and memory against a plan administrator reliance on evidence of standard practice about whether the particular participant received a copy of the relevant documents.
as a result,we conclude that the district court correctly utilized the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.we review the district court grant of summary judgment to aetna de novo,see pagan,at,and thus will review aetna denial of disability benefits under the same arbitrary and capricious standard properly used by the district court.
ii.the merits of thurber claim for benefits 
thurber makes several arguments on appeal for why aetna acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her disability benefits under the plan.only some of these arguments have sufficient merit to require discussion.we agree with the district court that aetna determination of thurber eligibility for benefits was supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to aetna.
first,thurber argues that aetna failed to give enough weight to her subjective complaints of pain.although subjective complaints if found credible could be legally sufficient evidence of disability,krizek cigna group insurance,cir,we agree with the district court that aetna gave sufficient attention to thurber subjective complaints of pain before determining that they were not supported by objective evidence.in aetna first denial letter,the insurer noted that thurber complain ed of recurrent discomfort about the right knee.ar.in its may denial of benefits on appeal,aetna commented that blumberg found that in spite of your subjective complaints,you had adequate range of motion to perform sedentary activities.id.at.finally,in aetna december final denial on,the letter confirmed that t he consultant noted that thurber had had previous knee pain and the consultant was aware that s he claimed to have pain,stiffness,and fatiguability on june.id.at.aetna did not abuse its discretion in concluding either that thurber subjective complaints of pain standing alone did not warrant finding her eligible for disability benefits,or that objective evidence did not support finding otherwise.
second,thurber argues that blumberg error attributing the march,clw to grant,instead of to bianchi,is a critical mistake because blumberg believed that grant found thurber to have improved.appellant br.at.even if blumberg erroneously believed that grant had authored the march clw,his recommendation to aetna was based on the substance of the report which was the most recent clw available at the time of his review.moreover,after blumberg review and aetna denial of thurber appeal,aetna retained two additional independent physicians to review thurber file and subsequently affirmed its prior denial based on their correct reports.
third,thurber claims that aetna did not give sufficient consideration to the total impact of the medical evidence she submitted to support her claim for disability benefits.as the district court correctly determined,the facts prove otherwise.each of aetna three denial letters,along with the reports from three independent board certified physicians,explained why aetna found thurber submissions to be insufficient.in addition,thurber claim that aetna failed to credit the objective medical evidence she submitted regarding her neck and spinal problems also fails.thurber initial disability claim and all of the supporting documentation from her care providers up until the fall of focused on injuries to her knees caused by her august car accident in conjunction with her car accident.but,even if thurber claim extended beyond disabling knee pain,the third independent physician review and aetna subsequent final denial letter both discuss the tests performed on thurber spine,demonstrating that aetna did not arbitrarily ignore this evidence for purposes of assessing her eligibility for benefits.
we have considered thurber additional arguments that the rejection of her claim was arbitrary and capricious and find them without merit.we affirm the district court conclusion that aetna eligibility determination was supported by substantial evidence.
iii.aetna counterclaim 
aetna brought a counterclaim seeking the return of overpaid benefits pursuant to erisa,a,which authorizes civil actions brought by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary to obtain.appropriate equitable relief to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.a.what qualifies as appropriate equitable relief is an issue that continues to perplex courts despite efforts by the supreme court during the past decade to shed some light on the matter.see sereboff mid atl.med,d great west life annuity ins.knudson,d.here,the district court determined that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over aetna counterclaim because aetna sought legal,rather than equitable,relief.because we are convinced that aetna counterclaim seeking the return of overpaid benefits constituted an action for appropriate equitable relief,we reverse.
the supreme court first tackled the question of whether a authorizes actions by insurers under an erisa plan in great west life annuity insurance company knudson.there,the insurer paid approximately for the participant medical expenses under her husband erisa plan after a car accident.see knudson,at.the knudsons subsequently settled their state c
