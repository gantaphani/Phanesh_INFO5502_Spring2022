wright electric,and two of its employees,william vice and billy joe porter collectively wright electric,appeal from a final judgment entered in the district court for the district of minnesota in favor of the minnesota state board of electricity board,john schultz,the executive secretary of the board,city of west paul city,and richard bradley,electrical inspector of the city collectively the state.the district court rejected wright electric request for declaratory and injunctive relief to bar enforcement of a state statute and rule,holding that they were not preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.we affirm.
background 
wright electric is a licensed minnesota electrical contractor that performs residential,commercial and industrial electrical work,using both licensed electricians and unlicensed workers.the board is the licensing authority that administers and enforces the minnesota electrical act.et.the act prohibits an unlicensed person from performing electrical work at job sites unless he or she is supervised by a licensed electrician.id,subd.a.the portion of the statute and rule at issue here,subd.a and.collectively the statute or the supervision ratio requirement,provide that a licensed electrician shall not supervise more than two unlicensed persons at a job site.
since wright electric has had an apprenticeship training program.the program consists of classroom instruction and training.the classroom instruction is provided by the construction education foundation foundation,an educational trust,and the minnesota chapter of associated builders and contractors abc,a trade association representing construction contractors.abc promotional materials noted that if companies joined the foundation and paid for employee apprenticeship classroom training through a foundation trust account,they may be able to establish an erisa plan and thereby be exempt from supervision ratios imposed by state local governments.in,wright electric joined the foundation and made quarterly contributions to its trust account.although wright electric made quarterly contributions to its dedicated foundation account,it often ran the account at a deficit.when there was a deficit,the foundation billed wright electric for the shortfall and wright electric then made a lump sum payment out of its general assets.
the training consisted of licensed electricians training and supervising unlicensed apprentices.in march,wright electric was performing electrical work at a job site in the city.on march,bradley cited vice and porter,who are licensed electricians,for violating the statute because they were supervising more than two unlicensed apprentices at the job site.
in june,wright electric filed an action in the district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to bar enforcement of the statute on the ground that it was unenforceable because it was preempted by erisa.in addition to alleging that the action was based on erisa,wright electric alleged that the action was based on the supremacy clause,article vi,clause,of the united states constitution.the district court granted the state motion for summary judgment.the district court first held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because wright electric apprenticeship training program was not an erisa plan.the district court reasoned that the apprenticeship program did not qualify as an erisa plan because,among other things,wright electric partially funded the program by lump sum payments from its general assets.see massachusetts morash,d.
although the district court believed that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction,it nonetheless considered the preemption issue.the district court concluded that erisa did not preempt the statute,relying,in part,on willmar,cooke,cir.willmar,cert.denied,d,in which the tenth circuit held that erisa did not preempt a state law prohibiting a licensed electrician from supervising more than one unlicensed person.this appeal follows.
discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
initially,we must resolve whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction,an issue we decide de novo.an erisa plan participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary may bring a civil action under a to recover benefits or enforce rights under an employee benefit plan or to enforce erisa.wright electric argues that the district court erred in requiring it to show that its apprenticeship program was an erisa plan in order to establish subject matter jurisdiction.in kulinski medtronic,cir kulinski,this court held that w here federal subject matter jurisdiction is based on erisa,but the evidence fails to establish the existence of an erisa plan,the claim must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.wright electric argues that kulinski is not controlling.we agree.in kulinski,the plaintiff,who was seeking severance benefits under an alleged erisa plan,base d his claim solely on erisa and j urisdiction likewise wa s asserted only on the basis of erisa.id.at.
in contrast here,wright electric is not seeking enforcement of erisa or plan terms.rather,it is seeking to bar enforcement of a state statute.in its complaint,the company asserted that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under because it was seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials from enforcing a state statute on the ground that it was preempted by federal law,in violation of the supremacy clause of the united states constitution.it is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights.shaw delta air lines,d shaw.in shaw,the supreme court explained that a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation,on the ground that such regulation is preempted by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause,must prevail,thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.id.indeed,the court noted that it frequently ha d resolved preemption disputes in a similar jurisdictional posture.id.citing,ray atlantic richfield,d jones rath packing,d.
in other words,a claim under the supremacy clause that a federal law preempts a state regulation is distinct from a claim for enforcement of that federal law.burgio campofelice,new york state dep t of labor,cir burgio quoting western air lines,port,cir.the coincidence that the federal law in question in this case contains its own preemption language,does not affect this distinction.also associated builders contractors saginaw valley area chapter perry,cir holding that even though plaintiff was not an erisa entity,court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider erisa preemption issue because plaintiff was seeking injunctive and declaratory relief from state regulation based on federal question jurisdiction.moreover,because its employees have been cited under the statute and the state represents it consistently enforces the statute,wright electric has standing to challenge enforcement of the state statute and rule.see burgio,at.
preemption 
we now turn to the preemption issue.erisa preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to an erisa covered employee benefit plan.a.wright electric argues that the district court erred in holding that erisa did not preempt the statute,relying on boise cascade peterson,cir boise cascade,cert.denied,d.in boise cascade,this court held that a state law regulating the supervision ratio of licensed pipefitters to unlicensed persons was preempted by erisa.the state argues that the preemption analysis of boise cascade is no longer controlling in light of intervening supreme court cases,beginning with new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d travelers.
we agree with the state.see southern california trust funds standard indus.elect,cir noting the breadth of federal preemption which governed our decisions prior to travelers is no longer applicable coyne delany selman,cir refusing to follow preemption cases.in boise cascade,this court began its analysis by noting that the erisa preemption clause is conspicuous for its breadth and e
