when an insurance company reorganization yields a pot of money that no one expected or even envisioned,who receives the proceeds in short,that is the issue this case requires the court to resolve.
bank of new york bny filed this interpleader action to resolve conflicting claims to stock it received from prudential insurance company of america demutualization,its reorganization from a mutual insurance company to a stock company.bny received the stock as to the former trustee of the aluminum company nsa pension plan nsa plan or plan.the plan terminated in,and the trustee used the plan assets to purchase two group annuity contracts,which satisfied the plan erisa obligations to the employees.
the claimants to the stock are a class of employees employees of the nsa represented by janowick,erwin,and kannapel,southwire company southwire the parent company of the former nsa,and century aluminum company century the purchaser of the former nsa assets.the district court addressed the claims in two phases,first concluding via summary judgment that southwire claims were superior to those of the employees,and next concluding that southwire claims trumped century.the employees and century both appeal.
regarding the employees appeal,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to southwire,as we conclude that both kentucky law and the nature of demutualization compel the conclusion that the employees are entitled to the proceeds,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.as to century appeal,we vacate the district court judgment and dismiss century appeal as moot,as we conclude that century could not have purchased from southwire that which southwire never owned.
background 
a.the pension plan 
in,nsa created the plan as a pension plan for the employees,who worked at an aluminum smelting plant nsa operated in hawesville,kentucky.under a plan,the benefits to be received by employees are fixed and the employer contribution is adjusted to whatever level is necessary to provide those benefits.power davis,d.thus,nsa paid contributions to the plan through a funding agent,and the plan held in trust and managed these funds on behalf of the employees.
the plan became governed by erisa upon erisa enactment in.in december,nsa terminated the plan.at that time,irving trust company irving was the designated plan trustee.consistent with erisa requirements,see b,irving purchased two group annuity contracts nos.and from the prudential insurance company of america prudential for the benefit of the employees.these annuity contracts constitute an irrevocable commitment on behalf of prudential to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan.b a i.see also,c,d.
after irving bought the annuity contracts which cost approximately million from prudential,some funds remained in the trust.consistent with erisa,the governing documents of the nsa plan provided that such surplus funds could revert to nsa once the trustee fully satisfied the plan obligations to its beneficiaries.see d joint appendix at nsa plan.nsa received approximately million under this provision.after all of the plan assets were distributed,irving status as trustee terminated sometime in.at that point,the plan was defunct.
subsequent transactions 
starting in the early,nsa underwent a series of corporate transactions with other companies under the umbrella of nsa parent corporation,southwire.in august,century agreed to purchase from southwire the hawesville plant and assets associated with its business.
prudential demutualization 
at the time irving purchased the annuity contracts,prudential was organized as a mutual insurance company under the laws of new jersey.a mutual insurance company has no shareholders and is instead owned by its policyholders.james smallenberger,restructuring mutual life insurance companies a practical guide through the process,drake.those who purchase policies from mutual insurance companies receive both membership interests,the right to elect directors and the right to receive a proportionate share of the company if it liquidates and contract rights,the obligations of the insurance company under the policy.id.at.
prior to,new jersey did not allow insurance companies to organize as stock companies.at nj dep t of banking ins.order no.new jersey law changed in,and in december,prudential board of directors adopted a plan to demutualize,that is,to reorganize from a mutual insurance company to a stock company.the demutualization plan was approved by policyholders in july,and within three months,the new jersey insurance commissioner approved the plan.id.prudential demutualization plan required the new company,prudential financial,pfi,to issue stock to eligible policyholders as consideration for their membership interests in the old company.
in early,pfi issued shares of stock to bny as the to irving.the stock was intended to compensate irving for the loss of membership interests that it held as the of the group annuities purchased to terminate the nsa plan.however,bny denied both that it was the and that it was entitled to the stock.soon,bny began receiving conflicting demands for the demutualization proceeds when southwire,the employees,and century all asserted entitlement to the stock.to settle these claims,bny filed its interpleader complaint on february,naming southwire,the employees,and century all as defendants.the district court had jurisdiction under the minimal diversity requirement of the federal interpleader statute because two of the claimants are diverse,as the employees are kentucky residents and southwire is organized as a delaware corporation.a state farm fire cas.tashire,d.
procedural history 
the district court certified a defendant class consisting of the employees and dismissed bny from the case,leaving the three claimants as parties to the litigation.it also granted bny permission to sell the stock and ordered it to deposit the proceeds with the court.accordingly,bny deposited approximately million with the district court.
the district court proceeded in two phases to settle the claimants dispute.first,it pitted southwire against the employees to determine which of those two parties had the better claim to the demutualization proceeds.on september,it granted summary judgment to southwire and denied summary judgment to the employees.
next,the district court decided whether century claim to the proceeds was superior to southwire.on august,it granted summary judgment to southwire and denied summary judgment to century.
both the employees and century appealed,and their appeals were consolidated for briefing and submission.we have jurisdiction over the employees and century appeals from the district court final judgment under.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment,dicarlo potter,cir,and will affirm a grant of summary judgment i f the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing the district court decision to grant summary judgment,we must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
iii.analysis 
the employees argue that southwire never had a right to the demutualization proceeds,and century argues that it purchased the right to the proceeds when it bought the hawesville plant from southwire in.because we conclude that the employees are correct,southwire never could have transferred the interest in the demutualization proceeds to century.
ultimately,we conclude that the employees are entitled to the demutualization proceeds for three separate reasons.first,we conclude that the terms of the annuity contract compel the conclusion that the employees are now the,and thus entitled to the demutualization proceeds.second,we conclude that under relevant contract principles,we would supply a term to the annuity contracts under restatement second of contracts entitling the employees to unforeseen demutualization proceeds.finally,we consider the nature of demutualization and conclude that southwire could not have had any claim to the demutualization proceeds because it never held any ownership interest in prudential.
terms of the annuity contract 
prudential demutualization plan entitles eligible policyholders,the owners of eligible policies and annuity contracts,at reorganization plan to demutualization compensation.at reorganization plan b.for group annuity contracts,it defines the designated as owners.at reorganization plan.here,the annuity contracts designate irving as the as trustee for the aluminum company pension plan.at.irving successor bny claims that irving status as ceased,presumably when its status as trustee of the nsa plan terminated in.the demutualization plan does not indicate how shares should be distributed when a policy lacks an owner 
because the demutualization plan does not resolve the dispute,we turn elsewhere.the department of labor dol has concluded that,in disputes over demutualization proceeds born from an annuity contract purchased to terminate an erisa plan the terms of the relevant annuity contracts and state law govern.dep t of labor,office of pension and welfare benefit programs op,wl.although the dol advisory opinion is not binding on us,it is worthy of some deference.christensen harris county,d quoting reno koray,d.interpretive guidance from administrative agencies that is not the product of formal,rulemaking is entitled to respect to the extent that th e interpretations have the power to persuade.id.quoting skidmore swift.the fifth circuit applied this standard and deferred to similar guidance from the dol in bussian rjr nabisco,cir.we conclude that the dol guidance is persuasive because a membership interest in a mutual insurance company is a precondition to any right to demutualization proceeds,and the annuity contract creates such interests.regardless of whether the annuity contract contemplates the right to demutualization proceeds,previous documents,the nsa plan documents could not have contemplated such a right,as they neither created nor encompassed membership interests in prudential.
we conclude that the terms of the annuity contracts entitle the employees to the demutualization proceeds.the parties do not press this argument in their briefs,but they have provided copies of the annuity contracts in the joint appendix.we address the parties primary argument,whether we should apply restatement second of contracts to supply a missing term to the annuity contracts,infra in part.
as noted above,prudential demutualization plan provides that,as owners of the contracts,are to receive consideration in the form of stock.the annuity contracts dub irving the,but this provision is of no help because,as noted above,irving successor claims that it is no longer the.the contracts further provide 
the at any time may,with the consent of the prudential,appoint a successor h owever,if the notifies the prudential that it will cease to exist or cease to perform the duties of the hereunder and no successor is appointed,this contract shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect 
at annuity contract at,annuity contract at.the record contains no indication that irving appointed a successor or notified prudential prior to that it would no longer perform the duties of.notably,the contracts are silent regarding who becomes the successor in this situation.
the primary object in construing a contract is to effectuate the intentions of the parties.cantrell supply,liberty mut.ins.kentucky courts have long held that in so doing,it is proper to consider the circumstances surrounding the parties,and the object of the contract,in addition to the contract language.owens.life ins,quoting mitchell ry.whe n a contract is silent on a vital matter,it is especially appropriate for courts to consider each of these factors,as well as the subject matter of the contract.cantrell supply,at.
here,these factors strongly indicate that the parties to the annuity contracts intended for the employees to step into irving shoes as the after irving withdrew.the purpose of the annuity contracts was to provide pension benefits to which the employees were entitled under the defunct nsa plan.accordingly,the employees are creditor beneficiaries of the contracts.see presnell const.managers,eh,quoting sexton taylor county.other than prudential,which is not a party to this case,only the employees have a direct interest in the annuity contracts.by contrast,southwire is neither a party to,nor a beneficiary of,the contracts.for these reasons,we conclude that the parties intent in entering the contract was that the employees would become the if irving were to step down 
restatement second of contracts 
aside from our analysis of the contract existing terms,we conclude that the employees are entitled to the demutualization proceeds under restatement second of contracts.the annuity contracts say nothing regarding demutualization,which is not surprising as demutualization was not legal in new jersey where prudential was located when irving purchased the annuity contracts from prudential on the employees behalf.because the annuity contracts do not contain a term regarding entitlement to demutualization proceeds,the employees urge the court to apply restatement of contracts second to supply the annuity contracts with a missing term.section states when the parties to a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties,a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.
southwire objects,claiming that kentucky courts have not endorsed.although no reported case in kentucky has applied this provision of the restatement,the kentucky supreme court has applied various other sections of the restatement,which demonstrates that the restatement is generally valid authority in kentucky.see,hargis baize,applying nucor,id.at stevens stevens.further,kentucky courts have recognized the principle that if a contract is silent on a certain point,the law will imply an obligation to carry out the purpose for which the contract was made exactly the substance of.old republic ins.ashley,citing warfield nat.gas allen.richardson eastland,where the contract is silent we must interpret the intent of the parties.sitting in diversity,our duty is to apply the law of the forum state as announced by its highest court.west bay exploration aig specialty agencies of,cir.where the relevant state supreme court has not spoken on an issue,we apply the rule that we believe the state supreme court would apply if it were to decide the case.himmel ford motor,cir.under these circumstances,we believe the kentucky supreme court would employ restatement.accordingly,so do we.
section comment d instructs courts to apply community standards of fairness to determine a term that is reasonable in the circumstances.here,it is clear that none of the parties expected to receive the demutualization proceeds,which will constitute a windfall to whoever receives them.it is also clear that nsa decision to terminate the plan in relieved it of any risk associated with the,the responsibility to provide whatever level of funding is necessary to yield the fixed level of benefits promised.see hughes aircraft jacobson,d noting that under an ongoing defined benefit plan,the employer typically bears the entire investment risk of the consequences of plan cover any underfunding as the result of a shortfall that may occur from the plan investments 
at the same time,the termination of the nsa plan shifted risk onto the employees.on paper,at least,the employees are entitled to exactly the same level of benefits under the annuity contracts as they were under the nsa plan,but crucially,their benefits are no longer guaranteed.under erisa,ongoing pension plans are guaranteed by the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc.see et.not so for the annuity contracts.if prudential were to become insolvent and default on its obligations under the annuity contracts,the employees would be unable to recover the full value of the benefits.accordingly,the nsa plan very event that necessitated purchase of
