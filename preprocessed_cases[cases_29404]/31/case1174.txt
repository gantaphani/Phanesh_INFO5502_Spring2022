when gore associates,gore closed its phoenix,arizona,electronic parts plant in,many of its employees lost their jobs before they qualified for an additional year of vesting and benefit accrual credit under gore stock ownership and pension benefit plan plan.gore plan used the method to calculate vesting and benefit accrual.that method counts the period of time the employee is employed,and not the number of hours an employee has worked during a given period.
two classes of gore former phoenix employees now appeal the final judgment of the district court granting defendants motion for summary judgment.the five claims presented on appeal center on three arguments.the employees primarily assert that the regulation violates erisa vesting and benefit accrual requirements.subsidiary to that claim,they allege that even if the regulation is lawful,gore nonetheless violated it.finally,they allege that gore violated its own plan when it interpreted the term layoff to mean a temporary absence and not a permanent loss of employment.because the regulation is valid,and because gore did not violate it or its own plan,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in july,gore announced that it was closing its phoenix plant.gore repeatedly described to its employees,both in oral and written form,that the upcoming loss of employment was a layoff.however,it also circulated a warn notice to the affected employees,in accordance with a,stating that the phoenix plant was closing and that due to the business relocation,your employment with gore will be terminated,effective september.there is no dispute that the employees in this suit were in fact permanently terminated from their jobs at the gore plant.
one of the employees who lost her job due to the plant closing,nedra johnson,filed a complaint with the committee that administered the plan committee,seeking credit for an additional year of service.johnson benefits had not yet vested under the plan because she had worked at gore for more than four years,but less than five.under the plan,employees were required to work five years before they vested in the benefits.each additional year of service,from april to march,counted towards the accrual of benefits.
the committee relied on plan section to deny johnson request.this section states that 
your severance from service will occur on the earlier of 
the date on which you quit,retire,are discharged,or die or 
the first anniversary of the first day of a period during which you remain absent from employment with or without pay for any other reason,such as your vacation,holiday,sickness,disability,leave of absence or layoff.
the letter denying johnson benefits explained that the term layoff refers to a temporary absence as opposed to a permanent severance with the company.the committee determined that johnson termination was permanent and she was,therefore,not eligible for an additional year of credit under plan section.
johnson filed a complaint alleging violations of erisa,to,in september.motions for class certification soon followed.johnson was named as the representative for class a plaintiffs former gore employees seeking benefits even though they had less than five years of service.deborah nelson was named as the representative for class b plaintiffs former gore employees who were already vested,but could not share in gore plan contribution for the year because they lost their jobs prior to the last day of the plan year.
on november,the district court denied employees class certification motions without prejudice,and determined that the committee denial of benefits should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.almost three months later,the employees moved to amend the complaint to add individual members of the committee as defendants.the employees also sought to add counts for alleged violations of erisa disclosure,vesting,and benefit accrual requirements,a count for breach of fiduciary duty,and another count for participation in that breach by james brown,legal counsel for the plan.the court granted the employees motion,but refused to add the fiduciary duty claims.
on august,both parties stipulated to a revised second amended complaint.this complaint withdrew count i,under which the employees had alleged that gore violated erisa when it failed to credit class members who had already accumulated hours of service in their last plan year.the employees agreed to withdraw this count because of the potential for conflict.in other words,some members in class a or class b may not have worked hours within the plan year and would therefore not gain,and perhaps lose,credit.count ii,which alleged that gore had violated the regulation,remained in the complaint.
after count i was withdrawn,the parties stipulated to the class certification and the district court issued an order certifying both classes of plaintiffs.shortly thereafter,both parties filed for summary judgment.in addition,the employees filed a renewed motion on the standard of review,asking the court to review the committee denial of the employees benefits claims de novo,and not for abuse of discretion.the latter motion was based on an to brown that had not been previously disclosed in discovery.the employees alleged that the proves that the committee members were influenced by a material conflict of interest,thereby meriting de novo review.
the at issue reflects a conversation that holly williams,a committee member,had with outside counsel robert meyer.in the,williams told brown that meyer had informed her that plan section was typical department of labor language,and that leave of absence and layoff are used when the person is expected to return to work.furthermore,she conveyed that meyer told her that if we wanted to stretch it,the committee could use leave of absence as a term code for the gore employees who lost their jobs because of the closure of the phoenix plant.williams expressed in her to brown that she was uncomfortable labeling the employees as being on a leave of absence because she was sure how it would affect other benefits and whether employees would be treated differently than vested employees.she also expressed concern that if the and vested employees were treated differently,they might receive different benefits because the value of the stock could be higher or lower at the time of the distributions.she concluded by stating that she felt very uncomfortable stretching the definition of layoff and leave of absence,and mentioned that she had not shared any of meyer advice with anyone else besides brown.
the district court denied the employees renewed motion on the applicable standard of review and granted gore motion for summary judgment.

discussion 
i.the regulation 
generally,the regulation allows for the calculation of an employee statutory entitlement with respect to eligibility to participate,vesting and benefit accrual with reference to the total period of time which elapses while the employee is employed a a ii.upon severance from employment,the employee is no longer capable of accruing time for either vesting or the accrual of benefits.the severance from service provision,which substantially mirrors gore plan section,states that 
for purposes of this section,a severance from service shall occur on the earlier of 
i the date on which an employee quits,retires,is discharged or dies or 
ii the first anniversary of the first date of a period in which an employee remains absent from service with or without pay with the employer or employers maintaining the plan for any reason other than a quit,retirement,discharge or death,such as vacation,holiday,sickness,disability,leave of absence or layoff.
the regulation was initially promulgated,in temporary form,by the department of labor in.see.in,the department of the treasury,to whom some authority over erisa had been transferred,promulgated the final regulation.see swaida ibm ret.plan,aff,cir per curiam.the regulation was a reflection of the manner in which vesting and benefit accrual for many private retirement benefit plans were already being calculated across the country.see id.at.
the regulation was promulgated at the same time as,and as an alternative to,the hours of service method,which credits service for vesting and benefit accrual if an employee works hours within a period.see.to to.the method allows several equivalencies.see c f.these equivalencies provide employers with alternate methods for determining an employee hours of service.generally,they free the employer from keeping an actual tally of every hour worked and allow employers to derive an hours worked figure,for example,on the basis of an employee days of employment,weeks of employment,or months of employment.see e.essentially,the equivalencies lessen the administrative burden for both employers and employees of maintaining compliance with the method.
ii.does the regulation violate erisa 
the employees argue that the regulation violates the minimum standard,the vesting,and the benefit accrual provisions of erisa because it fails to require the counting of hours of service see a a,b a,b a.other courts have addressed the question of whether the method violates the vesting provisions of erisa and have upheld the regulation.we agree with the second circuit in swaida,the seventh circuit in coleman interco.divisions plans,cir,and the eighth circuit in jefferson vickers,cir,and hold that the regulation does not violate erisa.
in swaida,various factors compelled the district court,whose opinion was unanimously adopted by the second circuit,to find that the regulation does not violate erisa.see swaida.at.the district court emphasized the statutory goal of protecting the pension rights of employees,the need to offer an alternative to the administratively burdensome method,and the authority congress delegated to the labor and treasury departments to issue regulations to clarify the terms hour of service,see a c,b b,and year of service,see a a.swaida.at.it also noted the broad authority of both the secretary of labor and the secretary of the treasury to promulgate regulations governing erisa.id.at.
the seventh circuit in coleman was confronted with a claim similar to that in swaida from an employee who quit before he was fully vested in his employer plan.coleman,at.the employee argued that he should be credited with his final year of service because he had worked hours.see id.at.the seventh circuit noted that the plan used the method and reasoned that if the regulation was valid,coleman would lose.see id.at.the court emphasized the universal use of the method,and ultimately concluded that the regulation is valid.see id.
the other courts to address the issue have also upheld the regulation,see jefferson,at cir,or have specifically refrained from addressing the argument the employees advanced in the district where the regulation does not operate as equitably as the rule,it is unlawful.see automated packaging.comm r,wl.
in order to determine the validity of this regulation,we must first examine the statutory language,as well as any extrinsic evidence,to determine if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue.montana clark,quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if congress has made an express delegation for the agency to fill a gap in the statutory scheme,we must affirm the agency construction unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.
the debated provisions of erisa show that congress delegated authority to the secretary to define the term hour of service.a c.the statute also indicates that the term year of service,for vesting purposes,means a period during which the participant has completed of service.a a b a.lastly,the statute delegates authority to the secretary to define,on any reasonable and consistent basis,the term year of participation for benefit accrual purposes.b a.
central to the employees argument is the claim that the plain language of a a and b a should govern,limiting all benefits plans to the method.this position is weakened,however,by the delegations of authority granted in a c and b a.these closely related provisions make the plain language of a a and b a ambiguous,and defeat the argument that the words of the statute,without more,embody congress intent.clark,at.in other words,it is clear under b a that congress intended the secretary to determine how to measure a year of participation for purposes of benefit accrual.it is difficult to conceive of a scheme that would limit the method for vesting purposes,but allow other reasonable and consistent methods for purposes of accrual.these conflicting commands require us to look beyond the employees plain meaning argument.see id.at the literal words of the statute are presumptively conclusive of legislative intent,but that presumption may be defeated by contrary indications of intent also evident on the face of the statute.
as the parties documented,the legislative intent is not conclusive on the specific issue at hand.see also swaida.at finding that the provision was not discussed extensively in either the senate or house of representatives.it is beyond dispute,however,that one of the primary goals of erisa is to reduce the burden of compliance with erisa provisions by plan administrators,employers,and participants and beneficiaries.a.eliminating the requirement of counting every hour an employee works furthers this goal.in light of this clear statement of congressional purpose,and congress express delegation to define the terms hour of service and year of participation,it can not be said that congress expressly foreclose d the construction embodied in the challenged regulation.clark,at.
therefore,the court must defer to the agency regulation unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.the regulation is neither arbitrary nor capricious because it is well within the secretary compass to determine,on policy grounds,that the method,on the whole,is reasonable and consistent with the method.in fact,the method is often more generous to employees,as the employees here implicitly conceded by withdrawing count i on the grounds that certain class members would not gain,and perhaps lose,vesting and benefit accrual credit under the regime.given the secretary authority to define the term year of participation,the employees argument that the method is invalid because it is not as equitable as the rule in every application amounts to an impermissible challenge to the apparent agency decision that the rule is generally reasonable and consistent.see chevron,at.
nor is the regulation contrary to the statute,as the employees contend,solely because it transforms the hour of service requirement into a period of time requirement.the regulation is closely related to the equivalencies listed in c f.although the regulation is not included as one of the equivalencies,it was promulgated at the same time and shares the same spirit of allowing employers to avoid actually counting every hour of an employee service.
therefore,the express delegations granted to the secretary to define hour of service and year of participation,coupled with the legislative goal of minimizing the burden of administering benefit plans,lead to the conclusion that the regulation is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the governing statutory provisions.
iii.did gore violate the regulation 
the employees maintain that even if the regulation is lawful,gore violated it when it immediately severed their service under a b i,and failed to credit them with an additional year of service under a b ii.we disagree.
we review the district court interpretation of the regulation de novo.student loan fund of idaho,united states of,cir amended by.first,the district court held that the employees argument that gore application of the regulation had to be as equitable as the hour rule ignored the language of the regulation itself.in light of the discussion above,it is not necessary to return to this argument.second,and more importantly,the court held that the employees misconstrue
