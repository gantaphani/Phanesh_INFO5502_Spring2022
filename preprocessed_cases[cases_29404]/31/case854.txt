a multiemployer welfare trust filed suit under erisa in against the gorman construction company to recover some in delinquent contributions including interest and attorneys fees for the period.after a bench trial,the district judge held the suit barred by the doctrine of laches and so entered judgment for the company.d.
gorman had signed a collective bargaining agreement with a teamsters local in.the agreement required gorman to contribute to a teamsters welfare trust a specified dollar amount weekly rising from in the first year of the agreement to in the last year of the latest successor agreement for any employee who drove a concrete truck during the week,however small a fraction of his work week the driving occupied.he might drive such a truck for only an hour a week,yet gorman would have to contribute the same dollar amount as if he spent his whole work week in that activity.this was an expensive proposition imagine having to make a weekly contribution for a employee who worked one hour a week,and gorman failed to make the required contributions,as was discovered by an audit conducted by the plan during the term of the collective bargaining agreement.dale stewart,however,who was both the head of the local union and the chairman of the welfare trust,told eric leonhardt gorman proprietor,according to the latter,that as a favor to him he had made the audit go away.
the collective bargaining agreement was renewed,with substantially the same terms except for the amount of the employer contributions,in and.in the trust conducted another audit,again found that gorman was not making the required contributions,and this time sued.gorman admits that the trust has made a prima facie case for the recovery of the delinquent contributions,but,as we said,the district judge upheld the defense of laches.
laches,the corruption of an old french word lasche meaning lax,in law means culpable delay in suing.traditionally,suits in equity were not subject to statutes of limitations,but such a suit could be dismissed on the basis of unreasonable,prejudicial delay by the plaintiff.piper aircraft,cir concurring opinion.the contrast is between rules and standards as regulatory devices.a statute of limitations cuts off the right to sue at a fixed date after the plaintiff cause of action accrued.laches cuts off the right to sue when the plaintiff has delayed too long in suing.too long for this purpose means that the plaintiff delayed inexcusably and the defendant was harmed by the delay.costello united states,d united states administrative enterprises,cir herman city of chicago,cir whiting united states,cir ivani contracting city of new york,cir.
the parties agree that erisa does not contain a limitations periods for suits against employers to recover contributions owed to a multiemployer plan.closest is f,which does cover suits by multiemployer plans,but only suits for withdrawal liability,jay conison,employee benefit plans in a nutshell ed,which this suit is not gorman has not withdrawn from the teamsters plan.
the usual practice when a federal statute fails to specify a limitations period for suits under it has been to borrow a state analogous statute of limitations,and that is what we and other courts have done in the case of erisa suits for the recovery of employers delinquent contributions.central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund jordan,cir felton unisource,cir see generally doe blue cross blue shield united,cir harrison digital health plan,cir per curiam adamson armco,cir.we remarked in doe that a borrowed statute of limitations can be either state or federal,but the parties to this case do not argue for borrowing a federal statute of limitations,and we note that trustees of wyoming laborers health welfare plan morgen oswood construction,cir,a case similar to ours,refused to borrow the limitations period in the national labor relations act.instead it borrowed the forum state statute of limitations for suits on written contracts that was the type of suit the court thought most like a suit for delinquent contributions.the illinois statute of limitations that the district court borrowed for use in this case is also ten years.it is possible that some other statute of limitations,state or federal,would make a better fit with the nature and purpose of a suit for delinquent erisa contributions,but we are not called upon to decide that,as the parties are not contending for a different statute of limitations.
for purposes of this appeal,therefore,it as if erisa contained a statute of limitations and this raises the question not discussed by the parties when if ever laches can be used to shorten a statute of limitations.it turns out that just as various tolling doctrines can be used to lengthen the period for suit specified in a statute of limitations,so laches can be used to contract it.hutchinson spanierman,cir maksym loesch,cir martin consultants administrators,cir concurring opinion.this is regardless of whether the suit is at law or in equity,because,as with many equitable defenses,the defense of laches is equally available in suits at law.hot wax,turtle wax,cir aukerman chaides construction,en banc.we may assume without having to decide that,as with equitable tolling and question is unsettled equitable estoppel,the relevant doctrine of laches is that of the state whose statute of limitations is being borrowed.see shropshear corporation counsel,cir.
we are mindful that some courts have invoked a presumption against the use of laches to shorten the statute of limitations,herman miller,palazzetti imports exports,cir united states rodriguez aguirre,cir lyons partnership morris costumes,cir.one even made the presumption conclusive,ivani contracting city of new york,supra,at,on the odd ground that abridging a statutory period for suit by means of a doctrine is in tension with the separation of powers.when congress fails to enact a statute of limitations,a court that borrows a state statute of limitations but permits it to be abridged by the doctrine of laches is not invading congressional prerogatives.ashley boyle famous corned beef,cir en banc.it is merely filling a legislative hole.and none of the courts we cited questions the use of the doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling to lengthen the statutory laches,as the hutchinson,maksym,and martin opinions cited above all point out the majority as well as the concurring opinion in martin,see at,is the mirror image of equitable estoppel.
this point turns out to be important in this case,and so we take a moment to explain it.the doctrine of equitable estoppel allows the plaintiff to extend the statute of limitations if the defendant has done something that made the plaintiff reasonably believe that he had more time to sue,labonte united states,cir bomba belvidere,cir wall construction general laborers union,local,cir.one example is the defendant promising not to interpose the defense of the statute of limitations,athmer equipment,cir cada baxter healthcare,cir another is his concealing the cause of action from the plaintiff,santa maria pacific bell,cir rhodes guiberson oil tools division,cir pruet production ayles,cir a third is promising to pay the plaintiff claim,bomba belvidere,supra,at mcallister fdic,cir.see generally shropshear corporation counsel,supra,at.conversely,if a plaintiff does something that reasonably induces the defendant to believe he wo be sued and the defendant ability to defend himself against the plaintiff suit is impaired as a result,the plaintiff can be barred by the defense of laches from suing.wauchope of state,cir transworld airlines,american coupon exchange,cir eeoc alioto fish,cir dan dobbs,law of remedies,ed.what is sauce for the goose the plaintiff seeking to extend the statute of limitations is sauce for the gander the defendant seeking to contract it.
laches is thus a form of equitable estoppel rather than a thing apart.maksym loesch,supra,at thompson board of county commissioners,callenders,beckman,idaho,central improvement cambria steel,fed,cir per curiam,aff under the name kansas city southern ry.guardian trust.dobbs,supra.the only difference is which party asserts it.that is not a material difference the fact that laches is asserted defensively by the employer sued by the plan,whereas equitable estoppel is used offensively to obtain extra benefits,does not destroy the symmetry between laches and equitable estoppel.failure to recover employer contributions imposes the same cost on the plan as being forced to pay additional benefits in the same amount.
the symmetry is particularly marked in this case because it is really a case of laches at all,at least in the technical sense,though that is the term the district judge used and the terminology is supremely unimportant for if we are right that laches and equitable estoppel are the same thing,it ca matter which term is used.the reason it is not a case of laches,strictly speaking,is that the teamsters trust is not suing to recover the delinquent contributions identified in the first audit.gorman argument is not that the second suit,the suit on the later delinquencies,should have been filed sooner,but that it should have been filed at all because the company was misled by the disappearance of the first audit.the company is really arguing that the disappearance should estop the trust to bring a suit for delinquencies,even if the suit is filed immediately after those delinquencies accrue.it is the fact that the conduct claimed to create an estoppel consists mainly of delay that gives the defense a laches flavor,since laches means delay.
since laches and equitable estoppel are,if not,since this is actually a case of the latter rather than of the question arises whether equitable estoppel can ever be a defense to a suit by a multiemployer plan for delinquent contributions.clearly not when it is invoked on the basis of words or acts by one of the employers in an effort to wrest larger benefits for the plaintiff participant or beneficiary than the terms of the plan allow.central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund gerber truck service,cir en banc black tic investment,cir bakery confectionery union industry international pension fund ralph grocery,cir benson brower moving storage,cir.if equitable estoppel were successfully interposed in such a case,the employer would potentially be imposing uncompensated costs on the other employers belonging to the plan.however,as assumed in illinois conference of teamsters employers welfare fund mrowicki,cir,and trustees of wyoming laborers health welfare plan morgen oswood construction,supra,at,a different conclusion could be reached in a case such as this,where estoppel is sought on the basis of words or conduct by a responsible official of the plan itself.true,estoppel ca be used to allow oral representations to expand the terms of an erisa plan,bowerman stores,cir downs world color press,cir,but the teamsters trust has not pointed to any plan language that the invocation of laches,on the basis of stewart alleged assurances or otherwise,would violate.we have held that equitable estoppel can be used to toll the statute of limitations in a suit against an erisa plan for benefits,doe blue cross blue shield united,supra,at,and that is similar to what the district court did in this case.gorman defense fails not because erisa bars such a defense,but because its elements have not been proved.
we can clear away some underbrush by noting the absence of any suggestion that stewart,by promising to make the first audit go away if that is what he is leonhardt word against his and the district judge did not decide which one was telling the truth,was trying to hurt trick it into thinking it would never have to pay the contributions called for by its collective bargaining agreements with stewart local.it could not be to the plan advantage to pull such a trick there is no contention that the interest payable on delinquent contributions makes a plan better off if it has to sue to recover such contributions than if it received the contributions as they came due.at worst stewart was careless if he promised to forgive delinquent contributions due under the collective bargaining agreement the question is whether his carelessness made leonhardt reasonably believe that delinquent contributions under future collective bargaining agreements were likewise forgiven.
that leonhardt belief had to be reasonable is worth stressing,for certainly when laches is predicated on careless rather than deliberate conduct by the plaintiff in the latter case it is canonically referred to as acquiescence rather than laches,piper aircraft,supra,at,illustrating the legal profession occupational hazard of multiplying distinctions unnecessarily,the defendant fault is relevant.rozen district of columbia,per curiam bernard gulf oil,cir,cir en banc,aff on other grounds,d.while not a defense to intentional misconduct,the victim fault is a defense full or partial to unintentional misconduct,fdic grace,cir gilchrist timber itt rayonier,cir per curiam.
as a matter of fact,the particular fault that consists in being unreasonable in relying on a promise or other words or conduct of an opposing party is a defense in all estoppel cases,office professional employees international union,local brownsville general hospital,cir linkous united states,cir,including all cases of laches,martin consultants administrators,supra,at bennett tucker,cir,whether the conduct giving rise to the claim of estoppel or laches is intentional or accidental.innumerable decisions establish this proposition for ordinary cases of equitable estoppel,as distinct from the amphibian we have here,labonte united states,cir ashafa city of chicago,cir santa maria pacific bell,cir office professional employees international union,local brownsville general hospital,supra,at.
the reasoning behind these decisions is that a statement no reasonable person would have relied on was probably not intended to probably did mislead,illinois tool works,cir.as we have explained in the related context of fraud,the victim of a fraud can not close his eyes to a risk that is obvious,even if he does not himself perceive the risk.although not required to expend a substantial effort to protect himself as a tort victim in a regime of contributory negligence will often be required to do,the potential victim of a fraud may not ignore a manifest danger.that is recklessness.it differs by only a shade,if that,from intentional conscious assumption of risk that defeats liability under the first aspect of the duty of reasonable reliance as we conceive it.the requirement of not being reckless serves in the law of fraud not only to define a duty,but also to disambiguate evidentiary ambiguities concerning the very existence of the fraud.if the victim acted recklessly in the face of the alleged fraud,it is difficult to believe that he was actually deceived he may simply regret having assumed a risk that has turned out badly.the requirement of justifiable reliance backstops the jury determination of actual reliance.id.at citations omitted.
in contrast,reliance is not an element of equitable tolling at all,see singletary continental illinois national bank trust,cir stitt williams,cir,the distinct doctrine that permits the statute of limitations to be extended in cases where,without fault by the defendant,the plaintiff is unable by the exercise of due diligence to obtain the information that he needs in order to be able to sue within the statutory period.the basis for the extension is not the plaintiff reliance on words or actions of the defendant,so the issue of reasonable reliance does not even arise.
but here there had to be reliance and it had to be reasonable.as to whether there was reliance,we note that leonhardt testified that he did understand the making the audit go away comment that he attributes to stewart to mean that there would never be a subsequent audit under a subsequent collective bargaining agreement.he also testified that stewart did not tell him he was making the collective bargaining agreements go away never indicate d that gorman would be immune from any future audits and never told him that gorman did not have to comply with the collective bargaining agreements.but even if,as gorman argues and we greatly dou
