we will affirm.
stanley harrow was insured under the prudential healthcare hmo plan through his wife,debra harrow.in,harrow was prescribed viagra,an drug,for impotence on april,harrow filled his prescription for viagra at a local pharmacy.during this visit,his pharmacist informed him that his insurance did not cover viagra,charged him to fill the viagra prescription,and instructed him to call prudential.upon returning home,and harrow reviewed the prudential healthcare hmo plan handbook.on that same day,harrow called the claims department number listed on the back of the prudential prescription card.she was informed by an unidentified person that the plan did not cover viagra because it was a new drug.she was also advised to save her receipts for future reimbursement in case viagra became covered.the harrows never contacted prudential again about viagra coverage and never refilled the prescription.on may,a month after being told viagra was not covered,harrow filed suit under erisa.in june or july of,prudential announced in a press release that it would not provide coverage for viagra.
prudential procedures for receiving and resolving complaints raised by covered persons are set forth in the prudential healthcare hmo plan handbook under the heading grievance resolution procedure,the process is described as follows 
complaints 
complaints can be received by the membership services coordinator in the prudential healthcare member services department by phone,mail or a personal visit to the prudential healthcare office.the membership services coordinator will provide an answer to the complainant within days of a complaint receipt.if your problem is not resolved to your satisfaction,you may file,in writing,a formal grievance.
grievances 
there are two steps in the grievance procedure.at any state of this process,the member has the right to request that prudential healthcare appoint a member of its staff,who has had no direct involvement with the case,to represent the member.
if the complaint procedure does not resolve your problem to your satisfaction,you may file,in writing,a formal grievance.the initial grievance will be reviewed and investigated by an initial grievance committee the committee will provide a response,in writing,to the complainant within days of receipt of the grievance,including the reasons for the decision and the member appeal rights.this decision is binding unless the member appeals the decision 
appeal of grievances 
if an appeal is desired,the complainant will be advised to formally request,in writing,the convening of the second level of grievance review committee this committee shall consist of at least prudential healthcare plan members 
an ultimate appeal procedure is available to the member.if the member is not satisfied with the decision of the second level grievance review committee,the decision may be appealed to the pennsylvania department of health.
several prudential officials testified the outcome of the internal appellate process was not harrow,d at.no evidence was presented demonstrating that harrow or any proposed class member initiated a grievance or appeal under prudential grievance resolution procedure.id.
prudential filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court denied without prejudice on january.in the same order,the district court adjourned,without date,plaintiff motion for class certification so that discovery could be undertaken.the originally named plaintiff,stanley harrow,died on june,and his wife was substituted as the named plaintiff and proposed class representative the district court subsequently granted defendant motion for summary judgment on december.id.at 
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendant on plaintiff wrongful denial of benefits claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies making one step which could be construed as an initial complaint does not constitute exhaustion of all remedies,particularly when the plan includes a concrete description of the appeal process available.id.at.the district court also concluded the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement did not apply because neither harrow nor any identified potential class member ever pursued any appellate procedures with prudential.id.at.in addition,the district court granted summary judgment on plaintiff breach of fiduciary duty claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,concluding plaintiff was actually seeking benefits and therefore was subject to the exhaustion doctrine.id.at.

a.the legal effect of stanley harrow death on his.survivability of erisa claims 
because the original named plaintiff has died in the course of these proceedings,we must consider whether his erisa claim survives.actions that are remedial in nature generally survive the death of a party.khan grotnes metalforming.because congress intended erisa to be remedial,erisa actions survive death.see b it is hereby declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans.see also duchow state teamsters conference pension retirement fund,cir khan.at.therefore,harrow may pursue her husband claims 
mootness of harrow claims 
we must also determine whether an article iii case or controversy survives harrow death.parole comm geraghty,d identifying two aspects of mootness w hen the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.quoting powell mccormack,d.the mootness issue implicates our jurisdiction.steel citizens for a better env t,d chong dist,cir inasmuch as mootness would divest us of jurisdiction to consider this appeal,we are obligated to address this issue as a threshold matter.citing rogin bensalem township,cir.
harrow initially asked for injunctive relief,declaratory relief,and damages.harrow concedes the claim for injunctive relief is now moot because of her husband death.her claim for declaratory relief is also moot because harrow can not benefit from a declaration of prudential obligations under the plan.cas.pac.coal oil.basically,the question in each case is whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.but harrow still has a claim for damages,reimbursement of the spent on the viagra prescription.therefore,plaintiff damage claim is not extinguished by harrow death.
summary judgment was properly granted on plaintiff benefits claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies 
an erisa beneficiary may bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of his plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan a b.except in limited circumstances a federal court will not entertain an erisa claim unless the plaintiff has exhausted the remedies available under the plan.weldon kraft,cir citing wolf,at zipf am,cir see also amato bernard,cir s ound policy requires the application of the exhaustion doctrine in suits under erisa.courts require exhaustion of administrative remedies to help reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits under erisa to promote the consistent treatment of claims for benefits to provide a nonadversarial method of claims settlement and to minimize the costs of claims settlement for all concerned.amato,at.moreover,trustees of an erisa plan are granted broad fiduciary rights and responsibilities under erisa and implementation of the exhaustion requirement will enhance their ability to expertly and efficiently manage their funds by preventing premature judicial intervention in their processes.see also zipf,at when a plan participant claims that he or she has unjustly been denied benefits,it is appropriate to require participants first to address their complaints to the fiduciaries to whom congress,in section,assigned the primary responsibility for evaluating claims for benefits.
a plaintiff is excused from exhausting administrative procedures under erisa if it would be futile to do so.berger edgewater steel,cir although the exhaustion requirement is strictly enforced,courts have recognized an exception when resort to the administrative process would be futile.plaintiffs merit waiver of the exhaustion requirement when they provide a clear and positive showing of futility.brown cont l baking,see also davenport harry abrams,cir exhaustion not excused because correspondence with employer did not amount to an unambiguous application for benefits and a formal or informal administrative decision denying benefits such that it is clear that seeking further administrative review would be futile quotation omitted fallick nationwide mut.ins,cir a plaintiff must show that it is certain that his claim will be denied on appeal,not merely that he doubts that an appeal will result in a different decision.quoting lindemann mobil oil,cir tomczyscyn teamsters,local health welfare fund,plaintiffs must demonstrate that a policy is so fixed that an appeal would serve no purpose scholl qualmed,d,dismissing viagra claim brought under the federal employee health benefits act because futility not demonstrated where plaintiff was unhappy with coverage limitation,but did not directly appeal.
whether to excuse exhaustion on futility grounds rests upon weighing several factors,including whether plaintiff diligently pursued administrative relief whether plaintiff acted reasonably in seeking immediate judicial review under the circumstances existence of a fixed policy denying benefits failure of the insurance company to comply with its own internal administrative procedures and testimony of plan administrators that any administrative appeal was futile.of course,all factors may not weigh equally.see berger,at metz united counties,d,relying on berger.
in berger,we affirmed a finding of futility where the district court excused three of four plaintiffs seeking retirement under a particular pension plan from exhausting administrative remedies.at.we agreed the blanket denial of applications for a particular retirement edgewater failure to comply with the plan administrative in favor of concluding that any resort by these employees to the administrative process would have been futile.id.but we also affirmed the denial of the futility exception to a fourth plaintiff who had never asked for the specific type of retirement plan,holding we agree with the district court conclusion that because kier did not request retirement,he is precluded from seeking judicial relief on his claims seeking to enforce the terms of the plan.id.the district court here found harrow case to be more like that of the fourth plaintiff for whom the futility exception was not granted.the court also cited to metz,in which none of the plaintiffs had filed an application for enhanced benefits as required under the severance plan.see metz,d at.
other courts of appeals have addressed whether the futility exception applies in circumstances that more closely mirror our case.these cases involve plaintiffs who,like harrow,have requested plan benefits.given the policies underlying the exhaustion requirement,these courts have been reluctant to grant the exception without clear evidence of futility,bourgeois pension plan for employees of santa fe int l,cir weiner klais,cir refusing to excuse exhaustion because plaintiff did not allege any factual basis for his futility claim diaz,at denying futility exception where claimants were delinquent in filing an administrative appeal,even though insurance company representative said,they not going to pay,because court found record contains nothing but speculation to suggest that the administrators would have reached a preconceived result in that respect.see also wilson globe specialty prods.d,requiring exhaustion where administrator arguably evidenced an intent to refuse plaintiff claim because court refused to predict how administrator would have decided the claim on review kulik metro.life ins,wl,at,unanswered letter summarizing phone conversation with plan administrator does not demonstrate futility because the letter contained no request for information and no reference to plaintiff intent to appeal denial of his claims 
here,the district court summarized the evidence as follows 
the harrows did not pursue any action beyond this initial telephonic inquiry to prudential they never refilled the prescription for viagra in june,prudential made public statements that it would not cover viagra.cave dep.at.lisa head and anthony kotin have been deposed on the issue of prudential appeals process.defendant exhs.c,d.at head deposition,she stated that the fact that prudential policy was to deny coverage of viagra would not mean that all appeals would be automatically denied.
q under those circumstances,would you expect any appeal to be successful 
i would expect that the appeal would go through the process that we outlined in previous testimony and that they would be given a fair assessment of the information available by that committee i would expect that it would go through the process.i do know that that would be upheld in every circumstance.
head dep.at,defendant exh.c.however,there is evidence from internal within prudential that perhaps the policy was more uniform than suggested by head and kotin.for example,one message stated i carboning others just to ensure that we are clear that there is no local authority to approve coverage for viagra even on a single case exception basis or for a specific claimant.gottsch,exh.i.finally,there is no evidence that any formal appeal from a denial of viagra coverage was ever taken by any person who might arguably be a class member.
harrow,d at.because the harrows took no steps beyond an initial telephonic inquiry,the district court held that plaintiff did not qualify for the futility exception.id.
we see no abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to apply the futility exception to the exhaustion doctrine.harrow made one telephone call to prudential before instituting an erisa suit.and harrow reviewed the plan handbook outlining complaint procedures,but none were filed.the press release announcing prudential general policy of denying coverage was made at least one month after harrow brought suit.harrow was told to save her receipts in the event prudential did cover the drug,suggesting that internal administrative procedures would not necessarily be futile.furthermore,prudential administrators testified that the outcome of its internal appeal procedures was not predetermined,although as the district court noted,there was conflicting testimony in this regard.viewing the facts and weighing the relevant factors,we agree with the district court that a plaintiff in these cir
