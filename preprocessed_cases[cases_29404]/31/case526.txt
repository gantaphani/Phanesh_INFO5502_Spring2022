the six named plaintiffs,all workers who formerly performed services for mobil corporation while on the payroll of companies,filed this class action complaint seeking retroactive employment benefits from exxonmobil corporation and other defendants hereinafter collectively mobil,after the merger of mobil corporation and exxon corporation,pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,as amended,et.the district court granted summary judgment for mobil.finding no error,we affirm.
like many companies,mobil seeks to attract and reward capable employees by offering a variety of health,vacation,and other benefits.these benefits are expensive,however,and in an effort to reduce costs,mobil began,in the early,to hire some of its employees through payroll companies.
employees hired in that fashion performed services similar or identical to those of other mobil employees while on mobil premises and under its supervision.they often worked with other mobil employees,and the services they provided were not highly specialized or individualized.they were not,however,on mobil payroll.this appeal presents the question whether such,the six named plaintiffs and the putative class on behalf of which they are eligible to collect benefits under the governing mobil benefit plans.
plaintiff john maclachlan provided services for mobil but was not on its payroll.rather,during the eleven years he worked as an electronics technician for mobil,he was directly employed and paid by two other companies consolidated technical services,cts,between and and universal technical services,uts,from to.maclachlan contract with cts specified that he was to report for work at the job site of mobil oil exploration producing southeast.his involvement with mobil ended when he was terminated by uts without cause on february.he was eligible for employment benefits offered by cts and uts.
similarly,the other named plaintiffs performed services for mobil while under the direct employ of a third party.james brown spent a decade as a mechanic for mobil aviation in morgan city,louisiana,but was paid by three different firms lee services from to jet professionals from to and excalibur from to.stephen manley worked as a dispatcher and flight controller for mobil aviation from to,during which time he was paid by jet professionals,from to lee services,from to and excalibur,from to.alaina spurlock was a clerical support staffer for mobil aviation,first while on the payroll of lee services from to then while on the payroll of excalibur from to.bernd stahr was a computer operator for mobil in new orleans from to,spending the duration of that period on the payroll of software scanning service.michael zainotz was hired to be a computer systems administrator for mobil new orleans office and worked in that capacity while on the payroll of computerized process from through.
the putative class also is comprised of former mobil workers who were on the payroll of third parties.as defined by the plaintiffs,the class consists of all persons,past,present and future,employed in or at defendant mobil facilities in the united states who perform ed personal services for mobil and who are not,or were not,classified as regular employees of mobil,but instead are or were classified as independent contractors or employees of agencies for one year.
under the relevant mobil plans,eligibility is restricted to regular employees,but there are two definitions of that term in the record.first,as used in the retirement plan that was in effect at the time maclachlan began working for mobil,a regular employee is an individual who is employed by an employer corporation for work for a regular period of at least hours of employment per calendar year.an employer corporation,as used in the plan,is mobil corporation and each subsidiary participating in the plan.the definitions in this plan make no mention of payroll status as a defining criteria,nor of an exclusion of employees from the plan 
the second definition comes from a amendment to the retirement plan that specifically excludes employees of third parties and independent contractors.that plan provides an individual who performs services for an employer under an agreement pursuant to which such individual is treated as an independent contractor shall not be a regular employee irrespective of whether he is treated as an employee of an employer under employment principles 
all the relevant plans also include language vesting the administrator with the discretion to interpret the plans and to determine whether claimants are eligible for benefits.under the retirement plan,a designated plan administrator is vested with the discretion and final authority to determine eligibility and to reach a final determination.similarly,for the severance plan,the administrator may interpret the plan and make all other determinations necessary.and,under the savings plan,the administrative fiduciary shall have all power and discretion necessary to carry out their duties.
in march,following his termination by mobil,maclachlan sent a letter to mobil employee benefits administrators formally requesting retroactive employment benefits he made the request on the ground that he was a common law employee of mobil,a term that he argued should be read to fit within the plan definition of regular employee.
exxon and mobil merged in december,some ten months after maclachlan lost his job with uts and nine months after he contacted mobil about his eligibility for benefits.it was not until after the merger that thomas harrison,an assistant plan administrator with the delegated authority to decide claims,first took action on maclachlan petition.
before the merger,harrison was an exxon employee and had not previously reviewed a claim for benefits under the mobil plans.to make his decision,he reviewed the terms of the mobil plans described above as well as maclachlan employment history with mobil and.harrison also discussed the history of the plan administration with doug davies,an exxonmobil attorney who worked in mobil benefits division before the merger.
davies informed harrison that there was no record of mobil paying benefits to similarly situated contractors.davies also stated his belief that maclachlan was the first contractor to file a claim seeking benefits.harrison investigation revealed that mobil historically had mailed information about benefits only to payroll employees.on the basis of this record,harrison concluded that contractors such as maclachlan are outside the plan definition of regular employees and thus are ineligible for benefits.
in march,harrison sent a letter to maclachlan attorney,formally denying benefits.harrison explained that mobil was denying maclachlan claims because maclachlan had been employed by and had not been on the mobil payroll.moreover,as harrison stated,even if maclachlan had been a employee for tax purposes,mobil has consistently limited benefits to persons in a formal employment relationship with a participating.
harrison also made specific findings with respect to the different mobil plans.maclachlan was ineligible for the retirement and savings plan,harrison found,not only because maclachlan was not on the payroll,but also because the terms of the plan exclude any person retained by an under written contract on a consulting basis or employed by an employer corporation under a written contract where the terms of such written contract exclude participation in the plan.harrison concluded that a provision in maclachlan contract with cts was intended to have this effect,because it stated that maclachlan was solely an employee of cts.
harrison also declared that maclachlan was not entitled to participate in the severance plan,because that plan applied only to employees terminated on,or within two years after,the date on which a change in control of mobil occurs.here,the merger between exxon and mobil did not occur until after maclachlan had been terminated.accordingly,harrison concluded,maclachlan would have been unable to receive benefits under that plan,even if he had been a mobil employee at the time of his termination.
maclachlan and his then sued for
