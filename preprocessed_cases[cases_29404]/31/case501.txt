appellant daniel jenkins jenkins brought a disability discrimination suit against cleco power,llc cleco and liberty life assurance liberty pursuant to the americans with disabilities act of,et.ada,a similar state law regulation,the louisiana employment discrimination law,ledl,and the employment retirement income security act erisa.jenkins appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to liberty and the involuntary dismissal of his claims against cleco.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
jenkins worked for cleco as a senior line mechanic lineman for fourteen years when,on september,a utility pole which he was climbing broke,causing him to fall to the ground and fracture his left femur.the comminuted fracture required extensive surgery,which was performed by douglas waldman,an orthopedic surgeon and jenkins primary treating physician.the injury resulted in some permanent deformity to the leg and difficulty with motion and weight bearing and causes the leg to lock and limited his physical capacity to perform several tasks,including the ability to sit for extended periods.jenkins went on disability until november,when he returned to his previous position with restrictions that he not climb.he patrolled the lines,performed monitoring activities,and continued physical therapy sessions.because jenkins was not fully performing his duties,cleco transferred him to the position of customer service specialist on june.
jenkins again went on short term disability leave from november,to december,when cleco informed him that his job duties as customer service specialist did not conform with waldman restrictions on his employment.at that time,waldman had written a letter saying that jenkins should not work unaccompanied and should not work on rough terrain with unsure footing,climb ladders,and work at night or in an isolated situation.after waldman modified the restrictions,jenkins returned to work again as a customer service specialist,where he remained until october.
after jenkins leg began to swell,waldman again said jenkins could not perform the job as customer service specialist.on october,jenkins again went on disability until december.while on disability,in june,jenkins applied for the job of service planner,which he had heard about from,because he thought it would meet his physical needs.the job of service planner involved helping customers plan electrical service,oftentimes walking in rough terrain,jumping fences,creeks,ditches and occasionally climbing over fences.overall,jenkins argues,the job was less physically difficult than that of customer service specialist.however,jenkins did not get the job.
on november,jenkins wrote to richard sasser,human resources manager,informing him that waldman had again released him to do the job of customer service specialist.jenkins testified that he would also have been willing to do other jobs as well.sasser responded that there were no vacant customer service specialist positions but that arrangements had been made for cleco to retrain jenkins with computer skills so that he could become a dispatcher or related position,which sasser testified only meant call center specialist.sasser testified that jenkins was given a job classification so that he would receive a paycheck,and jenkins began training.a short time after jenkins started his training,he went to sasser and,according to sasser,said he did not want to continue the training.jenkins was concerned with the amount of money he was making,with keeping his options open,and with accommodations for his leg.the two agreed that jenkins would take a couple of days off and think about it.jenkins left sasser a message the next day that he would continue with the training and was back in training monday morning.
by february,cleco had determined that jenkins was sufficiently trained,and sasser sent jenkins a letter,dated february,offering him the position of call center specialist.prior to that time,sasser received a copy of a letter from waldman to liberty,stating that jenkins could try a call center position if he could alternate between sitting and standing.however,we would have to see how he did with his job before releasing him permanently.waldman stated that jenkins would not be able to sit through eight hour days of training without breaks and that jenkins impairments had been previously outlined on march.
jenkins expressed several concerns to sasser.sasser testified that plaintiff voiced two concerns one that the job did not pay as much money as he thought he should be paid and two,he was concerned about sitting for eight hours a day sasser explained that the company was willing to accommodate him and he needed to really go home and think about this.plaintiff did not learn from cleco at the meeting what the physical aspects of the job would involve as far as sitting and standing.
jenkins testified that he wanted to talk to waldman about the job,and he convinced sasser to give him time to think about the offer.sasser allowed plaintiff to take a week of vacation to decide what he wanted to do.during that week,jenkins returned to see waldman.jenkins told waldman that he would have difficulty sitting at a desk where he would be cramped.jenkins also told the doctor that it was an eight hour job and you had to stay at the desk to perform the job.jenkins admitted,however,that he did not have a copy of the job description of call center specialist.jenkins testified he did not know of waldman january,letter allowing him to try the call center job,if he could alternate sitting and standing.
jenkins then sent sasser the letter dated february,in which he declined the offer of the call center job,saying that he could not meet the physical job requirements because of the sitting.jenkins attached waldman report of february.jenkins was terminated by cleco on may.liberty denied his claim for continuing disability benefits soon thereafter.
on december,jenkins filed a charge of disability discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the eeoc issued a notice of right to sue on february,and jenkins brought suit on may,against cleco and liberty,seeking compensatory and punitive damages,back and front pay and benefits,and reasonable attorney fees and costs.jenkins asserted claims under erisa,the ada,and the ledl.liberty removed the case to federal district court on july.
the district court granted summary judgment for liberty on jenkins erisa claim,concluding that liberty had not clearly erred in determining that jenkins was not totally disabled.after a bench trial before the magistrate judge on jenkins remaining claims,cleco moved for involuntary dismissal under fed.civ.b,which was granted.the court concluded that jenkins failed to establish that he was disabled as defined by the ada and,regardless,was unable to prove that cleco failed to reasonably accommodate him.the court also concluded that jenkins had failed to prove that cleco retaliated against him for requesting reasonable accommodations.
jenkins appeals the court summary judgment ruling and involuntary dismissal of his claims.
