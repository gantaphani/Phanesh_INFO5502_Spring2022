opinion of the court 
this is an appeal from an award of attorneys fees for an action brought by a union pension and welfare fund against an employer pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of,erisa.after granting a motion for summary judgment in favor of the fund,the district court ordered the employer to pay attorneys fees.the employer appeals,arguing that the district court should have dismissed the fund application for fees as untimely and,in the alternative,that the amount of the award was unreasonable.
we conclude that the motion for fees was timely and that the fee award was reasonable.accordingly,we will affirm the district court.in so doing,we consider two questions left unanswered by this court previous decisions first,whether a trial court must award interest under g b on an employer delinquent contributions that were unpaid at the time a suit was filed but paid by the time of judgment,and,second,whether proportionality necessarily limits mandatory fee awards in the erisa context.we answer yes to the first question and no to the second.
plaintiff united automobile workers local social security fund the fund is a union pension and welfare fund.defendant metro auto center metro is an employer obligated by a collective bargaining agreement to pay monthly contributions to the fund.on may,the fund filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey pursuant to erisa,seeking unpaid contributions totaling,as well as interest on the unpaid contributions and attorneys fees.in march,while the action was pending,metro paid the fund,but denied that it owed the fund another.
the parties then filed for summary judgment.by an order dated december,the district court denied metro motion for summary judgment and granted the fund motion.the district court judge signed the order on december,and the clerk entered it on december.
on january,the fund moved for attorneys fees and costs in the amount of pursuant to erisa g d,g d,which instructs courts to award reasonable fees to prevailing plans in actions to collect delinquent contributions under erisa.on october,the district court entered an order granting the fund in fees,a reduction from the amount requested.the district court concluded the full amount requested was unreasonable because it included fees for work spent on legal matters not necessary to the successful claim for contributions.the district court refused metro request to reduce the award in order to create proportionality between the fee award and the underlying damages.additionally,the district court rejected metro objection that hours of charges were excessive,noting metro provided no specific explanation setting forth why this court should agree.united auto.workers,local soc.sec.dep t metro auto,slip op.at,unpublished order granting motion for fees.
it is undisputed that erisa mandates an award of reasonable attorneys fees when,as here,a fund prevails in an action for unpaid contributions pursuant to.see g d bd.of trs.of trucking employees of jersey welfare fund,centra,cir penn elastic united retail wholesale employees union,cir.the relevant procedures for filing requests for fees are dictated by the federal rules of civil procedure and the local civil rules of the united states district court for the district of new jersey.see.d civ.planned parenthood of cent.att y of,cir.
metro appeals the award granted to the fund on two grounds.first,metro argues the district court should have dismissed the fund application for fees as untimely.second,metro argues the fee award is unreasonable.
because the district court order of october,reduced the fee award to a definite amount,it was a final decision.see interfaith cmty.org.honeywell int l,cir.accordingly,we have jurisdiction over the district court order granting fees.see.
we first consider whether the fund request for fees was timely.we review the legal interpretation of procedural rules de novo.planned parenthood,at.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that motions for attorneys fees must be filed no later than fourteen days after entry of judgment,unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court.d b.rule of the local civil rules of the united states district court for the district of new jersey provides an attorney seeking compensation for services or reimbursement of necessary expenses shall file with the court an affidavit within days of the entry of judgment or order,unless extended by the court,setting forth information about the services rendered.we have previously held that local civil rule extends the time within which to file for fees from fourteen days to thirty as a standing order of the district court.see planned parenthood,at.
in this case,the fund filed its application for attorneys fees on january,days after the clerk entered the district court summary judgment order.the parties agree that the rules provide a time period within which to file a request for fees,and they agree that the clock starts to run when the district court enters final judgment on the underlying claim.they disagree,however,about whether december,the date of entry of the summary judgment order,should be considered the date of entry of a final judgment giving rise to the fee request.
at the outset,we must consider the application of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure to the time period for a motion for fees.rule is most well known for clarifying the time within which an appeal must be taken,but it also clarifies the timing of motions rule a provides e very judgment and amended judgment must be set forth on a separate document except for those disposing of certain motions.if a separate document is required,but no separate document is issued,a court must deem the judgment date of entry as days after its entry in the civil docket.b.we mechanically apply rule to prevent uncertainties as to the date on which a judgment is entered,see united states indrelunas,d per curiam in re cendant.sec,cir,because d etermining the date of entry is critical for motion practice under the federal rules of civil procedure and for the timely filing of a notice of appeal.united states fiorelli,cir footnote omitted.
metro argues rule a does not require a separate document for a judgment to trigger the time period of a rule d fees motion.the text of rules and require that we reject this argument.rule addresses the time of entry for judgments for the purposes of these rules and rule requires motions for fees to be filed within days after the entry of judgment.rule enumerates certain exceptions to its formalities,none of which are relevant here therefore,when an order does not comply with rule,there is no immediate entry of judgment triggering the time period for rule d motions.in such circumstances,the time period begins days after entry of the order,as set forth in rule b 
accordingly,if the district court december summary judgment order is not a separate document,the time period for an application for fees provided by rule d and extended by civ.began to run days after december.more specifically,if the december order was not a separate document,the fund motion for fees was timely.
an order is considered a separate document for purposes of rule if it satisfies three requirements first,the order must be and separate from the opinion second,the order must note the relief granted and third,the order must omit or at least substantially omit the district court reasons for disposing of the parties claims.cendant,at citing local union of int l of workers okonite,cir.
here,the district court order granting summary judgment satisfied the first and third requirements of the rule,but did not specify the relief to which the fund was entitled metro argues the amount of the relief could easily be determined by g,even though the amount was not explicit in the district court order.see vitale latrobe area,cir describing a narrow exception to the general rule regarding final orders that treats an order as final as long as the relief can be determined through a mechanical and uncontroversial calculation even if relief is not specified in the order skretvedt dupont de nemours,cir same 
section g of title of the united states code dictates the relief prevailing funds are due in a action for unpaid contributions.it provides,
in any action under this subchapter by a fiduciary for or on behalf of a plan to enforce section of this title in which a judgment in favor of the plan is awarded,the court shall award the plan 
a the unpaid contributions,
b interest on the unpaid contributions,
c an amount equal to the greater of 
i interest on the unpaid contributions,or 
ii liquidated damages provided for under the plan in an amount not in excess of percent or such higher percentage as may be permitted under federal or state law of the amount determined by the court under subparagraph a,
d reasonable attorney fees and costs of the action,to be paid by the defendant,and 
e such other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.
for purposes of this paragraph,interest on unpaid contributions shall be determined by using the rate provided under the plan,or,if none,the rate prescribed under section of title.
the fund argues the district court did not simply have an uncontroversial,ministerial calculation to perform once it granted summary judgment because this court has not provided guidance on how to interpret g b.specifically,given that metro paid a portion of the delinquent contributions while litigation was pending,the fund asserts it was unclear whether the district court would award interest on those previously paid fees,as well as interest on the portion still unpaid by the time of judgment 
in awarding a judgment in favor of the plan the district court had to award the unpaid contributions and the interest on the unpaid contributions.g a,b.the phrase unpaid contributions in g b could refer either to contributions owed at the time suit commenced or contributions owed at the time judgment was entered.several courts have determined that g remedies apply to all contributions that are unpaid at the time a plan files suit,even if those debts are partially satisfied before judgment.see operating eng rs local health benefit fund gustafson constr,cir nw.adm rs,albertson,cir iron workers dist.council hudson steel fabricators erectors,cir carpenters amended restated health ben.fund john ryan constr,cir see also carpenters joiners welfare fund gittleman,cir holding the term unpaid contributions in g c means contributions unpaid at the time suit was filed,rather than contributions which were delinquent for some time but which were paid up before suit was filed.
at least one court,however,has prevented a fund from recovering interest on delinquent contributions that were paid between filing and judgment.carpenters council health welfare fund rogers,cir.in rogers,the court of appeals for the sixth circuit reasoned that g b appl ies only if there are unpaid contributions on the date of the award because g provides that upon a judgment in favor of the plan the court shall award the plan the unpaid contributions and interest on the unpaid contributions.id.at quoting g a b emphasis added by rogers.
we conclude the better interpretation of g b requires that plans be awarded interest on contributions unpaid at the time the suit is filed.as the court of appeals for the second circuit acknowledged,g b refers to unpaid contributions not to establish a limit on qualifying judgments,but rather because the amount of an award of interest or liquidated damages should logically be predicated upon the amount of the unpaid contributions originally at issue.iron workers,at.the payment of interest compensates plans for one kind of cost incurred in connection with delinquencies,that is,the loss of interest.bd.of trs.of hotel rest.employees local jpr,quoting staff of comm.on labor and human resources,the multiemployer pension plan amendments of summary and analysis of consideration comm.print see also laborers health welfare trust fund for cal.advanced lightweight concrete,d.the purpose of the provision would be defeated if we allowed employers to avoid paying interest simply by satisfying their debt moments before the court issues judgment.see iron workers,at permitting delinquent employers to avoid paying penalties after suit is filed would largely thwart the purpose of g to provide plan fiduciaries with an effective weapon against delinquent employers.it would also anomalously cause only employers with legitimate legal arguments awaiting final judgment to pay ancillary relief.citations omitted john ryan,at in fact,the interpretation of g would reward bad faith employers who insist on the spectre of adverse judgment before making payments they know or even concede to be delinquent and,at the same time,penalize good faith employers who litigate delinquencies through judgment because of a genuine dispute about whether money is owed.gilles burton constr,cir after suit is filed,we doubt that employers who are delinquent in their contributions can avoid the mandatory relief provisions of section g through the device of offering to pay only the overdue contributions.
accordingly,the district court could properly award the fund interest on those delinquent contributions that metro paid while the action,brought pursuant to,was pending.we recognize,however,that neither the district court nor the parties knew our position on this issue at the time of the summary judgment order.the parties could not be assured of the relief that would be awarded after the grant of summary judgment.
because the district court order granting summary judgment provided neither the amount of relief granted,nor left only a ministerial calculation,the order can not be considered a separate document for purposes of rule.without a separate document,the limit for the fee request did not begin to run until days after entry of the order.the fund request for fees was therefore timely.
we turn next to the reasonableness of the fee award.we review a district court award of fees for abuse of discretion and review a district court factual determinations,including the court determination of an attorney reasonable hourly rate and the number of hours he or she reasonably worked on the case,for clear error.interfaith cmty,at.we exercise plenary review over the legal standard that the district court used in calculating the award.see bell united princeton,cir.
metro argues the district court awarded an unreasonably high fee to the fund.in addition to complaining that the hours awarded were excessive and the work was vaguely described,metro contends that the district court erred by not reducing the fee award so as to make it proportional to the amount of the underlying damages recovered.since we have not previously ruled on whether a fee awarded pursuant to g d must be proportional to the amount of unpaid contributions recovered,we will focus our attention on that issue.before we reach it,however,we will briefly address metro other claims.
erisa allows a prevailing plan to recover reasonable attorney fees.g d.the most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the lodestar calculation.hensley eckerhart,d.under this approach,a court determines the reasonable number of hours expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.the product is a presumptively reasonable fee,but it may still require subsequent adjustment.id.at.pennsylvania.valley citizens council for clean air,d.in this case,metro does not challenge the hourly rate charged but does suggest the hours claimed by the fund,and awarded by the district court,were excessive and insufficiently supported.
in requesting,challenging,and granting attorneys fees,specificity is critical.a request for fees must be accompanied by fairly definite information as to hours devoted to various general activities,partial discovery,settlement negotiations,and the hours spent by various classes of attorneys.evans port,cir.and w here the documentation of hours is inadequate,the district court may reduce the award accordingly.hensley,at.
while the fund records describing the hours spent on various activities could have benefited from added specificity,the detail they provided allowed the district court to determine whether the costs claimed were unreasonable for the work performed.see washington phila.county.com,cir s pecificity should only be required to the extent necessary for the district court to determine if the hours claimed are unreasonable for the work performed.quotation marks and citation omitted.moreover,we agree with the district court that metro complaints of excessive hours were imprecise.see bell,at w e emphasize that the adverse party submissions can not merely allege in general terms that the time spent was excessive.metro did not provide the district court with adequate justifications to reduce the hours of the fund fees,and has not presented them to us.we will not disturb the court conclusion that the number of hours expended on the successful action was reasonable.
metro additionally argues that the district court erred in not reducing the fee award in light of metro offer of judgment made pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure courts have recognized that fees accumulated after a party rejects a substantial offer provide minimal benefit to the prevailing party.moriarty svec,cir.metro,however,never presented the fund with a substantial offer.metro initially offered to settle for the amount of unpaid contributions,but its offer did not include costs,fees,or interest incurred up to that point by the fund.the fund rejected the offer,indicating that it would be a breach of fiduciary duty for the fund to waive interest on the unpaid contributions.metro again failed to provide a substantial offer when it responded to this reduced its offer by half.
we see no reason to overturn the district court finding of reasonable hours and reasonable rates,and we do not agree with metro that its offer of judgment needed to factor into the award.the district court fulfilled its obligation to consider carefully the reasonableness of the fee request and made no clear errors in its findings of fact 
having concluded that the district court did not err in its lodestar calculation,we now turn to whether the district court should have downwardly adjusted the lodestar because the fee award was disproportionate to the amount of the unpaid contributions recovered.although multiplying a reasonable number of hours by a reasonable rate produces a presumptively reasonable fee,that does not end the inquiry.there remain other considerations that may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward or downward.hensley,at.see also delaware valley citizens council,at.the categories of considerations that justify adjusting the lodestar have changed over time.originally,it was contemplated that the lodestar could be adjusted upward or downward depending on a variety of factors,see lindy.builders,of phila.american radiator standard sanitary,cir,but more recently the supreme court has sharply limited the number of factors which can be considered in adjusting the lodestar amount.brytus spang,cir.see city of burlington dague,d holding courts may not adjust the lodestar amount because an attorney was retained on a basis blum stenson,d holding the novelty and complexity of a case are reflected in the lodestar and do not warrant adjustment id.at.holding an upward adjustment to the lodestar for quality of service is only applicable in exceptional cases.
the question for us courts must downwardly adjust a g d fee award to keep it proportional to the as of yet unaddressed by the supreme court.the supreme court has,however,addressed disproportionate attorneys fees awarded in the civil rights context.a plurality of the court in city of riverside rivera,d,refused to adopt a rule of proportionality for fees because such a rule would make it difficult,if not impossible,for individuals with meritorious civil rights claims but relatively small potential damages to obtain redress from the courts and thus would undermine congress purpose in enacting.city of riverside,at.brennan,joined by marshall,blackmun,and stevens,jj.justice powell cast the fifth vote to affirm the fee award of for a case in which plaintiffs were awarded in damages.id.at.powell,concurring in judgment.in the margin of his concurring opinion,justice powell stated i t probably will be the rare case in which an award of private damages can be said to benefit the public interest to an extent that would justify the disproportionality between damages and fees reflected in this case.id.at.
justice powell footnote in city of riverside seems to suggest courts should generally award only proportionate fees,and should consider the public interest served by the underlying case before awarding disproportionate fees.see,moriarty svec,cir relying on justice powell concurrence to support the proposition that proportionality concerns are a factor in determining what a reasonable fee is.in cunningham city of mckeesport,cir,however,we determined justice powell opinion did not mandate that courts adopt a rule of proportionality.in that case,we stated we did not have to apply the thrust of justice powell somewhat enigmatic footnote and require courts to consider the extent to which the public interest was vindicated by the award if the fee sought is disproportionate to the damages awarded.id.at.we explained,
first,this interpretation represents at most the view of a lone justice and was not endorsed by any of the other eight second,we have doubts about justice powell statement that only the rare case justifies disproportionate fee awards finally,we consider application of justice powell reasoning problematic in the absence of an explicit mandate,we are reluctant to begin the difficult task of developing standards by which we might incorporate proportionality principles into the attorney fee calculus.

thus,we have rejected a rule of proportionality in civil rights cases.see,id.a court may not diminish counsel fees in a section action to maintain some ratio between the fees and the damages awarded.and,when asked to limit our rejection of proportionality to fee awards,we refused.in northeast women center mcmonagle,the plaintiff brought a civil action under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,rico,cir.we declared that nothing in the language or the legislative history of either or c providing fees for rico litigation support s the application of a proportionality rule in the latter,but not the former.id.at
