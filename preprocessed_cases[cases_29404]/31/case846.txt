frederick and joanne reich sued frederick former employer,ladish company,ladish,and its pension plan,ladish company pension plan,international association of machinists and aerospace workers,local the plan because the plan denied frederick certain disability and health benefits.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants and the reichs appeal.we reverse and remand.
frederick reich reich worked as a machinist for ladish for almost thirty years.in the early,he was diagnosed with small airways disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.because of these illnesses,ladish periodically placed reich on paid medical leave over the next few years.in july,reich physician released him from one of these leave periods to return to work with certain restrictions.among other conditions,reich was limited to light work and required continuous oxygen.reich doctor confirmed that these restrictions were permanent.on july,ladish terminated reich,stating that the company had determined that there were no jobs within the bargaining unit that reich could safely perform,even with accommodations,given his medical restrictions.
reich subsequently sued ladish for disability discrimination,for failure to accommodate his disability,and for retaliating against him for engaging in protected activity.ladish was represented by its attorney,lawrence hammond.hammond supervised gerald bitters,who worked as ladish manager of benefits administration.bitters was responsible for the processing of pension benefit applications.ladish successfully defended the suit by arguing that reich disability prevented him from working safely at ladish.in the course of the suit ladish explained that it was not paying reich disability benefits because the plan covered only those employees who were found to be disabled by the social security administration ssa.at that time,reich petition for social security disability was still pending.in april,the ssa awarded reich disability benefits based on a disability onset date of august.after receiving this favorable determination from ssa,reich renewed his application for disability pension benefits with ladish,attaching a copy of the ssa decision.
bitters wrote a letter to reich denying the benefits because reich was not an employee at the time he received the ssa ruling of disability 
as you are aware,your employment was terminated in july of for your unavailability for work at the company.you were advised shortly after your employment terminated that you have a deferred vested benefit for which you are eligible at age.the plan does not provide for a former employee to apply for a disability retirement some two years and nine months after his employee status ends.you are therefore not eligible for a disability pension however,your rights to a deferred vested pension at age remain in force.
ex.in a separate letter,bitters informed reich he was not eligible for group health insurance benefits unless he was receiving a disability pension,ex.reich appealed the decision to bitters and,in a letter to reich attorney,bitters denied the appeal 
reich approval for social security took place several years after his termination of employment at the company.the basis and circumstances for his termination are not issues i am involved with it is my job to administer the pension plans.although the administrative law judge awarded reich retroactive entitlement to social security benefits,this did not change his status with ladish,that is,he was not retroactively reinstated to employee status.many former employees may become disabled,but they are not ladish retirees.as you are undoubtedly aware,during the time when reich was employed at the company his petitions for social security disability were denied.our plan requires that,in order to be a participant the individual must be a covered employee,and unfortunately upon the termination of his employment reich ceased to be a covered employee.
ex.reich subsequently sued ladish and the plan pursuant to the employee retirement and income security act erisa,seeking judicial review of the plan denial of disability and health insurance benefits,and for ladish breach of fiduciary duty.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.because the plan granted discretion to the administrator to pay or deny claims,the district court reviewed the plan denial of reich claim under the arbitrary and capricious standard.reich argued for closer review because of an alleged conflict of interest between the plan and ladish.because of the structure of benefits,ladish would have been required to fund health insurance benefits if reich was found entitled to disability benefits.reich maintained that ladish thus had an incentive to deny him disability benefits so that it would not have to pay his health insurance premiums.because of this alleged conflict of interest,reich urged the district court to apply a higher level of scrutiny to the decision denying disability benefits.the court declined to apply a higher standard,finding there was no evidence of a significant conflict.
the court similarly declined the defendants invitation to consider post hoc rationalizations for the decision to deny benefits.at the time of the denial,bitters relied entirely on the fact that reich did not have a favorable finding of disability from the ssa at a time when he could be considered a participant under the plan.the court thus refused to consider the plan new argument that reich medical conditions did not rise to the level of a disability as defined by the plan.the court instead focused on whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that reich was not a participant under the plan because he was not a covered employee at the time he received a finding of disability from ssa.the court found that the plan administrator interpretation of the word participant was reasonable.the court found no conflict between the definition of the word participant in the deferred vested retirement part of the plan and the use of that same word in the disability benefits part of the plan.the court therefore granted judgment in favor of the defendants on reich erisa claims.the court also found that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty claim because ladish was merely trying to make a settlement offer at the time and thus did not breach its duty.reich appeals.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.anstett,cir.on appeal,reich contends that the plan administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.in particular,he maintains that the plain language of the plan requires a finding that he was a participant entitled to disability benefits because the company conceded he was a participant for the purposes of another part of the plan relating to deferred retirement benefits.he also argues that the interpretation of participant offered by the defendants here defies common sense because almost no one would be eligible for the benefit if the plan is read as ladish urges.as a remedy,he asks us to grant summary judgment in his favor or to remand to the district court rather than remanding to the plan administrator.
we begin by turning to the many terms of the plan.reich primarily seeks disability retirement benefits.if he is entitled to disability retirement benefits,ladish concedes he is also entitled to health insurance coverage.the plan determines his eligibility for disability retirement benefits 
eligibility.a participant who attains his disability retirement date shall be eligible to receive a disability retirement benefit under the plan,in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the plan.
