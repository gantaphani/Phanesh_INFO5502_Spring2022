plaintiff jack leeson leeson,a former employee of defendant transamerica corporation transamerica,filed this action under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,to challenge the termination of his disability benefits.the district court,applying an abuse of discretion standard of review,upheld the transamerica corporation disability income plan decision to terminate his benefits.leeson appealed.in a prior disposition,we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment to transamerica and remanded with instructions to the district court to apply a de novo standard of review in determining whether transamerica properly terminated leeson benefits.leeson transamerica disability income plan,app x cir.
on remand,transamerica filed a motion to dismiss leeson action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that leeson did not have statutory standing as a plan participant to file suit under erisa.leeson,on the other hand,argued that he was a plan participant because he was employed at transamerica at the time he applied for benefits.leeson also stressed that transamerica approved his claim and,in fact,paid him benefits for four years.the district court,relying on curtis nevada bonding,cir,concluded that leeson was not a plan participant and granted transamerica motion to dismiss.the district court concluded that because leeson lacked standing to pursue an erisa claim,there was no federal subject matter jurisdiction.leeson again timely appealed.
in this appeal,leeson argues that the district court erroneously relied on our prior holding in curtis to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in curtis,we held that a district court lacked jurisdiction to consider an erisa claim where a former employee had neither a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment nor a colorable claim to vested benefits.id.at.relying on a more recent decision,vaughn bay environmental management,leeson contends that,under erisa,a dismissal for lack of statutory standing is properly viewed as a dismissal for failure to state a claim rather than a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,cir.leeson therefore argues that because he alleged a colorable claim for benefits,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to address the merits of his case on remand.
for the reasons explained below,we agree with leeson that vaughn controls.whether leeson is a participant for purposes of erisa is a substantive element of his claim,not a prerequisite for subject matter jurisdiction.as the supreme court has instructed,when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.arbaugh y h.to the extent our prior cases including curtis hold otherwise,they have no precedential effect because they are precisely the type of jurisdictional rulings the supreme court has since rejected.id.at quoting steel citizens for a better env t.we therefore vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.
leeson is a former employee of transamerica.while employed there,he participated in transamerica disability ltd income plans.the basic plan,known as the transamerica corporation disability income plan basic plan,provided benefits based on a participant predisability annual earnings up to.a second plan,known as the transamerica corporation class long term disability coverage supplemental plan supplemental plan provided benefits on eligible annual earnings over.
leeson began working as a regional pension manager for transamerica in.in december,leeson was in an automobile accident that resulted in injury to his neck and caused him to suffer severe headaches.leeson continued to work until june,at which time he took a leave of absence due to his deteriorating physical condition.shortly thereafter,leeson timely applied for ltd benefits under both the basic and supplemental plans.
on april,prudential insurance company of america prudential,as claims administrator,determined that leeson was eligible for ltd and approved his application subject to continuing evaluation of his claim.prudential paid leeson ltd benefits until july,when it determined that he was no longer disabled within the meaning of the ltd plan in terminating leeson benefits,prudential determined that the medical evidence no longer supported leeson claim that he suffered from a physical impairment that prevented him from returning to work.prudential further concluded that,although leeson may have suffered from an impairment that resulted from a psychological condition,the maximum benefits available for a mental impairment limitation had been exhausted.
leeson appealed prudential decision to terminate his ltd benefits.leeson disputed prudential interpretation of the medical evidence and requested that prudential reinstate his benefits.in a letter dated october,prudential affirmed its decision to terminate leeson benefits.the letter explained that leeson benefits were terminated because of the month mental disorder limitation and because the medical evidence did not show that leeson suffered from a physical disability that prevented him from working.
in february,leeson filed a second administrative appeal with the aegon committee,which had replaced transamerica as the plan administrator subsequently,on june,the aegon committee denied leeson appeal on the ground that he d id not meet the definition of disability under the plan that is applicable after the first months of disability.
one year later,in august,leeson filed a second appeal with the aegon committee.the committee denied this appeal,explaining that its june,decision was final.having pursued his administrative remedies,leeson filed this action pursuant to.a b and invoked federal court jurisdiction pursuant to e 
ruling on for summary judgment,the district court granted transamerica motion on the ground that the termination of benefits did not constitute an abuse of discretion.in its ruling,the district court concluded that transamerica did not breach its fiduciary duty under the standard recognized in atwood newmont gold,cir,when it provided leeson with a copy of the restatement plan that was in effect at the time leeson benefits were terminated,rather than the version of the plan in effect at the time leeson became disabled and applied for benefits.the district court further concluded that leeson received a full and fair administrative review,and that there was substantial evidence to support the determination that leeson disability resulted from a mental condition.
as noted above,leeson appealed.in leeson first appeal,we held that,under our decision in abatie alta health life insurance,cir en banc,the district court erred in reviewing for abuse of discretion the decision to terminate leeson benefits.we remanded the case for further consideration under a de novo standard of review to determine whether leeson was disabled under the terms of the restatement plan leeson,app x at.
transamerica never asserted in the administrative process,in the original district court proceeding,or in the prior appeal that leeson was not a plan participant within the meaning of.after our remand,however,transamerica filed a federal rule of civil procedure h motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that leeson did not qualify as a plan participant,and therefore lacked statutory standing to sue under erisa.in support of its argument,transamerica explained that after the remand,its newly retained counsel located relevant plan that governed leeson eligibility for benefits.under these ltd plan documents,transamerica argued that leeson was not a plan participant because he was on an unpaid leave of absence when he applied for benefits.citing to the restatement plan,transamerica argued that section expressly provided that if an eligible employee is on an unpaid leave of absence,his or her status as a long term participant shall be suspended and he or she shall be ineligible for long term disability benefits.recognizing that it had not previously raised this standing issue,transamerica argued that because the issue ultimately related to the district court subject matter jurisdiction it could,under rule h,raise the issue at any time.as noted above,transamerica relied on our decision in curtis to support its argument.
in opposing transamerica motion,leeson submitted a series of three declarations,the second and third of which corrected typographical errors in the first declaration.in these declarations,leeson declared that at the time he applied for ltd benefits,he was not on a leave of absence.in response to transamerica motion challenging the propriety of the later filed declarations,the district court struck them.as for the original declaration,the district court found that it was because it was made on information and belief rather than personal knowledge,and was not signed under penalty of perjury.the district court ultimately concluded that leeson declaration did not provide cognizable evidence that he was not on unpaid leave when he applied for benefits 
with this ruling,the district court found that leeson was not a plan participant under a b and therefore lacked statutory standing to pursue an erisa claim.accordingly,the district court granted transamerica motion to dismiss.in so ruling,the district court relied on curtis to further conclude that because leeson lacked statutory standing,federal court subject matter jurisdiction did not exist.leeson timely appealed.

leeson,who filed this action pursuant to a b,alleges that he was a participant in the transamerica ltd plan and that federal jurisdiction existed under e transamerica contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because leeson was not a plan participant as required by a b.as transamerica correctly notes,the supreme court has explained that t he express grant of federal jurisdiction in erisa is limited to suits brought by certain parties franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,concluding that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a lawsuit brought by state tax authorities for a declaratory judgment involving an employee benefit plan.participants are among those parties expressly entitled to bring suit under erisa.a b.thus,the question presented in this appeal is whether the challenge to leeson status as a plan participant implicates federal court subject matter jurisdiction,or the substantive adequacy of leeson claim.our prior case law has undoubtedly contributed to the conflation of these two distinct concepts.this appeal provides us with an opportunity,in light of the supreme court decision in arbaugh,to clarify that vaughn sets forth the correct rule.
we begin by recognizing that federal courts have broad adjudicatory authority over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.because of this extensive power,jurisdictional dismissals in actions predicated on federal questions are exceptional.safe air for everyone meyer,cir quoting sun valley gasoline,ernst,f d,cir.in bell hood,one of the seminal decisions addressing the contours of subject matter jurisdiction,the supreme court held that a claim alleged to arise under federal law should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the constitution and laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another.consequently,a federal court may dismiss a federal question claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction only if the alleged claim under the constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.id.at.
although seemingly clear in theory,our analysis of subject matter jurisdiction has been substantially more complicated in practice.strictly speaking,jurisdiction concerns the courts statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate cases.steel,at see also henderson ex rel.henderson shinseki,u rg ing that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court adjudicatory capacity,that is,its or personal jurisdiction.
the supreme court,however,has observed that the term j urisdiction is a word of many,too many,meanings.arbaugh,at quoting steel,at.according to the court,federal courts have sometimes been profligate in their use of the term.id.indeed,we have sometimes mischaracterized rules or elements of a cause of action as jurisdictional limitations,particularly when that characterization was not central to the case,and thus did not require close analysis.reed elsevier,muchnick.these cases,which the supreme court has referred to as jurisdictional rulings due to their cursory analysis,have no precedential effect.arbaugh,at quoting steel,at.
acknowledging the muddled state of the case law,the supreme court in arbaugh squarely addressed the lack of precision used by federal courts in analyzing the subjectmatter dichotomy.id.at.after the trial court entered judgment on a jury verdict in favor of an employee in an action involving title vii of the civil rights act of,the employer brought a motion challenging subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.although the trial court noted the waste of judicial resources caused by the delay in asserting such a challenge,the trial court dismissed the action because it concluded that title vii employee requirement was a jurisdictional prerequisite.id.at.the supreme court reversed,holding that title vii employee numerosity limitation is not a jurisdictional requirement therefore,it can not be raised defensively in a motion.id.the court reasoned that the limitation related to the substantive adequacy of a title vii claim because the employee threshold appears in a separate provision that does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.id.at quoting zipes trans world airlines.the court articulated a bright line rule 
if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue b ut when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.

in reed elsevier,the supreme court further examined the scope of federal court subject matter jurisdiction,this time with respect to the copyright act.the court concluded that a of the copyright act,which requires copyright registration of original works of authorship,is a precondition to filing a claim that does not restrict a federal court subject matter jurisdiction.at.in so holding,the supreme court applied the same approach that it followed in arbaugh.the court explained that registration requirement is not clearly labeled jurisdictional,is not located in a provision,and admits of congressionally authorized exceptions.id.at.therefore,it is properly construed as a rule.
the supreme court again endeavored to clarify the distinction between jurisdictional prerequisites and rules in shinseki.there,the court held that a day deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the court of appeals for veterans claims does not have jurisdictional consequences.shinseki.at.the court concluded that the relevant provision does not speak in jurisdictional terms,the provision is located in a completely separate subchapter entitled procedure,and construing the provision to restrict veterans benefits is inconsistent with the administrative scheme.id.at.
