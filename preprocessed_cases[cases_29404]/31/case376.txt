appellant claim is based on withdrawal liability established by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,as amended by the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of mppaa,
erisa was enacted by congress to protect employees pension rights.milwaukee brewery workers pension plan schlitz brewing,d.congress found,however,that erisa did not adequately protect plans from the adverse consequences that resulted when individual employers terminate d their participation in,or withdr e w from,multiemployer plans.pension benefit guaranty gray,d.as a result,several years after the enactment of erisa,congress promulgated the mppaa to foster the growth and continuance of multiemployer pension plans.see bay area laundry dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar,d.the mppaa primary objective is to insulate these plans in order to protect the retirement benefits of covered employees.in order to satisfy this goal,the mppaa requires employers who withdraw from underfunded multiemployer pension plans to pay a withdrawal liability.see,ilgwu retirement fund minotola,wl withdrawal liability is imposed in order to ensure that workers retirement benefits w ill actually be available during retirement.
complete withdrawal liability,pursuant to a,is not incurred until an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan,or permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan.therefore,a cause of action under the mppaa does not ripen until the employer fails to make a payment on the schedule set by the fund.see bay area laundry dry cleaning pension trust fund,at.as the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc advises,under erisa,as amended by the mppaa,the date of withdrawal is the date that operations actually date does not relate back to the date of filing of a chapter petition if operations have continued thereafter.see pbgc op.letter.
with regard to alter ego liability in cases involving claims to pension benefits protected by erisa,as amended by the mppaa,there is a federal interest supporting disregard of the corporate form to impose liability.lumpkin envirodyne,cir t he congressional intent of erisa is to hold employers responsible for pension benefits,so that when the corporate form poses a bar to liability,concerns for corporate separateness are secondary to what we view as the mandate of erisa.internal citations omitted.
in the instant case,the district court held that the trustee of the bankruptcy estate,rather than appellant,was the proper party to pursue the present action that court reasoned that appellant alleged injuries were the property of the bankruptcy estate,appellant,ex.b at,and would impact twin directly and all of twin creditors indirectly.id.at.
certainly the district court was correct that once a company or individual files for bankruptcy,creditors lack standing to assert claims that are property of the estate.the bankruptcy code defines the estate as all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,a,as well as a ny interest in property that the estate acquires after the commencement of the case.id.at a.this definition is given broad application and includes all kinds of property,including causes of action united states whiting pools,d moreover,at least in some circuits,a trustee in bankruptcy may maintain a veil piercing suit or alter ego action on behalf of a bankrupt corporation where the claim alleged involves a generalized injury to all creditors.see,koch refining farmers union cent,cir 
here,however,twin withdrawal liability is not property of the estate.although twin filed its bankruptcy petition on december,it did not cease operations until it entered into a shutdown agreement on december,and it continued contributions to the pension fund until january.therefore,the claim for withdrawal liability did not arise until after the filing of the bankruptcy petition 
the claim for withdrawal liability is also not a legal or equitable interest of the debtor.in order for the claim to be the legal or equitable interest of the debtor in property,the claim must be a general one,with no particularized injury arising from it.paul fire marine ins.pepsico,cir if a claim is a general one,with no particularized injury arising from it,and if that claim could be brought by any creditor of the debtor,the trustee is the proper person to assert the claim,and the creditors are bound by the outcome of the trustee action.on the other hand,if the claim is specific to the creditor,it is a personal one and is a legal or equitable interest only of the creditor.a claim for an injury is personal to the creditor if other creditors generally have no interest in that claim.koch refining,at 
in this case,the injury is not insolvency stemming from appellees actions.here,the injury is the appellees evasion of withdrawal liability.withdrawal liability is not owed to twin rather,it is owed to the pension fund.because the liability is owed only to the fund,the claim is personal to the appellant.moreover,absent a general creditors interest,a trustee can only collect money that may be owing to the bankrupt entity.see steinberg buczynski,cir if the corporation is injured by the shareholders disregard of corporate formalities then the trustee can sue otherwise he can not.here,there is no general creditors interest in the statutorily imposed withdrawal liability owed to the fund.rather,the action to recover the withdrawal liability has the character of an action for damages flowing from an alleged illegality against the fund.the alleged illegality may have caused other injuries in addition to those caused to the fund,but the direct injury to the evasion of its statutory the nature of plaintiffs claim as a personal one.see apostolou fisher,holding that when a actions injure both the individual creditor and the corporation,the individual creditor may pursue a cause of action against a outside bankruptcy for the direct injuries that the creditor,rather than the corporation,suffered.as a result,twin withdrawal liability is not part of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to section a or.consequently,the claim here can not be the property of the estate.see steinberg,at.
appellees rely on a new jersey bankruptcy case,tsai buildings by jamie,in re buildings by jamie,to demonstrate that alter ego and veil piercing actions are the property of the bankruptcy estate.their reliance,however,is misplaced.there,the trustee had standing to pursue an alter ego action on behalf of the corporate debtor to recover on a defaulted loan.thus,the action was based on a general injury suffered by a corporate debtor prior to its bankruptcy filing.the cause of action in the present action arises from a statutorily imposed withdrawal liability that occurred after the filing of the bankruptcy petition.
furthermore,the in re buildings by jamie court held,consistent with our decision here,that under new jersey law an alter ego action is an equitable remedy that may only be asserted by a corporation when it suffers harm.here,twin did not suffer harm from the appellees evasion of withdrawal liability only the appellants suffered such harm.see,steinberg,at explaining in a similar case that the only injured person here is the pension fund.as a result,the injury is personal to the appellants and only the creditor,not the bankruptcy trustee,can pursue the claim.see id.when a third party has injured not the bankrupt corporation itself but a creditor of that corporation,the trustee in bankruptcy can not bring suit against the third party.he has no interest in the suit.
appellees also argue that should this court hold that appellant has standing,the district court decision to dismiss the amended complaint should still be affirmed on the alternate ground that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.we find that the appellant has made the necessary showing for three of the four counts in its complaint.
counts i and ii disregarding corporate formalities 
abuses of the corporate form allow courts to impose liability on the corporation shareholders.the purpose of alter ego liability and piercing the corporate veil is to prevent an independent corporation from being used to defeat the ends of justice,to perpetrate fraud,to accomplish a crime,or otherwise to evade the law state dep t of envtl.protect.ventron,internal citations omitted.

gross undercapitalization failure to observe corporate formalities,of dividends,the insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time,siphoning of funds of the corporation by the dominant stockholder,of other officers or directors,absence of corporate records,and the fact that the corporation is merely a facade for the operations of the dominant stockholder or stockholders.

appellant,however,must also allege that foodtown used twin to perpetrate fraud,to accomplish injustice,or to circumvent the law here,appellant alleges,in subparagraph d,that the appellees diverted monies destined for withdrawal liability.appellant enumeration of appellees actions,consisting of diverting funds,fictitious invoices and kickbacks,inject s precision and some measure of substantiation into their allegations of fraud,consistent with rule b.see naporano iron metal,d at.when viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant,these allegations can support a claim that appellees used twin to perpetrate fraud,to accomplish injustice,or to circumvent the law.major league baseball.at.
count iii fiduciary duties 
the third count of appellant complaint alleges that t he individual officers and directors of twin and foodtown are fiduciaries with respect to union employees who were plan participants represented by plaintiff.appellees argue that they are not fiduciaries under erisa.the district court,however,stated that appellant fiduciary duty claims were being brought under state and common law and not under erisa.appellant,ex.b,at the fund theory of liability is not based on defendants status as fiduciaries per se under erisa but as fiduciaries to the fund as a creditor of twin,an insolvent corporation.quoting pl.br.at.
generally,corporate directors owe a fiduciary duty only to the corporation shareholders.this duty includes an obligation not to take action which would be adverse to the corporation interests.ayr composition,rosenberg,internal quotations omitted.once a corporation becomes insolvent,however,the directors assume a fiduciary or duty to the corporation creditors.see id.at.in this relationship,officers and directors can not prefer one creditor over another,and they have a special duty not to prefer themselves.in re stevens.based on the allegations here,the trial court could find that the individual officers and directors of twin and foodtown breached their duties under their relationship by withholding and diverting for their own benefit the monies that should have been used to make contributions.
count iv aiding and abetting fiduciary duties 
in the fourth count of its complaint,appellant claimed that a s an employer under erisa,twin,foodtown and defendant control group members are fiduciaries with respect to union employees who were plan participants represented by plaintiff.id.appellant contends that defendants jointly and severally aided and abetted the breach of fiduciary duties owed to plan participants by twin,foodtown and the defendant control group members,by knowingly and willfully participating in those entities breach of their fiduciary duties under erisa.id.although the district court characterized appellant fiduciary duty claim in count iii of the complaint as a common law claim,it is not possible to understand appellant claim of aiding and abetting fiduciary duties in this manner.
in this count,appellant claim is that twin and foodtown breached fiduciary duties owed under erisa.in order to acquire fiduciary status under erisa,the party must be named as a fiduciary in the instrument establishing the plan named as a fiduciary pursuant to a procedure specified in a plan instrument or fall within the statutory definition of fiduciary.glaziers glassworkers newbridge,cir.section a provides that
