we grant the petition for rehearing filed by defendant murphy oil usa,and having duly considered the response,we withdraw the prior panel opinion,in its entirety and substitute the following 
in december,michael custer custer had an accident at his home and,as a result,suffered a ruptured disk in his neck.custer was totally disabled and unable to return to work.when custer inquired about medical coverage from his employer,murphy oil usa,murphy,he was informed that because he was totally disabled his employment would be terminated and he would no longer qualify for coverage under the group insurance plan for employees of murphy oil the plan.under the plan in effect prior to,custer would have been covered until he turned.murphy contends that the plan was modified in january,therefore allowing custer coverage to end when he was terminated.custer and his wife,marsha custer,the plaintiffs challenge the modifications to the plan by alleging that murphy did not comply with the employment retirement insurance security act erisa,et,reporting and disclosure requirements and did not comply with the plan modification procedures.further,the plaintiffs allege that murphy decision to terminate custer employment interfered with custer attainment of rights protected under erisa.
custer worked at murphy from to.he started as an but,by,he had worked his way up to shift foreman at murphy plant in meraux,louisiana.this promotion made custer a salaried employee and he became eligible for the plan.the plan is a group health plan administered by the employee benefit committee benefit committee.in november,the benefit committee met to consider changes to the plan benefits,specifically relating to the long term benefits for employees who become totally disabled and are unable to work.at the time,the plan allowed employees who became totally disabled,and whose employment was terminated as a result,to receive benefits until the age of the benefit committee agreed to make changes,limiting benefits of totally disabled employees to cobra continuation coverage for months.
although the benefit committee agreed to the changes,they were still pending approval from the corporate office when the employee benefits department the benefits department sent murphy annual open enrollment notice to all eligible employees in november.instead of announcing the proposed changes,the notice only announced the possibility that changes will follow.murphy claims that the corporate office approved the changes in early december and that,immediately thereafter,the benefits department mailed a written notice to all active employees notifying them of various changes to the plan which would be effective on january.although murphy claims it mailed this notice to custer at his address,the plaintiffs contend that they never received the december notice.in march,murphy asserts it mailed a new summary plan description spd to all active employees,which included two sections relating to the coverage for disabled and terminated employees.the plaintiffs attest that they did not receive the spd either.
on december,custer was injured while moving boxes in his attic.apparently,the attic stairs collapsed he fell eight feet and ruptured the disks in his neck.as a result of the accident,he was totally disabled and immediately went on a leave of absence from work.on january,the benefits department sent custer a letter explaining how some aspects of his benefits would be affected by his leave of absence,and included some forms which he filled out and returned on january.on may,the benefits department sent custer another set of forms,which were returned completed.in june of,custer called murphy to inquire about his benefits and was told that his employment could be terminated due to his disability and therefore he would be no longer covered under the plan,as amended in january.custer claims that this was the first he had heard of these amendments.
eventually,custer was terminated from his employment on september.the benefits department notified custer that his medical coverage ended when he was terminated but also informed him that he was eligible for cobra continuation coverage,which ended in april.
the plaintiffs filed suit against murphy in march,seeking a declaratory judgment and damages under the version of the plan.after delays due to hurricane katrina,murphy moved for summary judgment in april.the plaintiffs opposed the motion and filed a for summary judgment,but in june the district court granted summary judgment to murphy on all claims and denied the plaintiffs for summary judgment.
we review grants of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.chacko sabre,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party can show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this determination,we evaluate the facts in the light most favorable to the this case,the plaintiffs.keszenheimer reliance std.life ins,cir.
the plaintiffs first argue that murphy december notice did not comply with erisa reporting and disclosure requirements.erisa requires that a summary of any material modification in the terms of the plan shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and shall be furnished in accordance with section b of this title.a.the plaintiffs argue both that the notice was not furnished in accordance with b and that it was not written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.
section b sets out the requirements for how plan administrators must notify participants of material changes in the plan.the statute states that a summary description of such a material reduction in covered services or benefits shall be furnished to participants and beneficiaries not later than days after the date of the adoption of the modification or change.b.further,the secretary of labor has promulgated regulations interpreting the disclosure requirements of b t he plan administrator shall use measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt of the material by plan participants,beneficiaries and other specified individuals.b.the regulations indicate that distribution through mail fulfills the disclosure obligation.id.material distributed through the mail may be sent by first,second,or mail.williams plumbers steamfitters local pension plan,cir the plan administrator may send the summary of material modification by mail.degruise sprint,cir stating,with respect to a similar provision of cobra,that t his does not mean,however,that employers are required to ensure that plan participants actually receive notice.rather,it merely obligates employers to use means reasonably calculated to reach plan participants.footnote omitted.as a result,we look not at whether custer actually received the december notice but instead at the benefit committee method of distribution 
in arguing that it complied with the reporting and disclosure requirements,murphy asks this court to apply the mailbox rule.the version of the mailbox rule that murphy would have us apply provides that the proper and timely mailing of a document raises a rebuttable presumption that the document has been received by the addressee in the usual time.schikore bankamerica supplemental ret.plan,cir citing hagner united states.see also beck somerset,cir applying the mailbox rule.because this mailbox rule functions merely to create a presumption of receipt,it only comes into play when there is a material question as to whether a document was actually received.see,schikore,at we note that the plan requires only actual receipt and does not require any particular form of mailing.however,in this case,the question is not whether there was actual receipt by the plaintiffs,but rather whether the plan administrator use d measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt.b.since the focus here is on only whether notice was mailed,the mailbox rule does not operate in this context.
although the mailbox rule does not operate here to shift burdens and create presumptions,as murphy argues,the mailbox rule is still germane to our analysis.a threshold question for the application of the mailbox rule is whether there is sufficient evidence that the letter was actually mailed.because murphy contends that the measure the plan administrator used to ensure actual receipt was distribution by mail,we ask whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether murphy mailed the notice.
the summary judgment record provides no physical evidence that the december notices were mailed,such as business records,a signed receipt from certified mail,or a envelope.however,murphy does provide sworn affidavits from kristi saulsbury saulsbury,murphy supervisor of mail services,and alissa wilson wilson,a benefits analyst in murphy benefits department the two affidavits,read together,state that in distributing the december notices,murphy followed its normal mailing procedures and saulsbury specifically states that the envelopes were metered for postage and placed in bins for delivery by the united states postal service.both saulsbury and wilson supply a copy of the mailing list used to label the december notices,and the list contains custer name and address.a sworn statement is credible evidence of mailing for the purposes of the mailbox rule.schikore,at simpson jefferson standard life ins,cir same.
further,we have recognized that p lacing letters in the mail may be proved by circumstantial evidence,including customary mailing practices used in the sender business.wells fargo business credit ben kozloff,cir.to show that the normal procedures were followed in mailing the december notice,murphy provides the deposition testimony of ronald smith,the manager of the benefits department as well as the affidavits of saulsbury and wilson.saulsbury and wilson stated that,under the normal process the benefits department provides mail services with a list of addresses.mail services then prints labels of those names and addresses,placing them onto envelopes.the envelopes then go back to the benefits department for stuffing and sealing after which they are returned to mail services.the saulsbury and wilson affidavits also corroborate the deposition testimony of ronald smith.soon after the approval of the plan amendment,smith stated that his department stuffed the december notice of material modification into envelopes and the envelopes were delivered to the mail room.as smith put it,my department did the stuffing.the mail room did the mailing.
the individuals actually responsible for addressing and mailing the envelopes,anthony yarborough and david kilby,provided no evidence to support that the notices were mailed or how they were addressed.yarborough and kilby stated that the mail room does not keep,as a matter of practice,any records,reports,codes,or memoranda concerning what it sends out the mail room does not know the contents of sealed envelopes received from the benefits department and the computers and printers that would have been used to produce the lists to address the envelopes were discarded in february.yarborough and kilby provided no evidence,either physical or testimonial,to support smith claim that the notices had been properly addressed and sent.
the plaintiffs,for their part,provide sworn deposition testimony that they never received the notice.evidence of can be used to establish that the notice was never mailed.this is the inverse of the mailbox rule presumption of receipt.as wigmore on evidence states 
the presumption of receipt rests upon the supposed uniform efficiency of the postal service in delivering letters duly stamped,addressed,and mailed into its custody if therefore the efficiency is operating,does not the nonarrival of an alleged letter indicate that such a letter was never given into the postal custody 
wigmore on evidence at chadbourn but see,meckel continental resources,cir applying new york law and holding that denial of receipt does not upset finding that a notice was mailed.
in addition to the plaintiffs claim that they never received the notice,the plaintiffs produce four other employees of the meraux plant,also shift supervisors like custer,who could not recall receiving the notice.three of the four shift supervisors stated they retain benefits documents in records at their homes,and they expected that if they had received the notice it would have been in their records none was able to find the relevant notice in their personal records.all four stated they regularly discuss changes in the benefits plans,especially those resulting in reductions of coverage for spouses,as here,and none could remember discussing these changes until they learned of custer injury and the denial of benefits he expected to receive.although this is a sort of presumption when applied to the plaintiffs,it does corroborate the plaintiffs assertion that murphy did not mail the notice.
while the plaintiff ultimately bears the burden of demonstrating that murphy failed to use measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt of the notice,murphy,as the party moving for summary judgment,bears the burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact.see harvill westward commc,cir the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute.where critical evidence is so weak or tenuous on an essential fact that it could not support a judgment in favor of the nonmovant,or where it is so overwhelming that it mandates judgment in favor of the movant,summary judgment is appropriate.alton texas,cir.
first,we refuse to fully adopt wigmore inverse mailbox rule in this setting,such that a plaintiff bare assertion of could create a genuine issue of material fact to survive summary judgment.to do so would essentially require proof of receipt on the employer part where the regulations only require proof of mailing.but while proof of receipt is unnecessary,we can not forget that proof of mailing is still required.on the issue of mailing,it can not be said that either of alton grounds are satisfied,and thus summary judgment is improper.
turning back briefly to the evidence of mailing in this case,saulsbury asserts that the notice was mailed.but murphy has not produced any business records or other physical evidence that the notice was sent.in fact,murphy has presented no evidence,testimonial or otherwise,as to the day on which the notices were mailed.the only two individuals who make sworn statements that they received the notices are smith and wilson,both employees of the benefits department responsible for the mailing.the plaintiffs assert that they did not receive the notice.further,the plaintiffs assertion of is supported by the other meraux shift supervisors testimony that they also could not recall receiving the notice,and that they regularly retain such notices but could not locate the notice in their records 
while we refuse to adopt wigmore inverse mailbox rule in its entirety,in this case,where the employee assertion of is supported by circumstantial evidence,and the employer provides an equally weak assertion that notice was mailed,the issue of mailing should not be decided at summary judgment.wigmore on evidence at chadbourn testimony of mailing and testimony of should go to jury rosenthal walker.noting that the mailbox rule presumption of receipt is a mere inference of fact and,when it is opposed by evidence that the letters never were received,must be weighed with all the other circumstances of the case,by the jury.because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to mailing,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on this issue 
the plaintiffs also argue that even if murphy did use proper methods to distribute the notice,murphy was still not in compliance with because the language of the december notice was not written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.a see also a.
in november,murphy sent a notice announcing the plan open enrollment schedule and stating,
