background

under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement,psc was required to make contributions to central states pension plan.psc withdrew from the pension plan,and its obligation to contribute to the plan ended on november.on february,psc and other members of the control group received a notice and demand for payment of withdrawal liability from central states.see id.and b.on march,members of the control group received notice that their withdrawal liability payments were past due.psc and other members of the control group never made the payments.
on june,central states began an investigation of the control group.at this time,psc provided central states with access to records for psc subsidiaries,including phencorp.phencorp records included a list of its officers and directors serving from january,through june.the list indicated that brindley was a director of phencorp.according to central states,it contacted psc and confirmed that the list of officers and directors was current.

phencorp filed an opposition to central states motion for default judgment,arguing that service was improper because brindley was not an agent of phencorp.phencorp maintains that brindley was never an employee of phencorp that he had not been an officer or board member of phencorp since november,and that he was served at his home address,which is not owned by or affiliated with phencorp.
phencorp also filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,alleging a lack of personal jurisdiction.phencorp states that it is an insurance company organized under the laws of barbados,with its principal place of business in michael,barbados.according to phencorp,it does not have any employees,real estate,or a physical place of business in the united states,and it does not maintain a website.phencorp states that although in the past it provided insurance for five companies with operations in the united states,it currently does not conduct business in the united states and its only connection to the united states is that it is owned by psc.
