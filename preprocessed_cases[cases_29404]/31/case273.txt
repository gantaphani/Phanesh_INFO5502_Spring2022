opinion of the court 
a party seeking attorney fees under erisa must show some success on the merits.here,the district court incorrectly defined some success by requiring evidence of judicial action.we will reverse.
the appellants,two individuals and two pharmacies,originally brought a denial of benefits action under the employees retirement income security act erisa and two state law causes of action.the appellees are insurance companies.the underlying claims in this dispute concerned the appellees alleged refusal to honor appellants claims for payment of products.the original complaint was filed in.the insurance companies moved to dismiss,arguing that the appellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.
the district court denied the motion to dismiss and ordered the appellees to review the appellants claims for benefits.the appellees then paid the claims in full and the district court dismissed the complaint as a result of the appellees payments.following dismissal,both the appellants and the appellees filed for attorney fees and costs,which the district court denied.the parties appealed and we affirmed the district court decision to deny fees.templin independent blue cross,app cir.we remanded,however,on one issue whether the appellants were entitled to interest on the delayed payment of benefits.id.
on remand,appellants sought interest ranging from approximately to million.while most of this interest was sought under the maryland code,appellants also demanded approximately based on the federal treasury bill rate.the district court convened a hearing in january of at which it made comments suggesting that,in its view,interest at the federal rate was likely appropriate,but that interest under the maryland statute would be improper.based on these parameters,the district court encouraged the parties to reach a settlement.unable to do so,the appellants filed their third amended complaint.at a hearing in march of,the appellees agreed to pay in interest to the appellants.as a result of this settlement,the district court dismissed the case.after the matter had been dismissed,the appellants filed a motion for attorney fees and costs.they sought for work performed from november,until august.the district court denied the motion.
the district court believed that the appellants had failed to achieve some degree of success on the merits.hardt reliance standard life,d citation omitted.the court noted that it had never made a substantive determination on the question of whether appellants were entitled to receive interest under the erisa statute,and that the issue was settled among the parties outside the courtroom and without a judgment from the court.at.it also thought that the appellants failed to achieve success on the merits because the amount of interest they actually received was trivial when compared to the millions of dollars they originally sought.id.at.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and e,and we have jurisdiction to review its orders pursuant to.we review a district court decision on attorney fees and costs for an abuse of discretion.hahnemann.hosp.all shore.o ur review of the legal standards a district court applies in the exercise of its discretion is plenary.ellison shenango.pension,cir citation omitted.
the decision whether to award fees and costs usually involves two steps.first,a court must determine whether the moving party is eligible for such an award.if so,then courts evaluate the five factors we set out in ursic bethlehem mines,cir,to determine whether to exercise their discretion and order an award.as noted previously,eligibility for an award of fees and costs in erisa cases depends on whether the moving party has shown some degree of success on the merits,not on whether the moving party is the prevailing party in the litigation.hardt,at.the appellants argued to the district court that they achieved a level of success because,after the hearing in january of and after the filing of the amended complaint,the appellees voluntarily changed their position and agreed to pay interest.in effect,the appellants were pursuing a catalyst theory of recovery.the district court acknowledged the applicability of this theory in erisa cases even though we,to date,have not,but denied recovery because it believed that judicial action of some type was needed to serve as the catalyst,not the activities of litigation itself.
we begin with the larger question whether the catalyst theory can be used to show some success under the erisa statute.in our legal system,each litigant typically pays his or her own attorney fees,whether they win or lose.see brytus spang,cir.however,some statutes provide an exception that shifts payment of one party legal fees to the other.id.at.erisa is one such statute,providing that the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney fee and costs of action to either party.g.most provisions give courts the discretion to award fees only to the prevailing party.see.prior to,a prevailing party had to satisfy two requirements.first,it had to succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.farrar hobby,d.second,a prevailing party had to achieve its desired result through a court judgment.we permitted a prevailing party to be awarded fees under a catalyst theory provided that the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.see,baumgartner harrisburg housing,cir allowing catalyst theory under,the civil rights attorney fee award act,where the pressure of the lawsuit was a material contributing factor in bringing about extrajudicial relief.
in buckhannon board care home west virginia of health human services,the supreme court rejected the use of a catalyst theory where a request for fees had been made under the fair housing amendments act of fhaa and the americans with disabilities act of ada,d.the supreme court explained that a prevailing party must secure a judgment on the merits or a consent decree.id.at.we have not yet specifically determined whether,the catalyst theory of recovery remains available under erisa.we have little difficulty concluding that it does.
to begin,the erisa statute does not limit fee awards to the prevailing party.the supreme court specifically held that a claimant need not be a prevailing party to be eligible for an attorney fees award under erisa.hardt,at.instead,a fees claimant must show some degree of success on the merits before a court may award attorney fees under g.id.a party satisfies this requirement if a court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation some success on the merits without conducting a lengthy inquir y into the question whether a particular party success was substantial or occurred on a central issue.id.conversely,a claimant does not satisfy that requirement by achieving trivial success on the merits or a purely procedural victory id.internal quotation marks omitted.
additionally,the supreme court has specifically acknowledged that attorney fees are available even without a formal court order.ruckelshaus sierra club,d.ruckelshaus lays down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising the discretion that g grants.hardt,at.further,at least four other courts of appeal have applied,the catalyst theory to statutes that lack requirements,and the court of appeals for the second circuit has specifically done so under the erisa statute.see scarangella group health,cir see also ohio river valley env l coalition,green valley coal,cir sierra club env l protection agency,loggerhead turtle cty.council,cir.
the appellees urge us not to endorse this theory.they rely on the supreme court decision in buckhannon,in which the supreme court narrowed the use of the catalyst theory,finding that the defendant voluntary change of conduct did not establish the plaintiff as the prevailing party required for an award of attorney fees under the fha and the ada.appellees reliance on buckhannon is misplaced.in hardt,the supreme court held that erisa includes no prevailing party requirement and instead vests district courts with broader discretion to award attorney fees.at.the su
