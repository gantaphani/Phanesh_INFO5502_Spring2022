in enacting erisa,congress created a comprehensive scheme for employee welfare benefit plans that completely preempts any cause of action that duplicates,supplements,or supplants an erisa remedy.aetna health davila,d.complete preemption converts a state law civil complaint alleging a cause of action that falls within erisa enforcement provisions into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the complaint rule.id.quoting metro.life ins.taylor,d.in other words,even if the plaintiff did not plead a federal cause of action on the face of the complaint,the claim is necessarily federal in character if it implicates erisa civil enforcement scheme.giles,at quoting taylor,at.
erisa civil enforcement scheme is laid out in a of the erisa statute.section a b establishes that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary t o recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.therefore,if a party state law claims fall under this a b definition,they are preempted by erisa.
aetna argues that lone star state law claims seek to recover benefits due to lone star under the terms of their patients member plans and are thus preempted by erisa.lone star,however,argues that their state law claims arise solely from the provider agreement,as aetna failed to pay the correct contractual rate for services rendered to patients who were members of aetna plans there are thus two issues we must resolve whether state law claims that arise out of a contract between medical providers and an erisa plan are preempted by erisa and whether lone star state law claims in fact implicate only rate of payment issues under the provider agreement,or if they actually involve benefit determinations under the relevant plan.
in order to determine whether lone star claims fall within the scope of a,we must look at the relationship between the provider agreement and the erisa plans.in davila,the supreme court held that 
i f an individual,at some point in time,could have brought his claim under erisa a b,and where there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant actions,then the individual cause of action is completely by erisa a b.
davila,at.emphasis added.the erisa preemption question thus turns on whether the provider agreement creates a legal duty independent of the erisa this case,a duty to pay a specific contractual rate for services rendered under the erisa plan.
it is clear that the provider agreement and the erisa plans each other the provider agreement establishes that aetna will pay lone star and lone star physicians claims for covered services,where covered services are those services recognized as medically necessary under the terms of the relevant erisa plan.the erisa plans state that aetna will pay recognized charges,and,under the definition of recognized charges,state that where aetna has an agreement with a health care provider,the recognized charge is the rate established in that agreement.the provider agreement also establishes the rates of payment receivable from aetna for treating plan members.under the provider agreement,lone star is to be paid the lesser of i its usual,customary,and reasonable billed charges ii the rates set forth in the compensation schedule or iii the fee schedule in the member plan.
however,determination of the rate that aetna owes lone star under the provider agreement does not require any kind of benefit determination under the erisa plan.the fee schedules in the member plans in this case all refer back to the provider agreement.the provider agreement sets out the compensation schedule,which establishes the rate of payment as a fixed percentage of the aetna market fee schedule,a standard schedule used by aetna that is updated annually and based on the location where the service is performed.the aetna market fee schedule relies on codes used by doctors known as cpt codes,which identify the medical procedure performed by the doctor.each cpt code has a different rate of reimbursement under the aetna market fee schedule.thus,in calculating what it owes lone star,aetna determines the reimbursement rate under the aetna market fee schedule for each cpt code submitted by the doctor,and pays lone star the fixed percentage set out in the provider agreement of that amount.
lone star concedes that in calculating the correct contractual rate,the amounts of the plan member will have to be accounted for,and those amounts are set out in the erisa plan,not the provider agreement.however,lone star argues that mere consultation of an erisa plan is not enough to bring the claims within the scope of a.
we agree.a claim that implicates the rate of payment as set out in the provider agreement,rather than the right to payment under the terms of the benefit plan,does not run afoul of davila and is not preempted by erisa.see blue cross anesthesia care assocs.med.group,cir.though the plan and the provider agreement each other,the terms of the particular,those related to not at issue in a dispute over whether aetna paid the correct rate for covered services as set out in the provider agreement.while aetna is correct that any determination of benefits under the terms of a,what is medically necessary or a covered service does fall within erisa,lone star claims are entirely separate from coverage and
