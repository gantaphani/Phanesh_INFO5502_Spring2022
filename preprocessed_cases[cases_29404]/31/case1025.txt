background 
smith is a registered nurse.during,she worked as an infection health nurse at the northwest arkansas rehabilitation hospital in fayetteville,arkansas.in may,laura koehn koehn,a board certified,diagnosed smith with a class iv rast allergy to latex.on november,smith employer suspended her for poor work performance,and on november,smith was terminated.smith attributed her work deficiency to her latex hypersensitivity.
on november,smith applied for her employer disability benefits.under the terms of the disability policy with unum,smith was eligible to receive benefits for twelve months if unum determined she was disabled from performing the material and substantial duties of her regular occupation.after the period,smith would continue receiving benefits only if unum determined that due to the same sickness or injury smith was unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which she is reasonably fitted by education,training,or experience.the policy also provided that unum would terminate benefits after twelve months of payments,upon a finding that smith is able to work in any gainful occupation on a basis,but chooses not to work.basis is defined as the ability to work and earn or more of your indexed monthly earnings.
in support of her disability claim,smith submitted statements from seven treating physicians.all seven physicians diagnosed smith as having a latex allergy and advised smith to limit,and where possible,avoid exposure to latex.a family practitioner warned that smith is at a high risk for life threatening reaction to latex.two other treating physicians concluded smith should not work in an environment containing latex.one of these treating physicians discussed with smith the possible necessity of changing occupations to avoid latex exposure.
two of smith treating physicians imposed further work restrictions.koehn advised that smith should avoid all latex exposure or as much as not work in medical or paramedical profession due to presence of latex.however,because latex is ubiquitous in our environment,the allergist noted it would be impossible to find a latex free work environment for smith,and concluded smith probably will not be able to return to work as a result of her latex sensitivity.a primary care physician,doty murphy murphy,noted that smith has a severe latex sensitivity which render s her incapable of any work activity.murphy explained smith allergy was more than an inconvenience and could result in her death,hospitalization,prolonged aggravation of her disability.murphy did acknowledge that when smith is not exposed to latex,she is able to function in her home and perform minimal activities.neither koehn nor murphy addressed the possibility of smith performing employment.
in august,unum approved smith claim for disability benefits based on its determination that smith was disabled from performing her regular occupation,and unum paid benefits retroactively from february.in may,unum commissioned michael joseph joseph,a board certified allergist and immunologist,to perform an independent medical examination ime of smith.when unum scheduled the ime,koehn prescribed that the ime should be conducted in a environment.when smith arrived at joseph office for the ime,she discovered that not one of the examination rooms was latex free.joseph used a pair of vinyl gloves borrowed from smith to perform the ime.despite her exposure to latex in the medical office,smith suffered no immediate allergic reaction during the ime.
due to smith concerns about latex exposure,joseph reported that his examination of her was somewhat limited,although he did not identify the limitations on his examination.smith reported a history of intermittent rash with shortness of breath when exposed to latex,and also noted multiple food allergies.joseph observed that smith heart and lungs were unremarkable and that her skin did not reveal any hives or swelling.joseph performed a rast test on smith that revealed a class iv ige reaction to latex which he interpreted as being consistent with moderate hypersensitivity to latex antigens.
following his examination and review of smith medical history,joseph opined that smith has a history of asthma and possible anaphylaxis and contact urticaria when exposed to latex in the work area.consistent with the opinions of smith treating physicians,joseph believed smith should be restricted from exposure to latex.however,joseph felt that many of her previous symptoms of asthma may not be related to latex exposure because the delayed reactions would not be consistent with latex hypersensitivity.he concluded that smith should be able to continue her occupation as an employee health nurse in a clinic or hospital environment.alternatively,he wrote,smith can work in any area where latex use is limited.he further suggested that smith asthma could be treated more aggressively.
the day after the ime,smith called unum to complain about joseph.specifically,smith complained that despite koehn medical directive that smith be protected against latex exposure,joseph exposed her to latex,failed to listen to her lungs,and told her he had seen one person with a latex allergy in an emergency room.smith also complained she was not feeling good because of the latex exposure.koehn called unum to advise she had prescribed smith prednisone for a short time because of her delayed reaction to the latex exposure during the ime.according to koehn,smith was doing better,although her blood sugars were out of control due to the prednisone medication.koehn also reported contacting joseph to inquire about his clinical experience in treating latex allergy and he told her he had read text books on the subject.
in august,unum commissioned a vocational consultant to perform a transferable skills analysis on smith.using the residual functional capacities outlined in joseph written report,the vocational consultant determined smith skills were readily transferable to positions in risk management,healthcare administration,and social or medical services.he determined employment in office settings,as opposed to medical facilities and laboratories,would be consistent with the work parameters outlined in joseph ime.the consultant also concluded smith was able to assume full time work in a setting where use of latex,particularly medical latex products such as gloves are not in use.
unum also referred smith file to another vocational expert to address specific issues pertaining to the presence of latex in commercial offices and office equipment.in his vocational review,this expert opined that latex office sources can be replaced with items and that gloves provided added protection against latex exposure.he reported that automobiles and office settings offer similar types of latex exposure and reasoned that a person who could operate an automobile would be able to function in an office setting with the use of items and gloves.finally,this expert reported that peripheral computer equipment,such as a mouse pad,keyboard and calculator,is available and is known to provide effective barrier protection for persons with latex allergy,although he was not aware of any computers.
following the ime and vocational consultations,francis bellino,bellino,unum reviewing physician,conducted two medical revi
