clair morgan appeals the district court decision that he is not entitled to receive pension benefits from the contractors,laborers,teamsters,and engineers pension plan plan.morgan applied for pension benefits after making contributions to the plan for approximately thirty years.we reverse because serious procedural irregularities led to breach of the trustees fiduciary duties and morgan is entitled to benefits under the terms of the plan.
background 
from to,morgan was a principal,officer,and shareholder of appellee m s grading m s.morgan asserts that during this period,he also acted as an employee by operating and performing mechanical work on equipment that was within the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the international union of operating engineers and m consequently,he made regular contributions to the plan like his union employees.
in,morgan applied to the plan for pension benefits.to be eligible for a pension,an individual must be an employee as defined by the language of the plan.article i,section of the plan,provides,in part,as follows 
the term employee shall mean any person covered by collective bargaining agreements between the employer and the unions who is engaged in employment with respect to which the employer is obligated to make contributions to the pension fund.the term employee as used herein shall also mean all employees of a participating union who elects sic to participate in this plan who are not excluded under irc b because of a collective bargaining agreement which either does not provide for contributions to this fund,or,provides for contributions to another fund as a result of good faith bargaining the term employee does not include any partner,independent contractor,person or any controlling shareholder who,directly or indirectly controls an employer.determination of who is a controlling shareholder shall be made by the trustees according to the rules of uniform application unless prohibited by law from being covered under the pension fund,the foregoing definition shall not exclude any person who worked regularly as an employee and on whose behalf payments are required to be made to the fund pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or participation agreement with the union for bargaining unit work.
after receiving morgan application for pension benefits,the trustees of the plan wrote and requested that he provide any information which would be helpful in the determination of whether or not he was an employee of m s and the operating engineers local union.the trustees specifically requested that morgan provide information regarding whether he performed work as an employee of m s for which contributions were required to be made whether he was an employee as defined in the plan and whether he had actually retired from the construction industry.morgan did not respond to this request for information.instead,after a period of nearly two years,morgan submitted a new application for pension benefits which indicated that his effective date of retirement from m s would be january.
on january,the trustees denied morgan application.the plan administrator informed morgan that his application was denied,in part,because he had not demonstrated that he was retired from the construction industry,or that he had worked regularly as an employee during a sufficient period of time to be eligible to participate in the plan.morgan appealed,and an administrative review hearing was held on may,before the plan board of trustees.at the hearing,morgan testified that although he was the owner of m s,he had operated and performed mechanical work on equipment for years.this equipment was of a type covered by the collective bargaining agreements between the international union of operating engineers and m morgan also testified that union representatives,some of whom were trustees of the plan,were aware that he maintained and operated his equipment himself because his employees reported these activities to the union.these union representatives periodically investigated the reports to ensure that morgan union card was current.without a union membership,the collective bargaining agreements prohibited morgan from operating or maintaining his equipment.morgan also testified that these union officials encouraged him to continue making contributions to the plan 
they told me you a mechanic and you carrying water,you carrying antifreeze,you working on machinery,you on the machine again.i had guys on the job who call the union all because i was running a machine.they drive out to make sure my union card was current they said,well,stay in the union.so i paid them every month for years.i met them every single month for years.i was advised every month for years to pay your dues,stay in the union or you going to have a big problem with the employees.
i ca emphasize about how many times i went over that issue as to staying in the union.they said technically you ca put antifreeze in the machine without belonging to the union,you ca do mechanical work on your own machinery without belonging to the union,you ca carry oil,you ca grease the machinery,you ca work on the equipment,you ca operate the equipment.clair,stay in the union,i was literally told that tens and tens and tens of times.
i was asked why would you want to get out your bills are paid and you got insurance.clair,you not going to be doing this forever,stay in the union.the longer you stay in your benefits for retirement will increase every year,stay in the union until you retire then everybody will be happy.
joint appendix.
from through,m s reported a total of hours for which contributions were required to be made to the plan on morgan behalf.these records were submitted to the trustees for consideration in connection with morgan appeal.morgan testified that these records were audited every three or four years by the plan.according to morgan,the auditor knew that contributions were being made on his behalf despite his status as an owner.however,neither the auditor nor any plan representatives informed morgan that he was ineligible to participate in the plan,or that m s should discontinue submitting contributions on his behalf.rather,morgan asserts that he received yearly reports outlining the monthly retirement benefits he would receive following his retirement.
despite the lack of any evidence to discredit either morgan assertion that he regularly performed bargaining unit work,or the time records submitted by m s,morgan appeal was denied by a to vote.four of the five no votes were submitted by employer representatives,while the lone favorable vote was cast by one of the two employee representatives among the trustees.morgan responded by filing suit,pursuant to,against the plan and the six trustees in the united states district court for the district of nebraska.following a hearing,the district court upheld the trustees decision to deny morgan application for benefits,and ordered the plan to refund to m s the actual contributions that were made on morgan behalf.the court concluded that the appeal hearing was procedurally flawed because the trustees considered information outside of the record in denying morgan application.despite this irregularity,however,the court determined that the trustees had not breached their fiduciary duties when they denied morgan appeal.the court held that the trustees properly discredited morgan testimony because it was not supported by documentary evidence,and that the trustees did not abuse their discretion by denying morgan claim for benefits.
during these proceedings,the testimony of the various trustees was presented.this testimony reveals that their decisions were based upon a variety of improper considerations.appellee calvin negus,an employer representative,testified that he denied morgan application because morgan was an owner,and an owner is supposed to be making contributions.negus discredited morgan testimony because he did not believe an owner would have had time to operate and maintain machinery in the manner morgan described,although he admitted that he did not have any actual knowledge of morgan daily activiti
