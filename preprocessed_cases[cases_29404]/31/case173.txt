background 
the joint board is an administrator and fiduciary of several erisa funds established by collective bargaining agreements between local union of the international brotherhood of electrical workers,the union and employers supplying electrical services.whiffen was one such employer at all points relevant to this litigation.pursuant to one of these collective bargaining agreements with the union the cba,whiffen was obligated to withhold specified portions of employees wages and,on a monthly basis,remit them to the joint board for deposit in several erisa funds,including a cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of internal revenue code k,k the k plan.
in september the joint board received two checks from whiffen bearing romanowicz signature,one in the amount of and the other for,conveyed in accordance with the cba terms.however,each was dishonored and returned to the joint board due to insufficient funds.in august,the joint board received another check from whiffen,again signed by romanowicz,this time in the amount of.as with the previous checks,the august check was dishonored.from august,through october,whiffen failed to make payments required under the cba to various erisa funds administered by the joint board.similarly,from july,through october,whiffen failed to remit required contributions to the k plan.
in march,the joint board filed suit against whiffen and ramonowicz,alleging that,in violation of,each had failed to remit timely contributions to the k plan and other erisa plans administered by the joint board the joint board sought to recover from whiffen all funds withheld from the k plan and other funds owed for the period from august,to october,it also sought to impose joint and several liability against whiffen and romanowicz for delinquent contributions to the k plan under the theory that romanowicz had withheld contributions in breach of a fiduciary duty further,the joint board averred that,under section b of the,romanowicz was personally liable for the dishonored checks 
neither whiffen nor romanowicz responded to the complaint or otherwise appeared before the district court to defend the lawsuit brought by the joint board.on june,the joint board requested that the clerk of the court enter defendants default pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.see.a when a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend,and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise,the clerk must enter the party default.on the same day,the joint board moved for a default judgment against both defendants,arguing that further briefing was not necessary to establish defendants liability because entry of judgment in their favor would require no findings of fact and there are no disputed questions of law.motion for default judgment see also.b noting that a district court may conduct hearings or make referrals to enter or effectuate a default judgment.
the district court noted defendants default and referred the matter to magistrate judge steven gold to recommend an award of damages.whiffen and romanowicz again failed to respond to the joint board allegations after reviewing the complaint and documents submitted by the joint board,the magistrate judge concluded that the joint board had established whiffen liability for unpaid contributions to the k plan and other benefit funds and recommended an award of for unpaid contributions to the k plan and for unpaid contributions to other funds.magistrate judge gold also recommended an award of in interest,in liquidated damages,and in attorneys fees and costs.see g authorizing awards of unpaid contributions,interest,attorney fees and costs,and other legal or equitable relief.
magistrate judge gold recommended dismissal of the joint board claims against romanowicz.first,the magistrate judge concluded that the joint board had failed to make out a prima facie case for breach of fiduciary duty against romanowicz because it had not established that he was a fiduciary of the k plan.second,magistrate judge gold reasoned that romanowicz was not personally liable under the for the dishonored checks because,in the magistrate judge view,the parties likely understood that romanowicz signed them in a representative capacity,report and recommendation,and that the joint board had offered no evidence,nor made any assertions of fact,suggesting there was not such an understanding,id.at.
over the joint board timely objection,the district court adopted magistrate judge gold report and recommendation,holding that the joint board had failed to establish romanowicz alleged fiduciary status because the board did not demonstrate romanowicz exercise of authority over k plan assets.see finkel,wl at.after noting that the joint board characterized magistrate judge gold second conclusion as clearly erroneous,the district court agreed with the magistrate judge finding that the parties understood romanowicz to have signed the dishonored checks in a representative capacity.see id.at.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,the joint board argues that the district court erred in holding that romanowicz was not a fiduciary of the k plan,failing to conduct a hearing prior to dismissing the claim,and holding that,under the,romanowicz was not personally liable for the dishonored checks because he signed them in a representative capacity.
in light of romanowicz default,a court is required to accept all of the joint board factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor,see au bon pain artect,cir noting that,where a party moves for a default judgment after another party default,the moving party is entitled to all reasonable inferences from the evidence offered,but it is also required to determine whether the joint board allegations establish romanowicz liability as a matter of law,see id.a district court retains discretion under federal rule of civil procedure b once a default is determined to require proof of necessary facts and need not agree that the alleged facts constitute a valid cause of action.
we review de novo a district court application of law to undisputed facts,see,in re new times sec,cir,which in this case were established through the joint board pleadings,submissions to the district court,and romanowicz default see lopresti terwilliger,cir w here the facts are not in question,whether a party is an erisa fiduciary is purely a question of law.quoting kayes pac.lumber,cir.
fiduciary duty 
pursuant to,see note,ante,where an employer has entered into a collective bargaining agreement requiring him to remit funds to an erisa plan,the employer is obligated to make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement.if an employer fails to make required contributions,a fiduciary of the plan may sue the employer,or another fiduciary of the plan,as that term is defined under erisa,to recover the unpaid contributions.see,notes,ante.in turn,erisa provides alternative definitions of fiduciary.for example,erisa provides that a fiduciary is someone who exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of an erisa benefit plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets.a i emphasis added.
in this case,the joint board alleged that employees elective contributions to the k plan were withheld from employees wages and maintained by romanowicz and whiffen as part of whiffen general assets for the benefit of romanowicz and whiffen,rather than being remitted to the k plan.complaint at.with respect to his role in withholding and failing to remit wages,the joint board alleged that romanowicz,by virtue of his position as an officer of whiffen,exercised control over whiffen assets,including the general assets with which withheld contributions were commingled,failed to advise participants or employees of whiffen that whiffen and romanowicz had failed and refused to remit the withheld contributions to the k plan.complaint at emphasis added.based on these allegations,the joint board concluded that romanowicz exercised authority or control over plan assets.thus,romanowicz was a fiduciar y of the plan within the meaning of a i.complaint at.similarly,in its objection to the magistrate judge recommendation that its claim be dismissed,the joint board alleged that a s the principal of whiffen,romanowicz withheld employee elective contributions from employee paychecks and did not make required contributions to the k plan.
in dismissing the action against romanowicz,the district court reasoned that,under,whiffen was obligated to remit withheld employee wages to the joint board for deposit in the k plan and that the funds withheld from the k plan were assets within the meaning of a i however,the district court concluded that the joint board failed to allege that romanowicz had the authority to determine which company bills to pay and when or he exercise d that authority by using the money from the unpaid contributions for company payments.finkel,wl at quoting a i.
on appeal,the joint board presses the view that a i description of a fiduciary as one who exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of erisa plan assets accurately characterizes romanowicz role in administering the k plan assets in this case.the joint board contends that,in omitting discretionary from this definition of fiduciary under a i,congress intended to establish that an individual need only exercise minimal control over plan assets in order to be regarded as an erisa fiduciary.in the joint board view,the district court erred in holding that under a i an erisa fiduciary must enjoy some discretionary authority over the disposition of company assets.
although we have recognized that congress intended erisa definition of fiduciary to be broadly construed,lopresti,at internal quotation marks omitted,we have also concluded that management or disposition of erisa plan assets refers to the common transactions in dealing with a pool of assets selecting investments,exchanging one instrument or asset for another,and so on,harris trust sav.bank john hancock mut.life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted webster third new international dictionary unabridged defining management to include the act of conducting or supervising something as a business esp the executive function of planning,organizing,coordinating,directing,and supervising any industrial or business project or activity with responsibility for results emphasis added.
contrary to the joint board assertions,the district court was not free to conclude that romanowicz status as an officer of whiffen made him a fiduciary of the k plan.lopresti,at unlike the common law definition under which fiduciary status is determined by virtue of the position a person holds,erisa definition is functional.internal quotation marks omitted.we have held that even where an individual was an officer of a company,was authorized to sign checks on the company account,and had some general knowledge that deductions were made from employees wages,he still was not an erisa fiduciary because he had no responsibility for determining which of the company creditors would be paid or in what order.lopresti,at internal quotation marks omitted.
accepting all of the joint board allegations in this case as true and drawing all inferences in its favor,we conclude that romanowicz was simply an officer of whiffen,that he signed checks on the company behalf,and that he and whiffen maintained plan assets for the benefit of romanowicz and whiffen,complaint at.the joint board has not alleged that romanowicz select ed investments or exchang ed one instrument for another.harris trust sav.bank,at.nor has it alleged that he was responsibil e for determining which of the company creditors would be paid or in what order,lopresti,at internal quotation marks omitted,or otherwise enjoyed authority or control over the management of k plan assets.in short,the joint board has not alleged that romanowicz engaged in,or had the authority to engage in,any activities that would make him a fiduciary under a i definition of that term.
in sum,the joint board allegations are not sufficient to establish romanowicz status as a fiduciary.
hearing prior to dismissal 
the joint board contention that the district court erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to dismissing its claim against romanowicz is without merit.under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,where a party has applied for a default judgment,the district court may conduct hearings or make referrals in order to,among other things,determine the amount of damages,establish the truth of any allegation by evidence,or investigate any other matter.b emphasis added.in permitting,but not requiring,a district court to conduct a hearing before ruling on a default judgment,rule b commits this decision to the sound discretion of the district court.we therefore review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.see sims blot,cir a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the joint board asserts that the district court erred inasmuch as it sua sponte,undertook to analyze the substantive claims against romanowicz without giving the joint board the opportunity to submit further evidence that would tend to show that romanowicz acted as a fiduciary.appellant br.our review of the record reveals that,notwithstanding its contention on appeal,the joint board never asked for a hearing,and one was not necessary.the joint board had ample opportunity to amend its complaint or supplement its allegations with evidence prior to moving for a default judgment against romanowicz.in moving for default judgment,the joint board chose to rely on the allegations in its complaint as well as two declarations and seventeen exhibits that it submitted with its motion for a default judgment.the joint board not only failed to request a hearing but it assured the district court that entry of a default judgment against romanowicz would entail no findings of fact or disputed questions of law.similarly,the joint board did not ask for a hearing on its objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.
following romanowicz default,there were no disputed issues of fact,and particularly in light of the joint board failure to request a hearing,we have no trouble concluding that the district court acted well within its discretion in proceeding without one.
personal liability for dishonored checks 
finally,we turn to the joint board argument that the district court erred in holding that romanowicz could not be liable for dishonored checks he signed on behalf of whiffen pursuant to section of the,a n authorized representative who signs his name to an instrument except as otherwise established between the immediate parties,is personally obligated if the instrument names the person represented but does not show that the representative signed in a representative capacity.b.as ex
