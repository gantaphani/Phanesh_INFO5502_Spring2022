this interpleader action requires us to interpret the scope of the qualified domestic relations order qdro provisions of erisa.yvonne curry,the designated beneficiary of charles myers erisa pension plan,appeals the district court summary judgment distributing the bulk of myers plan proceeds to the mother of his children,suzanne tise.the pension plan trustees,for their part,appeal the district court order awarding them in attorneys fees for their expenses incurred as interpleader plaintiff.we affirm the district court in both respects,although,on the merits,on a different legal analysis than the one adopted by the district court.
background 
myers,an independent television and film director,was a member of the directors guild and a participant in its pension plan,the directors guild of pension benefits plan the plan before his death in three parties had emerged to assert competing claims on the proceeds of his pension plan curry,the designated beneficiary,with whom myers was living at the time of his death tise,who had long ago obtained a child support order and the internal revenue service irs.although the irs has withdrawn its claim,curry and tise remain locked in a bitter dispute over who is entitled to the plan proceeds.
the roots of this controversy are some three decades old.tise and myers lived together in the late and early,and together had two daughters,chloe and cybele.in,several years after her relationship with myers ended,tise obtained a default paternity and child support judgment against him in marin county superior court.myers never paid child support voluntarily,and over the years,tise collected only from him.
in october,tise returned to state court,where she secured an order to show cause barring the directors guild of america from disbursing any proceeds from myers pension plan without first notifying tise attorney.although the order did not name the plan,the plan received a copy of this order in december of that year.
not only did myers shirk his child support obligations,he also neglected his income taxes.as a result he owed the irs more than.in june,the irs served a notice of levy on the plan,requiring the plan to pay the irs from myers pension plan proceeds in order to satisfy myers tax debt.now faced with two claimants on myers pension plan proceeds,the plan notified tise attorney in july that myers pension was soon to become payable and that other parties had asserted entitlements to the proceeds.in this letter,the plan also asked whether tise intended to obtain a qdro.see generally d.
in response to this letter,tise immediately returned to superior court and obtained a writ of execution and a notice of levy against the plan in the amount in which myers was in arrears on his child support payments.in december,tise secured an order to show cause alleging that the plan had failed to comply with the writ of execution and with tise request for an accounting of funds,and demanding that the distribution of myers plan proceeds be enjoined until a qdro could issue.
at a hearing on that request on february,the superior court concluded that,under state law,the plan had not been properly joined in the proceedings tise then took steps to join the plan,ultimately moving on march,for an order declaring her entitled to a qdro.the plan opposed tise effort to achieve joinder,and further took the position that tise was ineligible as a matter of law to obtain a qdro giving her a right to myers pension plan proceeds.
meanwhile,on february,myers died.under the terms of his pension plan,death benefits,in the form of monthly payments equivalent to those myers would have received himself had he retired the day before he died,then became payable to his designated beneficiary.less than two months before his death,on december,myers had executed a designation of beneficiary form naming curry as his sole beneficiary.
faced with three competing claimants to the proceeds of myers pension plan,not all of whose claims could be satisfied,the plan filed an interpleader complaint in the district court on april,naming as defendants curry,tise,and the united states.the plan asked the court to determine how much money the plan was obligated to pay to each,and deposited myers plan proceeds with the court registry.four days later,the plan sought,ex parte,and obtained,a stay of tise state court proceedings pending the resolution of the interpleader.
in due course,curry,tise,and the united states filed their answers in the interpleader action.on august,the plan noticed a motion for discharge from liability and dismissal from the action,and moved for attorneys fees and costs.a hearing was scheduled on the plan motion but,following a case management conference on august,the hearing was vacated,and two weeks later the plan withdrew its motions.
in november,tise moved for a stay of the interpleader action while she returned to state court to secure a qdro.curry and the plan,but not the united states,opposed her motion.on february,the district court granted tise motion for a stay.
back in marin county superior court,tise secured an order on april,styled order re qdro for child support arrears,interest accrued thereon and attorneys fees and costs relating to enforcement of child support.in the order,the superior court noted that it had issued an order in asserting its jurisdiction over myers employee pension plan benefits,including death benefits,and created in tise the right to collect the child support arrears from myers employee pension plan benefits.the superior court determined that tise was entitled to in child support arrears and attorneys fees related to enforcing her right to child support,and issued an order nunc pro tunc to october,to effect the enforcement of the child support order of this court entered and the order of this court of,which vested in tise the right to collect the child support from myers employee pension plan benefits.
armed with this order,tise returned to federal court,where the interpleader proceedings resumed.the parties stipulated to the plan dismissal from the action,and on june,the plan renewed its motion for attorneys fees.on july,the district court decided,on for summary judgment and on the plan fees motion,to award to the united states,to tise,and to the plan for attorneys fees.
both curry and the plan appealed the distribution of funds.less than a week before oral argument on the appeals,the irs withdrew its claim on the interpleaded fund,for reasons never explained.the panel that was to have heard the case remanded it to the district court for redistribution of the fund,but retained appellate jurisdiction.
on november,the district court entered an amended judgment and order,reallocating the proceeds of myers pension plan among tise,curry,and the plan.under the amended judgment,tise received in child support arrears and in attorneys fees,fully satisfying the state court order,the plan again received in attorneys fees,and the balance of the fund went to curry.curry and the plan resumed their appeals.
ii.the qdro provision 
curry argues that she is entitled to the entire fund because,as myers designated beneficiary,she automatically became vested in the death benefit upon his death in,so that the order tise obtained in requiring that the plan pay the death benefit to her instead is unenforceable.to evaluate curry claim,we begin by closely analyzing erisa qdro provision,a task that,unfortunately,requires some tolerance for acronyms.
prior to enactment of the retirement equity act of rea,the courts of appeals disagreed about whether state court orders issued pursuant to domestic relations proceedings could affect the distribution of pension benefits governed by erisa.some courts held that erisa blanket prohibition on the assignment or alienation of plan benefits,see c,barred assignments decreed by state courts in domestic relations actions.responding to the confusion on this point,and taking into account changes in work patterns,the status of marriage as an economic partnership,and the substantial contribution to that partnership of spouses who work both in and outside the home,congress amended erisa in specifically to provide for assignments of plan benefits to former spouses and dependents.see senate judiciary committee.at see also stewart thorpe holding,cir ablamis roper,cir.
the rea created an exception to erisa general bar on the assignment of pension plan proceeds for individuals who present qdros to plan administrators.d.qdros are a subset of domestic relations orders dros dros are any orders relating to the provision of child support,alimony,or marital property rights to a spouse,former spouse,child,or other dependent of a plan participant made pursuant to a state domestic relations law.d ii.a dro is a qdro if it creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee right to,or assigns to an alternate the right to,receive all or part of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a n erisa plan,d b,and does not require the plan to provide any type of benefit not otherwise provided,require the plan to provide increased benefits,or require benefits to be paid to an alternate payee which must be paid to another alternate payee under another qdro,d d see also samaroo samaroo,cir.finally,a qdro must specify the name and mailing address of the alternate payee and the affected plan participant,the amount or percentage of the participant benefits to be paid or the means by which that amount will be determined,the number of payments or time period to which the order applies,and the plan to which the order applies.d c.we recently examined this language and held that a dro that substantially complies with these requirements is a qdro.stewart,at.
the qdro provision is an exception not only to erisa rule against assignment of plan benefits but also to erisa broad preemption of state law.b.state family law can,therefore,create enforceable interests in the proceeds of an erisa plan,so long as those interests are articulated in accord with the qdro provision requirements.
qdros and creation of enforceable interests in benefit plans 
the central issue in this the plan is required to honor the state court order tise obtained in on the precise manner in which an alternate payee interest in an erisa plan is enforced under erisa qdro provisions.
primary responsibility for determining whether a dro is a qdro that establishes obligations for an erisa plan rests with the plan itself.d g.upon obtaining a domestic relations order in a state court proceeding,an alternate payee who seeks to establish a right to payment pursuant to that order from an benefit plan must present the order to the pension plan administrator for a determination of whether it is a qdro an alternate payee who thus submits a domestic relations order to an erisa plan places the plan on notice that the dro may be a qdro,and that,under state law,the alternate payee may be entitled to some or all of the benefits that have accrued in the plan with respect to a participant.
under this scheme,then,whether an alternate payee has an interest in a participant pension plan is a matter decided by a state court according to the state domestic relations law.whether a state court order meets the statutory requirements to be a qdro,and therefore is enforceable against the pension plan,is a matter determined in the first instance by the pension plan administrator,and,if necessary,by a court of competent jurisdiction.see d h i.
it therefore follows,as we recently explained,that t he qdro provisions of erisa do not suggest that the alternate payee has no interest in the plan until she obtains a qdro,they merely prevent her from enforcing that interest until the qdro is obtained.in re gendreau,cir,cert.denied,d see also stewart,at securing a dro that creates an interest in the proceeds of a pension plan gives the bearer the right to obtain a proper qdro.
gendreau illustrates this critical point.in gendreau,this court considered whether a plan participant could,by filing for bankruptcy,prevent his former wife from obtaining a qdro giving effect to their divorce decree by awarding her a percent interest in his pension plan proceeds.we concluded that the state court created the wife interest in the husband pension plan,and correspondingly limited the husband interest in it,at the time of the divorce decree.see gendreau,at.that the ensuing payment order did not meet the statutory requirements for a qdro did not alter the parties interests in the husband pension plan proceeds.rather,the wife simply had to return to state court for a revised order that would pass muster as a qdro.id.at.the divorce decree and original payment order,however defective under erisa,allowed the wife to stake a claim to the husband pension proceeds,but that claim could only be enforced by obtaining a qdro 
qdros and the onset of benefit payments 
because a qdro only renders enforceable an interest,there is no conceptual reason why a qdro must be obtained before the plan participant benefits become payable on account of his retirement or death.several features of the statute language and structure confirm that erisa erects no such requirement.
first,for all the detail of the qdro requirements,erisa nowhere specifies that a qdro must be in hand before benefits become payable.
second and more significantly,the statute specifically provides for situations in which no valid qdro issues until after benefits become payable.once the pension plan is on notice that a domestic relations order has issued that may be a qdro,the plan may take a reasonable period to determine whether the order is a qdro and therefore creates obligations for the pension plan.d g ii.while the plan is making this determination,it must segregate the benefits that would be due to the alternate payee under the terms of the dro during the first months that those benefits would be payable if the dro is ultimately deemed a qdro.d h v.this requirement obviously assumes that benefits may already be payable during the period the plan is determining whether the dro is a qdro.
third,congress expressly contemplated that further state court proceedings might ensue during the period,through which the alternate payee could attempt to cure any defects in the original dro and obtain an enforceable qdro.there is no reason it should take any plan administrator months to puzzle over the domestic relations order initially presented to the plan in order to determine whether it is a qdro,and congress did not intend to sanction such administrative lassitude.rather,the evident purpose of the period was to provide a time in which any defect in the original dro could be cured.the statute therefore provides that the alternate payee may,within the period,present the plan administrator,in lieu of the original court order,with a modification thereof.d h ii.if the plan administrator determines before the expiration of the fund segregation period that the modified court order is a valid qdro,the alternate payee is entitled to payment of benefits.id.
again,gendreau is illustrative.in gendreau,the plan administrator determined that the first state court order submitted did not qualify as a qdro.at.the state family court,however,had retained jurisdiction to make any changes that might be deemed necessary by the plan administrator,and the plan administrator anticipated that it may require multiple drafts of the order to meet qdro specifications.id.gendreau recognized that it was precisely because obtain ing a qdro is a process which everyone including congress recognizes as that erisa accommodates for periods when the status of a qdro is at issue.id.
fourth,the statute also specifies with particularity the circumstances in which the putative alternate payee loses the right to hold up the payment of benefits to the participant or his designated beneficiary.after the months have elapsed,if the dro status is still in doubt the plan must pay the segregated funds to the person who would otherwise have been paid.d h.if the plan thereafter determines that the alternate payee dro is a qdro after all,the plan must begin to pay the pension benefits to the alternate payee as directed by the order,although the plan is not required to pay the alternate payee retrospectively.d h iv.only after the requisite months have passed,that is,is it possible for a designated beneficiary to have a right to any part of a participant pension plan proceeds that can not be displaced by a qdro.
this complex,carefully articulated statutory scheme,then,plainly contemplates,and accounts in detail for,the situation in which the event that triggers the payment of benefits occurs before the plan knows whether it will be obliged to make payments to an alternate payee as such,the statute necessarily permits an alternate payee who has obtained a state law dro before the plan participant retirement,death,or other event to perfect the dro into a qdro thereafter subject to the period after which any benefits are payable to the original beneficiary.
this statutory system not only balances the interests of the plan and the various possible claimants to benefits while state family law orders are obtained but also assures that the ultimate rights of the putative alternate payees are resolved through legal proceedings rather than through manipulation or fortuity.if an alternate payee right to erisa plan proceeds were automatically cut off once an event occurred that,absent an enforceable qdro,would make the proceeds payable to someone else,then a plan participant retirement,the vicissitudes of court scheduling,or a plan participant death,all events beyond the control of the alternate payee,could determine the parties substantive rights.
moreover,any such rule could encourage opponents of the putative alternate payee to delay or complicate issuance or approval of a qdro in the hope that the event would occur in the meantime.in this very case,for example,myers died,apparently unexpectedly,while tise was attempting,in the face of vigorous resistance by the plan,to convert a dro into an enforceable qdro in state court.as the circumstances of this case illustrate,unless the qdro could issue after the plan participant death,congress intent to protect the interests of plan participants former dependents could be thwarted.gendreau,at allowing the plan participant to cut off his interest in the pension plans because of the timing of his bankruptcy petition would be contrary to erisa because doing so would not forward the purpose of the qdro exception to protect the financial security of divorcees.
curry additional arguments 
curry offers two further arguments in support of her claim to myers death benefit,neither of which has merit.
first,curry maintains that because erisa provides that a qdro recognizes the existence of an alternate payee right to receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan,d b i i emphasis added,the alternate payee has no right to receive benefits once an event occurs that makes them payable to someone other than the participant.the argument,more specifically,is that upon myers death,there was no longer a benefit payable with respect to myers,but only a benefit payable to a beneficiary,namely curry,and therefore no qdro affecting benefits payable with respect to myers could issue after his death 
this understanding of the term benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan is not the one that a common sense reading would suggest,and can not be squared with the statute as a whole.
benefits payable with respect to a participant are,quite evidently,different from benefits payable to a participant.in particular,the phrase curry relies upon plainly contemplates that an alternate payee can receive payments that,but for the qdro,would be payable to someone other than the is,to another dependent or designated beneficiary.dorn international brotherhood of electrical workers,cir explaining that u se of the phrase with respect to makes clear that alienability under a qdro is not limited to those benefits that are payable to a participant,only the participant life annuity,but may also make other plan benefits,such as the surviving spouse annuity available to an alternate payee.this understanding is confirmed by the statutory definition of participant 
the term participant means any employee or former employee of an employer,or any member or former member of an employee organization,who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization,or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.
emphasis added.since a participant is,under this definition,the employee or union member whose eligibility for benefits may trigger the eligibility of others,those others the participant beneficiaries can quite sensibly be said to receive their benefits with respect to in the sense of on account of the participant even after the beneficiary benefits become payable.
only this reading of the statutory phrase benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan is consistent with the statutory scheme as a whole.the statutory provisions covering the determination whether a dro is a qdro clearly contemplate that questions concerning the enforceability of dros as qdros can occur,and be resolved,after benefits become payable,and do not limit such qdro determinations to situations in which it is the participant rather than someone else who would receive the benefits if the alternate payee does not.see d h iii if there is no qdro determination within months,then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amount to the person or persons not the participant who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order emphasis added.
the short of the matter is that there would be no benefits payable to curry,tise,or,for that matter,myers,had he lived until his retirement,but for myers participation in the plan.those benefits remain payable with respect to myers even after his death because they accrued for his benefit and that of his beneficiaries.
curry second argument is that she can not be bound by the domestic relations orders issued in the child support proceedings.baker general motors,d.it is true that curry was not a party to any of the state court proceedings in this case,and clearly,she could not be held personally liable for myers child support obligations.
the qdro,however,does not impose personal liability on curry.rather,a qdro creates obligations for the pension plan,not for any individual participant or beneficiary.gendreau,at,the debt created by a dro is a debt of the pension plan,not of the plan participant,so that an alternate payee under a qdro has a claim only against the plan.and the obligation of the pension plan is created without regard to the participation of any designated beneficiary or the plan itself in the state court proceedings that produced the qdro.see blue ual,cir.rather,under erisa,the pension plan must pay the bearer of a dro if it determines that the order is a proper qdro,without further inquiry c ompliance with a qdro is obligatory.blue,at see d a each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.emphasis added.
in face of the statute clarity in this regard,it is hard to escape the conclusion that curry quarrel is really with the scheme of the statute.through its qdro provisions,erisa elevates a plan participant legal obligations,commonly to a former spouse or children of a previous marriage,over the participant express wishes to provide for other individuals as designated beneficiaries.while this result may seem harsh to the designated beneficiary,the fact is that congress intended this displacement of a plan participant wishes in some circumstances,in an effort to mitigate the impact of divorce upon children and former spouses.metropolitan life ins.wheaton,cir noting that qualified domestic relations order can override the designation of beneficiary in a pension plan carland metropolitan life ins,cir blindly paying the proceeds as specified in the insurance company beneficiary designation forms would be inconsistent with the statutory preemption exception that recognizes the validity of domestic relations orders affecting beneficiary designations.see generally metropolita
