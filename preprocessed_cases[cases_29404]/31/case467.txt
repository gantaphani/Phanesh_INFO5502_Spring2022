this case arises in the wake of the supreme court decision in eastern enterprises apfel,d.in eastern,the court held that coal act premiums assessed against companies such as mary helen coal violated the fifth amendment.although the defendants returned the unconstitutionally collected premiums,they refused to compensate mary helen for lost interest.mary helen is entitled to an award of prejudgment interest because of the general rule that interest follows principal.neither the absence of an authorizing statute nor erisa provision bars such an award.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is reversed and remanded with instructions to calculate the amount of prejudgment interest owed to mary helen.
mary helen coal corporation mined coal from until.during this time,the united mine workers of america umwa,a labor union representing coal miners,negotiated a series of collective bargaining agreements with the bituminous coal operators association bcoa.the agreements are collectively referred to as the national bituminous coal wage agreements nbcwas.mary helen was a signatory to at least two of these agreements the welfare and retirement fund and the nbcwa.the agreements were revised in and,though by this time mary helen was no longer actively mining coal and thus was not a party to either agreement.
by the late,escalating health care costs threatened the solvency of the most recent benefit plan.in response,congress enacted the coal industry retiree benefit act of coal act.the act created two new funds,including the combined fund.the combined fund provides benefits to coal industry retirees previously receiving benefits under the or nbcwas.to fund this new program,the coal act required coal operators who had previously participated in any of the nbcwas to pay annual premiums.the premium requirement thus applied to companies like eastern enterprises and mary helen even though they had not mined coal for many years.
mary helen filed suit against marty hudson and the other trustees of the combined fund trustees.in its complaint,mary helen alleged that the coal act premiums violated the due process and takings provisions of the fifth amendment.see mary helen coal hudson.mary helen i.following then binding precedent,the district court rejected mary helen claims and ordered it to pay all outstanding premiums plus interest.see id.at.mary helen appealed.
this court held mary helen appeal in abeyance pending the supreme court decision in eastern.see mary helen coal hudson,wl cir.eastern enterprises,like mary helen,stopped mining coal in the mid.in eastern,the supreme court held that the coal act was unconstitutional as applied to eastern enterprises.see at.no single opinion in eastern garnered five votes.the four justice plurality held that the coal act violated the takings clause.see id.at.according to the plurality,the coal act imposed severe,unanticipated retroactive liability upon eastern enterprises in amounts substantially disproportionate to the company prior experience with miner benefits.see id.at.justice kennedy,who concurred only in the judgment,concluded that the coal act premiums were not amenable to a takings analysis.see id.at.according to justice kennedy,however,the coal act violated the due process clause because it bore no legitimate relation to the government asserted interests and the degree of retroactive effect was severe.see id.at.the four dissenting justices agreed with justice kennedy that the due process clause provided the relevant framework,but disagreed with his conclusion about the existence of a constitutional violation.see id.at.breyer,dissenting.
once that decision was announced,we granted mary helen motion for summary reversal on the grounds that its case was materially indistinguishable from eastern.see mary helen coal,wl at.the trustees subsequently refunded the premiums paid by mary helen,but refused to compensate mary helen for the interest lost.
mary helen returned to district court seeking,among other things,in prejudgment interest.the district court denied this request.see mary helen coal hudson,d mary helen ii.according to the district court,the absence of a statute allowing an award of prejudgment interest meant that such an award was not required.see id.at.the district court also noted that any award of interest would be paid from the assets of the combined fund.according to the court,this meant prejudgment interest was barred by erisa provision,which states that the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer.id.quoting c.mary helen now appeals.
we have already determined that the coal act premium requirement,as applied to mary helen,violated the fifth amendment of the constitution.see mary helen coal,wl at.awarding prejudgment interest to mary helen,therefore,would simply give full effect to the supreme court decision in eastern and this court holding in mary helen i,by providing full compensation for the harms suffered.
the usual rule that interest follows principal is long and well established.see phillips washington legal foundation,d.see also webb fabulous pharmacies,beckwith,d the usual and general rule is that any interest follows the principal and is to be allocated to those who are ultimately to be the owners of that principal.the phillips court noted that this rule has existed under english common law since at least the mid and that it has become firmly embedded in the common law of the various states.at.read together,therefore,eastern and phillips indicate that mary helen receive interest on the premiums it paid.it is undisputed that after eastern the trustees had to refund the principal amounts paid by mary helen.since the principal belonged to mary helen,so too did the interest earned.that the trustees collected the premiums in good faith does not change the fact that doing so violated mary helen constitutional rights.thus,to deny an award of prejudgment interest would undercut the supreme court jurisprudence.
prejudgment interest is simply an element of mary helen complete compensation.osterneck ernst whinney,d.see also west virginia united states,d general motors devex,d.one factor to consider in deciding whether to award prejudgment interest is whether such an award is necessary to compensate the plaintiff fully for his injuries.osterneck,at.in this case,mary helen paid over in premiums to the combined fund from to.mary helen was deprived of the use of those funds until at least september,when we granted its motion for summary reversal.it is undisputed that the inability to make use of these funds from to imposed a measure of harm upon mary helen.thus,an award of prejudgment interest is a critical component of mary helen recovery.
mary helen is thus presumptively entitled to an award of prejudgment interest.of course,the award of prejudgment interest is within the discretion of the district court.moore.brown root,cir.the district court in this case cited two reasons for its decision not to award prejudgment interest the absence of any statutory authorization and erisa provision.neither of these rationales,however,bars an award of prejudgment interest to mary helen.thus,the district court denial of prejudgment interest was an abuse of discretion guided by erroneous legal conclusions.koon united states,d.
with regard to the district court first reason,it is well established that the absence of a statute authorizing prejudgment interest merely indicates that the question is governed by traditional principles.city of milwaukee cement division gypsum,d.see also monessen southwestern ry.morgan,d rodgers united states.here,the governing principle is one of fairness.blau lehman,d.as discussed above,because mary helen constitutional rights were violated by the coal act,prejudgment interest is mandated if we are to give meaning to the rule that interest follows principal.phillips,at.
the other obstacle to the recovery of prejudgment interest identified by the district court was erisa provision.the coal act states that the combined fund is a,welfare benefit plan under erisa.see a b and c.section c of erisa provides that the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of
