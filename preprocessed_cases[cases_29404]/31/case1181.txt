by participating in a partnership that regulates apprenticeship standards,california encourages employers and unions to support training and education programs for citizens who seek access to the building construction trades and other skilled jobs.although the goal of california apprenticeship programs is to promote economic opportunity,its regulations have caused considerable concern to the employers affiliated with the associated builders and contractors of southern california,associated builders.in february,associated builders sought an injunction to prevent california officials from implementing amendments to regs.b c,the subsections of california regulations that establish minimum wages and benefits on public and private construction projects for apprentices.
associated builders argues that these provisions,as amended,are preempted by the employee retirement income security act erisa,stat,codified as amended at et,and by the national labor relations act nlra,stat,codified as amended at et.the district court denied associated builders motion for a preliminary injunction.it determined that associated builders had little likelihood of success on the merits on its facial challenge to these provisions because they are part of the same regulatory scheme that the supreme court held not to be preempted by erisa,california div.of labor standards dillingham,d dillingham i,and that the ninth circuit,on remand,held not to be preempted by the nlra.dillingham sonoma county,cir dillingham ii.
the parties stipulated to the entry of a final judgment based upon the district court order denying the preliminary injunction.pursuant to.a,the district court entered a final judgment,which associated builders appeals.we find that b c,as amended,are not preempted by either erisa or the nlra.
background 
since the founding of the american republic,states have regulated training programs for individuals seeking to enter skilled crafts,in order to prevent their exploitation by employers.see generally rorabaugh,the craft apprentice from franklin to the machine age in america.california has regulated apprenticeships since at least,when the legislature enacted a statute that,among other provisions,required masters to offer apprentices a basic education.cal,ch,codified in cal.subsequently repealed and superseded by cal,ch.
california and other states were encouraged to take additional steps to regulate apprenticeships in,when congress passed the national apprenticeship act,stat,codified as amended at et.known as the fitzgerald act,this legislation directs the secretary of labor to cooperate with state agencies engaged in the formulation and promotion of standards of apprenticeship.in response to this federal encouragement,california passed the apprentice labor standards act in,which created the regulatory framework that governs apprenticeship in the state to this day.cal,ch,codified as amended at cal.et.
the goals of california regulatory scheme are to foster,promote,and develop the welfare of the apprentice and industry,improve the working conditions of apprentices,and advance their opportunities for profitable employment cal.california fulfills these goals by offering a variety of incentives to encourage apprenticeship programs to seek state approval,which can be obtained if the programs comply with specified state standards.regs.among the incentives that programs receive are direct financial assistance and automatic certification for relevant federal programs.cal.additionally,apprentices who enroll in programs referred to as registered apprentices in the california code receive a journeyman certificate upon completion of their training.contractors who hire apprentices from these programs receive certain benefits as well.see southern cal.chapter of builders and contractors,cal.apprenticeship council,cal th,d,explaining how california apprenticeship regulations work.participation in the regulatory scheme is entirely voluntarily,however.california does not prohibit apprenticeship training programs from operating without state approval,and employers are not required to hire apprentices from programs or indeed to hire any apprentices at all.
for building contractors,a major benefit of hiring registered apprentices is that they can pay them a special rate for work that they perform on public construction projects.cal.this rate is typically lower than the journeyman rate,which is otherwise the required minimum for such projects under california prevailing wage law.cal.the special apprenticeship rate is set pursuant to regs.b,which is one of the two provisions of the california apprenticeship regulations that associated builders claims is preempted.
the other provision that associated builders challenges is regs.c,which establishes the rates that contractors are to pay to registered apprentices on private construction projects.whereas the amendments did not substantially modify b,they the wage requirements for registered apprentices on private construction jobs that are set forth in c in order to reflect the varied market conditions throughout california.under c,as amended,a building construction contractor has two alternatives if it employs registered apprentices on private construction jobs.the first alternative is to pay registered apprentices a percentage of the prevailing per diem compensation package for journeymen in the relevant craft and geographical area.this percentage progressively increases from to percent over the period of an apprentice training program.regs.c the second alternative is for a contractor to provide the same compensation package to registered apprentices on private projects that it pays for public work jobs in the same craft and locality.regs.c.like the rest of california apprenticeship regulatory scheme,c is entirely voluntary.it does not impose any obligations on contractors who do not employ apprentices from apprenticeship programs.
two types of apprenticeship programs can qualify for state approval.joint apprenticeship programs are collaborative ventures between unions and employers.unilateral programs are run by employers with no union involvement.cal.regs.g,a b.at the time this lawsuit was filed,there were unilateral apprenticeship programs,enrolling approximately apprentices.associated builders sponsors three of these programs,which collectively enroll fewer than apprentices.
joint apprenticeship programs train a larger proportion of california registered apprentices.at present,there are active joint apprenticeship programs in the building and construction trades,enrolling over apprentices.among the sponsors are the california state pipe trades joint apprenticeship committee and the plumbers and steamfitters local joint apprenticeship and training committee,the amici curiae who urge affirmance of the district court ruling.the majority of unionized apprentices in programs are represented by the unions affiliated with the state building and construction trades council of california,whose motion to intervene as a defendant was granted by the district court.
ii.analysis 
by entering a final judgment pursuant to.a,the district court consolidated its preliminary injunction ruling with its decision on the merits.in such cases,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.freeman allstate life ins,cir barden detroit casino city of detroit,cir.
erisa preemption 
according to its express preemption clause,erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan a.this preemption clause ensures that plans and their sponsors minimize the administrative and financial burdens of complying with conflicting laws among states or between states and the federal government.the phrase relates to in the erisa preemption clause has been interpreted by the supreme court as encompassing state laws that either have a reference to or a connection with employment benefit plans covered by this statute.dillingham i,at.
the reference to prong applies where the state law in question either acts immediately and exclusively upon an erisa plan or the existence of such a plan is essential to the law operation.dillingham i,at.abraham norcal waste systems,cir.under the second prong,a state law has a forbidden connection with erisa plans if it falls outside the scope of state laws that congress understood would survive erisa or if its effect is to bind erisa plans.dillingham i,at.new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.
the outcome of our erisa preemption analysis is controlled by dillingham i,in which the supreme court rejected an erisa preemption challenge to cal,the california statutory provision that permits contractors to pay registered apprentices a special rate for work on public construction projects,d.the supreme court held that did not run afoul of the reference to prong of erisa preemption analysis because apprenticeship programs need not necessarily be erisa plans.dillingham i,at.rather,functions irrespective of the existence of an erisa plan and is indifferent to the funding,and attendant erisa coverage,of apprenticeship programs.id.at.internal citations and quotations omitted.
section,the regulation that associated builders challenges,implements the objectives established in cal.and other state legislation.in,as amended,there is no specific provision that makes erisa plans essential to its operation or that acts immediately or exclusively upon erisa plans.thus,like,survives associated builders challenge under this reference to prong of erisa preemption analysis.
under the connection with prong of erisa preemption analysis,associated builders challenge to also fails for the reasons set forth in dillingham congress did not intend erisa to preempt regulation in areas of traditional state concern,such as the regulation of apprenticeship standards,that are quite remote from the areas with which erisa is expressly,disclosure,fiduciary responsibility and the like.dillingham i,at.internal quotations and citations omitted.as the supreme court concluded in dillingham i 
given the paucity of indication in erisa and its legislative history of any intent on the part of congress to state apprenticeship training standards,or state prevailing wage laws that incorporate them,we are reluctant to alter our ordinary assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act.
id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.
associated builders argues that c should be treated differently from the portion of california apprenticeship regulatory scheme upheld in dillingham i because it establishes standards for compensating apprentices employed on private works while governs public works.associated builders acknowledges that regulating apprenticeship standards on public works is an exercise of traditional state power,but it argues that the state establishment of comparable guidelines for private projects is not.this argument has little merit,however,for california has long regulated apprenticeship standards without regard to whether apprentices work for public or private employers.
even if setting apprenticeship standards for private works were not an area of traditional state concern,congress mandates that erisa not be construed to alter,amend,modify,invalidate,impair,or supersede any law of the united states or any rule or regulation issued under any such law.d.to hold that erisa preempts california apprenticeship regulations would violate this mandate,for when congress passed the fitzgerald act,it recognized state efforts in regulating apprenticeship programs and apparently expected that those efforts would continue.dillingham i,at.
the other reason why california apprenticeship regulatory scheme does not have a forbidden connection is that it does not bind erisa plans to anything.id.at.at most,california regulatory scheme alters the incentives,but does not dictate the choices,facing erisa plans.id.at.if the indirect economic effect of such incentives were sufficient to trigger erisa preemption,there would be no effective constraints on erisa reach,and the words relate to would limit nothing.id.at.see also travelers,at.
in determining that the california regulatory scheme does not dictate the choices facing erisa plans,we reject associated builders attempt to compare it to the minnesota requirements governing sprinkler contractors that the eighth circuit held to be preempted by erisa.minnesota chapter of associated builders and contractors,minnesota of public safety,cir minnesota abc.the eighth circuit determined that minnesota requirement that all sprinkler contractors register all of their apprentices in a training program does more than simply provide a powerful economic incentive,it prevents the use of apprentices who are not registered in approved programs.id.at.in so holding,the eighth circuit explicitly distinguished minnesota requirements from the california apprenticeship standards upheld in dillingham id.
unlike the provisions preempted in minnesota abc,does not require that contractors maintain apprenticeship programs or that they hire registered apprentices in most circumstances.rather,california provides minimum standards for those apprenticeship programs that voluntarily seek state approval since does not compel an apprenticeship program to comply with california apprenticeship standards,associated builders reliance on minnesota abc is misplaced.moreover,the amendments to present even less of a concern about compulsion than the provision challenged in dillingham i because they reduce the incentive to seek state approval by increasing the wage rates for registered apprentices on private construction jobs.
associated builders also argues that california minimum apprentice rates impermissibly affect erisa plans because they can be satisfied by a mixture of wages and benefits.in wsb,curry,cir,we rejected an erisa preemption challenge to california prevailing wage law based on our analysis that the state regulation did not dictate terms rather it only required that regardless of how employers write their erisa plans,or even whether they have erisa plans at all,they must pay the prevailing wage,and they may do so through some combination of cash and benefits.id.at.here,there is even less of a concern about compulsion than there was in wsb because is not mandatory.
in sum,we conclude that erisa does not preempt for the following reasons these provisions do not act immediately or exclusively upon erisa plans apprenticeship standards are a traditional area of state concern congress has explicitly encouraged continued state regulation of apprenticeship standards and california does not compel contractors or apprenticeship training programs to participate in its regulatory scheme.
nlra preemption 
in contrast to its erisa challenge,associated builders directs its nlra preemption challenge only to c of the california regulations,which governs apprenticeships on private projects.this is a wise strategy since any challenge to california minimum standards for apprentices on public works would unquestionably be precluded by dillingham ii.in dillingham ii,we expressly held that,the california statutory provision regulating apprenticeship standards on public works,was not preempted by the nlra just as the supreme court,in dillingham i,d,held that it was not preempted by erisa.here,we conclude that for similar reasons the nlra does not preempt the regulations with respect to work on private projects.
as a threshold issue,associated builders attempts to distinguish dillingham ii by arguing that it merely reasserted the basic principle that nlra preemption does not apply when the state acts as either a proprietor or a market participant.building constr.trades council associated builders contractors,d babler,roberts,cir rondout,new york state dep t of labor,cir.associated builders misreads dillingham ii.there,we expressly rejected california claim that it acted pursuant to its proprietary powers when it established apprenticeship standards for public works.because our holding in dillingham ii turned on our determination that california enactment of constituted a regulatory not a proprietary action,the fact that the provision only de
