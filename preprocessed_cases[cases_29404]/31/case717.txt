for over twenty years,a small group of retirees,former plant maintenance workers and their spouses,have been receiving their health care coverage through hayssen manufacturing company hayssen and its successor,bemis company,bemis as a result of a plant closing agreement.in,bemis changed the insurance provider of its medical plan and made changes to deductible and amounts related to medical care and prescription drugs.in,bemis also informed the retirees that it would no longer provide a prescription drug benefit.the retirees then sued under the relations act,a,and the employee retirement income security act erisa,alleging that the and changes breached the agreement negotiated by an employer and a labor organization.the district court held that the plant closing agreement included no promise of lifetime benefits to the retirees and granted summary judgment to bemis.however,we find that the parties agreement was to provide lifetime benefits to retirees and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings on the question of whether bemis breached its agreement by making the changes to the retirees medical benefits.
background 
since bemis prevailed on summary judgment,we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the class represented by thomas temme,the party against whom the motion under consideration was decided.bassiouni,cir.hayssen and the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america and its local union the union were parties to a series of collective bargaining agreements covering the production and maintenance workers at the hayssen facility in sheboygan,wisconsin.the last collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the parties was an agreement covering the period from to.when this collective bargaining agreement cba expired on june,a strike ensued.the strike continued through the summer,and hayssen eventually decided to close its sheboygan plant and relocate its manufacturing operations.
in connection with this plant relocation,the parties negotiated a plant closing agreement closing agreement with the goal of embodying the full and complete terms and conditions regarding the effects of the termination of hayssen manufacturing operations and the termination of employment for all employees represented by the union.the first three paragraphs of the closing agreement terminated the employment relationship between union employees who retained seniority under the cba and hayssen,terminated the strike,and terminated the bargaining relationship between hayssen and the union.paragraph concerned the termination of benefits.paragraph a modified the pension plan and provided for a vested termination of the plan.paragraph b referred to the cba and listed the fully satisfied obligations and claims under the cba.paragraph c explained the calculation of severance pay and the necessity of executing a release as a condition for receiving the severance pay.paragraph contained a general statement releasing the company from claims arising under the cba and an agreement that no requests would be made to hayssen for any benefits beyond that provided by the closing agreement.finally,paragraph stated that the closing agreement is the full and complete agreement between the parties,superseding and voiding any prior agreements such as the cba except and only to the extent that reference to the same may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this agreement.
one provision in paragraph concerned medical benefits.because its meaning is the focus of the litigation between the parties,we recite the language of paragraph d in full 
d terminated under the provisions of this agreement with the exception of those eligible employees who apply for retirement benefits by,will be allowed to continue their present blue cross blue shield medical coverage by paying the full monthly premium for a period of months to or until they become covered by another medical insurance plan,whichever is sooner.if such an employee is covered as a dependent under another medical insurance plan,the blue shield plan would be the secondary payer.if an individual becomes covered under another plan within the month period,eligibility under the blue shield plan will cease immediately and there will be no coordination of benefits.
the premium rates for such coverage are currently per month for single coverage and per month for family coverage.these premium rates have been historically reevaluated by blue shield on july of each year.employees who elect to continue their blue shield coverage will also be subject to paying whatever the full monthly premiums are on.employees electing to continue medical coverage as described above must submit by mail to the company post marked by the of each month,a check or money the full monthly premium in effect.if an employee fails to follow any part of the procedure in the above paragraph without exception,meeting the deadline,submitting by mail or submitting a check or money order,such employee eligibility to continue medical coverage will cease immediately.
retired employee medical benefit 
individuals who attain age and have at least six years of continuous service by,and who elect to commence their retirement benefits by,will be eligible for the retired employee medical benefit.individuals who attain age or by and who indicate by,their intent to commence retirement benefits by age will be eligible for the retired employee medical benefit.if an employee becomes eligible for medical insurance coverage under another plan,the blue shield plan will become the secondary payer.if an individual is covered as a dependent under another medical insurance plan,then the blue shield plan would be the secondary payer.
the retirement benefit that the closing agreement makes retirees eligible for is not delineated in the closing agreement itself.in the cba,however,two provisions define the health insurance coverage.section of the cba continues the hospital,surgical and medical insurance to which employees are entitled from the previous cba,and adds some additional benefits.these additional benefits,effective july,include two fifty dollar deductibles per family per year and o ne hundred percent coverage for physicians home and office calls and prescription drugs after the deductibles are met.in full,the next section of the cba provides 
retired employee medical benefit.the medical benefit provided retirees,their spouses and dependents shall be the same as defined in section,except that benefits are provided under the medicare program,subject to the terms of the master insurance contract.
in the event of the death of the retired employee,their dependent spouse will retain coverage until such time as they remarry or qualify for other primary coverage.
the following conditions and terms apply to eligibility for the retired employee medical benefit 
a.the employee must be retired and must meet the conditions of a retired employee as defined in the hayssen retirement plan pension agreement,whichever applies.
must enroll in medicare plans a and b when the employee becomes eligible.
following the closing of its sheboygan plant,hayssen provided its retirees,both those who retired before the plant closing and those who were added to the retiree pool by the closing agreement,with medical benefits at the levels defined by the cba.bemis acquired hayssen in,and continued to provide retirees with these medical benefits.in the fall of,bemis notified the retirees that effective january,the plan would be offered under cigna instead of blue shield and that the deductibles would be raised to from the listed in of the cba.in the fall of,bemis notified the retirees that effective january,the medical plan would eliminate all prescription drug coverage.
thomas temme,representing the class of retirees who received the retiree medical benefit through the closing agreement,brought this class action suit alleging that bemis breached its agreement to provide retirees with vested welfare benefits.the district court certified the class,and designated thomas temme and his wife,shirley temme,as class representatives.both parties moved for summary j
