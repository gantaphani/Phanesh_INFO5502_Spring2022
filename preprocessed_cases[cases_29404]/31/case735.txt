beginning in,g and j plastering company g j operated as a plastering contractor in cook county,illinois,and surrounding counties its employees were represented by multiple unions,among them the journeymen plasterers protective and benevolent society of chicago,local local,until a november election,when the employees selected a union other than local as their one and only bargaining representative.as a consequence of that election,g j exited from the collective bargaining agreement with local and ceased making contributions to the various fringe benefit trust funds serving local members the local funds.when the local funds conducted an exit audit of g j records to determine whether g j had any outstanding liability to the funds,they determined that g j had not made the appropriate contributions to the local funds for work performed within local jurisdiction.they filed suit against g j pursuant to section of the labor management relations act of,and section a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a.after a trial,the district court found that g j had not complied with its obligations to the local funds and entered judgment in the funds favor in the total amount of.the court later awarded the plaintiffs costs totaling.the award of costs did not include the audit costs incurred by the local funds,as the court deemed the request for those costs lacking in adequate detail.the parties have filed g j contends that the district court erred in allowing the plaintiffs to introduce certain testimony and other evidence in support of their claims,and the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in denying their request for audit costs.we affirm.
the period of time relevant to this case extends from october,through november.the audit conducted on behalf of the local funds actually extended as far back as february,but the local funds ultimately decided not to seek relief for any work performed prior to october.throughout the relevant period,g j conducted construction plastering work in cook,dupage,and lake counties among others in northern illinois.at any given time,it had between and thirty plasterers in its employ.
prior to november,the plastering employees of g j were represented by three different unions locals and of the international union of bricklayers and allied craftsmen the dupage bricklayers,lake county area plasterers union local the lake county plasterers,and local.each union had its own geographic jurisdiction the dupage bricklayers covered dupage county,the lake county plasterers covered lake county,and local covered cook,will,kane,mchenry,dekalb,kendall,grundy,lasalle,and livingston counties.each union had its own set of trust funds for the benefit of its members.g j was bound to separate collective bargaining agreements with each of these unions.
each of those agreements obligated g j to make contributions to the various trust funds on behalf of its employees.there were six funds associated with local,and along with local itself,each of those funds is a plaintiff in this suit the chicago plastering institute pension fund,the chicago plastering institute health and welfare fund,the chicago plastering institute retirement savings fund,the local journeymen plasterers protective benevolent society of chicago apprentice training fund,the chicagoland construction safety council a council that promotes safe practices in the construction industry,and the chicago plastering institute a promotional trust fund that collects and forwards contributions to the chicagoland construction safety council.the first four of these funds are employee benefit funds within the scope of erisa section,the remaining two funds are funds.
by the terms of the collective bargaining agreements,g j obligation to make contributions to one union funds versus those of another depended not on the union to which an employee belonged,but rather on the geographic territory in which the employee performed plastering work.so whenever a g j employee performed plastering work within the territorial jurisdiction of local,g j was obligated to make contributions to the local funds based on that work,regardless of whether the employee performing the work was a member of local,the dupage bricklayers,or the lake county plasterers.similarly,g j was separately obliged to deduct working assessments,union dues from payments made to local members for work they performed within local jurisdiction.those assessments were payable to local itself rather than to the local funds.
as it turns out,however,g j contractual obligation to make contributions based on the territory in which its employees performed plastering work was to a significant extent superseded or rendered moot by two external sets of agreements among the union locals and their funds.
first,as to two of the three unions that represented g j employees prior to the november election,g j contractual obligation to make fringe benefit contributions based on the territory in which work was performed was superseded by a separate directive to make all contributions to the union that represented a given home local and to the fringe benefit funds affiliated with that union.beginning in,the northern illinois district council of operative plasterers and cement masons international association the op council,a collective of union locals representing plasterers and cement masons including local and the lake county plasterers,required contractors who employed members of those locals to pay both benefits and working assessments directly to a member benefit office and local union,regardless of where the employee was performing his work.that rule is known colloquially as the rule.the rule did not apply to work performed by members of the dupage bricklayers,which was not a member of the op council.thus,as to g j employees who were members of the dupage bricklayers,the company contractual obligation to make contributions based on where the employee work was performed remained unaltered.this meant that when a member of the dupage bricklayers performed plastering work in local territory,g j was obligated to make contributions to the local funds.by contrast,for work performed by members of local or the lake county plasterers,the company would make contributions based on the union membership of the employee performing the work,no matter where the employee work was performed.as we shall see,the rule had the effect of confining the bulk of g j liability in this case to work performed by members of the dupage bricklayers.
second,certain of the local funds had reciprocal agreements with their counterparts at other unions,including the dupage bricklayers funds,pursuant to which they would forward contributions received for work performed within local jurisdiction by members of other unions to the funds affiliated with the home locals of those workers.local health and welfare fund and its pension fund both were parties to such agreements.in terms of the damages that the local funds sought in this case for work performed by the dupage bricklayers members within local territory,the reciprocal agreements took the company obligations to those two funds off the table.
in november,the national labor relations board nlrb conducted an election among g j plastering employees to determine which union would thereafter serve as their exclusive collective bargaining representative.the nlrb certified the dupage bricklayers as the winner of that election on november.as a result,local ceased being the representative of any of g j plastering employees,g j exited the collective bargaining agreement with local,and g j had no obligation to make contributions to local or to any of its fringe benefit funds for plastering work performed after november.
the end of local tenure as a representative of g j employees and g j corresponding obligations under the collective bargaining agreement with local triggered an exit audit to determine the amounts of any outstanding obligations to the local funds.the plaintiffs informed g j that their auditors,the firm of piotrowski gebis p g,would be reviewing g j contributions for the period from february,through november,that audit commenced in february.problems soon emerged.in response to a questionnaire from the local funds,g j revealed that it had been making contributions based on the home local of each employee rather than the location of the work performed,as required by the various collective bargaining agreements.still,it was possible,in view of the rule and the reciprocal arrangement that some of the local funds had with their counterpart funds,that the local funds had received some if not all of the monies to which they were entitled despite g j error in the method of contribution.the local funds decided that they would have their auditors review g j work records for the last eighteen months of the audit period.g j had preliminarily indicated that it had records as to the location of the work performed by its plasterers going back that far.if analysis of the records for that period revealed that the local funds had been paid what they were entitled to,then the funds would assume that g j had paid them what they were owed in prior years.but when p g asked the company to provide whatever work location records it had for that purpose,g j finally disclosed that in fact it had no records showing where its employees had performed their work.testimony at trial would later lead the trial court to find that g j had never kept such records,notwithstanding its contractual obligation to make employee benefit contributions based on the territory in which each employee was engaging in plastering work.
p g thus was left to its own devices in attempting to determine the extent of g j outstanding liability to the local funds.based on g j payroll records,the auditors attempted to ascertain instances in which the company should have made,but in fact did not make,contributions to the local funds for work performed within local jurisdiction.having in mind the rule that applied to members of local and the lake county plasterers,the auditors principal focus was on the hours worked by members of the dupage county bricklayers.g j owed contributions to the local funds for any hours worked by dupage bricklayers within local territory.but because g j records did not reveal where individual employees worked on any given day,the dilemma posed to p g was how to determine what the company actually owed the local funds for work performed by dupage bricklayers in local territory.given the lack of the data necessary to make that determination,the auditors applied a set of assumptions to the data available to them and prepared what is known as a report on procedures,with the procedures being the assumptions agreed to between p g and its clients.for example,because g j records did not reveal the locations in which its employees had worked on any given day,p g assumed that all work performed by members of the dupage bricklayers during the audit period was work performed within local territory,such that the company should have made contributions to the local funds excluding the pension and health and welfare funds,which had reciprocal agreements with their counterparts for the entirety of that work.g j records also revealed that the company had paid a number of bonuses to its plasterers.but because g j had no written bonus plan and no documentation of the basis for the bonuses,p g assumed that all such bonus payments were really compensation for hours worked and that contributions to the local funds should have been made based on these payments.p g applied these and other assumptions to g j payroll data and came up with a calculation of what g j owed the local funds in delinquent contributions.p g partner gary gebis would later discuss the set of assumptions p g auditors had applied both in his deposition and in his trial testimony.gebis made clear that he did not vouch for the accuracy of the assumptions.p g report,issued in april,thus was not one which expressed a professional opinion as to how much g j actually owed in delinquent opinions.instead,it simply reflected what the company might owe the local funds given the application of the various assumptions to g j payment records.
the p g report set forth roughly four categories of work hours for which it was posited that contributions were owing to the local funds and to local itself jurisdictional hours,based on the assertion that g j had erroneously made contributions to the dupage bricklayers funds rather than the local funds for work that was performed within local territory,hours corresponding to payments given to employees that the company described as bonuses and as such would be exempt from any contribution requirement but which p g had assumed were actually for work performed,working assessments dues owed to local for hours worked by local members within local jurisdiction,and other hours for which p g believed contributions were owed.by p g calculation,the contributions and working assessments owed on these hours totaled.that total was later reduced to when the plaintiffs withdrew,inter alia,any claims for work performed from february,through september.g j rejected the analysis of the audit in toto and denied any liability for unpaid contributions.
local and the local funds filed this suit while the audit was underway.the parties consented to final disposition by magistrate judge schenkier,who conducted a bench trial.over g j objection,judge schenkier admitted p g audit report into evidence and permitted gebis to testify about the report although he was not one of the line accountants who had conducted the audit and prepared the report.
pursuant to a detailed set of factual and legal findings,judge schenkier found g j liable to the local funds for delinquent contributions,although he did not accept as valid all of the assumptions underlying the p g audit and thus deemed g j liable for a lesser amount than the plaintiffs had claimed.trustees of chicago plastering inst.pension trust cork plastering,wl.
the court concluded first that g j had breached the collective bargaining agreement with local by failing to make contributions based on work performed by members of the dupage bricklayers within local territory,at.the plaintiffs bore the burden of showing the number of hours for which contributions were owed,and normally this would simply be a matter of setting forth the number of hours worked within their jurisdiction,at.but g j had failed to keep records that would permit such a showing although,the court pointed out,erisa required it to keep such records,at,citing a and trustees of chicago painters decorators pension,health welfare,deferred sav.plan trust funds royal int l drywall decorating,cir g j breach of this obligation did not relieve the local funds of their burden of proof,nor did it permit pure speculation as to the number of hours that should have been reported but were not.wl,at.
as a factual matter,the judge rejected g j representation that its practice was to assign workers to jobs within the territory of their home locals,such that a dupage bricklayers member typically would have worked primarily in dupage county and would rarely if ever have been assigned to work in local jurisdiction,at.the court noted among other points that although a significant number of g j plasterers were members of the dupage bricklayers,g j did substantially more work in local territory than in the dupage bricklayers jurisdiction,so there was a compelling need to assign members of the dupage bricklayers to perform plastering work in local territory,at.the court surmised,then,that members of the dupage bricklayers had in fact done some work within local territory,and that g j had improperly made contributions to the dupage bricklayers funds for that work rather than to the local funds,at.
but some does not mean all.id.the court found no factual basis for the plaintiffs premise,reflected in the p g report,that all work performed by the dupage bricklayers members was performed within local jurisdiction,in view of evidence that some percent of g j billings during the relevant time period were for work performed outside of local territory and twelve and percent were for work done within the dupage bricklayers territory.id.
however,given that percent of g j total billings were for work performed in local territory,the court found it reasonable to infer that percent of its total work hours should have been reported to local,with corresponding contributions,at.yet,it appeared that g j had only reported percent of its hours to local.id.the court inferred that the hours that were worked by members of the dupage bricklayers within local territory and that should have been reported to local but had not been.id.the court deemed the company liable to the local funds for those hours.id.
the court went on to reject the plaintiffs bonus claim,at.notwithstanding the lack of a written bonus plan,the court found no support for the notion that the bonus payments represented compensation for hours worked.instead,the evidence showed that these were truly bonuses,at.
the court agreed that local itself was owed assessments dues for work performed by its members within local territory,at.the evidence indicated that there were g j employees reported as local members during the audit period,but the p g report indicated that dues had not been contributed for some hours worked by these employees within local territorial jurisdiction,at g j was liable to local for these hours,at.
finally,the court found g j liable for certain other categories of unreported hours.these included some hours worked by an individual g j classified as a manager but whom the court found to have been engaged in work for which the company was obliged to make contributions,at.there were also some hours categorized by g j as shop work,which would be exempt from any obligation to make fringe benefit contributions,but which the court found were actually hours devoted to plastering work,at.and finally,there were hours that g j claimed it had reported to the local funds but which the court found it had not,at.
the court concluded that g j was liable for a total of hours of unreported work to the four local funds that qualified as employee benefit funds under erisa,another hours to the chicagoland construction safety council,a fund,and hours to local for working assessments,at.the court directed the parties to calculate the amounts of contributions and union dues owed for those hours.the court also indicated it would add an award of prejudgment interest at the rate of one percent per month pursuant to g b.id.it announced its intent to impose an additional amount equal to the award of prejudgment interest as further damages,pursuant to the provision of section g c i.id.finally,the court acknowledged that section g provides for awards of attorney fees and costs,including audit costs,and indicated that it would set a schedule for the submission of materials that would permit the court to determine what amounts to award the plaintiffs for those fees and costs,at.
the parties subsequently prepared a joint submission reflecting agreement as to some but not all of the amounts owed pursuant to the court liability decision.one of the items as to which the parties disagreed was the reasonableness of the in audit costs for which the plaintiffs were seeking recompense.although the documentation produced to g j in support of those costs revealed the hours spent month by month on the audit,the total amounts charged to the local funds for those hours,and the p g employees who worked on the audit,the submitted materials did not disclose the qualifications,experience,and billing rates of the individual auditors nor were the time records itemized to reflect what tasks each individual auditor had been working on at any given time and the total hours spent on various aspects of the audit.
in a set of supplemental findings and legal conclusions,the court awarded the plaintiffs for unpaid contributions and union dues and prejudgment interest and double interest,but the court sustained g j objections to the audit costs and denied the plaintiffs request for these costs in toto,trustees of chicago plastering inst.pension trust cork plastering,wl.the court found it reasonable to expect that a request for an award of audit costs be supported by the same type of detail used to support requests.absent such detail,the court believed that it could not properly assess the reasonableness of the requested costs,at.the court subsequently signed off on the plaintiffs bill of costs in the reduced amount of.
the parties present us with three issues on appeal,all of them related to the audit.g j contests the district court decision to admit the p g report on procedures into evidence.g j views the audit report as being founded on inadmissible hearsay it also contends that the report was prepared in anticipation of litigation and is not otherwise admissible as a business record.second,g j argues that the court should not have allowed gebis to testify about the report.the company reasons that gebis was not one of the line auditors involved in conducting the audit and preparing the report nor was gebis qualified as an expert who could opine about the company liability to local and its funds.finally,the plaintiffs,contesting the district court decision to deny them any compensation for the costs of the audit.in their view,the court inappropriately held their request for audit costs to the same standards applied to requests and,alternatively,failed to give them advance notice of its intent to apply those standards and a reasonable opportunity to meet them.
a.the p g audit report 
the data underlying the p g report were,as we discussed earlier,derived from g j payroll records.but the report conclusions as to what g j owed local and the local funds based on that data were driven by a set of procedures or assumptions agreed to by p g and its clients.the report was not an audit opinion in the sense that it expressed a professional judgment about what g j owed the plaintiffs p g did not vouch for the validity of the assumptions employed but merely tabulated what the company might owe assuming the validity of the assumptions.
the district court overruled g j objections to the admissibility of the report on several grounds.first,the court noted that the data underlying the report were derived from the company own payroll records.g j did not object to the authenticity or reliability of its records,nor did it contest the accuracy of the data pulled from those records.wl,at at.g j real objection was to the set of assumptions that p g had applied to the data.although those assumptions were based to some extent on discussions between the auditors and their clients,that fact did not render the report itself hearsay.at.the court noted that the assumptions were also based on what the auditors had discovered in the course of their audit.at.moreover,gebis testified and was subject to as to what the assumptions were and what they were based on.at.ultimately,the court concluded that doubts as to the sufficiency and reliability of the assumptions went to the weight to be given to the report rather than its admissibility.at.i f i find that the procedures were good and that the analysis was correct,i accept it,the court observed.at.i f i do,i wo.id.and as we have discussed,the court went on to accept some of the assumptions set forth in the report as valid and rejected others.for purposes of calculating the total number of hours for which g j owed the plaintiffs contributions and working assessments,the court did rely on the report underlying data as to the hours falling into various categories,as there was no objection to the accuracy of the data summarized in the report.
g j threshold contention here is that the report should have been excluded from evidence because it contains inadmissible hearsay.this is not literally true the report is a long series of tabulations based on g j payroll records and it does not repeat any statements.but the report conclusions do reflect a series of example,that all hours reported to the dupage bricklayers funds were for work performed within local territory and thus contributions for those hours should have been made to the local funds rather than to the dupage bricklayers funds.as discussed,the local funds agreed upon these assumptions with their auditors,presumably in discussions and correspondence with p g,which in turn prepared the report in accord with those assumptions the report is thus entitled report on procedures.although the report does not recount these discussions,g j reasons that the report is necessarily based on the marching orders that p g was given and to that extent the report is the product of inadmissible hearsay.
there is no merit to this argument.the assumptions that p g applied in preparing the report obviously were important in assessing the validity of the report assertions as to what g j owed local and the local funds.but the fact that those assumptions were conveyed to the auditors in discussions is neither here nor there the content of those discussions was not being offered into evidence,let alone for its truth,nor was it necessary to recount such conversations in order to evaluate the merit of any assumption that p g employed.auditors,like other professionals,are often asked to analyze data based on a set of assumptions given to them.see am.inst.of certified public accountants professional,at describing procedures engagements.the assumptions that p g applied to the data were not a secret.gebis was deposed before trial,and he answered g j questions at that time about the nature of the assumptions underlying the report he was similarly examined and at length during the trial on the subject of these assumptions.the assumptions were not based on facts that were known only to the plaintiffs and communicated in secret to p g they instead reflected the plaintiffs conclusions about how various categories of hours and payments reflected in g j records should be treated in assessing g j liability to the local funds.as the district court recognized,these assumptions in fact were derived from what g j own records disclosed or failed to disclose about its methodology in reporting hours and making contributions to the various union locals and their respective funds.for example,the assumption that all hours reported by members of the dupage bricklayers represented work performed within local jurisdiction was premised on g j failure to keep records as to the jurisdictions in which its plasterers were working at any given time.similarly,the assumption that the bonuses g j paid to its employees were not truly bonuses but rather were disguised payments for hours worked was based on g j lack of a written bonus plan or other documentation setting forth the criteria for the bonuses.p g did not vouch for the accuracy of the assumptions,nor did the court admit p g report on the premise that those assumptions were accurate.the validity of the assumptions that the auditors applied was debated throughout the proceedings in light of the testimony and other evidence as to g j practices.it was that evidence,and not the content of any communications between p g and its clients,that led judge schenkier to accept some of the assumptions as accurate and to reject others as unsubstantiated.there was no error in admitting the report simply because it reflected these assumptions.
we also reject g j contention that the report should have been excluded on the basis that it was not made or kept in the ordinary course of business and was prepared for purposes of litigation.see.deeming generally admissible records of business activity united states blackburn,cir noting rule that documents made in anticipation of litigation are inadmissible under the business records exception see also lust sealy,cir.g j may well be right that the report itself does not qualify as a business record.the testimony at trial did not reveal any program by which the local funds routinely audited employers in fact,it appears that g j was last audited in.at.see paddack dave christensen,cir where trust funds had no routine audit practice,compliance audit report prepared when funds suspected employer may not have complied with its contribution obligations not admissible as business record,cited with approval in.tool works,cir.but the report would in any event qualify for admission as a summary of voluminous business g j own payroll records.see,united states weaver.the report,as we have discussed,merely tabulates data from g j records to show what the company might owe given certain assumptions.g j does not contend that either the underlying data or p g calculations are inaccurate.its quarrel has always been with the assumptions that the auditors applied to the data.as we have discussed,those assumptions were fully aired and their validity was assessed by the court based on the totality of the evidence.to the extent a given assumption was found to be invalid,the court rejected the report application of that assumption.but the payroll data summarized in the report were accurate,and the court committed no error in admitting the report as a summary of the data.see,at.
testimony of gary gebis 
gebis,as we have noted,testified at length as to the preparation of the report,the assumptions reflected in the report,and the report conclusions as to what g j purportedly owed to local based on the application of those assumptions to the company payroll records.the district court found that gebis was sufficiently involved in the p g audit to enable him to testify about the audit report and to lay a foundation for its admission.the court noted that gebis was p g liaison with the plaintiffs and in that capacity regularly communicated with them about the audit he spoke regularly with the field auditors and he signed off on the audit report after reviewing all of the pertinent working papers.wl,at at.
g j nonetheless argues that the district court should not have allowed gebis to testify about the report.as it did below,the company contends that because gebis was not one of the field auditors who did the legwork culminating in the report,he lacked sufficient personal knowledge about the report to give testimony about it.g j also suggests that gebis should not have been permitted to testify without being qualified as an expert witness pursuant to federal rule of evidence.
contrary to g j contention,gebis was certainly qualified to lay a foundation for the admission of the report notwithstanding the fact that he was not one of the line accountants who actually conducted the audit.the record reveals that gebis,as the liaison with the local funds,was in regular contact with the field auditors,met with them to review their progress,consulted with them when problems arose,and reviewed both their work papers and the final report.gebis himself recalculated all of the totals in the report prior to his testimony to satisfy himself of their accuracy,and he had also reviewed the report overall to ensure that it complied with the standards of his firm and the american institute of certified public accountants.at.gebis was conversant with the data and assumptions underlying the report and testified at length about both during the trial.he was qualified to lay an appropriate foundation for the report and did so.
the notion that gebis was called on to deliver opinion testimony and thus had to first be qualified as an expert witness pursuant to rule is mistaken.gebis certainly had expertise as a certified public accountant,but neither his firm report nor his testimony embodied an audit opinion in the usual sense.again,the report p g prepared reflects the analysis of data from g j payroll records in light of certain assumptions.the validity of those assumptions was addressed and resolved separately at trial.neither party treated the report as that of an expert,and g j own briefs acknowledge as much.the district court itself noted that gebis had not been tendered as an expert witness.at.
plaintiffs audit costs 
the plaintiffs challenge the district court denial of their request to recover their auditors fees.the collection and audit policy applicable to the local funds does not provide for,as the district court noted in its initial opinion on this subject.wl,at.but erisa itself grants the district court authority to award the plaintiffs their reasonable attorney fees and costs in successful actions to collect unpaid fringe benefit contributions owed to plans,g
