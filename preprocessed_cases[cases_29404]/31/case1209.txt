carl michael michael appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant riverside cement company pension plan in this action brought under the employee retirement income security act erisa,a.michael contends that his early retirement benefits were impermissibly reduced by a subsequent amendment to the riverside plan in violation of erisa rule,g.we conclude that he is correct,and we accordingly reverse the judgment of the district court.
the material facts of this case are undisputed.the controversy arises in an unusual context,because michael took an early retirement and then returned to work at riverside a few years later.riverside retirement plan was subsequently amended,and michael thereafter retired for the second time.his claim,which we find meritorious,is that the terms of his second retirement under the amended plan impermissibly eliminat ed or reduc ed his earlier retirement benefits as they had been guaranteed by the plan prior to its amendment.see g a.
michael retired for the first time from riverside cement company in,at age.his years with riverside allowed him to draw unreduced early retirement benefits of per month under riverside then current pension plan the plan.after receiving a total of,michael returned to work at riverside in and his early retirement benefit payments were suspended as called for under the plan.a crucial point,however,is that the plan provided that reemployment with riverside did not otherwise impair the early retirement benefits michael had received.at a later retirement,the pension was to be figured as if the pensioner were then first retired with credit for all service before and after the earlier retirement with no deduction for benefits received during the period of early retirement 
in,the riverside plan was amended to provide significantly more generous benefits under the amended plan,however,prior receipt of early retirement benefits by a rehired employee caused a substantial reduction in the pension otherwise payable upon second retirement.
michael retired again in with more than years of service with riverside.pursuant to a provision unchanged since the plan,the amended plan credited michael for his combined years of service before and after his early retirement.unlike the plan,however,the amended plan required that michael pension benefits at his second retirement be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the benefits he had received during his first retirement.this actuarial offset,however,was not permitted to reduce michael monthly pension below the amount payable to him under the old plan at the time it was amended 
the effect of the actuarial offset in michael case was substantial.his total of years of service qualified him for a pension,before reduction,of per month.after reduction of the actuarial equivalent of the early retirement benefits he had previously received his pension was per month 
it is true that michael was better off after the amendment than he would have been without it.had the plan remained in effect at michael second retirement in,his benefit unreduced by his early retirement benefits would have been per month.on the other hand,if the plan were still in effect,michael fellow workers retiring with years service and no prior early retirement would receive the same pension that he would per month.after the amendment,michael received per month and his fellow workers with years of service received per month.
michael filed suit against the riverside plan,contending that the reduction of his final retirement benefit by the actuarial equivalent of the benefits he received during his prior early retirement violated erisa rule,g.the district court granted summary judgment for the riverside plan.from this ruling,michael appeals.

immediately prior to the amendment to riverside plan,the plan provided that the early retirement benefits that michael had received would cause no reduction in his second retirement benefits.in other words,the plan provided that he would never have to pay back his early retirement benefits.yet when michael retired for the second time,the amended plan in effect required him to do just that.we conclude that,in requiring the reduction for michael early retirement benefits,the plan violated the provision of g.
erisa gives pension plan administrators the ability to fashion their own plan formulas.carver westinghouse hanford,cir.all plans,however,are subject to the outer bounds on permissible accrual practices established by erisa.alessi,d.congress purpose in enacting erisa was to ensure that if a worker has been promised a defined benefit upon if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit he actually receives it.id.at.citation omitted.
one of the outer bounds on an employer accrual practices under erisa is the prohibition against decreasing accrued benefits by plan amendment,known as the rule.g.the rule provides 
g decrease of accrued benefits through amendment of plan 
the accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan 
for purposes of paragraph,a plan amendment which has the effect of 
a eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a subsidy as defined in regulations 
with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits.
the question presented here,therefore,is whether michael early retirement benefits were eliminated or reduced by plan amendment.to answer this question,it is necessary to determine exactly what michael early retirement benefit was under the plan.the plan makes the answer perfectly clear those benefits were the payments michael received under the condition that,if he were to be reemployed,as he was,they would not cause a reduction in his second retirement benefit based on his total years of service.
the next question is whether this early retirement benefit,so defined by the plan,was eliminated or reduced by the amendment.here,too,the answer is plain.by requiring the deduction of the actuarial value of michael early retirement benefits,the plan amendment clearly eliminated or reduced the early retirement benefits as they had existed under the plan.a valuable component of those benefits under the they would not cause a reduction in benefits of a second nullified.
in granting summary judgment to the riverside plan,the district court focused only on the net effect of the amended plan on michael annual benefit commencing in.the district court found no prohibited reduction of accrued benefits,because michael monthly benefit commencing in greater than the monthly benefit he would have received in the absence of the amendment to the plan.but all employees with years of service gained handsomely by the amendment to reduce michael gain only because of early retirement benefits,which were paid under condition that they would cause no such reduction,reduces those prior benefits,as they were defined by the plan.no more is required to constitute a violation of the provision.
this court has previously looked beyond the net effect of a plan amendment on annual benefit payments,to the features of the benefit formula itself,and found an impermissible reduction of an accrued benefit.in shaw,we found that a plan amendment that phased out a living pension feature over several years decreased an accrued benefit in violation of g.shaw,at.this feature provided for an increase in a retiree pension whenever there was a subsequent increase in salary for the position the retiree had held upon retirement.when this provision was deemed by the plan administrators to have become too expensive,they amended the plan to phase out the escalation provision.we held that this amendment effected an impermissible decrease in benefits that were promised,anticipated and accrued,even though the amendment permitted some increase in the retirees pensions from their dollar level prior to the
