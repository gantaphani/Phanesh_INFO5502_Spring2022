qualchoice,qualchoice,a fiduciary and administrator of an employee benefits plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,appeals from the district court dismissal,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,of its action to obtain reimbursement under the terms of that plan from robin rowland rowland,a plan participant.qualchoice raises three claims of error on appeal.first,qualchoice argues that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,as federal common law provides federal question jurisdiction for erisa reimbursement actions.second,qualchoice argues that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to e,as qualchoice prayed for equitable relief within the meaning of a.third,qualchoice argues that the district court erred in granting rowland motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction before allowing qualchoice sufficient time to gather evidence.
for the following reasons,we affirm the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
on november,qualchoice filed a complaint against rowland alleging that qualchoice was a plan administrator and fiduciary for an employee benefit plan governed by erisa,and that rowland was a participant in that plan.qualchoice further alleged that it had advanced to rowland under the plan to cover medical expenses arising from an accident,that rowland had settled a claim with the tortfeasor,and that under the terms of the plan rowland was obligated to reimburse qualchoice from the money she received in that settlement.qualchoice prayed for specific performance of the reimbursement provision of the plan and restitution of the money it had advanced under the plan.on january,rowland filed a rule b motion to dismiss qualchoice complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because qualchoice sought only legal remedies for which erisa does not provide federal question subject matter jurisdiction.on january,qualchoice filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint that requested equitable relief in order to avoid dismissal for lack of federal question subject matter jurisdiction.
on february,the district court held a case management conference during which it granted qualchoice motion for leave to file an amended complaint,but specified that rowland motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction would apply to the amended complaint.on february,qualchoice filed an amended complaint that made many of the same factual allegations as its original complaint but newly alleged that it had advanced to rowland and prayed for equitable restitution,imposition of a constructive trust or equitable lien,an order declaring that qualchoice has a right to the equitable remedy of subrogation to obtain reimbursement and any other equitable relief.joint appendix at first am.compl.the amended complaint claimed that federal jurisdiction was proper under e and.on april,the district court entered an order explaining its obligation to ascertain whether federal question subject matter jurisdiction existed and its power to conduct an evidentiary investigation in furtherance of that goal,and requesting that the parties supply the following information to the court as soon as possible.at district.order,emphasis added.
the time and nature of defendant rowland accident,as referred to in of the amended complaint.
the details of how rowland received a fund in settlement of her claims from the above accident,id.at,whom she sued,what the settlement amount was,and when and to whom settlement amounts were or will be paid.
where the monies making up the fund in settlement are now.
at.district.order.one day later,on april,rowland filed an affidavit sworn by attorney claudia eklund attorney eklund in response to the district court order.
attorney eklund affidavit provided the following information.on the evening of november,when a wheeling lake erie railroad w le train was crossing an unguarded,unlit track,rowland drove her car into one of the railcars.at eklund aff.rowland was severely injured in the accident and required several hospitalizations,surgical procedures,and eventually a amputation.rowland incurred medical bills totaling as a result of the accident.attorney eklund represented robin and robert rowland in their lawsuit against w le for personal injuries and damages arising out of the collision.w le was an uninsured entity and verified by counsel to be an entity functioning on the verge of bankruptcy.at aff.a settlement was proposed under which w le agreed to pay a total of over the course of months.at aff.w le agreed to pay an additional over the same months,contingent upon w le obtaining certain concessions from the surface transportation board at a hearing to be held in june.at aff.according to attorney eklund,qualchoice agreed to waive any subrogated interest it may have had in the proposed settlement agreement.on december,w le and rowland consummated the settlement agreement.the surface transportation board,however,did not grant the concessions upon which the contingent payment of was based therefore,that amount did not become payable.
on december,upon signing the agreement,w le paid a lump sum of to rowland.on may,w le paid an additional lump sum of to rowland.c ommencing with june,monthly payments of for the next months were paid by w le,the last of which was received on january.at aff.from the initial payments,the sum of was used to pay litigation expenses.at aff.from each monthly check,an amount was deducted to pay the attorney fee balance.robin and robert rowland received a net recovery of.at aff.
according to attorney eklund,at this time april,no settlement fund exists,as the money has been disbursed over the last months on a monthly basis.at aff.
on april,which was the day after the district court requested that the parties supply additional information and the same day that rowland filed attorney eklund affidavit,the district court entered an order granting rowland motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.qualchoice timely appealed the district court order dismissing this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.nichols muskingum college,cir.although rowland makes both facial and factual challenges to qualchoice assertion of federal question subject matter jurisdiction,we only reach the facial challenge,and thus we must view the facts in the light most favorable to qualchoice,the party.see ohio life ins.united states,cir.
qualchoice argues that the district court had federal question subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to because qualchoice sought reimbursement under the terms of an erisa plan,which we have held may be obtained under federal common law.to support this argument,qualchoice relies upon walbro amerisure,cir,in which we held that a plan fiduciary action for reimbursement is cognizable under federal common law doctrines building on the enforcement provisions of erisa,and thus falls within the district court federal question jurisdiction.
subsequent to our decision in walbro,however,the supreme court decided life annuity insurance knudson,d,in which the court reemphasized its view that erisa is a comprehensive and reticulated statute,the product of a decade of congressional study of the nation private employee benefit system.citations omitted.the court further stated that,because of the comprehensive nature of the statute,it has been especially reluctant to tamper with the enforcement scheme embodied in the statute by extending remedies not specifically authorized by its text.id.quoting massachusetts mut.life ins.russell,d.obeying the court direction in knudson,we explicitly held in community health plan of ohio mosser,cir,that federal question jurisdiction does not exist under in an action by a plan fiduciary seeking civil enforcement of the terms of an erisa plan that does not implicate any erisa provision.in mosser,we held that e did not provide federal question subject matter jurisdiction over the plan fiduciary action because the relief sought was not equitable within the meaning of a.id.at.we further held that no other erisa provision permitted the action therefore,federal question jurisdiction does not exist under because erisa does not authorize the suit.id.at.thus in mosser,we abandoned our position in walbro and held explicitly that there is no federal question subject matter jurisdiction in an action by a plan fiduciary seeking civil enforcement of the terms of an erisa plan,unless erisa specifically authorizes the suit.therefore,qualchoice action to enforce the reimbursement provision is not cognizable under federal common law,and qualchoice can not rely upon federal common law to supply jurisdiction over its claim pursuant to.
qualchoice alternatively argues that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to e because qualchoice sought equitable remedies within the meaning of a.in its amended complaint,qualchoice prayed for restitution,imposition of a constructive trust or equitable lien,subrogation to obtain reimbursement,or any other equitable relief that the district court deemed proper.at.qualchoice argues that the settlement money that rowland recovered from w le rightfully belongs to qualchoice therefore,equity requires imposition of a constructive trust or an equitable lien to prevent unjust enrichment.qualchoice acknowledges that in knudson,the supreme court held that if a plan fiduciary seeks restitution from a plan beneficiary,who recovered from another,and the plan beneficiary does not possess the recovered funds,then the action is merely a legal action under the terms of the contract.qualchoice argues,however,that the instant action is distinguishable from knudson because the evidence demonstrates that rowland possesses the recovered funds qualchoice further argues that the supreme court expressly limited its holding in knudson to situations where the plan participant or beneficiary did not possess the recovered funds,thereby indicating that the result would have been different if the plan participant or beneficiary did possess the recovered funds.the district court rejected this argument,noting that regardless of rowland possession of an identifiable fund,qualchoice is still seeking damages for breach of contract,and concluding in any case that the beneficiary in knudson did actually possess the fund,as the beneficiary settlement recovery there was placed in a special needs trust and a client trust account.
erisa contains a section specifying the proper procedures for civil enforcement of the statute.section e provides,except for actions under subsection a b of this section,the district courts of the united states shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this subchapter brought by the secretary or by a participant,beneficiary,fiduciary,or any person referred to in section f of this title.thus,except for actions by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits under the terms of a plan,and another exception not relevant here,e supplies exclusive federal subject matter jurisdiction for the civil enforcement procedures authorized by.
title a is the civil enforcement mechanism available to plan fiduciaries.section a provides 
a civil action may be brought 
by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
the supreme court has emphasized that a does not authorize all relief that a court of equity might award rather it only authorizes those remedies traditionally awarded by courts of equity.the court has also made clear that regardless of how plaintiffs label their claims to relief,courts must determine whether the relief sought is truly equitable.see knudson,at.mertens hewitt,d.
the district court predicated its dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction upon its conclusion that the instant case is indistinguishable from knudson.in knudson,the supreme court held that a plan fiduciary action for specific performance and restitution under the plan reimbursement provision was not authorized by a.knudson,at.after the plan beneficiary in knudson was injured in a car accident,the plan fiduciary advanced money to cover the cost of medical expenses.id.at.the plan beneficiary then received money from a settlement with the tortfeasor.id.the plan fiduciary brought an action against the plan beneficiary seeking reimbursement under the terms of the plan and prayed for various equitable remedies.id.at.the supreme court held that the plan fiduciary was not entitled to an injunction against respondents failure to reimburse the plan or specific performance of the past due monetary obligation because such remedies are not typically available in equity.id.at.in rejecting the plan fiduciary claim for restitution,the supreme court distinguished between legal and equitable restitution.id.at.the supreme court stated 
in cases in which the plaintiff could not assert title or right to possession of particular property but in which nevertheless he might be able to show just grounds for recovering money to pay for some benefit the defendant had received from him,the plaintiff had a right to restitution at law through an action derived from the writ of assumpsit.in such cases,the plaintiff claim was considered legal because he sought to obtain a judgment imposing a merely personal liability upon the defendant to pay a sum of money.such claims were viewed essentially as actions at law for breach of contract whether the contract was actual or implied.
in contrast,a plaintiff could seek restitution in equity,ordinarily in the form of a constructive trust or an equitable lien,where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.a court of equity could then order a defendant to transfer title in the case of the constructive trust or to give a security interest in the case of the equitable lien to a plaintiff who was,in the eyes of equity,the true owner.but where the property sought to be recovered or its proceeds have been dissipated so that no product remains,the plaintiff claim is only that of a general creditor,and the plaintiff can not enforce a constructive trust of or an equitable lien upon the property of the defendant.
id.at.citations omitted alterations in original.in holding that the plan fiduciary in knudson was not entitled to equitable restitution,the majority wrote that petitioners seek,in essence,to impose personal liability on respondents for a contractual obligation to pay that was not typically available in equity.a claim for money due and owing under a contract is quintessentially an action at law.id.at.quotation omitted.yet,the majority opinion also emphasized that the plan fiduciary in knudson was not entitled to equitable restitution because 
the proceeds from the settlement of respondents tort not in respondents possession rather the disbursements from the settlement were paid by two checks,one made payable to the special needs trust and the other to respondents attorney the basis for petitioners claim is not that respondents hold particular funds that,in good conscience,belong to petitioners,but that petitioners are contractually entitled to some funds for benefits that they conferred.
subsequent to knudson,we held that a claim seeking restitution,or imposition of a constructive trust or equitable lien,is a legal claim if the plan participant or beneficiary does not possess an identifiable fund,regardless of whether the plan participant or beneficiary possesses money recovered from another entity.mosser,at.qualchoice attempts to distinguish this case from both knudson and mosser by claiming that it has alleged that rowland possesses an identifiable fund,and further that attorney eklund affidavit proves that rowland possesses the settlement money.therefore,we must decide whether district courts have jurisdiction over claims seeking restitution,or imposition of a constructive trust or an equitable lien,if the participant or beneficiary recovered money from another entity,and possesses that recovery in an identifiable fund.
of the circuits that have been faced with this same issue,two have concluded that a reimbursement action by an erisa fiduciary is equitable if the participant or beneficiary has recovered from another entity and possesses that recovery in an identifiable fund,but legal if the participant or beneficiary does not possess that recovery in an identifiable fund.see,bombardier aerospace employee welfare benefits plan ferrer,poirot and wansbrough,cir admin.comm.of the stores.assocs.health and welfare plan varco,cir,petition for cert.filed.
several of these circuit cases focus largely upon the language throughout knudson emphasizing that the plan beneficiary did not possess the settlement money,and the admonishment near the end of knudson stating that the majority was not foreclosing the possibility that a plan fiduciary might be able to bring an equitable action against the special needs trust or the client trust account.see,varco,at concluding that the action sought equitable relief because the plan participant possessed an identifiable fund primax recoveries,sevilla,cir concluding that the action sought legal relief because the plan participant possessed only an uncashed check from an insurer and the money remained with the insurer therefore,the participant did not possess an identifiable fund bauhaus usa,copeland,cir concluding that the action sought legal relief because the settlement money had been paid into the registry of the mississippi chancery court therefore,the beneficiary did not possess an identifiable fund.additionally,in a malpractice suit by erisa trustees against an actuary hired to evaluate a plan,the second circuit took a similar position regarding the distinction between equitable and legal relief.gerosa savasta,cir,cert.denied,d,and cert.denied,d,the gerosa court concluded that the trustees sought legal relief because they sued for damages for the actuary misconduct,rather than to recover a specific fund from the actuary.id.we find the analysis in these opinions to be unavailing on this issue because the majority in knudson left open the question of whether the plan participant or beneficiary possession of an identifiable fund would have allowed the fiduciary to seek equitable relief,and because this analysis ignores the knudson majority repeated emphasis that a breach of contract claim seeking money damages is a legal action.
recently,however,the fifth circuit issued an opinion providing a more thorough analysis supporting its view of the distinction between legal and equitable relief.bombardier.extrapolating from knudson,bombardier creates the following test for determining whether an action by a plan fiduciary seeks equitable relief does the plan seek to recover funds that are specifically identifiable,that belong in good conscience to the plan,and that are within the possession and control of the defendant beneficiary id.at.the first prong of this test asks whether the plan fiduciary sought to recover funds that they had paid out previously as benefits from a specifically identifiable corpus of money.id.the second prong of the test asks whether the plan terms contained an express,unambiguous reimbursement provision which made the disputed funds belong in good conscience to the plan.id.the third prong of the test asks whether the plan participant or beneficiary had actual or constructive possession or control over the funds.id.according to the fifth circuit,the plan beneficiary in knudson did not have actual or constructive possession over the funds because the settlement money had been placed in a special needs trust,as mandated by california law,but the plan participant in bombardier did have possession because the funds were held in a bank account in the name of the participant attorneys,which gave him constructive control,as the attorneys were his agents.id.finding that the plan fiduciary in bombardier met all of the requirements of the test,the fifth circuit concluded that the fiduciary sought to recoup the amount it had paid to the participant in benefits,rather than to impose personal liability on the participant,and therefore,that the fiduciary sought equitable relief.id.at.
the ninth circuit has taken the opposite view and held that an action by an erisa fiduciary to enforce a plan reimbursement provision is legal,regardless of whether the plan participant possesses an identifiable fund.westaff usa arce,cir,cert.denied,d in westaff,the plan fiduciary brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the funds in escrow belonged to it and seeking specific performance of the participant obligation to reimburse it.id.at.noting that the supreme court has instructed courts to look at the substance of the remedy sought rather than the label placed on that remedy,the ninth circuit concluded that the plan fiduciary in westaff sought to enforce a contractual obligation for the payment of money,a classic action at law and not an equitable claim.id.in westaff,the ninth circuit expressly took the position that the participant possession of an identifiable fund did not alter the nature of the action.id.
the third and fourth circuits have also applied knudson to determine whether the relief the plaintiff sought was legal or equitable,but have done so only in unpublished opinions involving obscure factual scenarios.see sackman teaneck nursing,wl cir,local ret.fund first union bank,wl cir.jan.while these cases do not answer the exact question we face,they do reflect an adherence to knudson admonition to look beyond the label the plaintiff puts on the relief sought.
since knudson was decided,we have dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction several actions brought by plan fiduciaries seeking reimbursement.see,mosser,caffey unum life ins,cir cmty.ins.morgan,wl cir,unicare life health ins.saiter,wl june,sheet metal local newman,wl may.in each of these cases,we simply held that the plan fiduciary sought legal relief for breach of contract.none of them,however,forecloses jurisdiction over the ostensibly equitable relief qualchoice seeks.
in mosser,the plan had paid for the participant medical expenses arising out of an accident with a negligent police officer.mosser,at.after the participant recovered from the city through a settlement,he did not reimburse the plan for the money it had paid out pursuant to the terms of the plan.the plan fiduciary then sued the participant,bringing a breach of contract claim requesting specific performance and restitution for medical payments made by the plan.id.at.when dismissing the plan fiduciary action,we noted that the plan fiduciary 
did not,in its complaint,allege that it had given certain funds to the participant,trace those funds to the settlement funds from the tortfeasor,allege that the participant was unjustly enriched by retaining the settlement funds,and seek the return of the settlement funds in the participant possession.rather,the fiduciary sought restitution from the participant for all covered services.
id.at.although we did not emphasize it our opinion,there was a significant factual difference between mosser and knudson.in knudson,the plan beneficiary never possessed the money she recovered in her settlement with the tortfeasor,as it had been paid directly into a special needs trust and a client trust account.knudson,at.in mosser,however,the plan participant apparently possessed the money she recovered from the city.mosser,at.
in saiter,a case very similar to mosser,the plan paid in medical expenses after the participant was injured in a car accident by a negligent driver.saiter,wl,at.the participant then recovered from the tortfeasor.the plan fiduciary sued the participant,the tortfeasor,and the tortfeasor insurance carrier,seeking reimbursement from the participant and asserting subrogation rights against the tortfeasor and the tortfeasor insurance carrier.when dismissing the fiduciary action,we stated that such actions are not authorized claims under erisa because they seek to enforce plan provisions through legal reme
