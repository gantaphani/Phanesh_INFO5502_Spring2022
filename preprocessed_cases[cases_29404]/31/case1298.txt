gregory tippitt appeals the district court entry of judgment in favor of reliance standard life insurance company and munich american reassurance company group long term disability insurance plan in his action for wrongful denial of benefits under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.
in july tippitt began working as a senior systems programmer at munich american reassurance company.he enrolled in the munich american reassurance company group long term disability insurance plan marc plan,a benefit that was made available to him as an employee.the marc plan is an employee welfare benefit plan,see,as well as a group health plan,see id.a,governed by erisa.tippitt is a participant in the plan.see id.
the marc plan is insured by a policy that munich purchased from reliance.reliance administers the plan and pays all benefits from its own assets.see a i,iii.to the extent that it exercises any discretionary control or authority respecting management of the plan or its assets,reliance is a fiduciary under erisa.firestone tire rubber bruch,d cotton.mut.life ins,cir.as a fiduciary,reliance must administer the plan for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan a a i,d.reliance must also provide a full and fair review of claim denials.id.
the marc plan states that an insured is entitled to monthly benefits if he is totally disabled as the result of a sickness or injury covered by this policy is under the regular care of a physician has completed the elimination period and submits satisfactory proof of total disability to us.an insured is totally disabled if during the elimination period,an insured can not perform each and every material duty of regular occupation.the plan does not define the term regular occupation.an insured completes the elimination period by being totally disabled for consecutive days.after days of total disability have elapsed,the insured may begin receiving benefits.
the marc plan states that an insured is partially disabled if as a result of an injury or sickness the insured is capable of performing the material duties of regular occupation on a basis or some of the material duties on a basis.the plan notes that a n insured who is partially disabled will be considered totally disabled,except during the elimination period.in other words,an insured who is only partially disabled,as opposed to totally disabled,during the first days of his disability is not entitled to any benefits under the plan.however,an insured who is totally disabled for the first days of his disability,and who later improves to the point of being partially disabled,is entitled to benefits.
while employed at munich,tippitt suffered from joint pain,back pain,cluster headaches,and fatigue.between december and september,he regularly visited his primary care physician for treatment.on november,that physician referred tippitt to a second physician,who is a board certified immunologist and rheumatologist.tippitt visited that specialist several times over the course of the following year and complained to him about pain in multiple joints,particularly in his hips,and reported that his activity levels were increasingly restricted.
on january,shortly after tippitt was promoted to assistant manager of computer information systems,he resigned from his job.on june,he filed an application for benefits,claiming that he became totally disabled on january.tippitt primary care physician,specialist,physical therapist,and ophthalmologist submitted reports about his medical condition to reliance.
in support of his application for benefits,tippitt sent reliance a position questionnaire which had been prepared by him and approved by munich assistant vice president of information services.the questionnaire stated that tippitt duties included implementing and maintaining all computer hardware and software systems,providing technical assistance to staff,conducting research and development,and performing administrative tasks.munich also submitted to reliance a job analysis form,which reported that tippitt was frequently required to stand,walk,and sit while performing his job.the form also indicated that tippitt job required him to use both of his hands and did not allow him to alternate between sitting and standing.
on october,reliance notified tippitt that he was ineligible for benefits because,under the terms of the plan,he was not totally disabled from each and every material duty of his occupation.reliance found that tippitt job most closely resembled the job description for manager,computer operations from the department of labor dictionary of job titles,and reliance used that job description,instead of the actual duties of tippitt job,to define his regular occupation.reliance determined that tippitt was capable of sedentary level activity with limited repetitive use of his upper extremities and the ability to alternate position as needed.it concluded that he was capable of performing a majority of the material duties of his occupation.
on november,tippitt asked reliance to review its denial of his claim.in support of his request for review,tippitt provided reliance with updated medical records from his treating physicians.
in a letter dated april,reliance stated that it had affirmed its decision to deny benefits.the letter explained that in order to meet the definition of total disability,an insured must suffer a condition so severe,it renders him or her unable to perform the material duties of his or her regular occupation,and that he had not shown that.reliance acknowledged that tippitt complained of pain with prolonged sitting,but it said that the pain should not limit his ability to perform his occupation as this occupation would allow for ample opportunity for position changes.the letter informed tippitt that reliance decision was now final because he had exhausted all of the administrative remedies available under the plan.
on april,tippitt filed suit under erisa against reliance,and also against the marc plan as an entity,see d,alleging that he had been wrongfully denied benefits.the relief tippitt sought was all benefits due him under the plan,an order enforcing and clarifying his right to future benefits,declaratory and injunctive relief,and interest,costs,and attorney fees.in the alternative,tippitt sought reversal of the denial of benefits or an order remanding the claim to the marc plan and requiring additional administrative review,along with interest,costs,and attorney fees.
following a bench trial,the district court issued an order on june,denying tippitt any relief and entering judgment in favor of reliance and the marc plan.the order explained in some detail the district court reasoning.that reasoning and our discussion of it will be easier to follow if we precede them with an explanation of the applicable legal framework.
a court must follow a series of steps in reviewing a denial of benefits decision in an erisa case.see hca health servs.of,employers health ins,cir.at each step,the court makes a determination that results in either the progression to the next step or the end of the inquiry.id.at.
in step one,a court must determine which standard to apply in reviewing the claims administrator benefits decision.hunt hawthorne,cir.erisa itself does not provide the appropriate standard.firestone,at.at marecek bellsouth,cir.a court chooses the appropriate standard after examining the plan documents to determine whether they grant the administrator discretion to interpret disputed terms.hca,at.if the court finds that the documents do not grant the administrator discretion,it applies de novo review to the administrator benefits determination and does not proceed to the remaining steps.firestone,at.at buckley metro.life,cir.if the court finds that the documents grant the claims administrator discretion,then at a minimum,the court applies arbitrary and capricious review and possibly heightened arbitrary and capricious review and proceeds to the second step.hca,at.
in step two,regardless of whether arbitrary and capricious review or the heightened form of that standard of review applies,the court reviews de novo the claims administrator interpretation of the plan to determine whether it is wrong.hca,at.wrong is the label used by our precedent to describe the conclusion a court reaches when,after reviewing the plan documents and disputed terms de novo,the court disagrees with the claims administrator plan interpretation.id.at.if the court determines that the administrator interpretation is right,the inquiry ends,but if it determines that the interpretation is wrong,the court proceeds to step three.see id.at.
in step three,the court decides whether the claimant has proposed a reasonable interpretation of the plan.hca,at internal quotation marks omitted.if the court concludes that he has,it continues on to step four.in step four,the court must determine whether the claims administrator wrong interpretation is nonetheless reasonable.id.if it is reasonable,then the interpretation is entitled to deference even though the claimant interpretation is also reasonable,and the court moves to step five.id.
finally,in step five,the court must consider the of the administrator.hca,at.if no conflict of interest exists,then only arbitrary and capricious review applies and the claims administrator wrong but reasonable decision will not be found arbitrary and capricious.id.the inquiry ends at that point.id.if a conflict does exist,then heightened arbitrary and capricious review applies.id.t he burden shifts to the claims administrator to prove that its interpretation of the plan is not tainted by.id.the claims administrator must show that its wrong but reasonable interpretation of the plan benefits the class of participants and beneficiaries.id.at.even if the administrator satisfies this burden,the insured may still be entitled to benefits if he can show by other measures that the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.id.at.
in reviewing reliance denial of benefits,the district court followed the analytical process we have just outlined.in step one the court found that because the marc plan required the insured to submit satisfactory proof of total disability to reliance,it conferred discretion upon reliance to determine eligibility for benefits.therefore,either plain arbitrary and capricious review or the heightened version of it was appropriate.the court then found that there was a conflict of interest between reliance and fiduciary roles,making heightened arbitrary and capricious the right standard.in doing so,the court relied upon levinson reliance standard life ins,cir,which involved the same plan language at issue here.
in step two,the court reviewed de novo reliance interpretation of the marc plan.the court addressed the provision that states that an insured is totally disabled if during the elimination period,the insured can not perform each and every material duty of regular occupation.the court found that under this provision,an insured is not totally disabled if he can perform even one of the material duties of his or her occupation.
the court then reviewed de novo the administrative record that was before reliance when it denied tippitt claim and subsequent appeals.the court found that during and after the elimination period,tippitt could perform some of the duties of his occupation during the three hours of sedentary work that multiple members of plaintiff medical team,and apparently plaintiff himself,reported that plaintiff could complete.the court held that this ability rendered tippitt ineligible for benefits regardless of whether the court defined his occupation according to the job analysis form completed by munich or the dot job description used by reliance.accordingly,the court held that reliance denial of benefits was not wrong,but right.
the court ended its inquiry there,at the second step,and did not proceed to the remaining steps of the analysis.the court determined that tippitt was not entitled to benefits and that reliance had not breached any of the fiduciary duties it owed him.this appeal followed.tippitt first argument focuses on what the court did in step one and his other two arguments focus on what the court did in step two.
tippitt contends that the district court erred when it determined that it should review reliance decision to deny benefits using the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard.he argues that the district court should have applied de novo review because the plan requirement that an insured submit satisfactory proof of total disability to us does not grant reliance discretion,but instead serves as a promise to pay benefits if certain conditions are met.reliance and the marc plan contend that heightened arbitrary and capricious review was appropriate because the plan language does grant reliance discretion through the satisfactory to us language.in any event,they say,we are bound by our decision in levinson.
the plan language in levinson,like that here,required the insured to submit satisfactory proof of total disability to reliance.levinson,at.not satisfied with the proof levinson submitted,the plan administrator denied benefits,and levinson filed suit against it.id.the administrator argued that its decision was only subject to arbitrary and capricious review,and levinson eventually agreed.id.at.the district court,applying arbitrary and capricious review,granted levinson motion for summary judgment,and the administrator appealed.id.
in step one of our analysis in levinson,this court stated that review was to determine whether the denial was arbitrary and capricious.at.later we noted that because there was a conflict of interest between the administrator fiduciary and roles,heightened arbitrary and capricious review was proper.id.at.we are bound by levinson to apply the same heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review in this case.
tippitt argues that we should not feel bound to follow levinson even though the plan language is identical,because levinson did not argue for de novo review.the levinson opinion,however,does not indicate that the court meant to assume away that issue or reserve it for decision in some future case where the standard of review issue was contested.instead,the opinion states the standard of review in terms of a conclusion or holding because the policy gives the administrator discretion to determine eligibility for benefits,we must determine whether the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.at.tippitt argument that we should not be bound by levinson because this point was not really argued in that case runs afoul of our decisions that a prior panel precedent can not be circumvented or ignored on the basis of arguments not made to or considered by the prior panel.see cohen office depot,cir unless and until the holding of a prior decision is overruled by the supreme court or by the en banc court,that holding is the law of this circuit regardless of what might have happened had other arguments been made to the panel that decided the issue first.accordingly,under our binding precedent the district court did not err in determining that the appropriate standard of review is heightened arbitrary and capricious.
tippitt contends that the district court erred by defining his regular occupation,for purposes of the plan,through use of a dot job description that does not reflect the actual duties he performed in his job at munich.even assuming that the duties listed in the dot description for manager,computer operations were substantially different from those tippitt actually performed,the district court did not err.the court did not define tippitt regular occupation solely with respect to the duties listed in the dot job description.the court decided that tippitt was ineligible for benefits regardless of whether it used munich job analysis form or the dot job description as a standard.it found that u nder either standard,plaintiff could perform some of the duties of either description.its decision was not affected by use of the dot job description.
tippitt contends that the district court erred by interpreting total disability so that an insured is not totally disabled if he can perform any
