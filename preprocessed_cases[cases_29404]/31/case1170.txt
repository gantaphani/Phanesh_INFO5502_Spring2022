in the course of chapter liquidation proceedings,debtors crown vantage,and crown paper crown decided to terminate crown pension plans through the purchase of an annuity,rather than by merging the plans into a multiemployer plan sponsored by pace international union pace.plan participants and pace filed an adversary action against crown in bankruptcy court,alleging that crown directors breached their fiduciary duties under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,as amended,by failing to consider adequately the proposed merger.the bankruptcy court agreed and issued a preliminary injunction ordering that crown maintain the residual the plan in an account pending a final decision on the allocation of the assets.pursuant to the bankruptcy court order,the parties submitted a joint plan for the distribution of the residual assets for the benefit of the plan participants and stipulated that the court ruling on the preliminary injunction could be treated as a final ruling on the merits under federal rule of civil procedure a.the bankruptcy court approved the plan.
as in the bankruptcy and district courts,crown argues that it did not breach its fiduciary duties to plan participants and beneficiaries because merger into a multiemployer plan is an impermissible means of terminating a pension plan under erisa,its implementing regulations,and the terms of the pension plan.pace the district court determination that it lacked standing to pursue an appeal.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.we hold that under erisa and its regulations,merger into a multiemployer plan is not a prohibited means of terminating a pension plan,and that the bankruptcy court did not err in concluding that crown breached its fiduciary duties by failing to consider thoroughly pace proposal and discharge its duties solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.a.with respect to pace,we vacate the district court judgment on that issue with directions to remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings 
facts and procedural history 
crown vantage,was the parent company of crown paper,which operated seven paper mills in the eastern united states and employed workers.the employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with pace.members of crown board of directors were also the trustees for its eighteen pension plans.
in march of,crown filed for chapter bankruptcy and began liquidating its assets.see generally in re crown vantage,cir.the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc filed proofs of claims totaling millions of dollars for the liability it would have been forced to assume if it had taken over crown pension plans.the bankruptcy court viewed pbgc proofs of claims as a stumbling block to chapter plan confirmation.in july of,crown board began to obtain quotes for the purchase of an annuity as a means of effecting a standard termination of the plans under section b of erisa,b.
during the summer of,pace proposed a merger of the seventeen pension plans that covered crown hourly employees into the pace industrial union management pension fund piumpf,a act multiemployer pension fund founded in for pace union members.pace preferred this option because piumpf in prior years had paid a thirteenth monthly check during the year,and thus merger offered the possibility that retirees might receive more than the minimum benefits.additionally,pace preferred the proposed merger because piumpf provided an established dispute resolution program for plan participants.
crown counsel met with a pace representative in august of to discuss the merger,and expressed the view that crown wanted to be assured of the financial stability of piumpf and the legality of the merger.the parties agreed that their attorneys and actuaries would further investigate the piumpf merger.on september,piumpf actuary reported that the merger was feasible,and crown counsel requested more information from piumpf counsel.that same day,crown board of directors met and reviewed bids for annuities,and learned that a reversion to the company of remaining assets in the plan would be possible if it terminated twelve of the pension plans through the purchase of an annuity the board also learned about the proposed piumpf merger,and agreed to compare it to the annuity options once it received final bids.
on october,piumpf counsel sent crown counsel a draft merger agreement.on october,crown counsel stated at a hearing in the bankruptcy court that it was looking into the possibility of a merger with piumpf.at this hearing,counsel represented that before an action is taken as to these pension plans,the court would be notified.on october,piumpf counsel sent crown more information about the financial stability and legality of the merger.
crown board met on october,to review the final annuity bids with the understanding that they would expire within hours.the bankruptcy court determined that the board did not seek a waiver of this deadline.at the time of the meeting,the board faced a day timetable for dissolving crown,and crown had or less in the bank.the board did not consider the piumpf merger at this meeting,and it did not ask its actuary to analyze the proposed merger.minutes of the october meeting reflect that pbgc had agreed to release crown under an annuitization of the pension plans,but not in a merger.the bankruptcy court found that the board did not pursue a release from pbgc for a merger with piumpf.the board decided to purchase an annuity as a means of terminating the twelve merged pension plans the merged plan through hartford life insurance company,on the basis of hartford financial stability and a projected maximum reversion of nearly million to crown.crown deposited over million with hartford the next day.
appellees edward miller and jeffrey macek,on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated plan participants,and pace,on behalf of its members and former member plan participants,filed suit in bankruptcy court.the plaintiffs alleged that crown breached its fiduciary duties under erisa by failing to perform a diligent investigation into the piumpf merger proposal,and by failing to discharge its duties solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.after rendering oral findings of facts and conclusions of law,the bankruptcy court granted a preliminary injunction,ordering all cash assets remaining in the pension plan to be placed in an account,and that no reversion of assets to crown could occur,pending the court final decision on the allocation of the assets.the bankruptcy court also ordered the parties to report on the feasibility of distributing the reversion for the benefit of the pension plan participants.although the plaintiffs asked the bankruptcy court to void the annuity transaction with hartford,the court declined to do so and allowed crown to complete the termination process.
the parties stipulated to having the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law deemed a final ruling on the merits,and submitted a joint report setting forth a procedure for distribution of the residual assets for the benefit of the plan participants.the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the distribution of the assets to the plan participants.as noted,the court left the preliminary injunction in effect pending implementation of the distribution.although no final judgment was entered,in light of the parties stipulation we treat the district order granting the preliminary injunction as the final judgment.
on appeal to the district court,crown argued that neither appellees miller and macek nor pace had standing and that it was neither subject to fiduciary obligations in terminating the plan,nor did it breach such duties.the district court held that appellees miller and macek had standing as plan participants to enforce crown fiduciary obligations,but dismissed pace for lack of standing,because it was not an enumerated party under erisa the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that crown breached its fiduciary duties as well as the preliminary injunction granted by the bankruptcy court.
ii.breach of fiduciary duties under erisa 
the parties do not dispute that the decision to terminate a pension plan is a business decision not subject to erisa fiduciary obligations,see cunha ward foods,cir,and amalgamated clothing and textile workers union,murdock,cir,whereas the implementation of a decision to terminate is discretionary in nature and subject to erisa fiduciary obligations.see waller blue cross of,cir.crown does not challenge the bankruptcy court finding that it failed fully to investigate the piumpf merger option.instead,crown argues that both erisa and the terms of the pension plan prohibit merger into a multiemployer plan as a means of termination thus its decision to terminate,rather than to merge,was discretionary and not subject to fiduciary obligations.the merits of miller and macek claim that crown breached its fiduciary duties therefore turn on whether merger into a multiemployer plan is a permissible means of implementing a decision to terminate.
standard of review 
we review the bankruptcy court decision directly and therefore review de novo the district court decision on appeal from the bankruptcy court.cellular,channel communications,in re cellular,cir neilson united states in re olshan,cir.we apply the same standard of review applied by the district court,and review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo,and its findings of fact for clear error.olshan,at.
permissibility of merger under the terms of the pension plan 
before the district court and in this appeal,crown has argued that the terms of its pension plan do not permit a merger as a means of termination.crown failed to raise this argument before the bankruptcy court.as a general rule,we do not consider issues argued for the first time on appeal.citibank,eashai in re eashai,cir.this rule applies to appeals from bankruptcy proceedings.in re southland supply,cir.we conclude that none of our recognized exceptions to this rule applies to this case.cold mountain garber,cir eashai,at.we therefore deem this argument waived.
permissibility of merger as a means of termination under erisa 
the bankruptcy court did not explicitly determine whether erisa permits merger into a multiemployer plan as a means of terminating a single employer plan.instead,the court assumed that this was permissible,finding t he decision whether to annuitize the plans or merge them into piumpf was a discretionary act subject to fiduciary duties.because the bankruptcy court interpretation of erisa is a question of law,our review is de novo.mathews chevron,cir olshan,at.
as crown argues,erisa a,a,provides that the exclusive means of terminating a pension plan are institution of termination proceedings by the corporation under standard termination under b and distress termination under c.the termination effected in this case was a standard termination.a standard termination requires that,when the final distribution of assets occurs,the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities.b d.so long as the pbgc does not issue a notice of noncompliance,the plan administrator must distribute the assets.id.b d a,a,c.
erisa b,b,sets forth the method for final distribution of assets for standard terminations.the assets are to be allocated according to the priorities listed in.next,the statutory section at issue in this case states 
in distributing such assets,the plan administrator shall 
i purchase irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan,or 
ii in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations,otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan.
b a emphasis added.thus,erisa explicitly provides for alternative means of terminating a pension plan.the implementing regulations are consistent 
the plan administrator must,in accordance with all applicable requirements under the code and erisa,distribute plan assets in satisfaction of all plan benefits by purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer or in another permitted form.
c emphasis added.thus,the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer is not a requirement other methods of termination are permitted as long as they are sufficient to cover plan liabilities.
crown emphasizes that erisa,and erisa,which controls transfers between multiemployer and plans,are two wholly separate sections of the statute,neither of which expressly permits mergers as a means of termination.yet,as the district court persuasively reasoned,both and are included within erisa title iv,which covers the topic of plan termination insurance.section falls under subtitle e of title iv,special provisions for multiemployer plans.it would have been logical for congress to place within title iv of erisa because,as appellees miller and macek argue,one practical effect of a merger or complete transfer is that at least one pension plan will cease to exist.
crown cites brotherhood of railroad trainmen baltimore ohio railroad,and scarborough office of personnel management,cir,for the proposition that a statute titles and headings can not limit the plain meaning of the text.those cases,however,dealt with unambiguous statutory language.by contrast,where the statutory language is ambiguous,titles and headings may be used to clarify the meaning of statutory text.see natural res.def.council epa,cir.here,the statutory language is unclear whether congress intended to permit mergers into multiemployer plans as a means of termination under b a is uncertain.consideration of the placement of titles and headings clarifies the statutory text and supports the conclusion that mergers are a permissible means of termination.
crown also argues that f,which involves transfers between or mergers of multiemployer and plans,supports its argument that terminations are distinct from transfers between single and multiemployer plans.section f states 
no transfer to which this section applies,in connection with a termination described in section a of this title,shall be effective unless the transfer meets such requirements as may be established by the corporation to prevent an increase in the risk of loss to the corporation.
section refers to terminations of multiemployer plans.the text of f implies that a transfer between a single and multiemployer plan can be in connection with a termination albeit the termination of a multiemployer plan.thus,f fails to support crown argument that termination and merger into a multiemployer plan are actions.
finally,crown argues that a merger into a multiemployer plan does not constitute a distribution under b.the terms distribution or distribute are not expressly defined in either erisa or its implementing regulations.see.dictionary definitions of distribute include to divide among several or many deal out apportion esp.to members of a group or over a period of time allot dispense,administer and to give out or deliver esp.to the members of a group.webster third new int l dictionary.these definitions do not support the exclusion of mergers into multiemployer plans as a means of termination.as appellees miller and macek argue,the purchase of irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan,pursuant to b,such as the annuity to be provided by hartford life in this case,does not appear to satisfy the distribution requirement any more than would a merger into a multiemployer plan.both scenarios would involve a series of payments to plan beneficiaries over time,rather than a payment at the time of termination.
in sum,the text of erisa and its implementing regulations is ambiguous at best and neither explicitly nor implicitly prohibits merger into a multiemployer plan as a means of termination of a pension plan.as the district court determined,b provides for alternative means of termination,so long as they are consistent with the plan provisions,applicable regulations and otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan.we hold that neither the statute nor its implementing regulations preclude mergers into multiemployer plans as a method of providing such benefit liabilities.we therefore affirm the district court ruling on this issue.
