background 
this dispute is no stranger to our court it comes before us for a second time.see stephanie blue cross blue shield of.hmo blue,stephanie i,cir.because there is no need to repastinate ground already,we begin by reproducing our earlier summary of how the case arose.
stephanie son,is a derivative beneficiary of an group health insurance plan the plan furnished by his father employer,harmonix music systems,harmonix.the plan is denominated as a preferred blue ppo preferred provider plan,the terms of which are set out in a subscriber certificate the certificate.in pertinent part,the certificate makes clear that coverage under the plan remains subject to a determination of medical necessity made by bcbs.it specifies that the plan covers treatment for psychiatric illnesses,including biologically based conditions,autism and,for children until age nineteen,for based conditions,behavioral problems.such benefits do not accrue for residential,custodial,or medically unnecessary services,such as those performed in educational,vocational,or recreational settings.the certificate also stipulates that only the least intensive type of setting required for treatment of a condition will receive approval.any inpatient course of treatment needs approval before the patient is admitted to the facility.
experienced a number of mental health issues beginning in early childhood.
condition intensified in severity in the summer of the summer between his freshman and sophomore years in high school.at that time,he became physically aggressive toward his parents and attended weekly mental health therapy sessions.although enrolled in an intensive outpatient educational facility,he continued to exhibit aggressive behavior that led to multiple arrests.his problems escalated because he steadfastly refused to take medications despite a court order requiring him to do so.
concerned about the apparent inadequacy of his care,stephanie enrolled at her own expense and without prior approval in vantage point by aspiro aspiro,a wilderness therapy program based in utah,which specializes in neurodevelopmental disorders.remained at aspiro from october of to january of.his psychological evaluators there diagnosed him as having asperger syndrome,anxiety disorder,and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.noticing some improvement,they recommended that he continue therapy in a setting.
on the advice of a consultant and without prior approval,stephanie proceeded to enroll in gateway academy gateway,a private school treatment center in utah that bcbs insists is out of network that is,not in a contractual relationship with bcbs.while at gateway,aggressive and emotionally erratic behavior continued among other things,he engaged in inappropriate sexual contact and committed a variety of petty criminal offenses.
in april of,harmonix submitted claims to bcbs for three sets of psychiatric evaluations and consultation services performed during the period from january,to february,in connection with admission to gateway.in late june,bcbs informed harmonix that gateway was a provider but that it would cover the three sets of evaluations as a exception.gateway itself submitted claims in september of and march of seeking reimbursement for principally residential services rendered to dating back to january of.
in an informal process,bcbs denied these room and board claims because the services were not medically necessary and the submitted documentation did not support the need for an inpatient admission.in an explanatory letter dated may,bcbs advised father that its denial of benefits was based largely upon an evaluation conducted by elyce kearns,a,who relied upon interqual,a nationally recognized set of criteria used to assess the level of care for mental health patients.given kearns evaluation,bcbs concluded that clinical condition does not meet the medical necessity criteria required for an acute residential psychiatric stay.
about a year later,stephanie requested and received a sheaf of pertinent records from bcbs.she then contested the denial of coverage through bcbs internal review process.in support of her appeal,stephanie furnished documentation from psychotherapists,evaluators,and educators in addition to police reports and juvenile court records.collectively,these materials described difficulties involving physical and verbal aggression,emotional volatility,lack of impulse control,and thinking errors.this pattern of conduct,stephanie maintained,posed a danger to and to others.
a second,kerim munir,scrutinized the administrative record and recommended that bcbs uphold the denial of benefits.he cited the absence of any medical necessity for the placement and reiterated the conclusions of the first.on june,bcbs denied the internal appeal in a letter to stephanie.
id.at footnote omitted.
having exhausted her administrative remedies,stephanie sued bcbs in an effort to recover the denied benefits.see a b.the parties for summary judgment,and the district court entered judgment in favor of bcbs.see stephanie blue cross blue shield of.hmo blue,wl,at.stephanie appealed.
we did not reach the merits of stephanie appeal but,rather,focused on a threshold issue,holding that the district court erred in reviewing bcbs denial of benefits for abuse of discretion.see stephanie i,at.we explained that the court should have reviewed the denial de novo because the certificate did not unambiguously confer discretionary decisionmaking authority on the plan administrator bcbs.see id.citing firestone tire rubber bruch,holding that a denial of erisa benefits is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.consequently,we vacated the district court decision in relevant part and remanded for reappraisal of the denial of benefits under the appropriate standard of review.see id.at.
on remand,the district court this time exercising de novo review again entered judgment in favor of bcbs.see stephanie blue cross blue shield of.hmo blue,stephanie ii,wl,at.june.this timely appeal followed.
ii.standard of appellate review 
this appeal,like stephanie earlier appeal,presents a standard of review quandary but one that operates on a different level.the first time around,we were asked to determine what standard of review the district court should employ in its review of the record of proceedings before the plan administrator.see stephanie i,at.on remand,the district court performed that task and,as we had instructed,exercised de novo review.see stephanie ii,wl,at.the question now becomes what standard we should apply in reviewing the district court decision.
stephanie posits that we should undertake de novo review at the appellate level.her argument leans heavily on the fact that the parties presented this case to the district court on for summary judgment.this argument has a certain superficial appeal after all,appellate review of a district court grant or denial of summary judgment is normally de novo,see,murray kindred nursing ctrs.llc,cir.houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir,and that standard is not altered by the incidence of for summary judgment,see,blackie maine,cir.
the rationale behind this practice is straightforward.in the ordinary case,a motion for summary judgment asks the district court to decide questions of law does the summary judgment record,viewed in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant,reveal the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and confirm that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law see fed.civ.a murray,at.if the answers to these questions are in the affirmative,the case ends if the answers are in the negative,the case is set for trial.
but one size does not fit all.as we previously have noted,a motion for summary judgment has a different office in administrative law cases.there,a summary judgment motion is simply a vehicle to tee up a case for judicial review based on the administrative record.bos.redev.auth.park,cir.that the parties brought the issues forward on for summary judgment is not significant substance must prevail over form shore,thompson,cir.the controlling feature is that the parties have presented the case to the court for an decision on the administrative record,see,and judicial decisionmaking proceeds on that basis.
erisa cases typically are adjudicated on the record compiled before the plan administrator.denmark liberty life assur,cir.such cases bear a strong family resemblance to administrative law cases thus as in the administrative law context a motion for summary judgment is simply a mechanism for positioning an erisa case for a district court decision on the record of proceedings before the plan administrator.see bard bos.shipping ass n,cir.explaining that i n the erisa context,summary judgment is merely a vehicle for deciding the case.
stephanie tries to avoid the force of this analogy by relying on our decision in v.at t mobility puerto rico,for the proposition that the intent of the parties at the time they moved for summary judgment ought to govern the standard of appellate review.see,cir,though,is a horse of an appreciably different hue.that case did not involve anything resembling an administrative record it was,instead,a employment discrimination suit in which the parties had filed for summary judgment.see id.at.the district court assumed the case to be a case stated,that is,a case in which the parties waive trial and present the case to the court on the undisputed facts in the record.id.at quoting tlt constr.ri,cir.we found the case stated characterization inappropos even though the parties had agreed on some facts held that the district court should not have decided the summary judgment motions on a case stated basis and affirmed on other grounds.see id.at.placed in its proper perspective,is not instructive here.
our rejection of stephanie two principal arguments does not answer the question of what standard of review an appellate court must apply in an erisa case that is presented for decision exclusively on the record of proceedings before the plan administrator.bcbs suggests an answer to this question.it posits that we should review the district court decision,to the extent that it rests upon factual findings and inferences therefrom,only for clear error 
logically,the nature of the district court review ought to figure importantly in determining the appropriate standard of appellate review.where the erisa plan grants the plan administrator discretionary authority,the district court must uphold that decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.see d h therapy,llc bos.mut.life ins,cir.in that event,it makes sense that appellate review should be de novo.see colby union sec.ins.mgmt.for merrimack anesthesia assocs.long term disab.plan,cir.reviewing de novo district court determination that plan administrator had abused its discretion and explaining that w here applicable,the abuse of discretion standard binds all reviewing courts,whether district or appellate,in the evaluation of a plan administrator determinations.
on the other hand,where the district court reviews the record of proceedings before the plan administrator de novo,the court may weigh the facts,resolve conflicts in the evidence,and draw reasonable inferences.see orndorf paul revere life ins,cir.in such cases,the argument for a more deferential standard of review has at least a patina of plausibility dantran,dep t of labor,cir.explaining that courts regularly review factfinding done pursuant to a preponderance of the evidence standard for clear error.
to complicate matters,our case law,specific to the erisa context,appears murky.in tsoulas liberty life assurance,the claimant alleged that her disability benefits had been wrongfully terminated.see,cir.the district court,exercising de novo review,entered judgment for the fiduciary.see id.noting that the parties submitted this case to the district court based on a stipulated record of the proceedings before the plan administrator,we held that the court factual determinations were reviewable for clear error.id.at accord digregorio hartford comp emp.ben.serv,cir.reviewing factual conclusion drawn by district court from record of proceedings for clear error.
in orndorf,though,we exercised plenary review over a district court de novo review of a plan administrator decision and questioned whether factfinding has any place in the typical erisa case.see at.we suggested that w here review is properly confined to the administrative record before the erisa plan administrator,there are no disputed issues of fact for the court to resolve.id.at.
while we regard this dive into the case law as informative,we need not resolve the tension in our decisions.standards of review sometimes have decretory significance but sometimes they do not.in the last analysis,this case falls into the latter camp we have examined the record with care,and we are satisfied that,regardless of whether we review the district court decision de novo or more deferentially for clear error,the outcome would be the same.accordingly,we leave the standard of appellate review question open assume,favorably to stephanie,that our review is de novo and proceed on that assumption.
iii.the merits 
the district court concluded that bcbs was justified in denying coverage for expenses at gateway for two independently sufficient reasons.first,the court held that the plan does not provide coverage for services rendered in an educational setting.see stephanie ii,wl,at.second,the court held that,in all events,the services in question were not medically necessary within the purview of the plan.see id.at.an overarching principle applies to both aspects of the district court decision an erisa beneficiary who claims the wrongful denial of benefits bears the burden of demonstrating,by a preponderance of the evidence,that she was in fact entitled to coverage.see gent cuna mut.ins.soc y,cir.
this case is,and it would serve no useful purpose for us to mine the record extravagantly.for present purposes,we think it sufficient to explain briefly why we conclude as did the district court that stephanie,although by able counsel,failed to carry her burden on either of the two identified grounds.
our starting point is the certificate itself,which makes pellucid that no benefits are provided for services that are performed in educational settings.it goes on to describe such settings 
t hese programs may have educational accreditation.the staff may include some licensed mental health providers who may provide some therapy.no benefits are provided for any services furnished along with one of these programs.for example,no benefits are provided for therapy psychotherapy furnished along with one of these programs.
the district court concluded,accordingly,that gateway was an educational setting,stephanie ii,wl,at,and stephanie does not offer an alternative reading of the certificate that would square its exclusion of services rendered in educational settings with the coverage she seeks.she also does not contest that gateway provided some educational services that regular course work is a part of the program that gateway refers to its enrollees as students and that the enrollees attend scholastic classes and receive traditional letter grades and averages.nor does she dispute that gateway refers to its facility as a campus or that when an enrollee completes the gateway program,he is said to have graduated.given these uncontested facts,it is plain that gateway is an educational setting.stephanie resists this conclusion,arguing that the educational setting exclusion should not apply because education was not the substantive purpose for enrollment.the terms of the certificate,though,do not admit of any such distinction.rather,those terms state,with conspicuous clarity,that n o benefits are provided for any services furnished along with one of these educational programs.
stephanie has a fallback position.she contends that bcbs did not properly notify her that gateway educational setting constituted a reason for its denial of benefits.the underlying premise on which this contention rests is sound a plan administrator,in terminating or denying benefits,may not rely on a theory for its termination or denial that it did not communicate to the insured prior to litigation.see bard,at glista unum life ins,cir.here,however,the conclusion that stephanie draws from this premise is problematic.she concedes that,well before the commencement of any litigation,bcbs notified father the holder of the certificate and,thus,the subscriber of the educational setting issue in a telephone call.
the certificate provides that,if a claim is denied,bcbs will send you the health care provider notice of the reason for the denial.the pronoun you is defined as any member who has the right to the coverage provided by this health plan.a member may be the subscriber or his or her enrolled eligible spouse or former spouse,if applicable or any other enrolled eligible dependent.to cinch matters,father was designated as an addressee for correspondence regarding claims.
stephanie does not dispute that father was a proper recipient for such notices.she nonetheless rejoins that the educational setting message needed to be communicated in writing.see requiring plan administrators to provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant see also g t he plan administrator shall provide a claimant with written or electronic notification of any adverse benefit determination.on that basis,she asserts that we should disregard the telephone call to father.
but there is a rub stephanie did not argue to the district court that the notice she received of the educational setting ground for denial was defective because it was not in writing.she focused,instead,on whether bcbs had notified her at all of the educational setting issue during the internal appeals process.she can not now switch horses in search of a swifter steed.see teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers union superline transp,cir.if any principle is settled in this circuit,it is that,absent the most extraordinary circumstances,legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court can not be broached for the first time on appeal.as a result,we hold,as did the court below,that the educational setting bar to coverage,adumbrated in the certificate,justified bcbs denial of stephanie claim 
even though this holding is dispositive of stephanie claim,we address succinctly,for the sake of completeness,the district court second ground for denying the claim that stay at gateway was not shown to be medically necessary.the court based this holding on a finding that treatment did not satisfy the interqual criteria for adolescent psychiatry,as implemented by bcbs internal policies.see stephanie ii,wl,at.
the certificate dictates that bcbs decides which health care services are medically necessary and appropriate for coverage.of course,on de novo review,we must be satisfied the plan administrator decision is correct.see richards,cir.indeed,even under deferential review,the determination must be reasonable.see colby,at.
to facilitate this decisionmaking,bcbs reviewers reasonably consult the interqual criteria,which are nationally recognized,guidelines.the criteria provide a sensible structure for analyzing a patient particular symptoms,diagnoses,risks,and circumstances to determine what level of care is medically necessary.
as relevant here,the interqual criteria invite a analysis.first,the reviewer must analyze the patient clinical indications,that is,his current psychiatric diagnosis and symptoms.if the clinical indications suggest a need for further treatment,the reviewer must then consider the individual social risks.that consideration entails an examination of the remaining two parts of the algorithm risks and level of care,respectively.
the district court did not make specific findings regarding clinical indications,and the logical inference is that the court deemed stephanie proof on this point sufficient.although bcbs claims that symptoms did not satisfy the listed criteria because he was not a chronic or persistent danger to himself or others within the week prior to his admission at gateway as required by the interqual criteria,the record belies this claim.
under the interqual criteria,an individual is a chronic or persistent danger to himself or others if he exhibits any one of several enumerated behaviors.one such enumerated behavior is unmanageable a ngry outbursts a ggression.another is s exually inappropriate aggressive abusive conduct,which according to the notes accompanying the interqual criteria may include noncontact acts such as sexual comments.
we need not tarry.on this issue,it suffices to say that records from final week in the wilderness program describe continued struggle with his emotions.he would quickly become agitated with members of his cohort and curse at them,using excessive inappropriate language including insults and perverted statements.pattern of outbursts and the prognosis formulated by his therapist at the wilderness program offer every indication that aggressive and inappropriate sexual comments will continue.given this tableau,we believe that stephanie carried her burden of showing that displayed clinical indications adequate to satisfy the interqual criteria.
stephanie proof does not fare as well on the remaining parts of the tripartite analysis.under the interqual criteria,stephanie was required to show that had a record of unsuccessful treatment within the year prior to his admission to gateway and that he was unable to be managed at a lower level of care that is,a level of care less intensive than the gateway program.the district court concluded that stephanie had not satisfied either of these requirements.see stephanie ii,wl,at.on de novo review,we reach the same conclusion.
to begin,the record leaves no doubt that did not have a record of unsuccessful treatment within a year prior to his admission at gateway.prior courses of treatments,such as the wilderness program,undeniably improved symptoms.see id.
a few examples hammer home the point.discharge report from the wilderness program confirmed that,after finishing the program,he had a greater ability to express his emotions,problem solve,and deal with frustration and disappointment.so,too,the discharge summary disclosed that had reduced his inappropriate talk and impulsive behaviors.these are badges of improvement,signifying that the wilderness program achieved at least a modicum of success.
arguing to the contrary,stephanie relies on the recommendation of a therapist at the wilderness program for ongoing residential treatment of.the notes accompanying the interqual criteria,though,define unsuccessful treatment as a lack of improvement of a patient symptoms and behaviors in previous treatment or inability to complete an adequate trial of treatment provided by a licensed program or clinician.under this standard,the fact that required further treatment did not mean that the previous treatment was unsuccessful what matters is that did not exhibit the requisite lack of improvement needed to render his prior treatment unsuccessful.stephanie does not explain how we can reconcile apparent improvement with the interqual criteria definition of unsuccessful treatment.
stephanie offers a second reason why should be regarded as having a history of unsuccessful treatment within the year prior to commencing the gateway program.she notes that began an outpatient regime in august of and that he was arrested the following month for hitting her.while this incident does seem to present an example of failed treatment in the relevant time frame,subsequent progress in the wilderne
