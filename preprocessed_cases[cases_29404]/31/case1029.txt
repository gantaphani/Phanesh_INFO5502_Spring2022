background 
since,ferrari,a trained anesthesiologist who has also earned a juris doctor degree,has suffered from numerous hydrops of the cochlea,a form of meniere disease that can cause episodic or permanent hearing loss.in,while employed as an anesthesiologist at the university of hospital,ferrari experienced an episode of hearing loss.following that event,his supervisor decided that the hearing loss made it inappropriate for the doctor to continue practicing as an anesthesiologist.he then appointed ferrari to serve as the hospital director of respiratory therapy.from until,ferrari remained at the university of hospital serving as the director of respiratory therapy and as chairman of the department of anesthesiology.hearing tests conducted on ferrari between november and april showed stable,normal hearing.
in may,ferrari accepted an anesthesiology faculty position at louis university.there,despite the earlier problem of episodic hearing loss,he spent about of his time providing patient care as an anesthesiologist and of his time in related faculty teaching duties.in april,ferrari suffered a sudden and permanent loss of hearing in his left ear.he sought medical care for the condition,but continued to perform his anesthesiology duties until february,when he was suspended from further duties in the department of anesthesiology.at that time his annual salary was.
as a benefit of his employment at louis university,ferrari was enrolled in tiaa group disability benefits plan the plan,an employee welfare benefit plan that provides benefits to employees who prove they are disabled under its terms.determination of availability of benefits is made by tiaa based on the employee claim file,which serves as the administrative record.at the time ferrari applied for disability benefits,the plan defined disability in three sections.part a specified that an employee who was completely unable,due to a disability,to perform his normal occupation would be considered totally disabled during the first thirty months following the incident causing the disability.part a provided that an individual would be considered totally disabled after the first thirty months only if he could not perform any occupation for which the employee was reasonably suited by education,training or experience.part b contained a definition of partial disability,which stated that after six or more months of continuous total disability,as defined in part a,a beneficiary would be considered partially disabled if he was able to perform some occupation for which he was reasonably suited by education,training or experience,but was unable to earn more than of his previous monthly wage base.
on april,the date ferrari applied for disability benefits,his application indicated that he did not expect to return to work.tiaa determined that ferrari had become totally disabled on february,and began making payments to the doctor,initially totaling per month,on may.tiaa also conducted an occupational evaluation to determine the implications of his hearing loss on his work ability.the evaluator concluded that,while he was not able to perform the essential duties of an anesthesiologist,ferrari could pursue work in other fields such as medical administration and legal work.on september,tiaa notified ferrari that,based on the information in his file,his benefits would continue for only thirty months through august,since the administrative record did not support a finding of disability under the part of the definition that required that he be unable to perform not just his normal occupation,but any occupation for which he was qualified by reason of education,training or experience.the letter indicated tiaa would be reviewing ferrari file on a regular basis to determine continuance of benefits and to assess his potential eligibility for benefits after the first thirty months.
on february,tiaa wrote to ferrari asking him to complete a form titled certification of continuing disability and requesting that he forward another form for completion by his attending physician.both ferrari and his physician returned the requested documents.on his form,ferrari indicated that he had not worked in the past twelve months but refused to authorize tiaa to obtain corroborating financial data from his financial institutions.letters sent by tiaa on february,and on july,again notified ferrari in writing that as of august,his benefits under part a would end unless the plan received documentation supporting continuing disability under the second part of the definition indicating that he was incapable of performing any other occupation for which he was suited by education,training,or experience.ferrari was directed to call a group benefits analyst if he had any questions about his benefit status.ferrari did not respond to the july,letter and as of august,tiaa stopped paying ferrari benefits.
on september,ferrari attorney submitted a written request to tiaa demanding reconsideration of its termination of his benefits.the letter asserted that ferrari condition continued to fall within the definition of total disability and alleged that due to his disability he was unable to engage in any occupation for which he was reasonably fitted by education,training,or experience.on october,tiaa informed ferrari that it would evaluate his request to reconsider its decision and on november,tiaa notified ferrari that it had determined that he was not disabled under the plan and refused to reinstate disability payments.in the same letter,however,tiaa stated that it would schedule an independent vocational assessment to reevaluate whether ferrari still met the definition of disability.on december,tiaa informed ferrari that the certified vocational rehabilitation counselor had completed the employability assessment,which included a transferrable market study.the counselor determined that,despite his hearing loss,there were several occupations available for ferrari in the louis area based on his education,skills,and background,including that of attorney,medical reviewer,and medical writer.on march,tiaa again notified ferrari that it would not continue his disability payments.ferrari filed suit against tiaa.both sides filed summary judgment motions.the district court granted tiaa summary judgment motion finding tiaa decision not to continue benefits was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion.this appeal ensued.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment motion de novo,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.woo deluxe,cir.de novo review of a district court judgment concerning an administrative record requires that we view the case from the same position as the district court.see brown united states dep t of interior,cir.in this case,the district court reviewed tiaa decision to deny ferrari benefits for abuse of discretion.
as an initial matter,however,ferrari asserts that the district court erred when it applied the abuse of discretion standard in its review of tiaa decision.he alleges both serious procedural irregularities and lack of judgment on the part of tiaa plan administrators that resulted in a breach of tiaa fiduciary duty to him.he claims that,as a result,a heightened,less deferential standard of review under woo,at,is required.ferrari suggests that this court should apply a approach under which the evidence supporting tiaa decision must increase in proportion to the seriousness of the procedural irregularity.id.at.with regard to the alleged proced
