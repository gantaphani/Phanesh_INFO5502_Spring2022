factual and procedural background 
the facts are largely taken from the court of appeal opinion.
betancourt and other employees laborers are union members who worked for richards,a subcontractor of trabucco associates.richards employed laborers pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement agreement between trabucco and laborers union,district council of the united association of journeymen and apprentices of the plumbing and pipefitting industry of the united states and canada union.
laborers worked on a residential construction project,which storke housing investors and bdc storke development collectively,storke owned.according to the agreement,laborers were entitled to an hourly compensation package,including wages and benefits.laborers received their cash wages,but richards failed to make contributions to the union trust funds for the benefit of laborers.pursuant to section,laborers recorded a mechanic lien for unpaid contributions in the amount of against storke real property.in may,laborers,as individuals and as members of union,and union,as a party to the agreement but not as a trust fund collectively,plaintiffs filed the instant action to foreclose on the section lien.
storke demurred,contending that the amounts due were fringe benefit contributions owing to union employee benefit plan,and,as such,erisa preempted plaintiffs action.a.relying on our decision in el capitan,supra,cal d,the trial court concluded that erisa preempted plaintiffs action.the court sustained storke demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action.
plaintiffs appealed.the court of appeal reversed the trial court judgment.it concluded that b ecause decisions of the united states supreme court subsequent to el capitan have dramatically narrowed the preemptive scope of erisa,we hold that erisa does not bar this action.we conclude that we are not bound by el capitan.the court of appeal reasoned,section is a state law of general applicability which creates no rights or restrictions concerning the administration or funding of erisa plans.therefore,it matters not that the remedy provided by section on the landowner not a remedy provided to redress violations of erisa.see d.our review follows.
discussion 
on review of the judgment of the court of appeal reversing the superior court orders sustaining defendants demurrers,we examine the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory,such facts being assumed true for this purpose.citations.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.as relevant here,plaintiffs complaint alleged that laborers worked on storke real property for an hourly compensation pursuant to the agreement laborers union was a party to the agreement laborers were due for their unpaid labor on the project and plaintiffs recorded a mechanic lien on the storke property pursuant to section.
the parties do not seriously dispute that plaintiffs section action seeks to recover unpaid contributions to their benefit plans.though section is not limited to an express trust fund see,storke maintains that plaintiffs action is a backdoor attempt to do something that this court in el capitan has already ruled against.because el capitan held that erisa preempts an action under section,storke contends an action under section is similarly preempted.in contrast,plaintiffs urge this court to declare that el capitan is no longer good law in light of subsequent federal high court decisions on erisa preemption,but also claim that el capitan is simply not applicable to cases arising under section.in order to address these claims,we begin with a discussion of erisa and its preemption clause.
erisa is a comprehensive federal statutory scheme designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.el capitan,supra,cal d at,citing shaw delta air lines,d shaw.it sets various uniform standards,including rules concerning reporting,disclosure,and fiduciary responsibility,for both pension and welfare plans.citations.shaw,supra,at.erisa preemption clause states,in pertinent part t he provisions of this subchapter shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section a of this title a,italics added.the basic thrust of the clause was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d travelers.
in its decision in shaw,the high court pronounced that a law relates to an employee benefit plan,in the normal sense of the phrase,if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.shaw,supra,at,fn.omitted.in a later case,the high court explained that to determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection,we look both to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive,travelers,supra,at,as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans,at.california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d dillingham holding california prevailing wage statute is not preempted by erisa.as to an impermissible reference,the high court concluded that w here a state law acts immediately and exclusively upon erisa plans,or where the existence of erisa plans is essential to the law operation,that reference will result in.dillingham,supra,at.
the high court has also held that state laws providing alternative enforcement mechanisms also relate to erisa plans,triggering.see mcclendon,d.travelers,supra,at.see also rush prudential hmo,moran,d rush prudential pilot life,supra,at.the policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that congress rejected in erisa the deliberate care with which erisa civil enforcement remedies in united states code section a were drafted and the balancing of policies embodied in its choice of remedies argue strongly for the conclusion that erisa civil enforcement remedies were intended to be exclusive.pilot life,supra,at.for example,the high court has held that a state law wrongful discharge action based on an employer motivation to avoid paying pension benefits,supra,at,and a state common law action based on improper processing of an erisa benefits claim pilot life,supra,at,both impermissibly conflicted with erisa enforcement scheme.
beginning with travelers,the united states supreme court has narrowed the scope of erisa preemption.travelers,supra,at.court must look beyond the unhelpful text of preemption clause dillingham,supra,at.following travelers de buono medical clinical services fund,d de buono same.while the high court recognized that erisa preemption clause a was clearly expansive,the court clarified that its relate to language was not intended to change the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law.travelers,supra,at.de buono,supra,at.
in other words,where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation,citation,we have worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.travelers,supra,at.de buono,supra,at.respondents have considerable burden of overcoming the starting presumption.the high court emphasized that p does not occur if the state law has only a tenuous,remote,or peripheral connection with covered plans,as is the case with many laws of general applicability.travelers,supra,at.
section provides that all persons and laborers of every class performing labor upon or bestowing skill or other necessary services on a work of improvement shall have a lien upon the property upon which they have bestowed labor for the value of such labor done whether done at the instance of the owner or of any person acting by his authority or under him as contractor or otherwise.our state constitution guarantees that laborers of every class shall have a lien upon the property upon which they have bestowed labor or furnished material for the value of such labor done and material furnished and the legislature shall provide,by law,for the speedy and efficient enforcement of such liens.cal,art.xiv.the mechanic lien is the only creditors remedy stemming from constitutional command and our courts have uniformly classified the mechanics lien laws as remedial legislation,to be liberally construed for the protection of laborers and materialmen.clarke safeco ins.cal th,d,clarke.even before our present constitution was adopted in,the first session of our state legislature enacted a mechanic lien law in.connolly development,superior court cal d,connolly.
in concluding that erisa did not preempt plaintiffs action,the court of appeal reasoned that section is a statute governing the payment of wages and thus,under federal case law,is the subject of traditional state regulation.noting that section does not refer to employee benefit trust funds,the court of appeal characterized the provision as a state law of general applicability that creates no rights or restrictions concerning the administration or funding of erisa plans.
under the rationale of travelers and dillingham,we agree with the court of appeal that erisa does not preempt plaintiffs action under section.the state statute does not relate to erisa plans.a.in other words,it does not make reference to or have a connection with erisa plans.see dillingham,supra,at.
unlike section,which we discuss further below,section is a mechanic lien law of general application and does not itself refer to erisa plans.see burch george cal th,d,no contest law is a neutral state law of general application that here would only tenuously affect an erisa plan,if at all.as noted,though the court of appeal did not address this,in the legislature amended the definition of laborer,which is referenced in section,to include an express trust fund,subd.b.the amendment to section,however,is intended to give effect to the public policy of this state to protect the entire compensation of laborers on works of improvements,regardless of the form in which that compensation is to be paid,subd.b.we conclude that section is not specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans.mackey lanier collection agency serv,d mackey.section does not act immediately and exclusively upon erisa plans,or is the existence of erisa plans essential to the law operation.dillingham,supra,at,italics added southern.trust standard indus.cir,standard industrial payment bond statute not necessarily limited to erisa plans no impermissible reference.this section is remedial legislation,to be liberally construed to protect the rights of laborers and materialmen in general.clarke,supra,cal th at,d.because section functions irrespective of the existence of an erisa plan,it does not make reference to erisa plans.dillingham,supra,at,quoting,supra,at.travelers,supra,at.
nor does section have a connection with erisa plans.dillingham,supra,at.travelers,supra,at.as a law of general applicability,section does not bind erisa plans to anything.dillingham,supra,at.this mechanic lien law permits laborers and other persons,who may include participants in erisa plans or the plans themselves,to obtain a lien to secure payment for their labor and materials.section effect on erisa plans,however,is indirect at most because it does not compel plans to function in a certain way.dillingham,supra,at.added inducement under,is not tantamount to a compulsion upon apprenticeship programs travelers,supra,at.surcharges under new york statute leave plan administrators right where they would be in any case,with the responsibility to choose the best overall coverage for the money.
the high court has explained that where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation,citation,we have worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.travelers,supra,at.as noted,california mechanic lien law derives from constitutional command cal,art.xiv,and dates back to.clarke,supra,cal th at,d,connolly,supra,cal d at.we have long recognized that it is within the state police power to provide for enforcement of liens for labor and materials.see roystone darling cal.storke fails to show that it was congress clear and manifest purpose travelers,supra,at,that erisa preempt our state mechanic lien laws.as the high court explained,we could not hold a state law in an area of traditional state regulation based on so tenuous a relation without doing grave violence to our presumption that congress intended nothing of the sort.dillingham,supra,at.see de buono,supra,at.describing types of state laws congress intended erisa to preempt.
storke,however,maintains that section is preempted because it constitutes an alternative enforcement mechanism to erisa.travelers,supra,at.pilot life,supra,at.see el capitan,supra,cal d at.in their section action,laborers seek to recover delinquent contribution benefits from storke,who is neither their employer nor a signatory to the agreement.storke contends this is impermissible under el capitan,supra,cal d at page,and is inconsistent with federal cases.see,eklecco iron workers union sec.funds cir,eklecco new york mechanic lien law preempted as an alternative enforcement mechanism bast prudential ins.of america cir,erisa preempts state law claims even if plaintiffs are left without a remedy crull gem ins.cir,fn.travelers does not signal a retreat from pilot life holding regarding the exclusive remedies of erisa.
pointing to this case factual similarities with el capitan,storke claims laborers are seeking to have alternate responsible who never entered into any contractual arrangement with the trust funds,the union,the individual employees,or the pay those contributions.for reasons that follow,we disagree that el capitan compels the conclusion that erisa preempts section.nor does a section lien action constitute an impermissible alternative enforcement mechanism for purposes of erisa preemption.
el capitan 
in el capitan,the employees were union members entitled to fringe benefit contributions under a collective bargaining agreement.after their employer failed to make contributions to the employees trust funds in excess of,the funds administrator recorded trust fund liens under former section against el capitan development company real property,on which the employees had performed work.the administrator alleged that because the unpaid contributions were due on account of work performed on el capitan property,section created liens on that property.el capitan,supra,cal d at.we held that the action under section was preempted under erisa a.el capitan,supra,cal d at.
in our decision,we recognized the broad scope of the key term,relate to,in erisa preemption clause a,based on congressional intent and high court decisions.el capitan,supra,cal d at.we concluded that a ll that is necessary to invoke erisa statutory preemption provision is that the state law in question relate to an erisa plan.id.at.the state law in question was section,which we concluded provid ed an additional method of funding,a lien against real property el capitan,supra,cal d at.
we determined that section relates to such plans by creating a mechanism for enforcing an employer contribution obligations that congress did not provide.el capitan,supra,cal d at.relying on pilot life,supra,d,and iron workers pension fund terotechnology cir,we emphasized that section was preempted because this provision purported to regulate erisa plans through a new cause of action or remedy not provided under erisa,the state lien laws.el capitan,supra,cal d at.the expectations that a federal common law of rights and obligations under plans would develop,would make little sense if the remedies available to erisa participants and beneficiaries under a could be supplemented or supplanted by varying state laws.el capitan,supra,cal d at,quoting pilot life,supra,at.this recognition that section if applied,would regulate the conditions under which the terms of an erisa plan might be enforced supported our conclusion that the section related to such plans and thus was preempted.el capitan,supra,cal d at.
we also rejected the argument that section was not preempted because it was a generally applicable mechanism for enforcing judgments.see mackey,supra.general state garnishment statute not preempted.we explained that s ection gives a trust fund a right to a lien against the property of third parties,such as el capitan,that the fund would not,and does not,have under erisa therefore,section can not be upheld under mackey as it creates a new substantive right against the property of a third party that is not created by erisa and,thus,goes beyond being a mere means of enforcing a judgment.el capitan,supra,cal d at.we also rejected the contention that section only affected an employee benefit plan in a tenuous,remote,or peripheral manner rather,the provision had the substantive effect of making an additional entity liable to the trust fund for contributions.el capitan,supra,cal d at.
contrary to storke contention,el capitan does not compel the conclusion that section is preempted.in that decision,we explained the differences between sections and,though both provide mechanic lien remedies.el capitan,supra,cal d at fn.we stated that in contrast to persons seeking a mechanic lien remedy under section,erisa plans do not provide labor and materials for a construction project.el capitan,supra,cal d at.but because section would treat erisa plans the same as persons who provide labor and materials by giving these plans a mechanic lien remedy unavailable under erisa,we concluded section would single out erisa plans for special treatment and thus relates to these plans.el capitan,supra,cal d at,mackey,supra,at.
though we recognized in el capitan that by providing a new cause of action or remedy section purported to regulate erisa plans el capitan,supra,cal d at,our holding that section was preempted relied heavily on the fact that the section is designed to affect erisa plans specifically.el capitan,supra,cal d at.we observed that the high court has virtually taken it for granted that state laws which are specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans are under a,quoting mackey,supra,at.we emphasized that unlike section,s ection is specifically for the use of express trust funds established pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.el capitan,supra,cal d at,fn.
we conclude that section does not constitute an alternative enforcement mechanism subject to erisa preemption.see fidelity,supra,see also standard industrial,supra.in fidelity,the first circuit court of appeals held that a massachusetts bond a general contractor to post a bond to secure payment for a subcontractor fringe benefit not preempted by erisa.after noting the changed legal landscape of erisa preemption jurisprudence fidelity,supra,at,fidelity concluded the bond statute did not constitute an alternative enforcement mechanism those state laws which touch upon enforcement but have no real bearing on the intricate web of relationships among the principal players in the erisa scenario,the plan,the administrators,the fiduciaries,the beneficiaries,and the employer are not subject to preemption on this basis.citation.it follows that a state statute which only creates claims against a surety does not constitute an impermissible alternative enforcement mechanism as that term is used in erisa jurisprudence.id.at.fidelity deemed the state bond statute a law of general applicability id.at,and recognized the statute regulates an area of the law traditionally thought to be the states preserve enforcing contracts under state law for the citizenry protection.citations.id.at.
likewise,we conclude that section is a statute that has no real bearing on the intricate web of relationships among the principal players in the erisa scenario fidelity,supra,at.as a remedial statute of general applicability,section does not regulate the relationship between erisa plans and participants or beneficiaries.see ante,d at,at.plaintiffs here are laborers and their union that seek to secure a mechanic lien on storke real property for full payment for their labor.they are neither suing or being sued in an effort to enforce the terms of an erisa plan.see laborers trust funds maui prince hotel,maui prince hotel state lien law not preempted because it merely provides a remedy available to a certain class of creditors that transcends erisa obligations and concerns.neither the plan,nor its administration and management,nor the benefits it provides,are implicated except insofar as it may be the recipient of any amounts recovered under the lien.to the extent the mechanic lien remedy could be interpreted as regulating relationships between an erisa plan and a third party,the relationships are too tenuous,remote,or peripheral to be preempted by erisa.standard industrial,supra,at.
the high court decision in mackey,supra,further helps distinguish this case from el capitan.while the high court held that georgia general garnishment law was not preempted,it concluded that the state antigarnishment provision that expressly referred to,and applied solely to,erisa employee benefit plans was subject to erisa preemption.mackey,supra,at.the antigarnishment provision protected erisa welfare benefit plans,but not plans,from garnishment.id.at fn.as the high court explained,it is this singling out that the state statute.id.at,fn.on the other hand,the court concluded the general garnishment law was among those methods for collecting money judgments that must,as a general matter,remain undisturbed by erisa otherwise,there would be no way to enforce such a judgment won against an erisa plan.id.at.
storke asserts that the multiplicity and inconsistency of the lien laws from state to state,and the variety of conditions that they impose on employers,their benefit plans and third parties are precisely the burdens that congress intended for erisa preemption provision to avoid.we are unpersuaded.first,storke fails to identify any specific material differences between our state lien law and any from other jurisdictions.second,and more importantly,the high court has explained that a state law that increases the cost of providing benefits to covered employees will have some effect on the administration of erisa plans,but that simply can not mean that every state law with such an effect is by the federal statute.de buono,supra,at,fn.omitted.
d.other decisions 
several cases from other jurisdictions have reached conclusions different from ours.see,eklecco,supra,at lien statute making property owner liable for employer erisa contributions preempted as alternative enforcement mechanism plumbing industry bd.howell,cir,plumbing industry bd.same ibew trig elect.const,trig public works lien statute making third party contractor liable for erisa contributions preempted as alternative funding mechanism for the erisa plans but see maui prince hotel,supra,at neutral and general mechanic and materialman lien statute not preempted.as one court observed,because the state law impermissibly adds to the exclusive list of parties erisa holds responsible for an employer benefit obligations,it can not stand.plumbing industry,supra,at.however,we find these cases to be inapposite.
although these cases recognized the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law in areas of traditional state regulation
