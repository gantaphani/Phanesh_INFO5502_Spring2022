background 
adamson was a participant in an employee benefit plan sponsored by her employer,micron technology,micron.unum contracted with micron to provide the group term life insurance portion of the plan.adamson applied and paid premiums for coverage on adamson and no evidence of insurability no evidence coverage was required.on july,adamson requested an additional coverage for adamson,which if approved would result in an aggregate of of coverage.the policy contained a provision for double payment for accidental death.the no evidence coverage for adamson became effective on september.
this supplemental insurance request required evidence of insurability as well as an additional premium.as part of the underwriting process,the adamsons completed and signed an evidence of insurability and application for lifestyle protection on august.unum maintains it sent a september,letter albeit with the wrong zip code to adamson requesting that she contact a paramedic company to obtain a blood chemistry profile,urinalysis,and other information on adamson as part of the underwriting process.adamson contends that she did not receive this letter.at.adamson was killed in a construction accident at his home on october.adams filed a claim for payment of of benefits on november.unum paid under the policy half represented the no evidence of insurability portion,half represented the double payment upon accidental death,but declined her claim for an additional for failure to provide the required evidence of insurability.according to unum policy,if the employee did not submit the required evidence within days of the insurer request,the claim for the higher coverage amount was deemed no longer desired by adamson and the file was closed.see.at.
adamson brought suit in utah state court on various state law claims.unum removed the case to federal court,and successfully urged erisa preemption.adamson was allowed to amend her complaint to allege erisa claims,and she did so alleging a wrongful denial of benefits under a b and a breach of fiduciary duty under a.in,the district court granted unum summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary claim,but denied summary judgment on the wrongful denial of benefits claim.
the district court requested briefing,and subsequently issued an order remanding the case to the plan order to determine how much premium had been paid for adamson coverage,and allow adamson the opportunity to submit additional information on the issue.unum conducted additional discovery and concluded that adamson claim should be denied because she only paid premiums applicable to the level of benefits.adamson appealed.in,the district court granted unum summary judgment on adamson wrongful denial of benefits claim.this appeal followed.
discussion 
when the district court grants a motion for summary judgment,our review is de novo,see anderson liberty lobby,d,and we apply the same standards as the district court.zurich am.matrix service,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issue of material fact exists,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in erisa cases,our review is confined to the administrative record.sandoval aetna life cas.ins,cir.
where,as here,an erisa plan grants a plan administrator or a delegate discretion in interpreting the terms of,and determining the grant of benefits under,the plan,we are required to uphold the decision unless arbitrary and capricious.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.in applying the arbitrary and capricious standard,the decision will be upheld so long as it is predicated on a reasoned basis.kimber thiokol,cir.in fact,there is no requirement that the basis relied upon be the only logical one or even the superlative one.see also nance sun life assur.of canada,cir.accordingly,our review inquires whether the administrator decision resides somewhere on a continuum of if on the low end.kimber,at internal quotation omitted.
a lack of substantial evidence often indicates an arbitrary and capricious decision.caldwell life ins.of,cir.substantial evidence is of the sort that a reasonable mind could accept as sufficient to support a conclusion.id.substantial evidence means more than a scintilla,of course,yet less than a preponderance.sandoval,at.the substantiality of the evidence is evaluated against the backdrop of the administrative record as a whole.caldwell,at.
we do note that where a standard conflict of interest exists,the plan administrator decision is entitled to less deference,and the standard conflict is regarded as one factor in determining whether the plan administrator denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious.fought unum life ins.of,cir.as we understand her argument,adamson claims that an additional reduction in deference is appropriate given an inherent conflict of interest.aplt.br.at.she argues that under this approach,unum has the burden to prove the reasonableness of its decision,with this court taking a hard look at unum rationale in denying benefits.we think that this approach neglects an essential prerequisite to invoking the burden shifting approach based on a conflict of interest.some proof supplied by the claimant must identify a conflict that could plausibly jeopardize the plan administrator impartiality.see fought,at kimber,at.
unum acknowledges that,at first blush,a conflict appears to exist because unum is both the insurer and the administrator indeed,in circumstances where an insurer doubles as the plan administrator,we have enunciated that there is an inherent conflict of interest between its discretion in paying claims and the need to stay financially sound.pitman blue cross blue shield of,cir see also fought,at welch unum life ins.of,cir.it might be just as easily observed that an insurer has an incentive to pay claims and to get it right so as to avoid dissatisfaction from plans as customers and lawsuits.whatever the merits concerning the potential motivation of an insurer doubling as a plan administrator,such observations were never meant to be an ipso facto conclusive presumption to be applied without regard to the facts of the the solvency of the insurer or the nature or size of the claim.the fact that unum administered and insured the group term life insurance portion of this plan does not on its own warrant a further reduction in deference.
unum is correct in contending that the issue about the underlying claim in this premium amounts paid by goes to the appropriate level of coverage to which adamson was entitled.this case is not about whether an insured loss course it did,for that issue was resolved by unum in adamson favor.rather,this case turns on data furnished by micron as the employer under a policy,one where the employer accounts for the number of employees,the amount of coverage,and the premium owed and forwards that information to unum.withholding and reporting decisions are made by micron,not unum.although that data must be applied against the plan provisions,we are at a loss in apprehending a conflict,particularly given the almost ministerial role of unum in these circumstances.though we discern no basis for applying any other than a pure arbitrary and capricious standard in this case we apply the standard conflict sliding scale of deference in accordance with our precedent.
in applying this standard of review,we conside
