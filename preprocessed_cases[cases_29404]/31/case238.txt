janet krizek suffers from a mysterious ailment,which has perplexed numerous doctors for several years.despite undergoing a multitude of tests and medical evaluations,krizek has been unable to find a definitive diagnosis for her condition.krizek symptoms have worsened through the years,causing severe pain,fatigue,and other problems and eventually forcing her to cease working.she brings the instant litigation under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,against insurance company of north america ina,sued as cigna group insurance.she challenges ina determination that she was ineligible for benefits pursuant to a group disability policy the plan,which ina issued to her former employer,cornell university.after holding a bench trial and conducting a de novo review of the administrative record,the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue,concluded that krizek is not entitled to disability benefits because she is not totally disabled within the meaning of the plan.
while we agree with the district court decision to restrict its review to the record before the plan administrator because of krizek failure to show good cause warranting an expansion of the record,we are troubled by several aspects of the court decision.despite professing to review only the administrative record,the district court relied heavily on evidence that was not part of the administrative record.the court also committed three clear errors of fact in assessing krizek subjective complaints of pain.because we are unable to determine the impact of these errors on the court ruling,we vacate the judgment and remand on the merits and,if appropriate,on the issue of attorney fees.see infra section iii.
background 
krizek medical problems 
krizek began working as a laboratory technician at cornell in.over the course of her employment,krizek duties increased to the point where she managed a research laboratory,supervised graduate students,helped conduct experiments,conducted repeat experiments to confirm results,and performed various administrative duties in the laboratory.krizek often worked overtime when the job required.
beginning in or,krizek,at the time in her late,began to experience fatigue and muscle aches.krizek recalls that this fatigue and pain gradually became more severe and developed into more serious problems,including memory loss,progressive hearing loss,impaired sense of taste and smell,sleeping difficulty,hypertension,and increased sensitivity to ultraviolet rays.krizek claims that these problems significantly interfered with her ability to perform her job.for instance,her hearing difficulty inhibited her ability to talk on the phone,while her memory problems caused her to forget passwords,entry codes,and even people name.
in the years that followed,krizek visited numerous doctors and tried a multitude of medications,but few answers were found on april,krizek primary care physician,alan midura,concluded that she should go on total disability at this point until her symptoms improve or a more definite working diagnosis can be established and treatment adjusted.thomas bunch of the mayo clinic also stated in his report that krizek condition is interfering with her life and she ca work.otherwise,krizek medical evaluations revealed minimal conclusive diagnoses as to the nature of her illness,the cause of her symptoms,or solutions for alleviating them.for instance,one physician speculated that krizek may suffer from an autoimmune disorder such as lupus or mixed connective tissue disease,or possibly sarcoid,while two doctors have suspected that she had sjogren syndrome,but no physician was able to say with any certainty.cat scans,mris,and other physical and neurological examinations likewise failed to indicate any enlightening abnormalities.krizek attempts at physical therapy only made her pain worse,and pain medications did little to relieve the pain.
on september,krizek applied for social security benefits and,on february,the social security administration adjudged krizek disabled as of april.accordingly,krizek was awarded to cover the applicable preceding period and per month for the future.
ii.ina denial of total disability benefits 
krizek claim for total disability benefits was based upon the plan total disability provision,which states a n employee will be considered totally disabled if because of injury or sickness,he is unable to perform all the essential duties of any occupation for which he is or may reasonably become qualified based on his education,training or experience.the plan further defines disabilities considered to result from sickness as those disabilities which result directly or indirectly from sickness or infection,except an infection resulting from an accidental cut or wound or are caused by hernia or injuries resulting in hernia.
ina referred krizek to the healthsouth rehabilitation center for a functional capacity examination fce conducted on october.the fce concluded that krizek is capable of working at a light level for a four to day and at a sedentary level for an day.on december,regain disability management services performed a transferable skills analysis,which identified various alternative occupations for krizek in light of the fce and krizek educational background,work history,training,and medical restrictions.
in a letter dated january,ina denied krizek claim,explaining that the medical information contained in krizek file does not support an impairment which causes total disability as defined in the plan.the letter relied upon the results of the fce,which concluded that krizek was capable of working in a sedentary work demand level per the dictionary of occupational titles for an eight hour day.the letter also conveyed the list of alternative occupations identified in the transferable skills analysis.
krizek appealed this denial on march.her appeal consisted of a detailed letter,which she claims was written with her husband assistance,reviewing the extensive history of her illness and explaining why her disability precludes alternative occupations.attached to this appeal were letters from family members,her former employer,and other individuals further explaining krizek deteriorating physical condition,as well as the social security administration letter finding her to be disabled within the meaning of its rules.
ina rejected krizek appeal on may.the rejection letter emphasized the absence of objective medical evidence demonstrating cognitive dysfunction or physical incapability.ina further explained that krizek own observations and the letters from her friends,and her family members can be construed as subjective in nature and therefore do not balance out the objective medical findings.
iii.proceedings before the district court 
on october,krizek filed a complaint in new york supreme court,tompkins county,seeking payment of all benefits accrued and unpaid,an order designating krizek as an eligible participant under the plan qualifying her for benefits as they become due,and her attorney fees.on november,the defendant filed a notice of removal,which resulted in transfer to the united states district court for the northern district of new york.
the district court held a bench trial on september,during which the parties were permitted to introduce evidence outside the administrative record.in a decision dated september,the district court ruled in favor of the defendant.despite its admission at trial of evidence outside the record,the court limited its review to the administrative record because of krizek failure to establish any of the conditions necessary to expand its review.the court noted,however,that even if it were to consider the expanded record,its conclusion would be the same.in conducting its de novo review,the court refused to give heightened weight to the determination by midura,krizek primary care physician,that she was totally disabled and to the social security administration finding that krizek was disabled.the court then considered the objective evidence of krizek disability,observing that t he medical evidence in the record contains little objective evidence regarding her disability,and almost uniformly indicates that the examinations and diagnostic testing of plaintiff yielded essentially normal or unremarkable results.the court also relied on the fce,which concluded that krizek should be able to work at the light level for four to five hours per day or at the sedentary level for eight hours per day.after concluding that the objective medical findings do not warrant a determination that plaintiff is unable to perform the essential duties of any occupation,the court turned to krizek subjective complaints.the court ultimately decided not to credit krizek complaints regarding her pain,fatigue,and other symptoms,explaining that her subjective claims were belied by her work with the special olympics,her preparation of a detailed appeal of ina denial of benefits,and her competence on direct and cross examination at trial.
discussion 
evidence outside administrative record 
krizek argues that the district court erred in limiting its review to the record before the claims administrator.although the court admitted at trial evidence that was not before the administrator,the court did not consider this additional evidence in reaching its decision.krizek maintains that the court instead should have expanded its review to consider this evidence because the plan administrator operated under a conflict of interest.krizek argues that,because ina,the underwriting company,is a subsidiary of cigna,the entity determining eligibility for benefits was also the company that would have ultimately paid those benefits.

our case law requires a demonstrated conflict of interest,defelice,at emphasis added,which places an affirmative burden on the plaintiff to establish that the plan administrator was sufficiently conflicted so as to expand the administrative record as conceded by appellant counsel at oral argument,however,the issue of conflict was never raised before the district court.indeed,the court expressly based its decision not to expand the record on this failure to produce evidence establishing a conflicted administrator,concluding that plaintiff has introduced no evidence demonstrating this alleged conflict,nor has plaintiff made any specific argument,or indicated where,if anywhere,in the administrative record,this conflict of interest is illustrated.accordingly,the court has no basis upon which to assess whether a conflict of interests exists.we agree with this conclusion.krizek failure to offer evidence showing a conflict,and even to argue that a conflict existed,precluded expansion of the court review on conflict grounds.krizek suggests that ina conceded the existence of a conflict by not objecting to the admission of additional evidence beyond the record.ina failure to object,however,did not relieve krizek of her affirmative burden to demonstrate a conflict because there was no basis for expanding its review on conflict of interest grounds,the district court did not abuse its discretion by limiting its review to the administrative record

the administrative record contained both objective and subjective evidence concerning krizek disability.the objective evidence consisted of reports prepared by the legion of physicians who have examined krizek in recent years,as well as results from examinations such as the fce.the subjective evidence included krizek explanation of her condition and supporting letters from her past employer at cornell,family members,colleagues with the special olympics,and a friend,attesting to krizek descent into disability.for reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court made one error of law and three clear errors of fact in evaluating this subjective evidence.
consideration of evidence outside administrative record 
as we concluded above,the district court did not abuse its discretion in confining its review to the record before the plan administrator.indeed,expanding the record would have been inappropriate in this case because krizek made no showing of good cause.see defelice,at stating that a district court discretion to admit additional evidence beyond the administrative record ought not to be exercised in the absence of good cause.
despite its claim to the contrary,the district court expressly considered evidence that was not before the plan administrator in arriving at its holding.the court cited as evidence which indicates that plaintiff condition is not totally disabling the fact that krizek testified for nearly an hour during the trial of this matter she was articulate,was able to recall with specificity the events leading up to and surrounding this case,was poised on revealing no mental distress,was able to answer questions and follow directions,and could read documentary evidence.the court later reasoned that it can not over look sic the fact that plaintiff revealed no physical distress whatsoever during her testimony before the court.obviously,the administrative record did not contain any evidence pertaining to krizek subsequent demeanor and performance while testifying at trial nor are we convinced that this evidence was inconsequential to the district court analysis.by the court own admission,the court was not able to over look sic krizek ability to testify competently at trial when it rejected her subjective complaints.
krizek work with the special olympics 
among the evidence which the district court concluded indicates that plaintiff condition is not totally disabling was krizek ability to attend and chair regular special olympics committee meetings.the court similarly rejected krizek subjective claim that she would be incapable of performing the essential duties of any other occupation because of her pain and fatigue because,inter alia,at the time of the appeal,she was the special olympics area coordinator,able to attend and chair regular special olympics meetings.krizek ability to perform these roles,the court suggested,undercut her claim regarding the severity of her pain,fatigue,and other symptoms.
the district court decision not to credit krizek pain complaints in part because of her work with the special olympics is a
