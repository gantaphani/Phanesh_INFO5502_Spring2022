the appellant,sara lee corporation,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for the appellee,frank mello.the district court applied and found that because mello,a sara lee employee,relied on the oral assurances of a company executive and on monthly pension statements to determine the value of his pension,sara lee was estopped from correcting a clerical error that reduced the amount of his expected benefits significantly.because mello could not have reasonably relied on informal communications to modify or supersede unambiguous plan terms,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for mello and dismiss the cause of action as a matter of law.
facts and proceedings 
on september,frank mello began working for bil mar foods.in,sara lee acquired bil mar foods,which became an operating division of sara lee.although sara lee had a benefit pension plan,bil mar foods executives,including mello,were not permitted to join sara lee pension plan until.until that time,bil mar maintained its own retirement plan,in which mello participated from to and from which he remains entitled to receive benefits.in october of,sara lee asked mello to transfer from bil mar foods to bryan foods,another division of sara lee.
a disagreement arose between mello and sara lee over whether mello pension benefits should be calculated using a hire date of september,or october.if the former date is used,mello is entitled to each month in pension benefits if the latter date is used,he will only receive a month.mello avers that lee kramer a sara lee,encouraged him to transfer and repeatedly assured him that his credited service date would remain september.
bryan foods recorded mello hire date on the rate card in his personnel file as october.however,the original hire date on his personnel forms was september.from to,mello received six annual benefit statements from sara lee.each benefit estimate included a disclaimer regarding the accuracy of the content therein,and instructed the recipient to defer to the terms of sara lee pension plan.each statement listed mello hire date and credited service date as september.the statements reflected monthly benefits ranging from in to in.in december,mello wife,who also works at sara lee,received an electronic version of her annual benefits while mello did not.when mello inquired about his missing statement,he received a pension estimate letter,which stated that his credited service date was october,and his monthly benefits were approximately.
mello spoke with several sara lee officials in hopes of reinstating his previously quoted monthly benefits amount.sara lee human resources department explained that under the terms of sara lee pension plan,his credited service date was the date he transferred to bryan october.according to mello,the president of bryan foods and sara lee vice president of human resources both assured him that the reduction in benefits was an injustice that could be rectified by appealing to the corporation.sara lee avers that the vice president,karen walker,merely reiterated that mello credited service date was in because bil mar foods was not a participating employer in the plan at the time of his transfer and provided him with information regarding appeal procedures.on april,mello appealed to the erisa appeal committee,which denied his petition.the committee found that mello was not entitled to credited service for his years of employment with bil mar foods.
in october,mello filed suit against sara lee and the sara lee pension plan collectively sara lee for benefits under erisa a b.both parties filed for summary judgment.on may,the district court granted summary judgment against sara lee.it reasoned that because the fifth circuit has not soundly rejected the applicability of erisa estoppel,and because allowing erisa estoppel use in the instant case would best comport with the basic policies undergirding erisa itself,to ensure the security of employee income and retirement benefits,the doctrine of erisa estoppel is applicable in this cause of action.applying the three elements of erisa estoppel,the court found that the erroneous benefits estimates qualified as material misrepresentations,mello reasonably and detrimentally relied on these representations in making his employment and retirement decisions,and mello claim involved extraordinary circumstances in that his employer,through written benefit statements and officers oral statements,repeatedly assured mello over a period that he was entitled to a monthly amount that was an extraordinary overstatement.after mello refused to take any job offers during the company reorganization in and,his position was eliminated and he negotiated a severance agreement.sara lee now appeals the district court order granting mello summary judgment on his erisa claim 
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.hodges delta airlines,cir en banc.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.
the parties dispute whether the committee denial of mello claim should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.challenges to an erisa plan administrator denial of benefits are reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.if the plan does grant such discretion,courts review decisions for abuse of discretion.mccall burlington fe,cir.section of the plan states that the sara lee corporation employee benefits administrative committee has discretionary powers,rights,and duties t o determine all questions arising under the plan,including the power to determine the rights or eligibility of employees or participants and t o enforce the plan in accordance with its terms 
because the application of is a legal theory rather than an interpretation of the plan terms,it should be reviewed de novo.see rhorer raytheon eng rs and const rs,cir izzarelli rexene prods,cir noting that in contrast to the great deference we grant the administrator interpretations of the plan,which involve contract interpretation,we accord no deference to its conclusions as to the controlling law quotations and citation omitted.furthermore,the committee made no finding as to whether the equities of the situation required sara lee to honor any representations it may have made to mello.because mello estoppel claim is not a review of a decision of the committee,the district court properly exercised de novo review.
iii.discussion 
erisa preempts state laws that relate to an employee benefit plan because congress was concerned that state laws might interfere with the administration and management of such plans.shaw delta air lines,d.in light of such preemption,courts are to develop a federal common law of rights and obligations under plans.firestone tire,at.quoting pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.
this circuit has yet to explicitly adopt as a cognizable legal theory in the past,we have considered that the theory could be cognizable given the right set of facts.mccall,at cir weir fed.asset disposition ass n,cir.we now join other circuits in explicitly adopting as a cognizable theory.to establish an claim,the plaintiff must establish a material misrepresentation reasonable and detrimental reliance upon the representation and extraordinary circumstances.mccall,at weir,at.
material misrepresentation 
sara lee concedes that it erred as to the amount mello benefit statements reflected that he was due upon retirement.sara lee argues,however,that these errors do not constitute material misrepresentations because the benefit statements are informal communications that can not be used to amend the plan.in other words,sara lee contends that representations are material only if they are in an official plan document.sara lee also argues that materiality is not in
