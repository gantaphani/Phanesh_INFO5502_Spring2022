this case concerns,among other issues,the standard of review to be applied by courts in reviewing a decision by the administrator of a pension plan governed by erisa,the employee retirement income security act of,stat,as amended,et.as is commonly the case,the documents for the plan involved in this case gave the plan administrator discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan,which ordinarily means that a decision by the plan administrator is subject to review by a court for abuse of discretion,under firestone tire rubber bruch,d,and metropolitan life ins.glenn,d metlife.the plan in question here is a top hat plan,an unfunded plan that is limited to key executives of the sponsoring company.that fact has led some courts to conclude that a plan administrator decisions should be subject to de novo review.in the circumstances of this case,though,notably the fact that there was no financial conflict of interest that influenced the administrator to favor one result over another,we conclude that our review should be for abuse of discretion.
defendant bancorp amended and restated supplemental benefits plan appeals the district court entry of summary judgment directing the plan to treat plaintiff franciene sznewajs as a designated surviving spouse beneficiary.franciene is the of robert sznewajs a former executive employee of bancorp covered by the plan.the plan had concluded that robert second wife,virginia,should be treated as his survivor beneficiary,a determination held improper by the district court.applying the abuse of discretion standard of review,we conclude that the plan administrator interpretation was permissible and should be affirmed.accordingly,we reverse and remand the district court judgment with instructions for the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of the plan.
background 
as an employee covered by bancorp plan for top executives,robert had the option to select a single life annuity or a joint and survivor annuity.under a single life annuity,payments would be made monthly to him as long as he lived but no payments would be made to anyone after his death.under a joint and survivor annuity,the amount of the monthly payments would be smaller,but if his wife lived longer than he did,payments to her would continue after his death.the total present value of the benefits was intended to be the same either way.the specific amount of the monthly payments would be determined by an actuarial calculation that took into account his selection and also the remaining life expectancy of that of his wife,if he chose a survivor on their ages at the time that payments started.robert opted for a joint and survivor annuity.his election,on a form signed by him,did not identify the name of his spouse.
robert resigned from bancorp in december and took a position with another bank.at that time robert was years old.although he was no longer employed by the company,robert did not start to receive benefits then,because the plan provides that payments do not start until after the beneficiary both ceases to be an employee of the company and turns.
at the time he left bancorp,robert was married to franciene,although they had been separated for over a year.robert and franciene were divorced in february,eight months before robert birthday.the divorce followed a dissolution proceeding in minnesota state court dividing the couple assets.pursuant to the divorce decree,franciene is entitled to fifty percent of any annuity payments robert receives under the plan.
in august of that same year,robert married virginia sznewajs.in october,he turned,and in november,he started receiving monthly annuity benefits,the value of which the plan calculated based on the life expectancies of robert and virginia.
in april,franciene filed a claim with the plan requesting that it recognize her,and not virginia,as robert designated survivor.this request was based on her interpretation of the term retirement as used in the plan.
the relevant provision is section a of the plan,which describes the time and manner of payment of benefits under a joint and survivor annuity as 
an actuarial equivalent reduced monthly benefit for life to the participant payable to the survivor designated at retirement,if then living,for life after the death of the participant if the designated survivor dies before the participant retires,then the participant shall select another survivor within days.except for death of the survivor the participant shall have no power to name a new survivor if the designated survivor dies after the participant retires but before the participant dies,then payments will continue to the participant in the same reduced amount and another survivor can not be selected.
emphasis added.
franciene contended that retirement in this context meant the date of robert termination of employment with bancorp when robert was still married to franciene rather than the date benefits commenced when virginia was robert wife.the plan administrator rejected franciene interpretation and denied her claim,deciding that virginia had properly been identified because she was robert wife at the time that he started collecting benefits and the amount of the monthly payment was calculated.franciene appealed this decision internally,but without success.
franciene then filed this action in arizona state court.the plan removed the case to the federal district court and interpleaded robert and virginia.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of franciene,concluding that the plan administrator abused its discretion by interpreting the term retirement in a manner contrary to the plan plain language and to the term ordinary meaning.the court ordered the plan to treat franciene as the designated survivor.it also ordered that the amount of robert monthly payment be recalculated based on franciene as the survivor beneficiary rather than virginia.because franciene was older than virginia,for actuarial purposes her life expectancy was not as long,so the amount of the monthly payment was increased.specifically,the court ordered that the monthly payment to robert be increased to,both prospectively and retroactively to november.
the plan timely appealed.
ii.standard of review of the district court decision 
this appeal involves two different standards of review one applying to our review of the district court decision,and the other concerning the standard that applies to court review of the erisa plan administrator decision.
as for the first,we review de novo a district court decision to grant or deny summary judgment.bergt retirement plan for pilots employed by markair,cir.we also review de novo a district court choice and application of the appropriate standard for reviewing benefits decisions by an erisa plan administrator.pannebecker liberty life assurance of boston,cir.
iii.standard of review of the plan administrator decision 
the appropriate standard for review by a court of the administrator decision is one of the disputed legal issues in this case,though we do not believe,in the end,that it determines the outcome.because the issue arises in many erisa benefit cases,however,it merits some discussion.
like many,perhaps most,benefit plans covered by erisa,this plan grants the plan administrator authority to interpret and apply the terms of the plan.section confers upon the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of this plan,and seeks to limit t he scope of any subsequent review,judicial or otherwise,to a determination as to whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily or capriciously in the exercise of its discretion.
drawing from principles of trust law,the supreme court has held that where an erisa plan does not provide otherwise,a court should apply a de novo standard of review to a plan benefits determination,under which the court should grant no deference to the plan decision.see metlife.at firestone,at.when a plan grants the plan administrator discretionary authority to construe the plan terms,however,the appropriate standard of review is for abuse of discretion,with any confl
