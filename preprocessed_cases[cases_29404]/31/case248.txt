we consider several questions in this case,including whether any genuine issues of material fact exist that preclude summary judgment on the calculation of plaintiffs pension benefits whether plaintiffs allege a viable claim of promissory estoppel and whether plaintiffs are entitled to a lump sum payment of pension benefits.
plaintiffs alfred and marie perreca timely appeal from a judgment entered september,by the united states district court for the southern district of new york ronald ellis,magistrate judge,with the consent of the parties pursuant to c granting defendants motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiffs for summary judgment.
plaintiffs brought this action against defendants seeking money damages for their alleged violation of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,as amended,et.am.compl.at.plaintiffs alleged that defendants wrongfully denied alfred perreca perreca the correct amount of his pension by calculating it from february,instead of august,despite the express terms of the retirement plan and in breach of a promise that defendant michael gluck gluck allegedly made to perreca in denied perreca the possibility of receiving his benefits in a lump sum payment,in an attempt to single him out for negative treatment and caused perreca to lose income from to because he retired early based on his expectation that he would receive larger pension benefits.id 
in a september,opinion order,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment granted defendants for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs for summary judgment.perreca gluck,wl,at.addressing plaintiffs claim that perreca was denied the correct amount of his pension,the district court first noted that there was no written documentation of defendant gluck alleged oral promise to perreca in that perreca pension benefits would accrue from august,promise which would have resulted in pension contributions for perreca during a period august,april when perecca employer,sternberger motor corporation sternberger,had paid union benefits for perecca.see id.at.in addition,the district court observed that t he language of the pension plan is quite clear that employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement are not covered under the pension plan.thus,perreca should have realized that such a promise would be illegal any reliance on perreca part therefore was unreasonable.id.at.the district court also recalled that the documents perreca received over the years listing his expected benefits as accruing from august,included the disclaimer that a ctual benefits are,of course,subject to verification before any payments are authorized.id.
on plaintiffs claim for a lump sum payment,the district court stated that at the time of perreca retirement on february,receiving pension benefits in a lump sum payment was subject to committee approval.when he retired,perecca did not request a lump sum payment.id.at.the court noted that his request in for a lump sum payment was based on a typographical error in a summary of the pension plan for which a replacement page correcting the typographical error was mailed to employees.id.moreover,the district court found that even if perreca had not received the corrected page in,he can not prevail because the error occurred nine years after he retired.he could not have relied upon it at the time of this retirement.id.in addition,the district court concluded that because perreca never sought lump sum payment of his benefits until,he could not claim that he had been singled out in any way.id.
with respect to plaintiffs lost income claim,the district court held that perreca may not recover under erisa for extra contractual damages.id.at citing.mut.life ins.russell,d.

calculation of perreca pension benefits 
a genuine issue of material fact exists as to when perreca was promoted to night manager,thereby automatically terminating his union membership 
the date that perreca was promoted to night manager is a pivotal and disputed factual issue in this case.
on the date that perreca was elevated to management,he would have automatically ceased to be a member of the fact that is conceded by both plaintiffs and defendants see perreca aff.of,gluck dep.at no longer been subject to the union collective bargaining agreement perreca aff.of,and become eligible to participate in the sternberger plan see perreca aff.of,ex,under either plaintiffs or defendants interpretation of the plan,which are discussed at section.post.accordingly,determination of perreca promotion date will affect this case in two ways.first,under plaintiffs interpretation of the express terms of the sternberger plan,if perreca membership in the union ended prior to january,the effective date of the plan perreca aff.of,ex,he is entitled to have his pension benefits calculated from august,the date that he became employed by sternberger.appellants br.at.second,even if a jury were to find that under the express terms of the plan,perreca is not entitled to company pension benefits calculated from august,he still may be entitled to company pension benefits calculated from january,the effective date of the sternberger plan,in contrast to the starting date asserted by defendants.
the date that perreca was promoted to night manager is a disputed issue,with both parties submitting sworn testimony and written records to support their respective claims.perreca swears in an affidavit that he was promoted to night manager at sternberger in.perreca supplemental aff.of.he recalls this with certainty because that was the year that his two sons became ill with respiratory infections,requiring perreca to be more available to assist with their care.id.as a result,perreca requested that sternberger no longer assign him to driving routes out of town.id.in response,sternberger promoted perreca to night manager so that he could work.id.to substantiate his claim that he was promoted in,perreca relies upon medical bills and receipts retained from his sons treatments that bear dates from february through june id.perreca attaches this evidence to his affidavit in support of his claim.see,ex.at.
in turn,gluck agrees that perreca was promoted to night manager in response to his request to be assigned locally due to his sons illnesses.gluck dep.at.however,on august,gluck testified that the promotion occurred in.id.later,in an affidavit dated december,he swore that perreca was promoted in.gluck aff.gluck offers no reason for his change of testimony and no reason as to why,over thirty years after the fact,or stands out in his mind as the year of perreca promotion.in addition,defendants have not produced perreca personnel and payroll plaintiffs though gluck testified that these records likely would reveal the date perreca was promoted to night manager gluck dep.at and that he was not aware of any of sternberger personnel files having been discarded id.at.rather,gluck december,affidavit claims that defendants have not located any records from the or which relate to these topics.gluck aff.
in place of the direct evidence that perreca employment records would provide,defendants point to union records indicating that sternberger paid into the union pension plan on behalf of perreca until april halbardier,ex.u at.while defendants suggest that this indicates that perreca was a union member until april,it is also possible that,due to an administrative oversight,sternberger neglected to stop contributing to the union pension plan when perreca was promoted years earlier and as a result of this inaccurate bookkeeping,failed to pay into the sternberger plan on behalf of perreca even though he was a member of the plan.moreover,even if we assume for the sake of argument that the union records accurately reflect that perreca was a union member until april,there then appears to be no explanation for the date asserted by defendants of february,as the starting date of perecca membership in the sternberger plan see halbardier,ex.y.the absence of any objective support in the record to date for the february,starting date claimed by defendants is a factor that could be weighed by a jury,along with other admissible evidence,in determining the date that perreca was promoted to night manager.
in light of the serious dispute over this important factual determination,the district court judgment is vacated with respect to the date from which company pension benefits should be calculated under the terms of the sternberger plan,and the cause is remanded to the district court for trial on the issue of whether perreca was promoted to night manager in,as he for that matter,at any time prior to january,which was the effective date of the sternberger whether his union membership in fact continued until april,as defendants insist.
genuine issues of material fact exist concerning the proper interpretation of the terms of the plan 
plaintiffs argue that according to the plain language of the original sternberger plan,an employee who stopped being a union member before the sternberger plan came into existence is entitled to receive benefit service from the date the employee was hired.appellants br.at.plaintiffs contend that because perreca was not a union member on the effective date of the plan january,he is entitled to credit under the plan starting from his first day of work on august.id.at.
the sternberger plan defines the term employee,in relevant part,as any person,excluding those covered under a collective bargaining agreement,regularly employed by an employer,sternberger and who receives compensation from an employer not as a pension,severance pay,retainer or a fee under contract.perreca aff.of,ex.emphasis added.plaintiffs contend that this definition excluded from plan participation only persons who were presently is,covered as of the effective date of the plan,which was january,a union plan otherwise the sternberger plan could have easily stated that persons presently or previously covered under a union plan were excluded.appellants br.at emphasis added.accordingly,under plaintiffs interpretation,since perreca was not covered by a union plan on january,he was not excluded as an employee from participating in the plan.id.
plaintiffs argue that the exclusion of multiple benefits provision of the sternberger plan also does not exclude persons as employees who ceased their union membership prior to january.id.that provision states,in relevant part,that m embership hereunder or eligibility therefor,if an employee has not become a member of any employee terminates when his employer is obligated to contribute to any other plan,involving pensions or other deferred compensation negotiated with a union which represents such employee in an appropriate bargaining unit.perreca aff.of,ex.thus,eligibility and membership were not terminated by the exclusion of multiple benefits provision for an employee like perreca who was a union member before the sternberger plan came into existence,because the employer was not,as of the effective date of the plan january,obligated to contribute to a union pension plan for that person.appellants br.at.
plaintiffs argue that perreca also met the eligibility requirements articulated in the plan,which states that e ach employee on the effective date who has not then attained his birthday shall be eligible for membership on that date perreca aff.of,ex.appellants br.at.as an employee who had not attained his birthday on january,perreca,plaintiffs assert,was eligible for membership on that date.id.in addition,plaintiffs explain how perreca also met the deadline for written application for membership that comes to pass either sixty days after the date that an employee becomes eligible to be a member,or sixty days after he receives notice of his eligibility from the administrative committee,whichever shall be later perreca aff.of,ex.appellants br.at.for when perreca received a form from sternberger for membership in the sternberger plan,he immediately completed and returned it to sternberger,as the form requested,and he became a member of the sternberger plan.id.at perreca aff.of.they further explain that upon application approval,membership was effective as of the date of eligibility,which,for perreca,was the plan effective date of january.appellants br.at perreca aff.of,ex.
finally,plaintiffs point to the prior service provision of the plan,which states that e very employee who becomes a member of the plan as of the effective date shall receive credited prior service for the years and completed months of employment from his first date of hiring by an employer or predecessor to the effective date perreca aff.of,ex.emphasis added.appellants br.at.they argue that since perreca became a member of the sternberger plan as of the effective date of january,he was entitled to receive credited prior service from august,the date of his hiring.id.
we are mindful that,a s a general matter,unambiguous language in an erisa plan must be interpreted and enforced in accordance with its plain meaning,aramony united way replacement benefit plan,cir see also fay oxford health plan,cir this court will review the erisa plan as a whole,giving terms their plain meanings.in addition,absent evidence indicating the intention of the parties,any ambiguity in the language used in an erisa plan should be construed against the interests of the party that drafted the language.see ret.plan for salaried employees of rko,cir in an erisa case,t he rule is that when one party is responsible for the drafting of an instrument,absent evidence indicating the intention of the parties,any ambiguity will be resolved against the drafter.internal quotation marks omitted pagan nynex pension plan,cir relying on same quotation masella blue cross blue shield of,cir noting that when courts conduct de novo review of an interpretation under an erisa insurance plan,ambiguities should be construed against the insurer fay,at where there are ambiguities in an erisa plan that this court is reviewing de novo,those ambiguities are construed in favor of the plan beneficiary.in light of these settled principles of contract interpretation,the plain language of the plan could be understood to permit plaintiffs claim for pension benefits coverage beginning august,as long as perreca was not covered by a collective bargaining agreement on january.
however,it is also a cardinal principle of contract construction that a document should be read to give effect to all its provisions and to render them consistent with each other.mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d see also kinek paramount communications,cir noting the principle of contract construction that all provisions of a contract be read together as a harmonious whole,if possible.thus,defendants argue that plaintiffs interpretation runs afoul of the unambiguous language of the plan excluding multiple benefits.appellees br.at.as defendants point out,perreca interpretation would require the company to make double payments for any employee who had previously been a union member,something not intended under the plan.id.emphasis added.
when one reads the plan as a whole,defendants argument casts doubt on the asserted plain meaning of the plan because the intent or purpose of the exclusion of multiple benefits provision clearly was to protect the employer from having to pay into two pension plans a union plan and the sternberger plan for the same set of years for any given employee.see,at noting that ambiguity in an erisa plan is construed against the drafter only absent evidence indicating the intention of the parties pagan,at same.the fact that membership in the plan terminates for any employee who becomes covered by a union pension plan during their employment see perreca aff.of,ex.is strong evidence of this purpose.
it is thus clear that we are faced with a disputed issue of fact over the proper interpretation of the plan by virtue of the apparent conflict between the plain meaning interpretation offered by plaintiffs and the evidence of the intent factor pressed by defendants.see fay,at language is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire agreement whether contract language is ambiguous is a question of law that is resolved by reference to the contract alone.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
accordingly,the district court judgment is vacated with respect to the date from which company pension benefits should be calculated under the terms of the sternberger plan,and the cause is remanded to the district court for trial on this issue as well see thompson gjivoje,cir where contractual language is ambiguous and subject to varying reasonable interpretations,intent becomes an issue of fact and summary judgment is inappropriate.
the alleged promise to perreca 
gluck alleged oral promise 
plaintiffs claim that,apart from the express terms of the sternberger plan,gluck orally promised perreca in that august,would be the starting date from which perreca company pension benefits would accrue.plaintiffs rely on this alleged oral promise as the basis for their claim of promissory estoppel.however,regardless of the accuracy of this allegation,plaintiffs claim fails because oral promises are unenforceable under erisa and therefore can not vary the terms of an erisa plan.smith,cir.as we observed in smith when we rejected a plaintiff claim that he had been orally promised additional benefits to supplement his employer erisa plan,
erisa explicitly provides,in section a,that all agreements relating to pension benefits must be in writing.erisa a,a every employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.the writing requirement protects employees from having their benefits eroded by oral modifications to the plan.
furthermore,the writing requirement protects the plan actuarial soundness by preventing plan administrators from contracting to pay benefits to persons not entitled to such under the express terms of the plan.the statutory language of a is clear and concise and must be enforced as written.to hold otherwise would not only thwart congressional purpose and intent,but would afford less protection to employees and their beneficiaries.
id.at quoting cefalu goodrich,cir.
accordingly,since perreca may not,as a matter of law,rely upon an oral promise to modify the terms of an erisa plan,we affirm the district court judgment to the extent that it denied plaintiffs claim to calculate pension benefits from august,on the basis of gluck alleged oral promise.on remand,the success of plaintiffs action at trial will depend upon their claim that the express language of the plan permits perreca pension benefits to be calculated from august.
projected benefits statements received by perreca 
perreca points to an annual statement of benefits dated july,that calculated his plan benefits from august,halbardier,ex.v as evidence that he indeed was promised that his sternberger plan benefits would accrue from august.see appellants br.at.this document,which was prepared for perreca,stated,inter alia,that as of july,your accrued pension under the retirement plan is a month to start on march,at age.you have years of service credited toward vesting your date of employment is august.halbardier,ex.at the bottom of this document,a statement in capital letters directed the recipient to consult the reverse side of the paper.this statement read,please see the reverse side for notes regarding the preparation of this statement and an explanation of accrued and vested benefits.id.on the reverse side of the paper,there was a note that read in pertinent part,every effort was made to avoid errors in the preparation of this statement.however,you will appreciate that errors may have occurred and that factors and assumptions used for projecting benefits may be subject to change.actual benefits are,of course,subject to verification before any payments are authorized,ex.
to the extent that plaintiffs suggest that this statement of projected benefits alone constituted a promise supporting their claim of promissory estoppel,we reject their claim.in light of the prominent disclaimer printed on the statement that specifically cautioned perreca that a ctual benefits are subject to verification before any payments are authorized,id,the statement of projected benefits can not,in the circumstances of this case,reasonably be construed as a promise concerning the precise amount of benefits accrued.the disclaimer was clearly printed on the statement prepared for perreca and notified him that actual benefits were subject to verification before any payments would be authorized.
lump sum payment 
do the terms of the version of the plan,including the lump sum option,govern perreca pension benefits 
in january,perreca requested for the first time lump sum payment of his pension benefits.see perreca aff.of,appellants br.at.plaintiffs assert that the lump sum payment option should be available to them because that option was available under the terms of the version of the sternberger plan,which plaintiffs contend govern perreca company pension benefits since that was the plan in effect at the time perreca retired on february,plaintiffs point to the preambles of the and versions of the plan to support the proposition that the version of the plan governs perreca company pension benefits,as both of those preambles state,with respect to any employee or member who had retired prior to the effective date of any change in the plan,all rights and any benefits payable shall continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the plan as in effect on the date of retirement perreca aff.of,ex.at,ex.at.moreover,defendants conceded at oral argument before us that perreca pension benefits are governed by the terms of the version of the sternberger plan that was in effect when perreca retired on february.accordingly,the parties here have effectively stipulated that the terms of the version of the plan,as amended in,govern perreca company pension benefits.
the version of the sternberger plan permits a member to elect certain pension payment options,including the lump sum option,ex.at ex.if a member selects the lump sum option,then,w ith the approval of the administrative committee of the plan,a lump sum equal to the actuarial value of the member standard pension shall be paid to the retired member upon retirement,ex.at ex.e.similarly,the summary plan description,which reflects amendments to the plan effective as of january,states,with committee approval you may be granted a lump sum upon retirement.but,since the basic purpose of the plan is to provide a lifetime pension,the committee will approve a lump sum payment only in unusual circumstances.halbardier,ex.l at.
did perreca timely request the lump sum option 
perreca concedes that he never sought committee approval for a lump sum payment at the time that he retired in.see appellants br.at.however,plaintiffs assert that under the terms of the election procedure provision of the version of the plan,perreca was entitled to elect a lump sum on or prior to march.id.at.that provision states,in relevant part,that a member may elect an option by filing a prescribed form with the committee on any date which is b less than one year prior to the pension conversion date,provided the member furnishes proof of good health satisfactory to the committee.perreca aff.of,ex.at ex.the plan defines pension conversion date as the earlier of a member pension commencement date or his normal retirement date,ex.g.the pension commencement date is the first day of the month as of which pension payments commence,ex.f,which for perreca was march,ex.at,ex.the normal retirement date is the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the member birthday,ex,which for perreca was also march,since he turned years old on february,see id.appellants br.at.
accordingly,plaintiffs claim that perreca was entitled to elect a lump sum on or prior to march,is confirmed by the terms of the version of the plan.thus,perreca request to sternberger in january for a lump sum payment of his pension benefits see perreca aff.of,appellants br.at,was timely under the version of the sternberger plan.
is perreca subject to the committee approval requirement of the lump sum option as stated in the plan 
as indicated above in section,the lump sum option provision of the version of the plan states that approval of the administrative committee of the plan is required before pension benefits may be paid in a lump sum to a retired member.perreca aff.of,ex.at ex.e.however,plaintiffs assert that under the tax reform act of,the committee approval requirement in the version of the plan was unlawful by the time that perreca requested a lump sum payment of his pension benefits in january,thereby voiding retroactively the committee approval requirement in the version of the plan and entitling plaintiffs to payment of the lump sum without limitation.see appellants br.at.in contrast,defendants argue that 
perreca cites no cases to support his argument that he can simply change the plain language of the plan.if perreca retirement is governed by the plan which was legal at the time he retired,he can not recover because he did not seek committee approval and none was granted.if he seeks it under any later plan,he is not entitled to the benefit because he did not retire at age.
appellees br.at.
plaintiffs are incorrect in attributing the ban on an employer discretion requirement for a lump sum payment option to the tax reform act of.rather,that prohibition was established by treasury regulation d,which was created to reflect changes made by the retirement equity act of retirement equity act and was intended to conform the regulations to section of the retirement equity act.limitations on alternative benefits.proposed january,codified at pt.see also retirement equity act of,tit.iii,stat.section of the retirement equity act amended the rules of erisa g,g,and internal revenue code irc d,d,that prohibit amendments to pension plans which diminish the accrued benefits of the participants.see retirement equity act,stat.at.erisa g,g,provides in pertinent part,
g decrease of accrued benefits through amendment of plan 
the accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan,other than an amendment described in section c or of this title.
for purposes of paragraph,a plan amendment which has the effect of

with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits the secretary of the treasury may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment eliminating an optional form of benefit.
erisa g,g.similarly,irc d,d,provides in relevant part,

b treatment of certain plan purposes of subparagraph a,a plan amendment which has the effect of 
ii eliminating an optional form of benefit,with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits.
irc d,d.thus,the provisions found in erisa and in irc prohibit the same conduct.
treasury regulation d,a was adopted in order to effectuate these principles and states in relevant part,
a pension plan that permits the employer either directly or indirectly,through the exercise of discretion,to deny a participant a section d protected benefit provided under the plan for which the participant is otherwise eligible but for the employer exercise of discretion violates the requirements of section d.
