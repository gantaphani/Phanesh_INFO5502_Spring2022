this case requires us to consider whether a former employee who has received a full distribution of his or her account balance under a defined contribution pension plan has standing as a plan participant to file suit under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,to recover losses occasioned by a breach of fiduciary duty that allegedly reduced the amount of his or her benefits.we join the first,third,fourth,sixth,seventh,and eleventh circuits,and hold that these former employees have standing to bring their claims accordingly,we vacate the district court order dismissing the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and remand for further proceedings.
jerry vaughn and theresa travers vaughn are former employees of bay environmental management bay environmental who participated in two types of retirement plans offered by the company plans.the first,referred to as the pension plan,was funded solely by the discretionary contributions of bay environmental.the second,known as the retirement plan,consisted of both a component and a k component.both plans were individual account plans,also known as defined contribution plans all plan investments were chosen by the plan trustees and investment advisors except for the k component of the retirement plan,which was directed by the plan participants.
in or early,republic services,purchased richmond sanitary services,rss,of which bay environmental was an affiliate.at around this same time,the trustees of the plans voted to terminate the plans.on or about april,bay environmental notified its employees that the plans would be terminated effective april.in august,the trustees transferred all plan assets to money market funds.subsequently,in the year,plan participants received a distribution of the value of their individual accounts.
on december,vaughn filed suit on behalf of himself and all individuals he named bay environmental and the plans trustees as defendants,alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by investing the plans assets imprudently.specifically,vaughn alleged that defendants knew or should have known that the purchase of bay environmental by rss would likely result in the termination of the plans and that defendants should have transferred the plan assets to money market funds sooner in light of the plans shortened investment horizon.vaughn sought relief in the form of a declaration that defendants had breached their fiduciary duties,a preliminary injunction prohibiting distribution of the individual defendants plan accounts,and the establishment of a successor trust for benefits owed to the plans,benefits to be paid by the defendants.
on march,after the parties failed to mediate the dispute,vaughn filed his first amended complaint,adding the plans investment advisors,fsc corporation and jerrold weinberg fsc defendants,as defendants vaughn also added a second claim for relief alleging that bay environmental further breached its fiduciary duties by failing to conduct an adequate investigation before selecting the investment advisors or to monitor the performance of the plans investments and investment advisors.
on july,the fsc defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction arguing that vaughn lacked statutory standing under erisa.specifically,they claimed that vaughn failed to allege sufficient facts to bring him within erisa definition of participant.see defining participant as any employee or former employee of an employer who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or whose beneficiaries may become eligible to receive any such benefit.
the district court granted the fsc defendants motion to dismiss on september.the court concluded that vaughn was not a participant because he had received a distribution of his individual account balance and was therefore not entitled to additional benefits under the plan.vaughn timely appealed 
we review the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo,accepting all facts alleged in the first amended complaint as true.see rhoades avon,cir see also larue dewolff,boberg,d as the case comes to us we must assume that respondents breached fiduciary obligations defined in erisa a,and that those breaches had an adverse impact on the value of the plan assets in petitioner individual account.
erisa a imposes a p rudent man standard of care on plan fiduciaries.a.this standard requires that the fiduciary discharge her duties with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing of a prudent man acting in like capacity a b.it also requires the fiduciary to diversify the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses,unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.a c.a plan fiduciary who breaches her fiduciary duties shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach.erisa a,a.
erisa provides for a civil action by a plan participant for appropriate relief for a breach of fiduciary duty.a.under the statute,participant means any employee or former employee of an employer who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer.the supreme court has interpreted this section as conferring standing on former employees who have a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment or a colorable claim to vested benefits.firestone tire rubber bruch,d original alterations and quotation omitted.in contrast,former employees do not have standing if a successful suit would result in a damage award that was not for benefits due under the plan.kuntz reese,cir per curiam kuntz ii see also.mut.life ins.russell,d holding that erisa a does not provide a cause of action for damages caused by improper or untimely processing of benefit claims.
in concluding that vaughn lacked standing,the district court first rejected his argument that kuntz did not apply because bay environmental plans were defined contribution plans,whereas the plan in kuntz was a defined benefit plan.in so doing,the district court noted that the ninth circuit has not distinguished between the two types of plans and that two district courts have applied kuntz to defined contribution plans.the court also noted that vaughn claim was not for an ascertainable amount of improperly calculated benefits,but rather alleged imprecise financial losses due to imprudent investment,and concluded that neither of the recognized exceptions to kuntz applied because vaughn did not allege and the case did not involve an annuity.the court thus concluded that under kuntz,former employees who have received a lump sum distribution of their individual accounts are seeking damages for breach of fiduciary duty,not vested benefits,and do not have standing as participants under erisa.
contrary to the district court order,kuntz does not control this case.the kuntz plaintiffs sued their former employer for breach of fiduciary duty alleging that the employer had misrepresented the benefits that would be paid under a defined benefit plan.kuntz reese,cir kuntz i,vacated by kuntz ii.on rehearing,we held that the kuntz plaintiffs were not participants within the meaning of erisa,because if successful,their claim would result in a damage award,not an increase of vested benefits.at.importantly,the kuntz plaintiffs conceded that they had received all of the benefits due to them under the plan.they alleged only that they would not have participated in the plan the defendant misrepresentations about the amount of benefits they would receive.kuntz i,at.
in contrast,vaughn alleges that he has not received all of the benefits due to him under the plans.although he received a distribution of the value of his individual accounts,he claims that he did not receive a full distribution because his accounts contained less than they would have if the fiduciaries had not breached their duty of prudent investment.because vaughn alleges that he did not receive everything that was due to him
