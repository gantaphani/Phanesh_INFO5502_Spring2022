in april,robert renfro began working for mobil oil corporation as a contract physician at the beaumont,texas,oil refinery.in the fall of,renfro sought a,salaried position as a staff physician with exxonmobil corporation.renfro received a letter confirming his appointment on january,began work on february,was injured in a car accident on february and died on february.
at the time of his death,renfro was years old,divorced,and had two grown children.exxonmobil employee benefits package the plan included life insurance coverage,and renfro became a covered employee as of february when he began work.under the plan,renfro was automatically entitled to percent of his base salary then per year and,with a similar payment for basic accidental death coverage,his heirs have now received under the plan.
under the plan,an employee could also elect additional group life insurance gul and,in addition,further coverage called voluntary accidental death and dismemberment vadd.the premiums,each dependent on the level of coverage selected,were fairly modest but the premiums had to be paid by the employee and required an affirmative election.for gul,election after days required a medical examination.
at the time of his death,renfro had not yet received the election forms they had been placed in the mail outbox on february.exxonmobil employed a process for preparing and delivering the forms for new employees.according to later evidence,it was not uncommon for there to be some delay in furnishing them.
just what elective benefits renfro would have chosen,if any,is his children assert that the benefits package was a primary motive in his choosing to become a,salaried employee of exxonmobil.in all events,on february and,after learning of renfro death,several exxonmobil employees purported retroactively to elect maximum gul and vadd coverage for renfro.
specifically,kathy mccoy,a benefits services supervisor at exxonmobil,emailed company legal counsel sherry englande stating that she wished to elect maximum optional gul and vadd benefits for renfro.mccoy may or may not have spoken with elda smith,the benefits manager for the company,but did not copy smith on the email to englande.when englande agreed with mccoy proposal,mccoy directed an employee in the houston office to enter maximum gul and vadd coverage for renfro as of february.
on april,a benefits counselor in houston sent renfro heirs his two children a letter with an attachment labeled estimate of survivor benefits,which stated that the children would receive for the basic coverage,for gul benefits,and for the vadd benefits.a prominent disclaimer in the letter states in the event of any inconsistency between the information contained in this statement and the provisions of the plans,the plans,as well as any applicable administrative regulations,will govern.
not surprisingly,the plan insurer for gul and vadd benefits,metlife,rejected the request that it pay life insurance claims for someone who had not elected coverage prior to a fatal accident.at that point,exxonmobil plan administrator,janet madigan,was consulted for the first time.under the plan,she had ultimate and interpretive authority.
madigan consulted another exxonmobil lawyer,who said that only madigan could approve a retroactive election.madigan then declined to do so.on may,a letter was mailed to renfro children stating that,contrary to the earlier letter,renfro was not eligible for gul and vadd benefits because he had not signed an election form.
renfro children protested the corrected benefits determination,but exxonmobil denied their appeal.the children asserted that renfro would have elected the additional coverage if the forms had been timely provided to him.renfro,they said,not only had become a employee partly to secure benefits,but he had in fact requested benefit election forms from the company a contention that exxonmobil disputes.madigan declined to reconsider her decision.
the children eventually sued exxonmobil,madigan and the plan in federal district court.two claims under the employee retirement income security act of erisa were pressed at trial one for benefits due under the plan,a b the other for equitable relief on the ground that the delay in furnishing the forms was a breach of fiduciary duty,id.a.after a bench trial,the district judge rejected the children claims.green exxonmobil,d.they now appeal to this court.
the conventional standard of review of the district court decision is for clear error as to fact findings and de novo on issues of law,coady toyota motor,cir,with some latitude in the latter case for rulings.id.at.where the plan administrator has discretionary authority to interpret and apply the plan,as madigan did in this case,such rulings are themselves reviewed for arbitrariness.firestone tire rubber bruch,d glista unum life ins.of,cir.
in appealing from the district court decision,the claimants offer four main arguments that subordinate exxonmobil employees made a valid and binding election on behalf of renfro which can not be undone that alternatively the company is estopped from denying the election that exxonmobil was responsible for any failure by renfro to elect coverage and that the district court should have found a breach of fiduciary duty by exxonmobil.we consider these arguments in turn.
under the plan,gul and vadd benefits required an election.it is a fair reading of the provisions dealing with the life insurance refer repeatedly to the employee or participant electing renfro or an assignee of his interest was the person to make the election and,as an election required the employee to undertake to pay the premiums,this makes further sense 
nothing in the plan explicitly provides for someone else except an assignee to make an election for the employee,let alone to do so retroactively after an accident has occurred.further,under the plan,madigan had the requisite authority to interpret and apply the decision to which we ordinarily defer unless it is unreasonable madigan decision that mccoy and other subordinates had no authority to make a retroactive election for renfro is far from unreasonable.
conceivably,madigan could have read the plan differently without being unreasonable.each side reads the plan as if it mechanically dictated answers as to whether other employees could act for renfro or whether madigan or others could excuse omissions.to us,these are issues not explicitly addressed in the plan.filling such gaps is ordinarily within the province of an administrator with discretionary authority.
claimants say that the subordinates were,like madigan,fiduciaries under erisa regulations but whether they were or not has little to do with whether they had authority under the plan to elect benefits for renfro.to say that someone is a fiduciary suggests special obligations in the exercise of authority although the kind and degree may vary,sec chenery.frankfurter.but authority to act depends on the plan and background agency law.
nor is such a ruling inconsistent with the claimants contention that some of the employees exercised discretion in various matters concerning benefits.in all likelihood some of them did.but this does not answer the question whether their discretion extended to making a election for an employee who had not himself made one or committed himself to pay an event in the administration of an erisa plan.
claimants say that the subordinates did,apparently with later consent by madigan,elect medical benefits for renfro.after the accident a benefits employee approved medical coverage as opposed to the hmo option for renfro to cover his medical care while he was on life support on february and.but this does not prove that the subordinate had authority to do said the subordinate did it also appears that coverage was the default option for medical benefits.
claimants also say that madigan admitted that she herself could have retroactively approved gul and vadd benefits for renfro.our reading of the transcript is otherwise.in any event,imputing such power to madigan or,with her consent,to subordinates might be a possible reading of the plan but again it is not dictated by any language in the pl
