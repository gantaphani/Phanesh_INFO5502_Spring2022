ii.background 
byars worked for the company for years until she was injured in august while vacationing out of the country.no longer able to continue her work,she received from six months of disability payments under a payroll practice plan,the terms of which are irrelevant to this case.while she was receiving disability payments,she filed a claim for disability ltd benefits under the long term disability income plan the plan.
a.the plan 
plan is governed by the employee retirement income and security act of,and designates as the sponsor and plan administrator.delegated its powers as plan administrator to the company long term disability income plan committee committee,which is the plan named fiduciary.the committee has the exclusive responsibility and complete and final discretionary authority to construe the plan and to decide all questions arising under the plan at b the committee also has the exclusive responsibility and the complete and final discretionary authority to determine the eligibility of all participants to receive benefits and the amount of benefits to which any participant may be entitled under the plan at b.
the plan requires the committee to select one or more employees to serve as its delegates.the delegates have the complete discretionary authority and sole responsibility to make all decisions on whether to approve or deny claims for benefits under the plan and their decisions shall be final and binding on all parties.at.the plan permits the committee to retain an administrative services provider with responsibility to investigate and process claims and appeals of denied claims,forward claim determination recommendations to the delegates for review,and issue payment of claims to participants as directed by the delegates.at.reliastar life insurance company was the administrative services provider when byars submitted her claim for ltd benefits 
under the plan,a participant is entitled to ltd benefits if she is disabled.the plan contains two definitions of disability.under the first definition,a participant is disabled if,during the first months following the disability date a physical or mental illness or injury continuously disables him from performing his normal duties for his employer at hereinafter the own occupation definition.under the second definition,a participant is disabled if,after the first months,a physical or mental illness or injury continuously disables him from engaging in any occupation for wage or profit,for which he is reasonably qualified by training,education or experience at cc hereinafter the any occupation definition.
byars claim 
byars filed her claim for ltd benefits on january,claiming that her disability date was on or around august.at.because she filed her claim within the first months following her disability date,the own occupation definition applied.reliastar denied her claim on april,saying that the medical evidence showed she was still capable of performing the substantial and material duties of her regular occupation as a product consultant.at.byars appealed denial of her claim.reliastar upheld its decision on august,again saying that byars was not totally disabled from her own occupation at.then,on january,seventeen months after byars disability committee informed her that it was upholding reliastar decision to deny her benefits.at.invoking erisa jurisdiction,e,byars filed this lawsuit in november.
c.the district court proceedings 
in her original complaint,byars asked for a d eclaration of her right to benefits past,present and future under the terms of the ltd plan.at.she also sought attorney fees,prejudgment interest,and statutory penalties.in the last of her several amended complaints,byars elaborated on her request for ltd benefits,contending that she was owed past due benefits from february,until the present at.
nearly five years after byars filed her original complaint,which had been amended a number of times,the court ruled on the following dispositive motions it granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion for summary judgment granted reliastar motion for summary judgment granted in part and denied in part byars motion for summary judgment and denied byars motion for partial summary judgment for document withholding penalties.
the court first order of business in addressing the summary judgment motions was to establish a standard of review.relying on firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the court decided that it should review the committee decision under an arbitrary and capricious standard because the plan both designated the committee as the plan administrator and granted the committee discretion to make final benefit determinations.the court rejected byars argument that reliastar was the de facto plan administrator under bruch,reliastar decision would be subject to de novo review because reliastar was not vested with discretion.
having established a standard of review,the court granted in part byars motion for summary judgment by reversing the committee decision to deny her benefits under the own occupation standard.the court first determined that the committee denial was de novo wrong because the evidence showed that byars was unable to perform the essential responsibilities of her own occupation.then,applying arbitrary and capricious review,the court determined that the committee application of the plan to byars disability claim was not made rationally and in good faith.at.the court based this finding on the committee january,denial letter in which it stated that byars was entitled to benefits only if she satisfied the any occupation definition of disability.at.because not more than months had passed since byars disability date,however,byars was still subject only to the own occupation definition.the court held that the committee use of the wrong definition of disability rendered its decision arbitrary and capricious,thereby entitling byars to months of own occupation benefits.
after awarding byars months of benefits,the court turned to the question of whether byars was entitled to benefits beyond months under the any occupation standard.it concluded that she was not,saying that h er medical records do not demonstrate that she is physically disabled from engaging in any occupation for which she is qualified.at.
next,the court denied byars motion for partial summary judgment in which she sought statutory penalties against the defendants and reliastar for their alleged failure to disclose documents that she requested after the committee denied her claim.the court found that byars failed to demonstrate that the defendants failure to provide all these documents was committed in bad faith or that she was prejudiced by this failure.at.finally,the court denied both byars and reliastar motions for attorney fees.
the court set a deadline for receiving proposed final judgments.the defendants and reliastar filed a joint proposed final judgment,in which they calculated that byars was entitled to of own occupation benefits.they arrived at this number by subtracting from of byars average compensation the amount of social security disability ssd benefits that she was receiving.in her proposed final judgment,filed one day late,byars calculated that she was entitled to of own occupation benefits,reflecting of her average compensation and not offset by ssd benefits.including prejudgment interest,byars requested a total of.she also claimed entitlement to reinstatement of other benefits that she alleged she would have received had the committee initially approved her claim.
after refusing to grant byars unopposed motion to treat her untimely proposed judgment as filed nunc pro tunc,the court adopted the defendants joint proposed judgment and awarded byars in own occupation benefits and costs,without prejudgment interest.byars appeals.neither the defendants nor reliastar.
iii.issues on appeal and standards of review 
the primary issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in deciding,on the parties for summary judgment,byars entitlement to benefits under the any occupation definition of disability.the propriety of the grant of summary judgment presents a question of law,which we review de novo.levinson reliance standard life ins,cir.
byars also raises several issues related to her award of own occupation benefits.first,she argues that the amount of own occupation benefits awarded by the court violates the terms of the plan,because it is less than of her average compensation.second,she argues that because she succeeded on her claim for own occupation benefits,the court erred in denying her motion for attorney fees.third,she argues that the court should have unambiguously ordered her reinstatement in the plan,thereby making her retroactively eligible for other employee benefits that she was deprived of as a result of the committee denial of her claim.finally,she argues that the court should have awarded prejudgment interest on her award of own occupation benefits.we review the district court denial of attorney fees and prejudgment interest for abuse of discretion.wright hanna steel,cir attorney fees mut.serv.ins.frit,cir prejudgment interest.
the final issue byars presents is whether the district court abused its discretion in refusing to award her statutory penalties under c against the defendants and reliastar for their alleged failure to produce documents as required by erisa.wright,at articulating standard of review.
iv.discussion 
any occupation benefits 
byars argues that the district court erred in deciding her entitlement to benefits beyond the first months following her disability date.she argues that because the committee never decided whether she was entitled to benefits under the any occupation definition,the court should have either remanded her claim to the committee or held a de novo bench trial to consider evidence that she would have proffered to the committee in support of any occupation benefits.
the defendants argue that byars invited the district court to rule on her entitlement to any occupation benefits because she requested relief up to the time of filing for summary judgment,well beyond the first months following her disability date.the defendants also argue that byars presented the issue of any occupation benefits to the district court and submitted evidence in support of those benefits,and therefore,judicial economy counseled that the district court decide her entitlement to them without remanding to the committee.
we do not write on a clean slate regarding this issue.in oliver coca cola,cir,vacated in part on petition for reh g,cir,a recent panel of this court held that a district court may rule on a beneficiary entitlement to any occupation benefits even though the plan administrator had not yet done so.the plan in oliver is the same plan that is before us.further,the administrative history in oliver is similar.a beneficiary filed a claim for ltd benefits and the committee denied his claim under the own occupation definition,never reaching the any occupation definition.the district court reversed the committee denial of own occupation benefits,and then concluded that the beneficiary was also disabled under the any occupation definition.
we held in oliver that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excusing the beneficiary from exhausting his administrative remedies that is,he was excused from seeking a decision by the committee in the first instance on his entitlement to any occupation benefits.we said that e xcusal of the exhaustion requirement is appropriate when resort to the administrative remedies would be futile or the remedy inadequate.id.at quoting counts am.life accident ins,cir.we held that exhaustion of remedies would be futile in that case because the committee had denied the plaintiff benefits based on the own occupation definition of disability.we stated that t hat determination necessarily precluded the plaintiff from arguing with a straight face to the same insurance company that he was unable to perform the material and substantial duties of any occupation.id.at quoting dozier sun life assurance of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
this case,however,is materially different from oliver in several respects.in oliver,the parties apparently sought summary judgment on oliver entitlement to benefits under both definitions of disability.the district court said that it is called upon to determine from the record evidence whether oliver was disabled during two separate periods of time,as the term disabled is separately and differently defined in the plan for the two periods.oliver,d.the court also noted that the claims administrator never voiced any distinction between oliver status or his ability to function in an employment environment during these separate periods of time.id.
in contrast,neither byars nor the defendants sought summary judgment on the issue of byars entitlement to benefits under the any occupation definition.thus,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on a claim for which they had not sought summary judgment.although a court may sua sponte grant summary judgment on a claim not presented in a summary judgment motion,the court is required to give notice to the parties that it intends to address the claim on summary judgment.here,the district court provided no notice that it intended to rule on the any occupation definition of disability.this was error.see imaging bus,llc banctec,cir holding that sua sponte grant of summary judgment without notice to the parties constitutes reversible error massey cong.life ins,cir explaining that notice is mandatory before sua sponte grant of summary judgment.
the defendants argue that byars invited the district court to rule on her entitlement to any occupation benefits,and thus we should not entertain her argument that the court erred in doing so.there is some confusion in the record to be sure,but we are unable to conclude that the grant of summary judgment was invited error.the second amended complaint is not free of ambiguity.it is a rambling pleading that asks for a d eclaration of her right to benefits past,present and future under the terms of the ltd plan,and p ayment of all past due benefits due her under the terms of the plan at.the complaint,however,only seeks review of the committee decision and nowhere references the any occupation definition.but,whether or not the complaint included a claim for any occupation benefits,byars summary judgment motion did not invite the district court to address the question.a careful review of the motions for summary judgment and the supporting memoranda reveals that neither byars nor the defendants sought summary judgment on the issue of byars entitlement to any occupation benefits byars memorandum in support of summary judgment is filled with references and arguments pertaining only to the committee error under the own occupation definition similarly,the defendants supporting memorandum constantly refers to byars failure to prove that she could not perform her own job at 
this case is different from oliver in another respect.in oliver,all parties agreed that there was no material issues of disputed fact,and no one suggested that the record was incomplete.on the other hand,there exists disputed issues of fact about whether byars could satisfy the any occupation definition.for example,payne indicated in his functional assessment of byars that her full capacity for sitting and standing was limited to two hours a day,while her full capacity for walking was limited to one hour a day.at.in this same assessment,payne selected the option s evere limitation of functional of sedentary work to describe byars physical impairment.at.payne also opined in a letter to the committee that byars is disabled and incapable of doing any type of work which requires prolonged periods of either sitting or standings as these only aggravate her sciatic symptoms.at.even more telling is the conclusion that jack sink,a vocational expert,arrived at in his comprehensive vocational assessment of byars 
all of these facts must lead to the conclusion that byars does experience pain which is debilitating and which prevents her from being a competitive worker.in brief,byars simply does not have the ability for sustained physical mental performance necessary to meet a competitive standard of work in her previous job,or in any other job,so long as she continues to have her current limitations.since her physicians have found her to be at maximum medical improvement,it is assumed that the limitations she currently experiences will continue.
ex.to ex.demand letter at emphasis added.
but,the defendants also presented evidence showing that although byars has reached her maximum medical improvement,she is capable of doing some work,as long as she is able to frequently adjust positions.at letter of payne opining that byars is disabled and incapable of doing any type of work which requires prolonged periods of either sitting or standing.furthermore,reliastar and its reviewing physicians believed the evidence did not support byars claim for disability even under the own occupation definition.at reliastar physician review report that there is nothing documented that is objective that would support the patient continued disability.unlike in oliver,there are genuine issues of fact regarding the extent of byars disability.the district court denied byars benefits under the any occupation definition because h er medical records do not demonstrate that she is physically disabled from engaging in any occupation for which she is qualified.at.byars,however,was never required to produce evidence supporting a claim for any occupation benefits because the committee denied her claim before the any occupation definition became applicable at the month following her disability date.byars should not suffer an adverse decision because of a failure to present evidence supporting the any occupation definition.
we hold,therefore,that the district court erred in deciding byars entitlement to any occupation benefits on summary judgment.
awards relating to own occupation benefits 
the plan offset provision 
according to section of the plan,an eligible participant will receive monthly benefits in an amount equal to of her average compensation the participant who incurs a disability will receive a monthly benefit in an amount equal to percent of his average compensation,reduced to account for disability benefits payable from other sources,as required under section.at.section a of the plan,entitled offset for other disability benefits,provides 
the monthly disability benefit payable from this plan to the participant who receives disability benefits from any source described in subsection b will be reduced as necessary so that the total of his monthly disability benefit from this plan equals no more than the following amount percent of his average compensation,minus the amount of his monthly disability benefits payable from all other sources provided further that the offset for other disability benefits will not serve to reduce the disability benefit under this plan to an amount less than percent of the participant average compensation as limited.
at emphasis added.
byars argues that the italicized language creates a floor below which an offset may not reduce benefits.according to her interpretation then,the district court erred in accepting the defendants proposed judgment of own occupation benefits in an amount less than of her average compensation 
the defendants respond with two points.first,they argue that byars has failed to challenge a previous order of the district court barring her from raising this issue.second,they argue that the issue is not ripe for review because byars did not present the issue in her summary judgment papers and,consequently,the district court never considered it.
we do not agree that byars is barred from raising this issue.byars raised it in her second amended complaint where she requested a d eclaration of her right to benefits in an amount not less than at of her salary.at.she also raised the issue in her memorandum in support of summary judgment at,in her proposed judgment at,and has thoroughly briefed the issue on appeal.nor do we read the order of the district court cited by the defendants,order granting in part defendants motion to dismiss class claims as barring byars from asserting her individual right to benefits that do not fall below of her average compensation.rather,the court in this order dismissed all class claims while preserving byars right to seek relief individually.nowhere in the order does the court hold that byars can not raise the argument in her individual claim.therefore,byars has preserved this issue.
nevertheless,we refuse to consider the merits of this issue.while the district court granted summary judgment and entered an order on the issue of liability,its summary judgment opinion did not discuss this issue,despite byars specifically asking for past due ltd plan benefits at a minimum floor of of her earnings in accord with the plan documents at.the district court only entered a final order awarding byars an amount of benefits below of her average compensation.if byars is correct that the plan does impose a floor on benefits,then the court final order is contrary to the terms of the plan,and was entered without a finding by the court on the issue.therefore,we vacate the judgment with respect to the amount of own occupation benefits awarded to permit the district court to address the issue in the first instance.
attorney fees 
erisa provides for an award of attorney fees in any action under this subchapter by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary,the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney fee and costs of action to either party.g.we have refused to interpret this provision as creating a presumption in favor of awarding fees.freeman cont l ins,cir the law provides no presumption in favor of granting attorney fees to a prevailing claimant in an erisa action.see also florence nightingale nursing,blue shield of,cir quoting freeman and refusing to adopt presumption of awarding fees.
district courts in our circuit should consider five factors in determining whether to award attorney fees 
the degree of the opposing parties culpability or bad faith the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorney fees whether an award of attorney fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances whether the parties requesting attorney fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an erisa plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding erisa itself and the relative merits of the parties positions.
freeman,at.
byars main argument is that the court did not explain its reasons for denying fees.she argues that the court should have carefully analyzed the relevant factors showing how its findings are supported by the record,and set forth principled reasons for apparently concluding that the defendants conduct did not merit attorneys fees being awarded.byars initial br.at.precedent in this circuit does not support such a requirement.
although it would be helpful if district courts specifically referred to each of these factors in their analysis,plumbers steamfitters local pension fund vertex constr,cir,we have said that so long as a court analysis takes these guidelines into account,it does not abuse its discretion by not enumerating each and every one.id.in fact,the case originally setting forth these factors,iron workers local bowen,cir understood them to operate only as a guideline to assist district courts in exercising their discretion and as a nuclei of concerns that a court should address in applying section g.id.at.
the district court analysis satisfies our test.the court listed the five factors and concluded that h ere,these factors do not weigh in favor of an award of attorney fees against the defendants or against the plaintiff.at.we hesitate to require the district court to do more
