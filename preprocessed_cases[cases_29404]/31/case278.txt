appellant lisa papotto appellee is a widow seeking payment of benefits from appellee hartford life accident insurance appellant or hartford under an accidental death and dismemberment policy in relation to her husband death.the policy at issue explicitly excludes losses sustained while intoxicated.hartford plan administrator denied payment of benefits to appellee because the deceased had consumed alcohol prior to his death.on appeal,the district court concluded that the policy implicitly required causal connection between intoxication and the loss,and remanded the case to the plan administrator.both parties posit that we have appellate jurisdiction to hear an appeal from this remand order.because we conclude that the remand order is not immediately appealable as a final judgment and that the collateral order doctrine does not apply,we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
the underlying facts in this case are tragic and largely undisputed.on august,frank papotto,late husband of appellee,was playing golf with several in new jersey.that afternoon,he drank approximately four to five beers.at some point during the round,papotto dropped his cell phone and fell out of a golf cart while reaching for it.as a result of the fall,papotto suffered a head injury and died approximately five hours later.
a toxicology screen conducted posthumously revealed that papotto had a level bal of.the new jersey state standard for intoxication is,putting papotto bal over the legal limit for operating a motor vehicle.n.stat.ann.
at the time of his death,papotto was an employee of td bank.as an employee,papotto was entitled to benefits under td bank welfare benefit plan which provided,among other things,accidental death and dismemberment insurance coverage ad d.this ad d policy the policy was purchased through hartford.papotto designated appellee the beneficiary under the policy.

procedural history 
on august,appellee filed a claim with hartford for the ad d benefits.on october,hartford denied the claim because the evidence showed that papotto was intoxicated at the time of his death.on december,appellee appealed hartford denial to the plan administrator.appellee argued that hartford could not rely on the results of the toxicology screen to prove that papotto was intoxicated at the time of death but offered no evidence to show the results of the screen were inaccurate or unreliable hartford could not apply the new jersey standard for intoxication because papotto was not operating a motor vehicle at the time of his death and the policy intoxication exclusion must be read to require a causal connection between the intoxication and the loss in order to bar coverage.on january,the plan administrator upheld hartford decision to deny the ad d benefits.
on september,appellee filed a complaint against hartford in the district court for the district of new jersey pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,challenging the plan administrator findings and renewing the three arguments that she raised in her appeal to the administrator.both parties brought motions for summary judgment.
the district court rejected appellee first argument and found that it was generally reasonable for an administrator to rely on a toxicology report to establish evidence of intoxication.the district court also rejected appellee second argument and found that it was reasonable for hartford to rely on the new jersey statute defining intoxication.thus,the district court noted that the only remaining issue in dispute was the propriety of hartford construction of the policy.papotto hartford life accident ins,wl,at.the district court agreed with appellee as to this issue,and found that hartford interpretation of the policy was unreasonable the district court concluded that the intoxication exclusion provision must be read to bar coverage only when intoxication caused or contributed to the loss or death.
the district court thus denied both summary judgment motions as premature,and remanded the case back to the plan administrator for consideration of whether papotto intoxication caused or contributed to his death.id.in its order,the district court also permitted the plan administrator to the record and consider additional evidence to determine causation.the district court did not enter judgment in favor of any party.a docket entry from january,reads civil case terminated.per chambers ja.
hartford timely appealed the district court determination that the intoxication exclusion provision only precludes payment when the intoxication caused or contributed to the death.papotto,claiming that the district court erred by permitting the plan administrator to the record and consider new evidence.
after the filing of the notice of appeal,we sua sponte raised a question about our appellate jurisdiction.the parties submitted briefing on this issue,asserting that we have jurisdiction over the district court remand order pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
before we inquire into the merits of the issues on appeal,we must address the question of our appellate jurisdiction see elliot archdiocese of new york,cir our jurisdictional inquiry must precede any discussion of the merits of the case for if a court lacks jurisdiction and opines on a case over which it has no authority,goes beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental principles of separation of powers.quoting steel citizens for a better env t.both parties have indicated their consent to our appellate jurisdiction,but it is well established that we have an independent duty to satisfy ourselves of our appellate jurisdiction regardless of the parties positions.kreider dairy farms,glickman,cir see also arizonans for official english arizona,e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.first alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted in re resorts int l,cir subject matter jurisdiction can not be conferred by consent of the parties.internal quotation marks omitted.

the finality rule is not inflexible,however.the supreme court of the united states,recognizing that there are some issues that are too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated,created the collateral order doctrine.cohen beneficial indus.loan.to fall within the small class of decisions excepted from the rule by cohen,the order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay.
finality under 
although both parties contend that we should examine our jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine,our first inquiry is always whether an order is final under.whether a remand to an erisa plan administrator is a final decision and qualifies for review pursuant to is a matter of first impression for this court.many of our sister courts have found remands to erisa plan administrators analogous to remands to administrative agencies and have drawn from this jurisprudence to address questions of finality in the erisa context.see,rekstad first bank,cir petralia v.at t global info.solutions,cir.we follow suit and begin by exploring our jurisprudence on appellate jurisdiction over remands to administrative agencies.
remands to administrative agencies 
the general principle enunciated by this c ourt is that district court orders remanding cases to administrative agencies are not final and appealable.of maint.way emps.consol.rail,cir hereinafter brotherhood.we have determined,however,that a remand to an administrative agency may be deemed final for purposes of when a d istrict c ourt finally resolves an important legal issue in reviewing an administrative agency action and denial of appellate review before remand to the agency would foreclose appellate review as a practical matter.kreider,at.we distill a standard from this statement in kreider accordingly,we may exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to the finality rule over remands to administrative agencies when the remand finally resolves an issue,the legal issue is important,and denial of immediate review will foreclose appellate review in the future notably,grappling with our jurisdiction over remands,we have consistently accorded significant weight to the third factor,potential for evasion of future review.see aja assocs.army corps of eng rs,cir finding jurisdiction over a remand requiring the administrative agency to provide a procedural due process hearing because the district court decision granting applicants the right to a hearing could not receive later appellate review united steelworkers of am.local union,cir finding jurisdiction over a remand order that required a reconstituted administrative board to conduct an entirely new hearing because the remand order essentially disposed of all previous findings and orders and any new determinations would likely be unreviewable.
to be clear,we do not engage in this analysis to determine if there is an exception to the finality rule courts of appeals do not have authority to create exceptions to congressional limits on jurisdiction.see hertz friend,congress determine s the scope of the federal courts jurisdiction.kreider,at t he judiciary has no power to make exceptions to the congressional determinations of appellate jurisdiction.sloviter,concurring.contra id.at referring to the standard as an exception to finality in agency proceedings.rather,this analysis reflects a practical construction of finality.id.at sloviter,concurring see also mohawk,carpenter,this court has long given a practical rather than a technical construction.internal quotation marks omitted rekstad,at referring to the analysis of remands under as the practical finality rule petralia,at referring to the analysis of remands as a corollary rule to the finality rule therefore,we utilize the kreider test merely to evaluate whether a specific decision of the district court incorporated within a remand order is indeed final for purposes of.see harris,at t here are instances in which a final decision is not a final judgment.quoting abney united states.
kreider aptly exemplifies our application of the test.in kreider,a farmer kreider applied to the united states department of agriculture usda for an exemption to avoid paying certain fees related to his dairy farm.at.kreider application was denied by the market administrator.the decision was reversed by the administrative law judge alj,which was in turn reversed by the judicial officer jo.kreider filed a complaint in district court,which remanded the case for further evidentiary findings first order.on remand,the alj denied kreider exemption status once again,and kreider appealed.the jo determined the appeal was untimely because it was mailed on the date the appeal was due via federal express.although the applicable regulation required that an appeal is deemed to be filed when it is postmarked,the jo determined here that the term postmarked required a united states postal service postmark,rather than the mark of federal express.id.at.kreider returned to district court.upon review,the district court found that kreider appeal was timely and thus remanded for consideration on the merits second order.
the usda appealed to us,arguing that the district court erred in finding kreider appeal timely.on appeal,we sua sponte raised the question of our jurisdiction.we found no jurisdiction over the first order for consideration of additional evidence because the first order did not finally resolve a particularly important legal issue,and,more importantly,it was not an order that would evade appellate review.id.at.
by contrast,recognizing that questions regarding the timeliness of an appeal directly implicated disputes over the district court jurisdiction,we found jurisdiction over the second order.we noted that the second order,
resolves an issue of law that may evade review if immediate appeal is not permitted should kreider receive the relief it seeks on remand,is doubtful that the usda would be able to appeal its own decision in order to raise the procedural issues decided by the district court.
application 
we believe this test,applying a practical construction of finality,equally applicable in the erisa context.as jurisdictional questions under should be made on a basis,rekstad,at,we apply this rule in light of the particular facts before us,bearing in mind our jurisprudence discussed above.
the remand order at issue here directed the plan administrator to take two actions to consider additional evidence,and to read a causation requirement into the intoxication exclusion provision and determine whether papotto intoxication caused or contributed to his death.in looking only to the order for consideration of more evidence,we easily determine that we lack appellate jurisdiction over this portion of the remand.as we have previously determined,orders directing remands to administrative agencies to consider additional evidence are nonfinal.brotherhood,at.internal quotation marks omitted holding that a remand order to the railroad board for consideration of more evidence relating to the termination of employees was not final and appealable.
moreover,this portion of the remand order fails the first of the kreider prongs it does not finally resolve anything.we take guidance from a recent fourth circuit case,which squarely addressed the same issue and held that a remand order to an erisa administrator for consideration of more evidence was not final for purposes of because it resolved a purely procedural issue and did not address the merits of the claim.dickens aetna life ins,cir.in the same vein,we now hold that the first portion of the remand order requiring the consideration of more evidence involves a strictly procedural matter.there is no final resolution on the merits,the first of the kreider prongs is not met,and appellate jurisdiction does not exist
