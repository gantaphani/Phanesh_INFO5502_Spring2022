opinion of the court 
the regulations implementing the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,provide that when a plan administrator denies a request for benefits,it must set forth a description of the plan review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures,including a statement of the claimant right to bring a civil action.g iv.the erisa plan at issue in this case contains a deadline for filing a civil action.appellant neville mirza received a benefits denial letter advising him of his right to judicial review,but it did not mention the time limit for doing so.the principal question we address is whether plan administrators must inform claimants,of deadlines for judicial review,in their notifications denying benefits.we hold that they must,and that the appropriate remedy for this regulatory violation is to set aside the plan time limit and apply the limitations period from the most analogous cause of action here,new jersey deadline for breach of contract claims.because mirza filed his complaint before the expiration of this limitations period,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
is an employee of the challenge printing company of the carolinas challenge and a participant in her employer erisa plan.the plan documents contain a section on claims procedures,which provides a framework for the submission and review of claims for benefits.if a claimant receives an adverse initial benefit decision,she may appeal that determination through an internal review process.once the claimant exhausts that process and receives a final decision from the plan administrator,the claimant has one year to bring a legal action for benefits.
in april,consulted with neville mirza about severe back pain she was experiencing.mirza diagnosed with a herniated disc and recommended she undergo an endoscopic discectomy.agreed to the proposed treatment plan and executed an assignment of benefits form that assigned to mirza any and all rights that may have including but not limited to her personal injury protection carrier for any payment of outstanding medical bills incurred with mirza.app.the parties agree that through this assignment mirza stepped into the shoes of for purposes of pursuing any rights the latter might have under erisa.mirza performed the procedure on back and submitted a claim for to insurance administrator of america insurance administrator,the company charged with processing claims under challenge erisa plan.
insurance administrator first denied the claim on june,explaining that supporting documentation was missing.mirza submitted additional documents in response to this denial,but the claim was denied again.mirza worked his way through the internal review process and,on august,he received a letter denying his final appeal.insurance administrator found that the medical procedure on back was not a covered benefit because it was medically investigational.at the end of the letter,insurance administrator informed mirza of his right to bring a civil action under erisa a if he was not content with this final decision app.neither the august letter nor any of the earlier denials mentioned that,under the plan,mirza had one year from the date of the final benefits denial to seek judicial review.at some point after mirza received the august letter,he retained the law firm of callagy law.
around the same time that first visited mirza in april,she also met with spine orthopedics sports spine.likewise assigned her benefits to spine,which,after providing anesthesia services to,submitted a claim to insurance administrator for benefits under the erisa plan.after insurance administrator made only partial payment on the claim,spine,like mirza,retained callagy law to represent it in the benefits dispute.on november,an employee from insurance administrator spoke on the telephone with someone from callagy law about spine claim for benefits.it is not clear what was said on this phone call.according to insurance administrator,its employee read verbatim the plan language about the deadline for filing suit following the final denial of benefits.by callagy law account,the employee from insurance administrator said only that a patient plan allows months to appeal.app.internal quotation marks omitted.several months later,an attorney from callagy law,in connection with its representation of spine,requested a copy of the erisa plan documents,which included the time limit for judicial review.callagy law received the plan documents on april.while the parties debate the substance of the november,phone call,it is undisputed that the first time either mirza or callagy law received written notice of the deadline was on april.
on march,almost months after he received the august,denial letter mirza sued insurance administrator for unpaid benefits mirza thereafter filed an amended complaint,this time against both insurance administrator and challenge collectively,defendants,asserting breach of contract count one,and claims under a for violating erisa by improperly denying benefits count two and for an administrator failure to supply requested information count three.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss as to counts one and three neither of which is the subject of this appeal and denied it as to count two.with respect to count two,the district court directed the parties to exchange information on the issue of whether the claim was in light of the plan limitations period.following limited discovery,the district court converted the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment and ruled for defendants.
the district court disposed of mirza claim for benefits through a analysis.first,it held the plan deadline for seeking judicial review was enforceable because it was not unreasonable.next,it observed that,absent equitable tolling,mirza suit was because it was filed more than one year after the final denial of benefits.finally,the district court found mirza was not entitled to equitable tolling because he had notice of the deadline for suing defendants.recognizing there was no evidence that mirza himself was aware of the deadline,the district court imputed callagy law knowledge to mirza.in its view,mirza,through his counsel,was on notice of the time limit well in advance of the august,statute of limitations end date.mirza counsel was notified of the time limit orally on november,and received a copy of the plan on april,in connection with the spine appeal,which dealt with the same patient and same plan.mirza ins.adm r of,wl,at july.because it held mirza had notice of the contractual time limitation,the district court said it did not need to address mirza argument that defendants violated erisa by not specifically informing him of the deadline in the august denial letter 
our approach to this case proceeds along a different path from that taken by the district court because we do not find equitable tolling to be an obstacle,or even relevant,to mirza claim.instead,we focus our analysis on the issue the district court avoided,namely,whether defendants violated their regulatory obligations by failing to include the time limit for seeking judicial review in the letter denying mirza request for benefits we do so because that issue and not equitable tolling controls.
erisa provides that a participant or beneficiary may bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.a b.the statute,however,does not prescribe any limitations period for filing such an action.when a statute does not provide a limitations period for filing a claim,we borrow the statute of limitations from the most analogous claim,which in this case is breach of contract.see hahnemann.hosp.all shore,cir.the parties agree the default limitations period for mirza claim is six years,which is the deadline for filing a breach of contract action under new jersey law.see stat.ann.however,because an erisa plan is nothing more than a contract,parties may agree to a shorter limitations period so long as the contractual period is not unreasonable.see hahnemann,at.
the erisa plan here provides that no legal action may be commenced or maintained to recover benefi
