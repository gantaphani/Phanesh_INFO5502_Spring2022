trustees the trustees of the local pension trust fund the fund appeal from a decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york lewis kaplan,judge granting summary judgment in favor of honerkamp honerkamp and denying the trustees for summary judgment.honerkamp withdrew from the fund after the fund had reached critical status as defined by the pension protection act of the ppa,an amendment to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,and after the collective bargaining agreements cbas requiring honerkamp to contribute to the fund had expired.the trustees sued,arguing that the ppa prevented honerkamp from withdrawing and required the company to make certain ongoing pension contributions pursuant to the fund rehabilitation plan.the district court agreed with honerkamp that the ppa did not forbid its withdrawal or require those contributions.it therefore granted summary judgment to honerkamp and denied the trustees for summary judgment.
on appeal,the trustees argue that the district court misconstrued the ppa in denying their and granting summary judgment to honerkamp.for the reasons that follow,we reject the trustees argument and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
statutory background 
we begin with an overview of the pertinent statutory framework,which provides necessary context for the events of this case 
erisa is a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating employee retirement plans.see generally erisa et,et.congress has amended the law periodically since originally enacting it in.
among other things,erisa was designed to ensure that employees and their beneficiaries would not be deprived of anticipated retirement benefits by the termination of pension plans before sufficient funds have been accumulated in the plans.connolly pension benefit guar,d internal quotation marks omitted.to that end,the statute created an agency,the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc,to administer an insurance system by collecting premiums from covered pension plans and paying out accrued benefits to employees in the event a pension plan has insufficient funds.see erisa,bd.of trs.of conference of teamsters pension trust fund thompson.materials,cir.
b.the mppaa 
one type of pension plan regulated by erisa is the multiemployer pension plan,in which multiple employers pool contributions into a single fund that pays benefits to covered retirees who spent a certain amount of time working for one or more of the contributing employers.plans of this sort offer important advantages to employers and employees alike.for example,employers in certain unionized industries likely would not create their own pension plans because the frequency of companies going into and out of business,and of employees transferring among employers,make plans unfeasible.multiemployer plans allow companies to offer pension benefits to their employees notwithstanding these practicalities,and at the same time to share the financial costs and risks associated with the administration of pension plans.see concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension trust fund for,d.
a key problem of ongoing multiemployer plans,especially in declining industries,is the problem of employer withdrawal.employer withdrawals reduce a plan contribution base.this pushes the contribution rate for remaining employers to higher and higher levels in order to fund past service liabilities,including liabilities generated by employers no longer participating in the plan,inherited liabilities.the rising costs may encourage or force further withdrawals,thereby increasing the inherited liabilities to be funded by an contribution base.this vicious downward spiral may continue until it is no longer reasonable or possible for the pension plan to continue.

erisa as originally enacted did not adequately address and even exacerbated these problems.this was because of certain provisions,which we need not detail here,that had the effects of encouraging employers to withdraw from weak multiemployer pension plans,which they often could do without compensating the plans for the inherited liabilities that remaining participants would incur and encouraging employers who did not withdraw to terminate deteriorating pension plans sooner rather than later.see concrete pipe,at gray,at bd.of trs.of conference of teamsters pension trust fund,at.the potential of widespread termination of pension plans caused by cascading withdrawals threatened to impose too heavy a burden on the pbgc the insurer of protected pension benefits and,in turn,to collapse the plan termination insurance program.gray,at.
in,congress responded to this concern by enacting the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of the mppaa,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of and.under this amendment to erisa,an employer that withdraws from a multiemployer plan is liable to the plan in the amount determined to be the withdrawal liability.erisa a,a.withdrawal liability is the withdrawing employer proportionate share of the pension plan unfunded vested benefits.see gray,at citing erisa.under the mppaa,the employer pays its withdrawal liability in annual installments,which are calculated based on the employer historical contribution amounts.see erisa c,c,c,c.the statute limits the employer obligation to make these payments to years,even if it would take more than payments for the employer to pay its full withdrawal liability.see erisa c b,c b shopmen pension fund disa,cir.
by,a confluence of economic circumstances including the actual or forecasted termination of various large pension plans and the erosion of many employees retirement savings again threatened erisa system for federally insuring multiemployer pension plans.see janice kay mcclendon,the death knell of traditional defined benefit plans avoiding a race to the k bottom,temp.thus,in,congress revisited the problems associated with underfunded pension plans by enacting the pension protection act of,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of and.the law is,totaling approximately one thousand pages,and introduced a number of mechanisms aimed at stabilizing pension plans and ensuring that they remain solvent.see generally sarah burt,note,pension protection a comparative analysis of pension reform in the united states and the united kingdom.int l comp,douglas lineberry,the pension protection act of,law.july,at.
as relevant to this case,the ppa includes measures designed to protect and restore multiemployer pension plans in danger of being unable to meet their pension distribution obligations in the near future.the statute created two categories for such plans endangered and critical.under the ppa,a pension plan is endangered if,inter alia,it is less than eighty percent funded,and it is in critical status if,inter alia,it is less than percent funded.erisa b,b.if a pension plan falls into critical status,the plan sponsor must notify the participating employers and unions,erisa b d,b d,and each participating employer must contribute an additional surcharge of five to ten percent of the contribution amount required under the applicable cba.see erisa e,e.
additionally,upon a multiemployer pension plan entry into critical status,the plan sponsor must adopt a rehabilitation plan to restore the fund financial health going forward 
a rehabilitation plan is a plan which consists of 
i actions,including options or a range of options to be proposed to the employers and unions,formulated,based on reasonably anticipated experience and reasonable actuarial assumptions,to enable the plan to cease to be in critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period and may include reductions in plan expenditures including plan mergers and consolidations,reductions in future benefit accruals or increases in contributions,if agreed to by the employers and unions,or any combination of such actions,or 
ii if the plan sponsor determines that,based on reasonable actuarial assumptions and upon exhaustion of all reasonable measures,the plan can not reasonably be expected to emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period,reasonable measures to emerge from critical status at a later time or to forestall possible insolvency 
erisa e a,e a.the rehabilitation plan must set forth new schedules of reduced benefits and increased contributions,from which participating employers and unions may choose when it is time to negotiate successor cbas.see erisa e,e.one of those schedules must be designated as the default schedule,which assume s that there are no increases in contributions under the plan other than the increases necessary to emerge from critical status after benefits have been reduced to the maximum extent permitted by law.erisa e,e.
most importantly for present purposes,the ppa provides as follows 
c imposition of default schedule where failure to adopt rehabilitation plan 
i in general 
i a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan that was in effect at the time the plan entered critical status expires,and 
ii after receiving one or more schedules from the plan sponsor under a rehabilitation plan,the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the rehabilitation plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor,
the plan sponsor shall implement the default schedule of the rehabilitation plan beginning on the date specified in clause ii.
ii date of implementation 
the date specified in this clause is the date which is days after the date on which the collective bargaining agreement described in clause i expires.
erisa e c,e c.as will be seen,it is this provision and the extent to which it bears on the facts of this case that are at the core of this appeal.
ii.factual background 
the facts,which are not in dispute,are as follows 
the fund is a multiemployer pension plan.the trustees are its sponsor.
honerkamp is a distributor of wood chips operating out of two new york facilities one in the bronx and one in central islip.in early,honerkamp and the bakery drivers local union the union were parties to cbas that covered honerkamp unionized employees in its two facilities.the cbas,which were set to expire in late,obligated honerkamp to contribute to the fund on behalf of the company employees.
in march,the trustees announced that the fund was in critical status as defined by the ppa,see erisa b.b.they therefore began drafting a rehabilitation plan.but they did not expect to complete the rehabilitation plan until late,around the time the two honerkamp cbas were due to expire.because the rehabilitation plan would figure prominently in any negotiations between honerkamp and the union over successor cbas,the two sides agreed to extend the existing bronx and central islip agreements through february and march,respectively.
in november,the trustees finalized the rehabilitation plan,which,as required by the ppa,set forth several new schedules of reduced benefits and increased contributions.see erisa e,e.according to the rehabilitation plan,the trustees had determined that the fund was unlikely to emerge from critical status within the statutory rehabilitation period.see erisa e,e.this was because the employer contribution rates required for such a result would have exceeded the amounts that employers would have had to pay to withdraw from the fund under the mppaa.as explained by the rehabilitation plan,the trustees assum ed that employers would be unwilling to continue to participate if the cost of doing so were to exceed the cost of withdrawing.joint appendix at.the trustees therefore designed four primary,or,schedules to impose approximately the same burden actuarially on employers that a withdrawal from the fund would produce.id.at.participating employers adoption of the schedules was estimated to push back the fund projected date of insolvency from to.
the trustees also included in the rehabilitation plan a default schedule,which,in accordance with the ppa,outlined the fund emergence from critical status.see erisa e,e.but because the trustees believed that the contribution levels required for the fund to emerge from critical status were unrealistic ally high,at,they expected the default schedule to be implemented only if a participating employer and union did not agree on one of the four schedules.presumably,this expectation was due to the earlierexcerpted portion of the ppa that requires a multiemployer pension plan in critical status to implement the default schedule in the event such deadlock persists for days.see erisa e c,e c.
with the rehabilitation plan finalized,honerkamp and the union proceeded to negotiate their successor cbas.they considered the rehabilitation plan schedules as well as the possibility of honerkamp withdrawal from the fund.as part of that consideration,honerkamp requested and the trustees provided an estimate of honerkamp withdrawal liability under the mppaa.
on july,honerkamp sent the union a last,best,and final offer for each facility.both offers provided that,as of august of that year,honerkamp would withdraw from the fund and create instead a k retirement plan for the company employees.the central islip employees voted to ratify the offer and,together with honerkamp,entered into a new cba on august reflecting this change.the bronx employees initially rejected honerkamp offer.with the parties then at an impasse,honerkamp unilaterally implemented its offer withdrawing from the fund in favor of the k plan as permitted by the national labor relations act,et.the bronx employees and honerkamp eventually entered into a new cba in april.like the agreement reached with the central islip employees,the new bronx cba provided for honerkamp withdrawal from the fund in favor of a k plan.
on july,honerkamp informed the trustees that it would be withdrawing from the fund for both locations effective august.the trustees responded that the ppa required honerkamp to contribute to the fund under the rehabilitation plan default schedule if the company and union did not agree to a schedule within days of the cbas expiration.honerkamp countered that withdrawal was permissible and that it would be liable only to pay withdrawal liability as calculated under the mppaa.
iii.procedural background 
in february,the trustees brought this suit against honerkamp.they argued that the ppa prevented honerkamp from withdrawing from the fund after the fund entered critical status.the trustees sought to compel honerkamp to make retroactive and prospective contributions under the rehabilitation plan default schedule.honerkamp moved and the trustees for summary judgment.the magistrate judge submitted to the district court a report and recommendation in favor of summary judgment for honerkamp.following oral argument on the parties motions,the district court adopted the recommendation.
the trustees appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of honerkamp and denial of their for summary judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,which relied entirely on its construction of the ppa.see finkel romanowicz,cir we review de novo a district court application of law to undisputed facts.
ii.the ppa effect on withdrawal 
at issue here is the extent to which the ppa,in these circumstances,abrogates the ability of a participating employer to withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan in critical status.honerkamp claims that it may withdraw from the fund as long as it pays withdrawal liability as calculated under the mppaa.the trustees do not dispute that this would have been correct before the enactment of the ppa.but they contend that under that more recent statute,honerkamp can not withdraw and must continue participating in the fund while contributing in accordance with the rehabilitation plan default schedule.see erisa e c,e c.
to our knowledge,no other court besides the district court in this action has considered whether the ppa prohibits employers from withdrawing from multiemployer pension plans in critic
