opinion of the court 
plaintiffs mark renfro and gerald lustig,representatives of a putative class of participants in a k defined contribution plan,sued defendants unisys and fidelity management trust and its related corporate entities under the employment retirement income security act of erisa,et,for breach of fiduciary duty.plaintiffs alleged defendants inadequately selected a mix and range of investment options to include in the plan.the district court dismissed the fidelity entities,holding they were not fiduciaries with reference to the challenged conduct,dismissed the action holding plaintiffs claims were implausible because the plan mix and range of options was reasonable,and,in the alternative,granted unisys summary judgment motion holding the erisa provisions exempted it from liability.we will affirm the dismissal of the fidelity entities and the dismissal of the action.we will not reach the grant of summary judgment.
the unisys corporation savings plan is a defined contribution plan within the meaning of,which is tax qualified under k.a defined contribution plan promises the participant the value of an individual account at retirement,which is largely a function of the amounts contributed to that account and the investment performance of those contributions.larue dewolff,boberg,d.these plans dominate the retirement plan scene today.id.at.
the unisys plan consists of several investment options as of the filing of the complaint into which unisys employees may allocate contributions.an may contribute up to,but no more than per year,of his or her wages into the plan.unisys then matches half of the participant contribution,capped at of the participant wages,which it invests in the unisys stock fund.participants are fully vested in their accounts.
of the options included in the plan,participants could invest in either of a stable value fund or the unisys stock fund,or one of options provided under trust agreement with fidelity.of the options provided by fidelity,four were commingled pools.commingled pools consist of funds commingled from different sources owning shares in the pool.they are part of a group trust owned by a bank.of the commingled pools included in the unisys plan,one commingled pool invested in an s p index,and three commingled pools invested in bonds.
the remaining investment options were mutual funds.a mutual fund is a pool of assets,consisting primarily of a portfolio of securities,and belonging to the individual investors holding shares in the fund.jones harris assocs,d alterations in original quoting burks lasker,d.mutual funds are organized as investment companies,which are governed by the securities act of,et,and the investment company act of,et.see jones.at.accordingly,they are subject to a variety of reporting,governance,and transparency requirements that do not apply to other investment vehicles such as commingled pools.
the unisys plan mutual funds were added in by way of a trust agreement with fidelity.fidelity,as a directed trustee of the plan,agreed to provide administrative services bundled with the investment options.in return,unisys agreed that any additions to the funds to be managed by fidelity would be fidelity funds.the agreement did not prohibit unisys from adding options to its plan,and administering them itself,or from contracting with another company to administer investments.in fact,in its recitals,the trust agreement stated certain investments were to be held in trust and administered by corestates,a trustee unaffiliated with fidelity.
each mutual fund included in the plan incurred fees for investment management.these fees are set for each mutual fund in an expense ratio a percentage of each contributor assets invested in a particular fund.the plan had a wide variety of risk and expense ratios the expense ratios on the funds included in the unisys plan ranged from to.renfro unisys,dist.lexis,at.april,taking judicial notice of the fees because they were disclosed in prospectuses filed with the securities and exchange commission.these fees pay for,among other things,management of the investments and compliance with securities laws.all fees were disclosed in materials distributed to the participants regardless of these fees,the unisys plan participants appear to strongly prefer mutual fund investments.as of the filing of the complaint,nearly billion of the plan roughly billion worth of assets were invested in these mutual funds.
plaintiffs sued unisys and the fidelity entities in the united states district court in the central district of california alleging breach of fiduciary duty under and a,and for equitable relief under a relating to defendants selection for inclusion and maintenance of investment options in the unisys plan.the case was transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania.
while the case was pending,the supreme court issued its decisions in bell atlantic twombly,d,and aschroft iqbal,d,addressing pleading standards.plaintiffs sought and were granted leave to file an amended complaint and a second amended complaint,which was filed on september,
in the complaint,plaintiffs allege that unisys and the fidelity entities breached their duties of loyalty and prudence by selecting and retaining retail mutual funds in the range of investment options.specifically,plaintiffs contend the administrative fees governed by the trust agreement,and the fees associated with each retail mutual fund,are excessive in light of the services rendered as compared to other,less expensive,investment options not included in the plan.these allegations focus on the inclusion of retail mutual funds,which are available to individual investors with small investments as well as to large erisa funds such as unisys.plaintiffs allege unisys could have selected investments having lower fees than mutual funds used the size of its plan as leverage to bargain for lower fee rates on mutual funds.
both the fidelity entities and unisys moved to dismiss under.b.see renfro,dist.lexis,at.the fidelity entities contended they were not fiduciaries with respect to the challenged conduct and,relying on the seventh circuit decision in hecker deere,cir,supplemented by cir,that plaintiffs had failed to plead a plausible breach of fiduciary duty.in addition,the fidelity entities argued plaintiffs claims were barred by erisa limitation period.unisys similarly argued plaintiffs did not adequately plead a breach of fiduciary duty.in the alternative,unisys moved for summary judgment under.c,contending erisa safe harbor provision,c a ii,shielded it from liability because the alleged losses were the aggregate result of the participants own investment decisions.
the district court denied the statute of limitations motion on the ground that erisa fiduciary breaches are continuing violations that accrue each time a plan incurs a loss as a result of a breach.but the court granted the fidelity entities motion to dismiss,concluding as a matter of law under the trust agreement that fidelity and its related corporate entities were not fiduciaries with respect to the challenged conduct because they did not exercise control over the inclusion of investment options in the plan.renfro,dist.lexis,at.the court also granted the defendants motion to dismiss on the grounds the complaint failed to state a claim because the plan offered a sufficient mix of investments for their participants such that no rational trier of fact could find,on the basis of the facts alleged in the operative complaint,that the unisys defendants breached an erisa fiduciary duty by offering this particular array of investment vehicles.id.at quoting hecker,at.in the alternative,the court granted unisys motion for summary judgment,finding erisa section c shielded unisys from liability for any alleged breach because the participants chose the investment options into which they allocated their contributions.id.at.
plaintiffs timely appealed.
our review of a rule b motion to dismiss is plenary.leveto lapina,cir.rule b permits dismissal of complaints for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.b.the question is not whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail but whether their complaint was sufficient to cross the federal court threshold.skinner switzer,d internal citations and quotations omitted.because federal rule of civil procedure a requires a showing,rather than a blanket assertion,of entitlement to relief,courts evaluating the viability of a complaint under rule b must look beyond conclusory statements and determine whether the complaint factual allegations,taken as true,are enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.in re ins.brokerage antitrust,cir quoting twombly,at.but plaintiffs need only allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.matrixx initiatives,siracusano,d quoting twombly,at.accordingly,we must examine the context of a claim,including the underlying substantive law,in order to assess its plausibility.see ins.brokerage,at.
erisa is a comprehensive and reticulated statute,the product of a decade of congressional study of the nation private employee benefit system.mertens hewitt,d internal quotation omitted.in enacting erisa,congress resolved innumerable disputes between powerful competing interests not all in favor of potential plaintiffs.id.at.because congress did not require employers to establish benefit plans in the first place erisa represents a careful balancing between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creation of such plans.conkright frommert,d internal quotations and citations omitted.accordingly,congress sought to induc e employers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of liabilities,under uniform standards of primary conduct and a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and awards when a violation has occurred.rush prudential hmo,moran,d.to that end,erisa authorizes six distinct civil actions that may be brought by various parties under delineated circumstances,including actions by plan participants to remedy a breach of fiduciary duty.see larue,at.
erisa requires each plan to have one or more named fiduciaries that are granted the authority to manage the operation and administration of the plan.a.but by erisa definition 
a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent 
i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,
ii he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation,direct or indirect,with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan,or has any authority or responsibility to do so,or 
iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.such term includes any person designated under section c b of this title.
a.because an entity is only a fiduciary to the extent it possesses authority or discretionary control over the plan,see in re unisys.retiree med.benefits erisa litig.unisys iii,cir,we must ask whether the entity is a fiduciary with respect to the particular activity in question,srein frankford trust,cir internal quotation omitted.in every case charging breach of erisa fiduciary duty,then,the threshold question is not whether the actions of some person employed to provide services under a plan adversely affected a plan beneficiary interest,but whether that person was acting as a fiduciary that is,was performing a fiduciary function when taking the action subject to complaint.pegram herdrich,d.
erisa imposes statutory duties on fiduciaries that relate to the proper management,administration,and investment of fund assets,with an eye toward ensuring that the benefits authorized by the plan are ultimately paid to participants and beneficiaries.larue,at quoting.mut.life ins.russell,d.accordingly,an erisa fiduciary is required to 
discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and 
a for the exclusive purpose of 
i providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and 
ii defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan 
b with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.
the fiduciary standard is flexible,such that the adequacy of a fiduciary independent investigation and ultimate investment selection is evaluated in light of the character and aims of the particular type of plan he serves.in re unisys sav.plan litig.unisys i,cir internal quotation omitted.and an erisa fiduciary acts prudently when it gives appropriate consideration to those facts and circumstances that,given the scope of such fiduciary investment duties,the fiduciary knows or should know are relevant to the investment course of action involved a b i.accordingly,in evaluating a questioned decision,we have focused on a fiduciary conduct in arriving at that investment decision.unisys i,at.but we have also approved of an approach examining whether a questioned decision led to objectively prudent investments.see in re unisys sav.plan litig.unisys ii,cir approving of the hypothetical prudent investor test see also roth sawyer cleator lumber,cir even if a trustee failed to conduct an investigation before making a decision,he is insulated from liability if a hypothetical prudent fiduciary would have made the same decision anyway.fink sav.trust,scalia,concurring in part and dissenting in part contending a fiduciary should not be liable for damages when,regardless of its failure to investigate beforehand,it made or held objectively prudent investments.
we first turn to the dismissal of the fidelity defendants.fidelity concedes it was a fiduciary under the plan because it was a directed trustee with respect to certain assets and administrative functions.but the parties contest whether fidelity and its related corporate entities were fiduciaries with respect to the challenged conduct of selecting and retaining investment options in the unisys plan.plaintiffs proceed under three theories to assert that fidelity and its related corporate entities were fiduciaries with reference to the challenged conduct,or otherwise could be liable for restitution.
plaintiffs contend that fidelity,by virtue of its role as a directed trustee,functioned as a fiduciary with reference to the claimed breach.as noted,erisa requires every plan to have one or more named fiduciaries.a.erisa also requires plan assets to be held in trust.id.a.a directed trustee,such as fidelity,is a fiduciary subject to proper directions of one of the plan named fiduciaries.see id.a.
the trust agreement appointing fidelity as a directed trustee limited fidelity role to hold and invest plan assets in trust among several investment options selected by the applicable fiduciary,and to perform recordkeeping and administrative services for the plan if the services are purely ministerial in nature and are provided within a framework of plan provisions,guidelines and interpretations conveyed in writing to fidelity by the administrator.the agreement expressly disclaimed any role for fidelity in selecting investment options,stating,fidelity entities shall have no responsibility for the selection of investment options under the trust,instead,the agreement required that fidelity be explicitly direct ed as to what investment options plan participants may invest in.fidelity limited role as a directed trustee,delineated in the trust agreement,does not encompass the activities alleged as a breach of fiduciary duty the selection and maintenance of the mix and range of investment options included in the plan.as we have explained,a directed trustee is essentially immune from judicial inquiry because it lacks discretion,taking instructions from the plan that it is required to follow.see moench robertson,cir.
contrary to plaintiffs assertion,the agreement unambiguous amendment provisions do not undermine this allocation of authority.section b of the trust agreement allows for amendment of the investment options included in the trust agreement by mutual agreement of the parties.fidelity entities were required to give their consent in order for funds to be added to the group of plan investments it administers.this provision extends fidelity control only over which investments were to be administered by fidelity and not over which investments were selected for inclusion in the plan as a whole.unisys remained free to add investments to the unisys plan and to administer such investments itself or contract that function to another party.in fact,the trust agreement recitals state unisys intended to add other investments to a trust to be managed by corestates.fidelity had no contractual authority to control the mix and range of investment options,to veto unisys selections,or to constrain unisys from including other investment options in the plan administered by an entity other than fidelity.it therefore did not a function as a fiduciary with respect to selecting and maintaining the range of investment options in the plan.accordingly,fidelity status as a directed trustee does not subject it to liability for these activities.
plaintiffs also contend fidelity is liable for any breach by unisys as a under a.this section provides 
in addition to any liability which he may have under any other provisions of this part,a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall be liable for a breach of fiduciary responsibility of another fiduciary with respect to the same plan in the following circumstances 
if he participates knowingly in,or knowingly undertakes to conceal,an act or omission of such other fiduciary,knowing such act or omission is a breach 
if,by his failure to comply with section a of this title in the administration of his specific responsibilities which give rise to his status as a fiduciary,he has enabled such other fiduciary to commit a breach or 
if he has knowledge of a breach by such other fiduciary,unless he makes reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach.
as noted,fidelity is a directed trustee of the plan owing fiduciary duties with respect to the limited authority and discretion it exercises.at the outset,we note a party does not act as a fiduciary with respect to the terms in the service agreement if it does not control the named fiduciary negotiation and approval of those terms.hecker,at see also chi.dist.council of carpenters welfare fund caremark,cir.when a person who has no relationship to an erisa plan is negotiating a contract with that plan,he has no authority over or responsibility to the plan and presumably is unable to exercise any control over the trustees decision whether or not,and on what terms,to enter into an agreement with him.such a person is not an erisa fiduciary with respect to the terms of the agreement for his compensation.krear nineteen named,cir.plaintiffs allege unisys selected investment options with excessive fees caused by a fee structure negotiated between unisys and fidelity for included mutual funds.fidelity owes no fiduciary duty with respect to the negotiation of its fee compensation by unisys.moreover,fidelity was not yet a plan fiduciary at the time it negotiated the fee compensation with unisys.
even assuming fidelity subsequent assumption of the role of directed trustee could subject it to liability for a breach by unisys relating to the mix and range of investment options in the plan,including risk and fee profiles,sections a and require actual knowledge of the breach under this rule,the fiduciary must know the other person is a fiduciary with respect to the plan,must know that he participated in the act that constituted a breach,and must know that it was a breach.donovan cunningham,cir quoting.plaintiffs claims fail because they do not contend fidelity had knowledge about unisys allegedly flawed process regarding investment options to be included in the plan.in fact,by contending that fidelity failed adequately to review the plan fees in light of the size of the plan assets,plaintiffs effectively concede fidelity did not possess actual knowledge of unisys alleged breach.see second am.compl.b,similarly,plaintiffs do not allege fidelity knew unisys selection of investment options constituted a breach of fiduciary duty.accordingly,plaintiffs fail to state a claim against fidelity under a.
finally,plaintiffs contend the fidelity entities are liable for restitution under a,which provides a civil action may be brought 
by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary 
a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or 
b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief 
i to redress such violations or 
ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
we have held this provision authorizes direct suits against fiduciaries for breach of their duty.see bixler central.teamsters health welfare fund,cir.but two years after bixler,in reich compton,cir,we examined whether the secretary of labor could bring suit under a against nonfiduciaries alleged to have participated in a breach of fiduciary duty.we noted the supreme court dictum in mertens,at,expressed considerable doubt that a authorizes suits against nonfiduciaries who participate in fiduciary breaches.reich,at.finding this dictum persuasive and noting that the language shared by sections a and a should be deemed to have the same meaning,id.at quoting mertens,at,we held that the secretary of labor could not bring suit under a against nonfiduciaries charged solely with participating in a fiduciary breach,id.
in light of reich,and interpreting identical language,we find mertens persuasive and hold that a does not authorize suit against nonfiduciaries charged solely with participating in a fiduciary breach.reich,at.because,as previously discussed,the fidelity entities did not act as fiduciaries with respect to the alleged breach,they may not be sued under this section for acts taken in a nonfiduciary role.
accordingly,we will affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint against the fidelity defendants.
as for the claims against unisys,it appears to concede it is a fiduciary with respect to the selection and maintenance of the plan mix and range of investment options.but the parties contest whether,given the composition of the mix and range,plaintiffs have plausibly pleaded a breach of fiduciary duty.
in this case,the putative class frames its complaint as a challenge against the selection and periodic evaluation of the unisys defined contribution plan mix and range of investment options.plaintiffs do not challenge the prudence of the inclusion of any particular investment option.specifically,plaintiffs take issue with the inclusion of an array of fidelity retail mutual funds funds that are available on the same terms to individual investors in the open market.plaintiffs also allege the fees on the mutual fund options are excessive in comparison to the services rendered,both as compared to other mutual funds and to other types of investments unisys could have selected for inclusion in the plan.within this rubric,plaintiffs point to the structure of fidelity fee compensation on the mutual funds,which is in part calculated as a percentage of the total assets in the funds.plaintiffs contend the services required to administer mutual funds do not vary based on the aggregate amount of assets in the funds.rather,they contend fees should be calculated on a basis.in addition,because the plan includes only a few other investment vehicles such as commingled funds and company stock,plaintiffs argue this plausibly demonstrates unisys breached its fiduciary duties in composing the mix and range of investment options included in the plan in sum,plaintiffs challenge the k plan as a whole,alleging unisys inadequately investigated and selected investment options into which plan participants could choose to allocate their contributions.
two sister circuits have evaluated similar complaints at the motion to dismiss stage.see hecker,braden wal mart stores,cir.hecker and braden share a similar analytical framework for evaluating an erisa breach of fiduciary duty claim targeting the selection and maintenance of a mix and range of investment options in a k de
