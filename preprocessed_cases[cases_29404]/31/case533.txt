employees of an insurance company complain that the defendants violated their rights under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,by failing to discharge them when the company faced imminent dissolution and by maladministering their retirement benefit plan.they argue that,through their erisa violations,the defendants denied them the opportunity to receive enhanced retirement benefits.we find no violation of erisa,and thus affirm the district court dismissal of all claims.
were employees collectively,the employees of employers casualty company ecc and participants in ecc employment retirement plan the plan,a pension plan governed by erisa.in october,ecc was suffering financial difficulties.it implemented a reduction in force and amended the plan to allow certain participants to receive enhanced retirement benefits enhanced benefits.a participant qualified for enhanced benefits if he or she was selected for termination between october and december,first window for the stated reason of workforce reduction or job elimination satisfied certain age and service requirements and filed a written election to receive such benefits with the committee administering the plan.
because of continuing financial difficulties,on march,a texas state court placed ecc under the control of a conservator,the texas commissioner of insurance.the conservator engaged coopers lybrand coopers to provide management services to ecc.
there was no economic turnaround.ecc again amended the plan on may,retroactively extending the time during which a participant could become eligible for enhanced benefits to include the period from january through december,second window.financial problems persisted,and,on november,ecc amended the plan to extend the eligibility period to december,third window.on december,the ecc board of directors adopted a final amendment to the plan,freezing the plan as of december,freeze amendment.no one who was not already a participant on that date could thereafter become a participant,and no further increases in accrued benefits for existing participants could occur.
as of december,about employees were eligible for enhanced benefits,ninety percent of whom were terminated by december under the authority of ecc officers and coopers lybrand.approximately eligible employees were not terminated by december,and thus were not allowed to receive the enhanced benefits for which they would have qualified.all of the employees were in this latter group,and several of them had specifically asked that their employment be terminated on or before december.
almost every ecc officer who satisfied the age and service requirements for enhanced benefits arranged to be terminated before december,some whose duties were not eliminated.in some cases,terminated employees were then rehired as independent contractors.the employees were not given this opportunity.
on november,in anticipation of a receivership order,the commissioner appointed jack webb as the special deputy receiver.the commissioner instructed webb to create a detailed activity plan that projects the expected fees,expenses,and timelines required to close the ecc estate.webb was also required to review personnel and retain only those essential to liquidating the company.
on january,the texas court withdrew the conservator and appointed the commissioner as temporary receiver,at which point coopers role as consultant ceased.on this date,ecc corporate existence also ceased,the company became ecc in receivership eccr,and the employees were immediately hired to perform services for eccr.by order dated february,the commissioner became permanent receiver.over the course of,eccr terminated all employees employment.
while winding down eccr operations,eccr and its webb and three others collectively,receivership defendants liquidated the plan assets in may.the receivership defendants transferred some of the plan assets to the prudential insurance company of america and hartford life insurance together,insurer defendants,in exchange for annuities to fund the pension benefits of plan participants.these annuities did not include enhanced benefits for the employees,but did include enhanced benefits for employees who had qualified and made the necessary elections under the terms of the plan.excess assets were transferred to eccr,or otherwise used for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of plan participants,beneficiaries,and administrative expenses.
on december,the employees filed a complaint in the southern district of texas,alleging various erisa violations by ecc,ecc officers,and coopers collectively,employer defendants,as well as the receivership defendants,the plan,and the insurer defendants before responding to the complaint,the receivership defendants filed for injunctions in the texas state courts in which the receivership proceedings were being conducted.on september,the federal district court administratively closed this case and granted the parties leave to reinstate at such time as they deemed appropriate.the state district courts issued the requested injunctions and orders prohibiting the employees from pursuing this cause of action.the texas court of appeals reversed the lower courts and the texas supreme court denied a petition for review.on june,the state district courts vacated all injunctions applicable to the employees.
this case was reinstated on february,and was referred to the magistrate judge for full pretrial management.defendants filed various motions to dismiss and,after a period of discovery,the magistrate judge issued a recommendation that the motions to dismiss be granted.after the employees filed objections,the magistrate judge revised her recommendation and issued a supplemental memorandum.the district court adopted the revised recommendation,and entered an order dismissing all claims against all defendants.
the employees filed a timely notice of appeal.
we review a dismissal for failure to state a claim under.b de novo.oliver scott,cir.we now take up,in order,the employees claims that the employer defendants violated erisa,by failing to terminate the employees the employer defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the employees under erisa a,a,by failing to terminate them the receivership defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the employees by failing to administer the plan in accordance with erisa provision,g,g the receivership defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the employees by transferring plan assets in violation of erisa a d,a d and the plan and the insurer defendants are properly named as defendants to this action as necessary parties although neither is charged with violating any rights of the employees.
we first consider whether the employees state a valid claim against the employer defendants under erisa,for failure to terminate them so as to make the employees eligible for enhanced benefits the district court,in adopting the magistrate judge recommendation,found that the employees had not shown any authority for a claim based on the retention of the claimants.similarly,it held that the employees made no allegations against the employer defendants that implicate the sort of unscrupulous behavior that was intended to prohibit.
the employees challenge the district court holding,arguing that,given the lack of material business reasons to treat the employees differently from their fellow employees who were terminated by december,per the job elimination program,the failure of the employer defendants to terminate them constituted impermissible discrimination under.they also seem to argue,if only implicitly,that in prohibiting various actions meant to interfere with pension benefit rights,prohibits the passive act of retention for the same purpose.the employees admit that there is no precedent for sustaining such that the statutory text speaks in terms of discharge and other disciplinary they seem to suggest that this action nevertheless falls neatly within the general scope of erisa.
to sustain a valid claim,an employee must show prohibited adverse employer action taken for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which the employee is entit
