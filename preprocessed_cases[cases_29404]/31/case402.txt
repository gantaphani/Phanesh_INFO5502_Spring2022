in this employee retirement income security act of erisa case,an employer was deemed to have wrongly transferred assets from a pension plan that enjoyed a separate account feature to a pension plan that lacked one.although the transfers were voluntary and the employer guaranteed that the value of the transferred assets would not fall below the amount,an internal revenue service audit resulted in a determination that the transfers nonetheless violated the law.
plaintiffs,who held such separate accounts and agreed to the transfers,brought suit under erisa and sought disgorgement of,an accounting for profits as to,any gains the employer retained from the transaction.the district court dismissed their case,holding that they lacked statutory and article iii standing.for the reasons that follow,we disagree and hold that plaintiffs have both statutory and article iii standing.further,we hold that plaintiffs claim is not.accordingly,we reverse and remand the matter for further proceedings.
in,the bank amended its plan the k plan to give eligible participants a opportunity to transfer their account balances to its plan the pension plan.the pension plan provided that participants who transferred their account balances would have the same menu of investment options that they did in the k plan.further,the bank amended the pension plan to provide the guarantee that participants who elected to make the transfer would receive,at a minimum,the value of the original balance of their k plan accounts the transfer guarantee.
the k plan participants accounts reflected the actual gains and losses of their investment options.in other words,the money that k plan participants directed to be invested in particular investment options was actually invested in those investment options,and k plan participants accounts reflected the investment options net performance.
by contrast,pension plan participants accounts reflected the hypothetical gains and losses of their investment options.although pension plan participants selected investment options,this investment was purely notional.by design,pension plan participants selected investment options had no bearing on how pension plan assets were actually invested.instead,the bank invested pension plan assets in investments of its choosing periodically crediting each pension plan participant account with the greater of the hypothetical performance of the participant selected investment option,or the transfer guarantee.
plaintiffs william pender and david mccorkle collectively with those similarly situated,plaintiffs are among the eligible participants who elected to transfer their account balances.participants who elected to transfer their k plan balances to the pension plan may not have appreciated the difference between the plans,particularly if they maintained their original investment options.but for the bank,each transfer represented an opportunity to make money as long as the bank actual investments provided a higher rate of return than pension plan participants hypothetical investments,the bank would retain the spread.and although the spread generated by each account might have been relatively small,in the aggregate and over time,this strategy could yield substantial gains for the bank 
to illustrate by way of example,consider k plan participants jack and jill.they each have account balances of,and each has selected the same investment option,which generates a percent return over a year period.jack decides to keep his k plan account,and jill decides to make the transfer to the pension plan.
when jill transfers her assets to the pension plan,she selects the same percent return investment option she had in the k plan.but instead of actually investing the jill transferred to the pension plan according to her selected investment option,the bank periodically notes the value that her assets would have gained on her selected investment options but actually invests it in an investment portfolio that generates a percent return over years.
fast forward ten years jack actual investment of the initial generates in actual returns.jill hypothetical investment of the she transferred from the k plan to the pension plan generates in investment credits.the accounts are both valued at.
jack k plan account balance represents the full value of the initial balance plus his actual investment performance.but the balance of jill pension plan account does not represent the full value of the that she transferred from the k plan and the actual investment performance of that money.because the bank actually invested that money in investment options with a percent return over the period,it generated.due to the difference between the bank actual rate of return and the rate of return of jill selected investment option,the bank retains after it credits her pension plan account with.the spread between the actual investment returns and the hypothetical returns may be small on the individual account level for jill pension plan account.but it is greater than the amount of money the bank stands to gain from jack account.and with the thousands of jills working for a large employer like the bank,it has the potential to add up.
in the wake of a june wall street journal article covering these types of retirement plan transfers the internal revenue service opened an audit of the bank plans.in,the irs issued a technical advice memorandum,in which it concluded that the transfers of k plan participants assets to the pension plan between and violated internal revenue code d and treasury regulation d,q a a.according to the irs,the transfers impermissibly eliminated the k plan participants separate account feature,meaning that participants were no longer being credited with the actual gains and losses generated by funds contributed on the participant s behalf.
in may,the bank and the irs entered into a closing agreement.under the terms of the agreement,the bank paid a million fine to the treasury,set up a k plan,and transferred pension plan assets that were initially transferred from the k plan to the k plan.the bank also agreed to make an additional payment to participants who had elected to transfer their assets from the k plan to the pension plan if the cumulative total return of their hypothetical investments was less than a certain amount all transfers were finalized by.
plaintiffs filed their original complaint against the bank in the district court for the southern district of illinois in,alleging several erisa violations stemming from plan amendments and transfers.the bank moved under a to change venue,and the case was transferred to the western district of north carolina.there,the district court dismissed three of the four counts contained in the complaint.see mccorkle bank of america,cir.
plaintiffs lone remaining claim alleges a violation of erisa g,g which states that an participant accrued benefit may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan unless specifically provided for in erisa or regulations promulgated pursuant to erisa.according to plaintiffs,the bank improperly decreased the accrued benefit of the separate account feature.relying,at least in part,upon the irs declaration that the transfers from the k plan to the pension plan violated both treasury regulation d,q a a and the statute it implements,d a,plaintiffs sought to use erisa civil enforcement provision,erisa a,a,to recover the profits the bank retained after it transferred the effected pension plan accounts to the k plan.
at the hearing on the parties for summary judgment,the bank argued that its closing agreement with the irs stripped plaintiffs of article iii standing because it restored the separate account feature,and the statute of limitations barred plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs countered with a request for declarations that they are entitled to any spread between what they were paid and the actual investment gains of the assets that were originally in the k plan,and the agreement between the bank and the irs did not extinguish their erisa claims.the district court granted the bank motion,denied plaintiffs motion,and dismissed the case on the basis that plaintiffs lacked standing.pender bank of am,cv gcm,wl,at.plaintiffs appealed.

on appeal,plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to the full value of the investment gains the bank realized using the assets transferred to the pension plan.to assert such a claim under erisa,plaintiffs must possess both statutory and article iii standing,david,at,which we now respectively address.
to show statutory standing,plaintiffs must identify the portion of erisa that entitles them to bring the claim for the relief they seek.plaintiffs argue that erisa a b,which allows a beneficiary to recover benefits due under the terms of the plan,enables them to bring their claim.in the alternative,they argue that sections a and a also entitle them to the relief they seek.we consider each.
under erisa a b,a civil action may be brought by a participant or a beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.emphases added.plaintiffs argue that erisa a b is the proper section under which to bring a claim for benefits due based on a misapplied formula and that the bank misapplied the formula when it failed to administer the plan in a manner consistent with erisa minimum standards.appellants br.at emphasis omitted.however,cigna amara,explicitly precludes them from using this provision to recover the relief they seek.
in amara,as here,the plaintiffs sought to enforce the plan not as written,but as it should properly be enforced under erisa.the district court ordered the terms of the plan reformed and then enforced the changed plan.id.at.but as the supreme court underscored,t he statutory language speaks of enforcing the terms of the plan,not of changing them.id.at internal quotation marks,citation,and emphasis omitted.indeed,nothing suggest ed that section a b authorizes a court to alter those terms where that change,akin to the reform of a contract,seems less like the simple enforcement of a contract as written and more like an equitable remedy.id.at.
here,as in amara,plaintiffs requested remedy would require the court to do more than simply enforce a contract as written.rather,as we will soon discuss,what they ask sounds in equity.accordingly,section a b provides no avenue for bringing their claim.
under erisa a,a plan beneficiary may bring a civil action for appropriate relief when a plan fiduciary breaches its statutorily imposed responsibilities,obligations,or duties,erisa.plaintiffs argue that they may seek relief under section a because the bank breached a fiduciary obligation by failing to act with the best interest of participants in mind and by ignor ing the terms of the amendments to the extent the amendments were inconsistent with erisa.however,again plaintiffs claim is precluded by supreme court precedent because pegram herdrich,bars recovery under this provision.
unlike traditional trustees who are bound by the duty of loyalty to trust beneficiaries,erisa fiduciaries may wear two hats.employers,for example,can be erisa fiduciaries and still take actions to the disadvantage of employee beneficiaries,when they act as employers,firing a beneficiary for reasons unrelated to the erisa plan,or even as plan sponsors,modifying the terms of a plan as allowed by erisa to provide less generous benefits.pegram,at.thus,the threshold question we must ask here is whether the bank acted as a fiduciary when taking the action subject to complaint.id.at.
under erisa,a person is a fiduciary a plan to the extent that he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or its assets,renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation,or has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.erisa a,a.accordingly,the bank is a fiduciary only to the extent that it acts in one of these three capacities.
as we read count iv of plaintiffs fourth amended complaint,plaintiffs one remaining claim,they assert two fiduciary breaches the bank breached a fiduciary duty when it amended the k plan and pension plan to permit the transfers and the bank breached a fiduciary duty when it permitted the voluntary transfers between the plans.neither holds water.
the first claim fails because p lan sponsors who alter the terms of a plan do not fall into the category of fiduciaries.lockheed spink.instead,these actions are analogous to those of trust settlors.id.
the second claim fails for the simple reason that the bank did not exercise discretion regarding the transfers.the transfers between the k plan and the pension plan occurred only for those plan participants who affirmatively and voluntarily directed the bank to take such action.because following participants directives did not involve discretionary plan administration so as to trigger fiduciary liability as required under erisa a,that action can not support an erisa a claim.
finally,under section a,a plan beneficiary may obtain appropriate equitable relief to redress any act or practice which violates erisa provisions contained in a certain subchapter of the united states code.to determine whether section a applies to these facts,we must answer two questions did the transfers violate a covered erisa provision and if so,does the relief plaintiffs seek constitute appropriate equitable relief within the meaning of the statute the answer to both questions is yes.
erisa g,which is also known as the provision,is a covered provision under section a.it provides that a plan amendment may not decrease a participant accrued benefit.erisa b,b,defines the accrued benefit in a k plan as the balance of the individual account.in the technical advice memorandum,the irs concluded that the transfers between the k plan and the pension plan violated d and treasury regulation d,q a.see.d language nearly identical to erisa g that a plan amendment may not decrease a participant accrued benefit.treasury regulation d,q a a,which implements d,further provides that the separate account feature of an employee benefit under a defined contribution plan is a protected benefit within the meaning of d.
according to the irs interpretation of the relevant statutes and regulations,separate account feature describes the mechanism by which a defined contribution plan accounts for contributions and actual thereon allocated to a specific defined contribution plan participant with the risk of investment experience being borne by the participant.in a defined contribution plan like the k plan,assets are actually invested in participants chosen investment.k plan participants bear the investment risk,but this is unproblematic because their account balances are identical to the actual performance of their actual investments.
by contrast,because pension plan participants investments are hypothetical,there is no guaranteed correlation between their account balances and the assets available to cover pension plan liabilities.depending on the success of the bank actual investments,the pension plan assets may lack sufficient funds to satisfy all of its liabilities or may run a surplus.
turning to a textual analysis,we insert the relevant language from section b into section g the balance of the individual account may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan the transfer guarantee provides assurances that individuals will receive no less than the monetary value of their k plan accounts at the time of transferred funds will not decrease below a certain threshold even if,for example,it invests pension plan assets poorly and loses the money is not the same as actually not decreasing the account balance.it brings to mind the instructive,even if distinguishable difference between making a loan that the borrower promises to repay and leaving your money in your bank account.assuming all goes well,the end result may well be the same but they plainly are not the same thing.
in essence,section g prohibition against amendments that decrease defined contribution plan participants account balances is a variation on a trustee duty to preserve trust property.see restatement second of trusts.an erisa plan sponsor is under no duty to ensure that defined contribution plan participants do not decrease their account balances through their own actions.but the plan sponsor can not take actions that decrease participant account balances.
for these reasons,and in light of the similarities between d and erisa g,and the irs persuasive analysis,we hold that a defined contribution plan separate account feature constitutes an accrued benefit that may not be decreased by amendment of the plan under section g.the transfers at issue here resulted in a loss of the separate account feature and thus violated section g.
although the bank violation of section g is a necessary component of plaintiff claim for relief under section a,that violation alone is insufficient to confer statutory standing.plaintiffs must also seek appropriate equitable relief.this,they do.
the supreme court has interpreted the term appropriate equitable relief,as used in section a,to refer to those categories of relief that,traditionally speaking,prior to the merger of law and equity were typically available in equity.amara.at quoting sereboff mid atl.med,internal quotation marks omitted.further,because section a functions as a safety net,offering appropriate equitable relief for injuries caused by violations that does not elsewhere adequately remedy,varity howe,equitable relief will not normally be appropriate if relief is available under another subsection of section a.id.at.
here,plaintiffs seek the difference between the actual investment gains the bank realized using the assets transferred to the pension plan,and the transferred assets hypothetical investment performance,which the bank has already paid pension plan participants.in other words,plaintiffs seek the profit the bank made using their assets.this is the hornbook definition of an accounting for profits.
an accounting for profits is a restitutionary remedy based upon avoiding unjust enrichment.dobbs,law of remedies,ed hereinafter dobbs.it requires the disgorgement of profits produced by property which in equity and good conscience belonged to the plaintiff.id.it is akin to a constructive trust,but lacks the requirement that plaintiffs identify a particular res containing the profits sought to be recovered.great life annuity ins.knudson,citing dobbs,at,at.
in knudson,the supreme court expressly noted that,unlike other restitutionary remedies,an accounting for profits is an equitable remedy.at.the court also suggested that an accounting for profits would support a claim under section a in the appropriate circumstances.see id.noting that the petitioners did not claim profits produced by certain proceeds and were not entitled to those proceeds.this case presents those appropriate circumstances.
unlike the petitioners in knudson,plaintiffs seek profits generated using assets that belonged to them.and,as explained above,section a other subsections do not afford plaintiffs any relief.if section g proscription against decreasing accrued benefits is to have any teeth,the available remedies must be able to reach situations like the one this case presents,where a plan sponsor benefits from an erisa violation,but plan participants perhaps through luck or agency no monetary loss.see mccravy met.life ins,cir w ith amara,the supreme court clarified that various equitable remedies are indeed available to erisa plaintiffs o therwise,the stifled state of the law interpreting section a would encourage abuse.because it holds the defendant liable for his profits,not for damages,dobbs,at,the equitable remedy of accounting for profits adequately addresses this concern.amalgamated clothing textile workers union,afl cio murdock,cir holding that a constructive trust was an important,appropriate,and available remedy under section a for breach of trust,even when plaintiffs had received their actuarially vested plan benefits.
in sum,plaintiffs have statutory standing under section a to bring their claim.
the bank argues that even if it violated certain provisions of erisa,the district court properly granted summary judgment because plaintiffs lack article iii standing.the bank argues that the transfers from the pension plan to the k plan mooted any injury.
for the federal courts to have jurisdiction,plaintiffs must possess standing under article iii,of the constitution.see david,at.there exist three irreducible minimum requirements for article iii

our analysis first focuses on whether plaintiffs have demonstrated an injury in fact.the crux of the bank standing argument is that plaintiffs have not suffered a financial loss.we,however,agree with the third circuit that a financial loss is not a prerequisite for article iii standing to bring a disgorgement claim under erisa.edmonson lincoln nat.life ins,cir,cert.denied.see also vander luitgaren sun life ins.of canada,cv,wl,at,rejecting argument that plaintiff lacked standing to sue for disgorgement of profit earned via a retained asset account 
as an initial matter,it goes without saying that the supreme court has never limited the requirement to financial losses otherwise even grievous constitutional rights violations may well not qualify as an injury.instead,an injury refers to the invasion of some legally protected interest arising from constitutional,statutory,or common law.lujan defenders of wildlife.indeed,the interest may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,standing is gauged by the specific,statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.int l primate prot.league adm rs of tulane educ.fund.we therefore examine the principles that underlie plaintiffs claim for an accounting for profits under erisa a to discern whether there exists a legally protected interest.
it is blackletter law that a plaintiff seeking an accounting for profits need not suffer a financial loss.see dobbs,at accounting holds the defendant liable for his profits,not damages.see also restatement third on restitution and unjust enrichment cmt.a noting that the object of an accounting is to strip the defendant of a wrongful gain.requiring a financial loss for disgorgement claims would effectively ensure that wrongdoers could profit from their unlawful acts as long as the wronged party suffers no financial loss.we reject that notion.edmonson,at 
as the third circuit recently a fiduciary breach case that,while distinguishable,we nevertheless find a plaintiff seeking an accounting for profits to demonstrate a financial loss would allow those with obligations under erisa to profit from their erisa violations,so long as the plan and plan beneficiaries suffer no financial loss.edmonson,at.such a result would be hard to square with the overall tenor of erisa,a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.ingersoll rand mcclendon,internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,it would directly contradict erisa provision covering liability for breach of fiduciary duty,which requires a fiduciary who breaches any of his or her statutory responsibilities,obligations,or duties to restore any profits to the plan.erisa a.
