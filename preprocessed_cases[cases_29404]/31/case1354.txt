these consolidated proceedings involve the question whether a health care service plan may enforce an arbitration clause contained in the plan and in related subscriber agreements which does not comply with the statutory disclosure requirements applicable to such clauses.in case no,the petitioner,george rivera,seeks a writ of mandate vacating a trial court order granting the motion of the real party in interest,pacificare of california pacificare,to compel arbitration in accordance with the plan arbitration clause.in case no,pacificare has appealed the order of the trial court denying pacificare motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the same clause.the respondent,lisa ellen smith,makes the identical arguments in support of the trial court order in her case as does rivera in his 
as a part of its regulation of health care service plans,california imposes certain disclosure requirements as a predicate to the enforcement of arbitration clauses contained in plan subscriber agreements.health and safety code section section see fn,post provides that a binding arbitration clause in a health care service plan must incorporate various disclosures,including a clear statement of whether the subscriber or enrollee is waiving his or her right to a jury trial the waiver language must be substantially in the wording provided in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a and must appear immediately before the signature line for the individual enrolling in the plan,subds.c,d.
these cases present the question whether the failure to comply with the mandate of section will invalidate the right of pacificare to enforce the arbitration clause in its subscriber agreements with smith and rivera.although it has been held that the provisions of the federal arbitration act,et hereafter,faa preempt section and prevent its enforcement,what has not yet been decided by a california court,is whether the act,et hereafter,overrides the faa and precludes its preemptive impact on section.this is a significant issue,the resolution of which will turn on whether section constitutes a regulation of the business of insurance within the meaning of.
after a careful examination of the relevant authorities,we are persuaded that section does constitute such regulation and therefore,the faa can not preempt section and the latter provisions must be enforced.as a result,we will grant the requested writ relief in case no.and will affirm the trial court order in case no.
factual and procedural 
as we summarize below,rivera and smith have each filed an action against pacificare seeking damages for injuries sustained as the result of pacificare alleged failure to provide promised plan benefits,including the failure to timely authorize or extend needed treatment by health providers.in each case,pacificare responded to the complaints with a motion to compel arbitration.
rivera background facts case no.
in may of,rivera was an employee of the county of los angeles county.county had previously entered into a contract with pacificare to provide health insurance for its employees referred to in the pacificare documents as members.the agreement between pacificare and county consists of a business agreement signed by the county and three forms of subscriber agreements depending on the coverage option selected by the member.all forms of the subscriber agreements contained an arbitration clause to which each member became bound upon his or her execution of the enrollment form in addition,the evidence of coverage booklet pages,provided to each member following enrollment,contained a further reference to the commitment to arbitrate any dispute 
following his enrollment in the pacificare plan,rivera was diagnosed,on may,as suffering from a severe bacterial infection in his left foot.in the complaint he subsequently filed against pacificare,he alleged he was denied timely and proper treatment for this condition he had to wait three days for authorization to see a specialist.by the time of that appointment his condition had progressed to gangrene,and the surgeon recommended,on may,that he be admitted to the hospital that day,and that the small toe on his left foot be amputated within to hours,after antibiotics had controlled the infection.however,the medical group exercising its delegated authority to make utilization management decisions for respondent pacificare refused to authorize an admission to the hospital.when he was two days later,his infection had spread.
when rivera doctor learned,on may,that rivera had not been admitted to the hospital as he had directed,he told rivera to come to the hospital the next morning at for admission and surgery on his foot.when rivera arrived,however,he learned he was not on a list of patients whose admission had been authorized,and he was required to wait for hours.it turned out that rivera admission had not been authorized by a hospitalist,a doctor employed by the participating medical group to coordinate hospital admissions and care.he was not seen by the hospitalist for another five hours.because of the delay in admission,rivera surgery was not scheduled until the following day.
after one of rivera doctors told rivera wife that he should have had the surgery three days earlier,she insisted that the surgery go forward.the surgeon arrived at and was displeased at having been summoned however,when he saw how far the infection in rivera foot had progressed he scheduled the surgery immediately.the operation began at midnight.the infection had spread during the time rivera had been waiting for care,so that instead of having only his small toe amputated,it was necessary to remove two toes and a portion of the foot.a week after the surgery,rivera surgeon referred him for hyperbaric oxygen treatment,a therapeutic technique used to promote healing in necrotic tissue.the surgeon noted in the chart that rivera need was urgent.once again,however,pacificare delayed authorization for the prescribed treatment.unfortunately,because of such delay,the gangrene progressed,and rivera surgeon recommended an amputation of the entire foot,above the ankle.when rivera arrived at the hospital at on the scheduled day,he was again kept waiting for time for an entire of the need for the plan hospitalist to admit him.
not surprisingly,rivera claims to have suffered substantial physical and emotional damage as a result of such conduct.thereafter,he filed this action against pacificare on may,in his first amended complaint in which he is joined by his spouse,rita rivera,filed on june,he alleged causes of action 
pacificare response was to file a motion to compel arbitration.this was heard by the trial court on august,and the motion was granted.rivera filed a petition for a writ of mandate on october.following some delay occasioned by the filing of additional briefing both in support of and in opposition to the petition,we issued an order to show cause on march,and set the matter on calendar for hearing with the smith appeal.
smith background facts case no.
smith filed her complaint on october,in that pleading,she alleged the factual basis for her claim against pacificare she is the stepdaughter and dependent of thomas battle,an administrator for the rim of the world unified school district in lake arrowhead.as an employee of the school district,battle had the option of enrolling in the health plan offered through the southern california schools employee benefits association.under this plan,he received the bulk of his health care coverage from the blue cross plus preferred provider plan.mental health benefits,however,were derived solely from a supplementing health plan sponsored by pacificare and marketed as pacificare behavioral health of california pbhc.smith,as battle dependent,was also covered under this mental health plan.this plan has language compelling arbitration to resolve any disputes that may arise.such language is substantially the same as we have already described with respect to the rivera action.see fn,ante.
smith became suicidal in due to an uncontrolled major psychiatric depressive disorder,bulimia nervosa,and anorexia nervosa.in response,pacificare terminated her inpatient treatment after only six days and refused to authorize or pay for additional inpatient care even when smith condition deteriorated further over the next two months.such termination of the inpatient treatment appears to have been dictated by the terms of pbhc plan.this plan offers to provide full coverage for inpatient stays up to thirty days.however,members are limited to one inpatient stay per year,and stays of less than five days do not count toward this limitation.by terminating smith inpatient treatment only six days after her admission,pacificare effectively ensured that,regardless of the state of smith mental health,the inpatient benefits smith received could be kept to the minimum.pacificare actions also ensured that smith would receive no further inpatient benefits from pacificare for the balance of the year.
in filing her complaint,smith,as did rivera,sought substantial damages for the injuries she claimed to have sustained as the result of pacificare alleged misconduct.pacificare responded to this complaint in the same manner as it did to the rivera action.on december,it filed a petition to compel arbitration relying on the contractual provisions discussed above.
on february,after reviewing the written arguments filed in support and opposition to pacificare petition,the trial court heard the argument of counsel and denied the petition.this is an appealable order code of civ,fireman fund ins.companies younesi th,d and pacificare filed a timely appeal.
we thus have before us two different cases,involving substantially the same relevant factual circumstances,the same defendants,the same counsel on both sides and the same legal issue as to which two different trial judges reached the exact opposite conclusion.
contentions of the parties 
rivera and smith hereafter collectively referred to as plaintiffs contend as follows 
pacificare is a health care service plan subject to the regulation of the health care service plan act of health,et act,including section 
the arbitration clauses of the pacificare agreements which pacificare sought to enforce by its petitions to compel arbitration do not comply with the mandatory disclosure requirements of section and therefore absent the preemption issues raised herein are unenforceable as a matter of law 
health care service plans such as pacificare are engaged in the business of insurance and section is a state law that regulates the business of insurance 
exempts a state law that regulates insurance from preemption by any federal statute,the effect of which would impair,invalidate or supercede such state law,unless the federal statute specifically relates to insurance.
the faa would preempt and preclude the operation of section,unless is applicable 
the faa is a statute of general application and does not specifically relate to insurance if the faa were applied in either of these cases it would impair,invalidate or supercede the operation of section 
since the faa can not be applied without violating the mandate of,it can not preempt section since the pacificare arbitration clauses do not comply with section,pacificare is not entitled to enforce its demands for arbitration and its motions for such relief were improperly granted in the rivera matter and properly denied in the smith case.
of the seven points made by the plaintiffs in the above summarized contentions,pacificare concedes that five are not disputed.the only points of disagreement which pacificare has are with contention number and the conclusion expressed in contention number.it is pacificare position that health care service plans are not engaged in the business of insurance and section is not a statute which regulates insurance.if pacificare is correct,then can not be applied in this matter to preclude the preemptive effect of the faa.
the problem presented by these consolidated matters is therefore both straightforward and focused we must decide two questions.first,are service plans,such as pacificare,engaged in the business of insurance second,is section a state law that regulates the business of insurance we answer yes to both questions.
discussion 
applicable general principles and undisputed matters 
we begin our consideration of these questions by summarizing the factual matters and legal principles as to which there is no real dispute.
pacificare concedes that it is a licensed health care service plan instead of purchasing individual or group health insurance,many persons and employers now contract with health maintenance organizations hmos which,in turn,contract with health care providers,doctors,hospitals,medical groups,to provide actual health care services.see,samura kaiser foundation health plan,th,d.beginning in the late,insurers and others developed new models for delivery,including hmos.citation.the defining feature of an hmo is receipt of a fixed fee for each patient enrolled under the terms of a contract to provide specified health care if needed.the hmo thus assumes the financial risk of providing the benefits promised if a participant never gets sick,the hmo keeps the money regardless,and if a participant becomes expensively ill,the hmo is responsible for the treatment agreed upon even if its cost exceeds the participant premiums.pegram herdrich,d.
in california,health care service plans or hmos are licensed and regulated by the department of managed care under the act as already noted,one of the provisions of that act is section 
the arbitration provisions of the pacificare agreements with the plaintiffs did not comply with the disclosure requirements of section.essentially,the disclosures made in the agreements were not placed in the mandated juxtaposition with the enrollee signature line and did not clearly disclose the scope of the arbitration as required by section.pacificare does not dispute that there was a failure to comply with the requirements of section.instead,pacificare argues that such failure is irrelevant because section is preempted by the faa and therefore does not apply.
the faa applies to any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce which contains an arbitration clause.section of the faa provides that arbitration provisions shall be enforced,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.ibid.thus,a state court may,without violating section,refuse to enforce an arbitration clause on the basis of generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.doctor associates,casarotto,d,casarotto.critically,however,a state court may not defeat an arbitration clause by applying state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions.ibid.
thus,in casarotto,the supreme court found that the faa preempted a montana law which had required an arbitration clause to be typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of any contract in order to be enforceable.casarotto,supra,d.because the montana law conditioned enforceability of the arbitration agreement on compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally,it was preempted.id.at.
the faa would appear to apply to the pacificare agreements at issue here.first,the contract involves interstate commerce.in providing health services to enrollees,pacificare must,and does,contract with entities.in addition,the agreement provides that pacificare will arrange for the provision of health services for enrollees,wherever they may travel,including out of state.these circumstances bring the pacificare agreements within the reach of the faa.see,summit health,pinhas,d,medicare provider that purchased out of state medicines and supplies engaged in interstate commerce for purposes of the sherman act toledo kaiser permanente medical group,hmo contract concerned interstate commerce under faa,where coverage provided for injuries or illness and hmo obtained physicians and supplies from out of state.
moreover,section is obviously a regulatory provision applicable only to arbitration provisions,not to contracts generally.as already noted,this is precisely what the faa prohibits.just as the montana statute in casarotto required that an arbitration provision contain particular language and be placed in a particular location in a contract,and hence was invalid under the faa,so too,does section place restrictions on the manner in which an arbitration provision may be placed in a health care service contract.
thus,in erickson aetna health plans of california,th,d,the court held that section was preempted by the faa.citing casarotto,the erickson court noted that section imposes on arbitration clauses in health care plans a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally,and such arbitration clauses must satisfy special requirements as to form and content which are not imposed on contracts generally.id.at,d.as a result,section takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue,and,consequently,conflicts with section of the faa.ibid.therefore,pacificare argues,section is preempted by the faa.
plaintiffs response to this argument is that the faa can not preempt section because of the operation of.
congress enacted in it sets forth a policy declaration that it is in the public interest that the primary regulation of the business of insurance be in the states,not in the national government.it was passed in response to a united states supreme court decision united states underwriters.which held that the business of insurance was commerce within the meaning of the commerce clause and therefore the business of insurance was subject to all federal laws,including those relating to antitrust,at.this was a major change in the law.in,the supreme court had held paul virginia wall,that insurance was not commerce and therefore was not subject to federal commerce clause statutes.
the clear purpose of was to abrogate this change and to insure that the states would continue to enjoy broad authority in regulating the dealings between insurers and their policyholders.cochran paco,cir.as the supreme court itself later explained,the act was passed in reaction to this court decision in united states underwriters.prior to that decision,it had been assumed,in the language of the leading case,that i ssuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce.paul virginia,wall.consequently,regulation of insurance transactions was thought to rest exclusively with the states.in underwriters,this court held that insurance transactions were subject to federal regulation under the commerce clause,and that the antitrust laws,in particular,were applicable to them.congress reacted quickly the act was the product of this concern.its purpose was stated quite clearly in its first section congress declared that the continued regulation and taxation by the several states of the business of insurance is in the public interest.stat,in context,however,it is relatively clear what problems congress was dealing with.under the regime of paul virginia,supra,states had a free hand in regulating the dealings between insurers and their policyholders.their negotiations,and the contract which resulted,were not considered commerce and were,therefore,left to state regulation.the underwriters decision threatened the continued supremacy of the states in this area.the act was an attempt to turn back the clock,to assure that the activities of insurance companies in dealing with their policyholders would remain subject to state regulation.sec national securities,d,national securities,italics added.
thus,there seems little question that congress,by its passage of,returned to the states the plenary power to regulate the business of insurance that they had enjoyed prior to the underwriters decision.if congress intended to invoke its commerce clause powers to occupy part of the field of insurance regulation,it would expressly say so.cochran paco,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the mandate of appears to be both plain and clear.an act of congress may not be construed to invalidate,impair,or supercede a state law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance unless the federal act specifically relates to the business of insurance,b,italics added.there is no dispute between the parties that the application of the faa would have the effect of invalidating,impairing and superceding the operation of section indeed,it would absolutely preclude its use to regulate the wording and organization of pacificare arbitration clauses.similarly,there is no argument that the faa is a statute of general application which does not specifically relate to the business of insurance.thus,in order for us to conclude that does preclude the application of the faa in these consolidated cases we need only address the integrally related questions as to whether health care service plans,such as pacificare,are engaged in the business of insurance and whether section is a statute enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.
health care service plans are engaged in the business of insurance 
statutes aimed at protecting or regulating the relationship between insurer and insured,directly or indirectly,are laws regulating the business of insurance within the meaning of that phrase as it is used in.national securities,supra.as the national securities court emphasized,the focus of is upon the relationship between the insurer and its policyholders.the relationship between insurer and insured,the type of policy which could be issued,its reliability,interpretation,and were the core of the business of insurance.undoubtedly,other activities of insurance companies relate so closely to their status as reliable insurers that they too must be placed in the same class.but whatever the exact scope of the statutory term,it is clear where the focus was on the relationship between the insurance company and the policyholder.id.at,italics added.cases interpreting the scope of the act have identified three criteria relevant to determining whether a particular practice falls within that act reference to the business of insurance first,whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder risk second,whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured and third,whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry.citations.metropolitan life ins.massachusetts,d,see also pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.
in group life health ins.royal drug,d royal drug and union labor life ins.pireno,d pireno the supreme court first identified these criteria.these cases,however,involved the scope of the antitrust immunity which was granted by the second clause of b.see fn,ante.
in royal drug,independent pharmacists brought an antitrust action against blue shield claiming that it was engaged in of prescription drugs.the lawsuit attacked blue shield use of pharmacy agreements between it and any pharmacy in the state that wanted to participate in its program.under the agreements,a blue shield insured would pay the pharmacy for a prescription,and blue shield would reimburse the pharmacy for the actual cost of the drugs dispensed.the agreements essentially limited the participating pharmacy profit on any prescription to.royal drug,supra,at.
the issue in royal drug was whether blue shield conduct in entering into the pharmacy agreements was the business of insurance and therefore exempt from the antitrust laws.royal drug,supra,at.the court held that the pharmacy agreements were not the business of insurance under the act.
the court first noted that insurance inherently involves the spreading of risk between the insurer and its insureds,and that the pharmacy agreements did not spread risk because they did not involve any contract between the insurer and its insured.rather,blue shield assumed the risk providing its insureds with prescription drugs for,and the pharmacy agreements were simply the means of providing the promised benefit at a low cost.
in the court view,the pharmacy agreements were indistinguishable from countless other business arrangements that may be made by insurance companies to keep their costs low.royal drug,supra,at.because of this,and because the agreements were between the insurer and entities outside of the insurance industry,the court held that the act did not protect the practice.
in pireno,a chiropractor challenged an insurer use of a peer review panel to determine which claims for chiropractic care the insurer would pay.the insurer defended by claiming that the use of a peer review committee was exempt from the antitrust laws as part of the business of insurance.pireno,supra,d.the court held that the use of peer review to determine whether to pay claims was not the business of insurance within the scope of the act,and hence not exempt from the antitrust laws.
pireno distilled from royal drug the three criteria relevant in determining whether a particular practice is part of the business of insurance exempted from the antitrust laws by b.pireno,supra,italics added.f irst,whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder risk second,whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured and third,whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry.ibid,italics omitted.in pireno,however,the court cautioned that,n one of these criteria is necessarily determinative in itself.pireno,supra,at.
applying the criteria to the peer review practice,the court determined that the practice did not spread risk,since the transfer of risk occurred when the policy was issued,and the peer review process was logically and temporally unconnected to the transfer of risk.pireno,supra,at.the court also determined that peer review did not involve an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and its insured,nor was it limited to entities within the insurance industry,since the chiropractors performing the review were neither insureds nor within the insurance industry.id.at.
in department of treasury fabe,d fabe,however,the supreme court pointed out that both royal drug and pireno were focused on the second clause of section b which related to the narrow issue rather than the broader language of the first clause.the first clause commits laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance to the states,while the second clause exempts only the business of insurance itself from the antitrust laws.to equate laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance with the business of insurance itself,would be to read words out of the statute.id.at,italics added.
the broad category of laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance consists of laws that possess the end,intention,or aim of adjusting,managing,or controlling the business of insurance.citation.this category necessarily encompasses more than just the business of insurance.w e believe that the actual performance of an insurance contract is an essential part of the business of insurance.t he first clause of b was intended to further congress primary objective of granting the states broad regulatory authority over the business of insurance.the second clause accomplishes congress secondary goal,which was to carve out only a narrow exemption for the business of insurance from the federal antitrust laws.citations.fabe,supra,at.thus,t here can be no doubt that the actual performance of an insurance contract falls within the business of insurance,as we understood that phrase in pireno and royal drug.to hold otherwise would be mere formalism.the court statement in pireno that the transfer of risk from insured to insurer is effected by means of the contract between the parties and is complete at the time that the contract is entered citation,presumes that the insurance contract in fact will be enforced.without performance of the terms of the insurance policy,there is no risk transfer at all.moreover,performance of an insurance contract also satisfies the remaining prongs of the pireno test it is central to the policy relationship between insurer and insured and is confined entirely to entities within the insurance industry.fabe,supra,at.
as we pointed out earlier,hmos or health care service plans,such as pacificare,are engaged in providing a service that is a substitute for what previously constituted health insurance.the only distinction between an hmo and a traditional insurer is that the hmo provides medical services directly,while a traditional insurer does so indirectly by paying for the service citation,but this is a distinction without a difference.citations.in the end,hmos function the same way as a traditional health insurer.the policyholder pays a fee for a promise of medical services in the event that he should need them.it follows that hmos are in the business of insurance.washington physicians service ass gregoire cir.other courts have also reached the conclusion that hmos are engaged in the business of insurance.kentucky of health plans,nichols cir,corporate health,texas of ins.cir,anderson humana,cir,ocean state physicians health plan blue cross cir.we believe the reasoning of these cases is sound and we have no trouble also concluding that pacificare,as a health care service plan or hmo,is engaged in the business of insurance.
significantly,the legislature has reached the same conclusion in a very public way.it has expressly recognized that health care service plans in california are engaged in the business of insurance within the meaning of the act.in,it enacted the managed health care insurance accountability act of,statutes,chapter,partially codified at civil code.this statute provides a remedy for injuries caused by the failure of managed care entities and health care service plans to provide medically appropriate treatment to their subscribers.in an uncodified section to the act,the legislature stated.a the legislature finds and declares as follows 
based on the fundamental nature of the relationships involved,a health care service plan and all other managed care entities regulated under the health and safety code are engaged in the business of insurance in this state as that term is defined for purposes of the act and following.nothing in this act shall be construed to impose the regulatory requirements of the insurance code on health care service plans regulated by the health and safety code.italics added.
the case on which pacificare relies williams california physicians service,supra,th,d is not to the contrary.indeed,it did not even address the issue before us.williams simply held that a health care service plan regulated by the act was not necessarily the equivalent to an insurance company for regulatory purposes.williams did not purport to address the issue confronting this court.rather,it simply recognized that the legislature has elected to subject insurers and health care service plans to distinct regulatory regimes.insurers are regulated by the insurance code and the insurance commissioner.health care service plans fall under the jurisdiction of the department of managed care and the act.hence,when the plaintiff in williams sought to challenge the conduct of her health care service plan by invoking a provision of the insurance code,the court correctly held that the statute did not apply.nothing in the reasoning or holding of williams justifies pacificare contention that somehow it is not engaged in the business of insurance.
this leaves us with the final and critical question.does section constitute a regulation of that insurance business.
section does regulate the business of insurance 
the supreme court has recently made it clear that the pireno factors are merely considerations to be weighed in determining whether a state law regulates insurance,citation,and that n one of these criteria is necessarily determinative.unum life ins.of america ward,d,ward.although it was considering the issue in the context of the savings clause of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,b a,the court reasoning is obviously relevant here.the court repeated the comment made in an earlier decision where it noted that the first question to be addressed was whether the state law fit a understanding of insurance regulation and then the pireno factors would be looked to as checking points or guideposts,not separate essential elements that must each be satisfied to save the state law.id.at.italics added.
in order to be within the definition of insurance regulation,a law must not just have an impact on the insurance industry,but must be specifically directed toward that industry.pilot life ins.dedeaux,supra,d.section falls squarely within the standard announced in national securities,supra,d.it regulates the language and terms of the policies that hmos can offer in california,by requiring hmos that want to use mandatory arbitration to provide certain disclosures in the documents issued to its plan enrollees.because it defines the language that hmos must use in their plan documents,section operates directly on the relationship between the hmo and its.the disclosure requirement is plainly an effort to protect insureds,hence the state has exercised its power to protect or regulate the relationship between the hmo and its members.this is exactly what national securities says falls within the core of the business of insurance.id.at.
nothing in fabe limits the test announced in national securities.to the contrary,fabe that test,holding that the ohio law involved in that case fell within scope of because it was aimed at protecting or regulating the performance of insurance contract.fabe,supra,at.the fabe court rejected the federal government contention that royal drug and pireno had somehow supplanted the national securities test,distinguishing those cases,and noting that they did not address the first clause of section b of,b relating to state laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,but rather focused on the second clause dealing with the narrower question of the exemption.id.at.
three federal appellate courts have concluded that state laws that restrict arbitration in the context of insurance are state laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.mutual reinsurance bureau great plains mut.cir,cert.denied,d stephens american intern.ins.cir,and quackenbush allstate ins.cir.in mutual reinsurance,which fabe the tenth circuit held that a kansas law prohibiting arbitration clauses in insurance policies was not preempted by the federal arbitration act,because it was a state law that regulated insurance.mutual reinsurance,supra,at.the mutual reinsurance court relied primarily on national securities,explaining that the kansas statute regulated the relationship between the insured and the policyholder,and was therefore at the core of the business of insurance.
the second circuit reached the same conclusion in stephens,holding that kentucky legislative scheme for liquidating failed insurance companies,which contained an provision,was protected by the act.the court also relied on national securities and fabe,concluding that the statute in question was part of a state liquidation scheme that regulated the performance of insurance policies once an insurer or reinsurer is placed in liquidation.stephens,supra,at.
the ninth circuit discussion of the issue in quackenbush is admittedly dictum because the court explained that,unlike the kentucky liquidation scheme,california liquidation scheme lacked an provision.quackenbush,supra,at.but the court was clear that,if a california law prohibited arbitration of disputes involving an insolvent insurer,then that law would undoubtedly also be saved by from preemption by the faa.ibid.
even accepting the contention,however,that the issue should be decided by application of the pireno factors,we believe that the facts and circumstances presented here demonstrate that those criteria,as recently characterized and applied by the supreme court in ward,supra,d,are in fact sufficiently met.it is true that does not transfer risk.plaintiffs concede the point,but argue that the issue is irrelevant.ward makes it clear that even if the pireno test is applied,not all three parts must be met.pacificare contends that the second prong is also not met because regulates arbitration provisions,which,pacificare argues,are not an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured.pacificare contends that arbitration is really nothing more than a shift in forum,leaving a party substantive rights under the policy unchanged.ward,however,does not justify this argument.there,unum argued that the rule regulates only the administration of insurance policies,not their substantive terms and it therefore can not be an integral part of the policy relationship.ward,supra,at,fn.the ward court expressly rejected this argument.ibid.here,because directly regulates the words that pacificare may use in its plan if it wants to include an enforceable arbitration clause,it regulates an integral part of the policy relationship.this relates directly to the performance and enforcement of the policy,a factor of critical importance under fabe 
pacificare finally contends that the third prong is not satisfied.it argues that because section affects health care service plans,and not insurance companies,the statute is not limited to insurance entities.we have already disposed of this contention.hmos are engaged in the business of insurance when they offer health coverage to their members,and section clearly regulates this aspect of their endeavor.the fact that they are also involved in other activities that may not constitute the business of insurance is of no consequence to the issue before us.
section is limited solely to hmos,and parallels insurance code,which requires disability insurers which includes health insurers who wish to include arbitration clauses in their policies to make the same disclosures to their insureds.these provisions,which were simply different sections of the same legislation,evidence an effort by the legislature to regulate the relationship between insureds and their insurers,regardless of the type of coverage being provided.
ultimately,therefore,even if the pireno test is to be applied,section meets that test as clarified and applied in ward.finally,as a simple matter of common sense,by conditioning the availability of arbitration in hmo subscriber contracts on the hmos compliance with the mandated disclosures,section regulates insurance.
conclusion 
for all of the foregoing reasons,we conclude that pacificare is engaged in the business of insurance and section clearly purports to regulate an important aspect of that business relating to the performance and enforcement of the policy.thus,section does regulate the business of insurance within the meaning of.therefore,the faa,a federal statute of general application,which does not specifically relate to insurance,is foreclosed from application to prevent the operation of section.as a result,pacificare arbitration provisions may not be enforced because of their failure to satisfy the specific and unambiguous disclosure requirements imposed by section.the trial court erred in granting pacificare petition to compel arbitration in the rivera case and properly denied a similar petition in the smith matter.
disposition 
the order in smith is affirmed.in the rivera writ proceeding,the order to show cause is discharged and a peremptory writ shall issue directing the trial court to vacate its order of august,granting pacificare petition to compel arbitration and to enter a new and different order denying such petition.upon remand,the trial court shall conduct such further proceedings as are appropriate in each case and are consistent with the views expressed herein.both smith and rivera shall recover their costs incurred in these appellate proceedings.
we have consolidated these cases on our own motion.while they involve different plaintiffs in the underlying actions,the defendant,pacificare and related entities is the same in both cases,the relevant factual issues are very similar and the legal issues are identical.moreover,counsel are the same and they make identical arguments in both cases.thus,it is appropriate that the cases be decided in a single opinion.
code of civil procedure,section,subdivision a,specifies the language which must be utilized in an arbitration clause inserted in any contract for medical services.it provides that the clause must state that any dispute as to professional neglige
