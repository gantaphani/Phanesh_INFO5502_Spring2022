before the outsourcing,appellants had worked in the facilities and utilities engineering groups at honeywell kansas city manufacturing plant.as a government contractor honeywell manages and operates the kansas city plant for the department of energy doe,and honeywell or one of its predecessors has operated the plant since.honeywell contract with doe provides that the government pays all management and operation costs at the plant,including employee compensation and benefit costs,and honeywell receives an incentive fee based on performance and other awards.
the facilities engineering group at honeywell was responsible for the design and implementation of onsite construction projects,and the utilities engineering group was responsible for maintaining onsite facilities such as heat,ventilation,air conditioning,water,and electricity.honeywell president karen clegg was dissatisfied with the senior management and the performance of the facilities and utilities groups,and the company hired a consultant in to study its facilities operations.that study concluded that the facilities engineering group was too large and did not meet the standards of private industry.the study also found that a significant contributor to the problems in the area was turnover at the senior management level.
since doe had renewed contracts to operate the kansas city plant without competitive bidding,but in honeywell received information that doe would likely open the contract to outside bidders.this information was later confirmed,and honeywell hired consultant darrell elliott to help develop a strategy for its bid on the contract.elliott assisted honeywell in performing a self assessment to determine its strong and weak areas.he recommended that the company address any potential weaknesses and urged honeywell to consider outsourcing some functions to companies that were stronger in the weaker areas.the self assessment identified security,the cafeteria,and facilities and utilities engineering as areas whose outsourcing could strengthen honeywell contract proposal to doe.honeywell states that elliott recommendation was consistent with the doe policy described in its report making contracting work better and cost less.that report encouraged contractors to consider whether subcontracting or outsourcing would be cost effective.
david douglass became vice president for operations at honeywell in january,with supervision over the facilities and utilities groups.he received feedback from a local doe officer that the facilities area had performed at a good level,but that there was room for improvement.another source of concern for honeywell was doe fiscal year report,which rated its facilities and utilities areas only as good while other areas received a rating of outstanding.douglass succeeded in getting honeywell to seek a new director for the facilities and utilities functions in early,but it did not find any acceptable candidates.honeywell states that it was about this time that douglass proposed that it follow elliott recommendation that facilities and engineering services be outsourced by subcontracting with a third party.the facilities and utilities engineering groups were seen as potential areas for outsourcing because they were not considered core competencies of honeywell and they were commonly outsourced in private industry.the proposal was put before a focus group which concluded that doe might prefer that honeywell retain control of the utilities group but that it might be the wrong approach to continue with the facilities group in the same way.
in march honeywell entered into discussions with three firms about outsourcing,and it then executed a memorandum of understanding with the engineering company burns mcdonnell.that memorandum stated that doe was expected to issue a formal request for proposal for the kansas city plant,that each party would use best efforts to negotiate an agreement under which burns mcdonnell would serve as a subcontractor for facilities and utilities engineering services,and that this would be incorporated into honeywell proposal.when doe issued a formal request for proposal in april,honeywell and burns mcdonnell agreed to prepare one for submission.honeywell informed its employees in may that it intended to propose outsourcing the facilities and utilities engineering groups and the cafeteria operations in its bid for the doe contract.
at least five other companies notified doe that they planned to submit a proposal,and representatives of other potential bidders toured the honeywell kansas city plant in may.honeywell submitted its proposal to doe on july and learned in october that it had been chosen none of the other potential bidders actually submitted a proposal.although doe identified the outsourcing of the facilities and utilities functions as a weakness in honeywell overall proposal,it ultimately approved the subcontract with burns mcdonnell.
honeywell established eleven positions that would remain in the company to oversee and coordinate the facilities and utilities functions,and it indicated that all employees in the facilities and utilities groups could apply for them.although the positions were filled from those groups,the five appellants who applied were not selected.several facilities and utilities engineering employees asked to be transferred to other positions within honeywell to avoid being outsourced to burns mcdonnell,but douglass announced that no other employees from the affected groups would be able to remain at honeywell because the company wanted to ensure continuity of operations after work was transferred to burns mcdonnell.according to honeywell some internal debate followed,and it was decided that the employees who were to be outsourced would be allowed to apply for internal openings if an employee skills were not necessary for the success of the outsourced operation.honeywell states that as a result of this screening process,at least fifteen employees applied for internal openings and two were allowed to transfer within the company.
appellants assert that permission to apply for internal transfers was given on an ad hoc basis without informing all of the employees that the initial transfer ban had been lifted,but register and lawson were cleared to apply for internal openings.register applied for an internal position of industrial engineer,but that position was given to another employee before the hiring manager received register application.both register and lawson expressed interest in applying for another engineering position and were cleared to apply,but they were later informed that the position was not going to be filled because the needs of the department had been reevaluated.appellants point out,however,that honeywell had said in a corporate newsletter that it anticipated filling many positions with outside talent because a number of its associates were becoming eligible for retirement.
in its april request for proposal,doe had notified potential bidders that one of its goals was to maintain the value of employee benefit packages while at the same time limiting its long term liability,and honeywell agreed in its contract that it would submit a plan for achieving this goal.appellants assert that honeywell knew about doe desire to limit long term liability before the company made the decision to outsource their jobs to burns mcdonnell.they claim that honeywell recognized in february that a portable pension plan would be needed to ease the transition and to retain talent after the outsourcing.they were nevertheless not offered such a plan even though by the time of outsourcing in january,one had been in place for months at other business units of the company.honeywell disputes the accuracy of that claim.it says it had considered a portable pension plan for new and existing employees during,but the idea was put on hold because of the potential acquisition of the company by general electric.
honeywell submitted a plan to doe on october,in accordance with the contract provision requiring limitation of its long term liability.honeywell plan included a portable pension plan for new hires and an option for existing employees to leave their old pension plan and join a new one.this new plan provided earlier vesting of benefits than honeywell existing plan,but featured substantially lower retirement benefits for long term employees.it also eliminated the retirement medical coverage that had been available under the previous plan,fees for health insurance were increased,and long term disability and survivor benefits were eliminated.the portable pension plan was put in place for new hires at honeywell in march,and it became available to all honeywell employees in.appellants ceased to be honeywell employees in january,and they were never offered a portable pension plan.
effective january,the facilities and utilities engineering functions were outsourced to facilities and engineering services fes,a subsidiary of burns mcdonnell created for this purpose.honeywell terminated the nine employees involved in this case and others in the facilities and utilities groups,and all were offered employment at fes.appellants accepted the offer,and burns mcdonnell placed one of its managers in charge of the outsourced fes operation and added others.the outsourced employees remained at the same desks in the honeywell facility and performed the same functions as they had when they worked for honeywell.
the outsourced employees had been participants in honeywell pension plan which was a defined benefit plan.that plan provided for normal retirement at age and early retirement at age or when the sum of the participant age and years of service equaled point retirement.a plan participant who worked at honeywell for more than five years but did not qualify for either normal or early retirement would receive a vested benefit which was significantly lower than one received upon retirement.after the outsourcing decision was made,honeywell amended its pension plan to allow affected employees who were approaching a retirement milestone to receive an unpaid bridge leave of absence so they could reach the milestone.this bridge leave was available to employees who were either within twenty four months of reaching age,thirty six months of reaching age,or point retirement.the bridge leave allowed ten outsourced employees to attain full retirement benefits,and twenty six of the fifty five outsourced employees are or will be eligible for at least early retirement benefits.although appellant lawson was three weeks short of age at the time of the outsourcing,honeywell allowed him to use accrued paid leave to remain on its payroll until his fifty third birthday so he too could take advantage of the bridge leave opportunity.
in preparation for the outsourcing,honeywell worked with burns mcdonnell to design a compensation and benefit package for the outsourced employees at its fes subsidiary.the fes salary for each of the nine appellants at fes was equal to or greater than the salary received at honeywell,and fes employees were eligible for bonuses that were not available at honeywell.the outsourced employees at fes came under a burns mcdonnell benefit package which did not include a defined benefit plan like honeywell pension plan,but burns mcdonnell created two additional defined contribution plans for the fes employees.honeywell commissioned a study of its benefit package compared to the one at fes.the first study indicated that the value of the fes package would be approximately of honeywell.burns mcdonnell enhanced the fes benefit package in response,with the result that the fes package was valued at of honeywell,or if possible bonuses were considered.
appellants claim they lost their right to future benefit accruals and their retirement medical benefits as a result of their outsourcing,and they allege that both doe and honeywell benefitted financially from the change.they point to doe annual report on contractor work force restructuring for fiscal year,which stated that employees were outsourced from the kansas city honeywell plant,that the workforce restructuring cost,and that the estimated savings to the government in salary and benefits from the outsourced positions was million.appellants claim that honeywell shares in any savings the government experiences from reducing costs,including employee benefits.honeywell disputes this contention,stating that the pension plan is funded by doe and that any cost savings accrue only to it.moreover,honeywell pension plan was fully funded in and actuarial projections indicated that no contributions would be needed for the next fifteen years.honeywell also asserts that any financial benefit doe may have received from the outsourcing is offset by its additional expenses for funding the defined contribution plans and bonuses for the outsourced employees.
after the employees were transferred out of honeywell,register filed a complaint in district court.it alleged as amended that honeywell had discriminated against him on the basis of his age,in violation of the adea and title vii,and terminated him in order to interfere with his pension rights,in violation of of erisa.lawson filed a separate action,alleging identical violations of the adea and title vii,and erisa.register later successfully moved to amend his complaint to add a claim that honeywell violated a b of erisa,by failing to pay severance benefits,and to add seven other plaintiffs on the two erisa claims.the court granted a joint motion to consolidate the register and lawson cases,and honeywell moved for summary judgment.
the district court granted honeywell motion on july,dismissing all of the claims against the company.appellants moved for reconsideration on their claim under of erisa,but the court denied the motion and judgment was entered against them.their appeal from the judgment is founded only on the dismissal of their erisa claim alleging interference with their pension rights.they contend that the district court erred by considering the affidavit testimony of honeywell consultant darrell elliott and by concluding that one of honeywell reasons for the outsourcing was not pretextual.honeywell responds that the decision to outsource was an exercise of legitimate business judgment and that the district court correctly dismissed the claims.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.woodland joseph ryerson son,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,presents no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the nonmoving party must do more than rely on allegations or denials in the pleadings,and the court should grant summary judgment if any essential element of the prima facie case is not supported by specific facts sufficient to raise a genuine issue for trial.celotex catrett,d.
section of erisa makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge a participant in an employee benefit plan for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan.to prevail under appellants must show that honeywell had a specific intent to interfere with their pension benefits,but that may be shown by circumstantial evidence.regel,cir.
in overruling the appellants objection to darrell elliott affidavit,the district court observed that it had not been offered as an expert opinion to show that honeywell decision to outsource was a prudent one,but rather as evidence of its motive for outsourcing.appellants claim that the district court erred by considering the affidavit because it lacked foundation and was in re
