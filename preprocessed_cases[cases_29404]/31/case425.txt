in paying larry carden monthly benefits under a disability plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,aetna life insurance company,the insurer and administrator of the plan,offset workers compensation benefits that carden received for an illness unrelated to his disability.aetna relied on its reading of the plan offset provisions and the plan language giving it discretion to interpret the plan.
the district court concluded that aetna determination was consistent with the language of the plan and that therefore its interpretation was not unreasonable.it accordingly concluded that aetna is entitled to offset plaintiff disability benefits by the workers compensation benefits which he received.
challenging aetna reading of the plan,especially in light of aetna financial conflict of interest,carden appealed.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
larry carden,a power plant operator for duke energy corporation since,began experiencing symptoms of episodic vertigo causing imbalance and dizziness in.in april,he ceased working as a result of this condition and made a claim under duke energy disability plan.aetna,which administered and paid benefits under the plan,accepted carden application and began paying carden monthly disability benefits.
unbeknownst to aetna,carden made a workers compensation claim against duke energy a few months later,in august,alleging that he was suffering from asbestosis as a direct and proximate result of his employment with duke energy.although duke energy contested the claim,asserting that carden had not been exposed to the hazards of asbestos,it ultimately entered into a settlement agreement with carden in may for a lump sum payment of,of which was allocated to carden alleged permanent impairment and to attorneys fees.duke energy also agreed to pay future medical expenses relating to asbestosis.
when aetna first learned of carden workers compensation settlement in late,it notified carden by letter dated december,that the workers compensation award was other income under the plan that needed to be offset against his disability benefits.aetna set out a schedule,under which carden would repay the through a reduction in his monthly disability checks for months,and explained that it was making the adjustment s ince you have received disability benefits in excess of your entitlement.when carden appealed the decision,aetna affirmed,explaining to carden attorney 
our interpretation of the plan is worker compensation benefits carden received is sic considered as other income as described on page in the coverage summary.therefore,we feel it should be offset or reduce his monthly disability payments.
carden commenced this action under erisa,challenging aetna interpretation of the plan,and the parties thereafter entered into a stipulation of the material facts and the issue to be decided.they agreed that there are no facts in dispute and that the basis for carden disability claim with aetna by reason of vertigo and the physical basis for his workers compensation claim asbestosis are different.they stipulated to the administrative record and to the plan documents and language.they agreed that aetna is a fiduciary as defined by erisa and that it had discretionary authority to interpret the plan under plan language that read,aetna shall have discretionary authority to determine whether and to what extent employees and beneficiaries are entitled to benefits and construe any disputed or doubtful terms of this policy.they also agreed that because of aetna role in evaluating and paying claims,the modified abuse of discretion standard as interpreted and applied by the fourth circuit court of appeals and this court is applicable for this matter.finally,they agreed that the case turned entirely on the proper interpretation of the plan language,articulating the issue as follows 
the parties agree that the substantive issue to be resolved is whether aetna,under the specific language of the plan documents is entitled to offset worker compensation benefits recovered by carden against the monthly disability benefits being paid by aetna to carden when the physical basis for the disability benefits being paid by aetna,vertigo is different than the physical basis which gave rise to the worker compensation award,asbestosis.
the district court found that aetna interpretation of the plan was reasonable and was supported by substantial evidence,resulting from a deliberate,principled reasoning process.accordingly,it entered a judgment on november,declaring,aetna is entitled to offset plaintiff longterm disability benefits by the workers compensation benefits which he received based on his asbestosis.from that judgment,carden appeals.
the plan in this case provides disability benefits to employees,and,because carden suffers from vertigo,he has been receiving disability benefits since.there is no dispute about whether the benefits are payable and their amount.rather,the issue here is whether aetna,functioning under a conflict of interest,acted reasonably in construing the plan language to provide for an offset against those benefits in the amount that carden received in as a payment for his permanent impairment caused by asbestosis.
carden contends that the plan,in addressing lump sum payments from workers compensation,provides that such a payment may be set off against disability benefits only when the payment is for the same disability for which disability benefits are paid.while carden claims that the plan provisions are unambiguous in this regard,he argues that if the plan language is ambiguous,it must be interpreted in favor of him and against the insurer because of aetna conflict of interest,citing to a line of cases represented by carolina care plan,mckenzie,cir.in carolina care plan,we said,when an erisa plan vests discretion in an administrator who also insures the plan,reasonable exercise of that discretion requires that the administrator construe plan ambiguities against the party who drafted the plan.at emphasis added.
since we decided carolina care plan and the other cases on which it relies,the supreme court decided metropolitan life insurance glenn,d,altering several aspects of judicial review of erisa plan determinations.see champion,at.in glenn,the court held that judicial review of an erisa plan administrator decision is under a de novo standard unless the plan provides to the contrary.glenn.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.but when the plan language grants the administrator discretionary authority,review is conducted under the familiar standard.champion,at.
of especial importance here,the glenn court also held that the administrator conflict of interest did not change the standard of review from the deferential review,normally applied in the review of discretionary decisions,to a de novo review,or some other hybrid standard.glenn.at champion,at.indeed,the court stated more broadly that the conflict of interest should not lead to special rules,or other special procedural or evidentiary rules,focused narrowly upon the conflict.glenn.at.rather,a conflict of interest becomes just one of the several different,often,factors to be weighed together in determining whether the administrator abused its discretion.id.
the glenn court found a conflict when the plan administrator serves in the dual role of evaluating claims for benefits and paying the claims.glenn.at.specifically,it held that an insurance company,which served as both administrator with discretionary authority to determine claims and insurer with responsibility of paying the claims,functioned under a conflict of interest.id.at.
inasmuch as aetna serves both as administrator of the plan with discretionary authority to determine entitlement to benefits and to construe disputed terms and as insurer of the plan with responsibility for paying benefits,it has a conflict of interest,as defined by glenn.
carden maintains that because of this conflict of interest the plan language must be interpreted in his favor,thus barring aetna from offsetting his asbestosis settlement against his disability benefits for vertigo.carden would have us reach this
