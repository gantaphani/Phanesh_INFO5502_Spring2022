background 
the funds are erisa benefit plans that provide health and pension benefits to union employees working in the fire protection industry.the benefits are financed by employer contributions pursuant to collective bargaining agreements with various local unions representing industry employees.
fairfield is a connecticut company that sells and installs fire sprinkler systems.it employs on average between twenty and people.until may,fairfield was a member of the national fire sprinkler association nfsa,an association of employers in the fire protection industry,and granted the nfsa authority to enter into collective bargaining agreements with local unions on its behalf.
for much of the period in question,nfsa entered into agreements with various local unions of the united association of journeyman and apprentices of the plumbing and pipe fitting industry of the united states of america.such agreements are permitted under f of the national labor relations act,f,and are commonly utilized in the construction industry to accommodate its workforce in multiple states.under the agreements,a such as fairfield agrees with local unions operating in assigned geographic areas that it will hire a given local workers and will honor the terms of that local agreement whenever it engages in a project within the local territorial jurisdiction.nfsa director of labor relations cornelius cahill explained the effect of these agreements during his deposition 
q funds counsel when nfsa entered into bargaining with for example a local union in california,and subsequently signed a contract on behalf of its members,was fairfield bound by that contract 
a cahill yes,it would be.
q can you explain how that would be if they were working in california 
a well,they would be bound to that agreement if they went into that particular geographical location.there were advantages to that to contractors.the contractor would call up the local that they were going into and would say i a member of nfsa,they have my bargaining rights.i need x number of people to work,i signatory by virtue of my membership.and they would not have to go in and negotiate with the local.they would just be able to ask for manpower.
beginning in,nfsa entered bargaining agreements on behalf of its,including fairfield,with locals and,which cover new york and connecticut,respectively.
in,nfsa and local negotiated a collective bargaining agreement the agreement,that was in effect from april,until march.as a member of nfsa at the time the agreement took effect,fairfield was bound by it on may,shortly after the agreement took effect,fairfield withdrew its membership in nfsa,thereby terminating nfsa authority to enter into future agreements on fairfield behalf.
following fairfield withdrawal,nfsa and fairfield independently entered into negotiations with local for separate collective bargaining agreements covering connecticut.the existing agreement with local the first agreement,which had been negotiated by nfsa and under which fairfield remained obligated,was set to expire on july.in short order,nfsa negotiations with local yielded a new collective bargaining agreement the second agreement between its and local.
however,the negotiations between fairfield and local failed to produce an agreement.as a result,with the expiration of the first local agreement on july,local called a strike against fairfield.fairfield immediately responded by hiring permanent replacements.fairfield ceased making the payments to the funds that had been required by the first agreement.fairfield instead established its own health insurance coverage and pension benefit programs for its connecticut employees,making contributions to these programs on behalf of its new replacement work force.
on march,the trustees of the funds filed suit pursuant to erisa,to recover payments they alleged were owed the funds on behalf of fairfield connecticut employees for two separate periods of delinquency july,through march,and from august,through july.after the close of discovery,the trustees moved for summary judgment.in opposition,fairfield claimed for the period after july,that it was not obligated to contribute because it was not a party to the second agreement.as for the payments sought for the period through july,fairfield argued that there were disputed material facts as to whether it was actually in arrears.
the district court disagreed with fairfield on both issues and granted summary judgment in favor of the trustees,from which fairfield now appeals.
discussion 
section provides in relevant part 
every employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall,to the extent not inconsistent with law,make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement.
this provision establishes an independent federal right of action distinct from the contract on which the duty to contribute is based,through which erisa funds may seek to compel employer contribution.james jorden,waldemar pflepsen,stephen goldberg,handbook on erisa litigation a,at ed.
july,to march,
the trustees theory of recovery for the period from july,to march,is based on a by the parties the traveling clause in the agreement,the agreement with local of new york which was entered into while fairfield was still a nfsa member.the traveling clause provides in pertinent part 
this agreement applies to the united states except in the present territory covered by the local agreement in.it is agreed that the contractor members who are subscribers to this agreement shall,when performing work within the jurisdiction of any other sprinkler fitters local union,adhere to and be bound by the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement negotiated by nfsa with these other sprinkler fitters local unions.
the trustees contend that the traveling clause effect is to obligate fairfield to adhere to the terms of the second agreement whenever fairfield operates in connecticut,even though fairfield was not a contracting party to the second agreement.
relying on this conception of the traveling clause,the trustees argue that the funds are entitled to recover against fairfield under erisa for violation of the second agreement requirement that employers operating in connecticut contribute to the funds.the district court agreed with the trustees and granted summary judgment in their favor.
on appeal,fairfield argues the district court erred because a of the lmra,a,prohibits it from contributing to the funds for the period after july,setting aside our considerable doubts as to the merits of the trustees novel theory of whether it even presents an actionable theory of recovery under erisa since fairfield was not a party to the second agree with fairfield that a of the lmra precludes contributions after july.
section a of the lmra makes it unlawful as a general matter for employers to provide payments to union affiliated representatives and entities,including union established erisa funds,beyond narrowly prescribed exceptions set out in c.see a,c see also local nursing home pension fund demisay,d section restricts payments to labor union trust funds.as we noted in moglia geoghegan,cir
