the trustees of a local union benefit funds appeal from judge hurley decision granting summary judgment and holding invalid a policy they adopted regarding the amounts owed by firms in which the owner,or owner spouse,works as an employee.see la barbera collyer equip,may,memorandum and order.we affirm 
background 
in the,local,an affiliate of the international brotherhood of teamsters,entered into written collective bargaining agreements with various employers in the heavy construction and excavating industry on long island.five trust funds,all of which are governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,were established as part of these agreements a welfare fund providing health care coverage,a pension fund,an annuity fund,a job training fund,and a vacation and sick leave fund the funds.employers are required to contribute to the funds on behalf of those employees covered by the collective bargaining agreements.
the amount of employer contributions required is tied to the number of hours each employee has worked.for example,section a b of the and collective bargaining agreements required contributions to the welfare and pension funds for each hour worked under this agreement up to a maximum of forty hours per week.
the amount of benefits employees receive is also tied to the total number of hours worked by the employees in specified periods.for example,under the welfare fund,employees who work hours or more in an employment quarter receive full health care benefits,including full accident and sickness benefits.however,employees can maintain full health care benefits,but not accident and sickness benefits,if they work at least hours in an employment quarter.employees who work hours or more in covered employment in a period commencing february and ending january regardless of the number of hours per quarter also receive full health care benefits for the following year,beginning march and ending february.employees who fail to meet either the quarterly threshold or the yearly minimum lose their health care coverage.
as a result of these provisions,employers are required to maintain records that can be audited periodically to confirm the accuracy of the reports submitted.if an employer fails to submit required reports supporting books and records for audit within twenty days after a written demand,article vi d of the trust agreement executed by the union,the employers,and the trustees,authorizes the trustees to estimate the number of hours worked by the firm employees.in these circumstances,the trustees are permitted to compute the amount of contributions due for any month by adding ten percent to the number of hours in the base month,defined as the month in which the largest number of hours were reported in the previous twelve reports.in the event that there is no determinable base month due to a lack of reports submitted by the employer or no previous audit reports,then employees are deemed to have worked hours per week for the entire unreported period,obligating the employer to make contributions accordingly.
we view the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.beginning in the the trustees perceived that some firms often reported an employee working hours each quarter,the precise minimum amount required to qualify the employee and his family for health care benefits from the welfare fund.the trustees also noted instances where employers falsified the hours worked,sometimes to the point of altering a company books and records.the trustees observed that these events often coincided with firms held by owners,firms owned by one person,who reported himself or herself,or his or her spouse,to the funds as an employee of the company,or firms owned wholly by a married couple,with one spouse reported as working for the company.
for example,appellees collyer collyer and palmo leasing palmo are family owned and operated entities in which the husband is the employee and the wife is the.in the case of collyer,the audits revealed that brenda collyer had reported her husband,jeffrey collyer,as working exactly hours in four of sixteen quarters.in a fifth quarter,she had reported her husband as working hours,and in a sixth quarter,hours.at.there was evidence that brenda collyer may have inflated her husband hours as well as shifted hours from a employee to her husband in order to meet the threshold.at.
the trustees found a similar pattern of reporting following an audit of palmo books and records for the periods july,through august.in fourteen of sixteen quarters,margaret palumbo,the shareholder of the corporation,reported that her husband,john palumbo,had worked between and hours.in seven of those quarters she reported him working at the minimum.at.
in the past,a drop in the average number of hours worked caused the funds actuarial consultants to advise the trustees to raise overall contribution rates to maintain the participants benefits.the trustees suspected that the misreporting of hours by owners was contributing to the current increase in the contribution rates required to maintain health coverage for participants eligible for benefits from the welfare fund.this may have been the case because ordinary employees who become eligible for benefits will generally have worked substantially more than the minimum hours required and thereby caused the payment of more than the minimum contributions required.the trustees were also concerned that a lower average number of hours would adversely affect the pensions of future retirees.
in response to these concerns,the trustees adopted a resolution the owner rule providing 
effective may,the trustees hereby resolve that where an employer has submitted remittance reports to the funds stating hours have been worked in covered employment by an individual who,alone or with his or her spouse,is a percent owner of the employer,or by the children,parents or siblings of such percent owner,the employer shall be required to report and pay contributions for each such person for no less than forty hours a week for each week of every month the person has been reported to have worked in covered employment.for each such person,the employer must report forty hours per week for every week in the month,irrespective of the amount of work the person actually performs or the amount of compensation the person receives in a month 
on may,and july,the trustees commenced actions against collyer and palmo,respectively,under sections a and of erisa,a and,and under section of the labor management relations act,to recover delinquent under the owner rule contributions to the five funds.the action sought retroactive contributions from as far back as owner rule was adopted in may interest.the judgments sought were substantial in the case of palmo,at least in the case of collyer,at least.the trustees also filed actions against other owners seeking contributions pursuant to the rule.ultimately,the fourteen cases were consolidated for the limited purpose of submitting a joint motion for summary judgment to determine the validity of the owner rule.see note,supra.
the district court granted appellees motion and held that the owner rule was arbitrary and capricious as a matter of law.the court held that the collective bargaining agreements did not permit the trustees to demand contributions for hours not actually worked and that the owner rule exceeded the scope of these agreements by compelling employers to make contributions for hours not worked even in circumstances where the employer had been scrupulously honest in reporting the hours of work performed and making the appropriate contributions.la barbera collyer,slip op.at.this appeal followed.

the parties dispute the standard of review to be applied in determining the validity of the owner rule.appellees argue that the court should review the rule de novo because it modifies the collective bargaining agreements,an act beyond the trustees pow
