this matter arises under a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a,which authorizes suits by,inter alia,a pension plan beneficiary to enjoin any act or practice that violates erisa,to obtain other appropriate equitable relief to redress such violations,or to enforce any provision of erisa or the terms of a pension plan.id.appellant jeffrey perelman is a participant in the defined employee pension benefit plan the plan of appellee general refractories company grc.jeffrey alleges that his father,raymond perelman,as trustee of the plan,breached his fiduciary duties by covertly investing plan assets in the corporate bonds of struggling companies owned and controlled by jeffrey brother,appellee ronald perelman.jeffrey contends that these transactions were not properly reported depleted plan assets and increased the risk of default,such that his own defined benefits are in jeopardy.the district court dismissed several of jeffrey claims for lack of constitutional standing,later granted summary judgment against him on all remaining claims,and denied his application for attorneys fees and costs under erisa g,g.we will affirm.
in,raymond became the chairman of grc,a large manufacturer of industrial materials between and,raymond was a trustee of the grc plan,and he served as plan administrator between and.in that position he exercised discretionary control over management of plan assets and thus qualified as both a plan fiduciary and a party in interest under erisa.see a,a.jason guzek,a defendant in this action but not an appellee,assumed the role of plan administrator from to and was succeeded by grc itself as plan administrator in.
raymond son ronald has been the controlling shareholder of revlon,and its wholly owned subsidiary,revlon consumer products corporation together,revlon.beginning in,raymond directed the plan purchase of roughly million of revlon corporate bonds.in,raymond converted those bonds into revlon stock.he and his wife ruth then assigned beneficial ownership of the revlon shares to mafco holdings,another company owned and controlled by ronald.as plan trustee,raymond also invested plan assets in a lending agreement between revlon and macandrews forbes holdings,macandrews,an entity that,like revlon,was principally owned by ronald.one consequence of these transactions was that ronald,by virtue of his control over the voting rights of stock held by the plan,became a plan fiduciary under a.ronald also qualified as a party in interest,both because of that fiduciary status and as a relative of raymond.id.a,f.
since,jeffrey has been a participant in grc defined benefit pension plan.jeffrey alleges that raymond and ronald,at the plan expense,structured transactions to allow ronald to raise capital for revlon without sacrificing his control over the company.jeffrey contends that these investments,which diminished plan assets,were routinely misreported by the defendants on the annual reports that a plan administrator must file with the internal revenue service irs and department of labor.see id.between and,the reports did not disclose that the plan held investments in revlon bonds.instead,the and reports stated that all plan assets were invested in master trust accounts,while the reports from through stated that all plan assets were invested in mutual funds.assessments from independent auditors,which were appended to the annual reports between and,did disclose the investments in revlon bonds,but either failed to identify those investments as transactions or did so for the wrong reasons.the plan investment in the lending agreement between revlon and macandrews also was described inaccurately.
in october,jeffrey brought this lawsuit both as an individual and on behalf of the plan against raymond,ronald,guzek,and grc.the second amended complaint,filed on july,asserts the following breach of fiduciary duty of care under.a b against raymond and ronald counts one and ten,respectively prohibited transactions under against raymond and ronald counts two and nine failure to diversify plan assets under a c against raymond,guzek,and grc counts three and six failure to update or maintain proper plan documents under against raymond,guzek,and grc counts four and seven improper delegation of control of plan assets under a against raymond count five and failure to prosecute a breach of fiduciary duty against guzek,grc,and ronald counts eight and eleven.the complaint seeks monetary relief under erisa a,a,in the form of restitution for plan losses and disgorgement of profits.it also demands injunctive relief,including removal of raymond as trustee appointment of an independent trustee an outside audit for all plan years from to an order enjoining raymond from ever again serving in a fiduciary capacity for an erisa plan and an order declaring void any provision in the plan or its trust agreement that would indemnify any defendant.finally,the complaint requests attorneys fees and costs under erisa g,g.
in august,the district court found that jeffrey lacked constitutional standing to pursue restitution and disgorgement claims because he had failed to demonstrate an actual injury to himself,as opposed to the plan.the court nonetheless permitted jeffrey to pursue the other requested forms of injunctive relief.thereafter,in september,raymond executed a corporate resolution terminating himself as trustee and appointing reliance trust company to that position grc also retained the services of an independent investment manager for the plan.and earlier in,raymond voluntarily contributed to the plan trust.none of these actions,however,included an admission of culpability or wrongdoing.
in january,the court denied jeffrey motion to file a third amended complaint,finding that the addition of a claim for monetary damages under erisa a,a,would be futile,again for failure to allege an actual injury.the court also denied as moot jeffrey bid to remove raymond as trustee.with respect to the trustee indemnification language,the court concluded that the plan clause fell within a provision because any indemnification would be funded by grc rather than by the plan itself.because the trust agreement,however,was ambiguous as to which entity would fund any indemnification,the court concluded that jeffrey had stated a claim for relief as to that document.the court dismissed jeffrey claim to permanently bar raymond from serving as an erisa fiduciary,finding that the secretary of labor,rather than jeffrey,was the appropriate party to seek such relief with respect to pension plans in which jeffrey was not a participant or beneficiary.and finally,the court concluded that jeffrey request for a historical audit would serve only to support an attendant claim for restitution and disgorgement,which the court had already concluded was impermissible in the absence of actual injury sustained by jeffrey.the court thus limited the scope of jeffrey demand for an audit to a determination of whether the plan was currently at risk of default.
in february,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all remaining claims.first,the court concluded that,under statutorily endorsed accounting principles,no genuine dispute of material fact existed as to whether the plan was currently funded,meaning that jeffrey was not entitled to audit relief.the court also concluded that no live case or controversy existed with respect to the trust agreement indemnification clause.
on april,the district court denied jeffrey application for attorneys fees and costs,finding that jeffrey had not achieved some degree of success on the merits,ruckelshaus sierra club,and that even if some degree of success had been achieved,jeffrey had not demonstrated an entitlement to fees under the test announced in ursic bethlehem mines,cir.he filed a timely appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction under e and f.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
jeffrey raises two main claims on appeal.first,he contends that he has standing to seek monetary equitable relief such as disgorgement or restitution under erisa a because he did in fact suffer an increased risk of plan default with respect to his defined benefits,and insofar as he seeks relief on behalf of the plan,no showing of individual harm is necessary.second,jeffrey challenges the denial of attorneys fees and costs,contending that his lawsuit was a catalyst for the voluntary resolution of several issues,including raymond resignation as trustee,and the district court misapplied the five ursic factors.

the three elements of the doctrine of constitutional standing are as follows 
first,the plaintiff must suffer an that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,as opposed to conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of the injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.id.alterations in original quoting simon.welfare rights.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.quotation marks omitted.
over the past fifteen years we have twice grappled with the complexities of constitutional standing as it relates to claims for monetary equitable relief brought by plan participants under erisa a.see id.at horvath keystone health plan,cir jeffrey standing here,like that of the plaintiffs in edmonson and horvath,turns primarily on the first element,also described as actual harm.see horvath,at.with respect to claims for injunctive relief,such injury may exist simply by virtue of the defendant violation of an erisa statutory duty,such as failure to comply with disclosure requirements.see id.claims demanding a monetary equitable remedy,by contrast,require the plaintiff to allege an individualized financial harm traceable to the defendant alleged erisa violations.id.at 
jeffrey claims two financial injuries that,in his view,support a finding of standing to pursue equitable relief in the form of restitution or surcharge.first,he submits expert testimony that the plan suffered a net diminution in assets of approximately million as a result of raymond investment of plan assets in revlon debt second,he offers expert testimony that due to this diminution in assets,the plan risk of default increased dramatically.he concedes,however,that to date,he has received all distributions under the plan to which he was entitled.
in the case of a defined benefit plan,like the plan here,the supreme court has established that diminution in plan assets,without more,is insufficient to establish actual injury to any particular participant.see hughes aircraft jacobson.this stems from the fact that participants in such a plan are entitled only to a fixed periodic payment,and have no claim to any particular asset that composes a part of the plan general asset pool.id.at.accordingly,even if the defendants dealings resulted in a diminution in plan assets,they are insufficient to confer standing upon jeffrey absent a showing of individualized harm.
by contrast,there is some support for the notion that a participant or beneficiary in a defined benefit plan has suffered an injury sufficient to pursue a claim for equitable monetary relief under a where the fiduciary alleged misconduct creates or enhances the risk of default by the entire plan.larue dewolff,boberg.the risk of default by defined benefit plans,of course,is not a novel or abstract concept.congress has sought rigorously to minimize or eliminate such risk by requiring defined benefit plans to satisfy complex minimum funding requirements,and to make premium payments to the pension benefit guaranty corporation for plan termination insurance.id.
specifically,an employer must make minimum required contribution s to its defined benefit plan whenever the value of plan assets is less than the plan yearly funding target,defined as the present value of all benefits accrued or earned under the plan as of the beginning of the plan year.a,d a,d.in other words,an employer is required to contribute to a plan whenever the plan liabilities exceed its assets.however,a plan does not qualify as or underfunded statuses which trigger even more onerous funding safeguards unless the value of plan assets is less than of the plan funding target.i,f c i,f c.
under the same statutory scheme,plan surpluses or shortfalls are calculated based on prevailing segment rates,interest rates based on historical bond yields.see h h.on july,congress enacted the moving ahead for progress in the century act map,stat,which authorized the use of new segment rates beginning december.see h c iv h c iv.that authorization was extended in august and remains operative.see highway and transportation funding act of hafta,stat.as explained in hafta legislative history,map modified the interest rates used in valuing pension liabilities to give employers the option to effectively spread out the higher contributions over a longer period of time than would otherwise have been required,pt,at.
as of january,the date of the plan most recent available actuarial report,the plan had assets of approximately million.jeffrey concedes that,under map accounting methods,the plan liabilities at that time were approximately million,meaning that the plan assets exceeded its liabilities.by the same token,however,we accept his allegations which are bolstered by his expert that,under the statutory valuation methods predating map,the plan liabilities on an ongoing plan basis were approximately million a ratio that left the plan only funded.in jeffrey view,the fact that the plan assets were less than its liabilities under at least one analytical approach would permit a factual finding that raymond dealings increased the risk that the plan might default on its obligations.jeffrey argues that the dueling legitimacy of the two accounting approaches is a question of fact that must be resolved at trial.
we agree with the district court,however,that the controlling yardstick here is provided by the finely tuned framework established by congress.where a plan assets exceed its liabilities under a statutorily accepted accounting method,it passes muster as a matter of law,the employer need not make additional contributions to remove a designation of or underfunded status.see,harley.min,cir finding no injury where plan funding level had not triggered minimum required contributions adedipe bank,ass n,d,concluding that the relevant measure for actual injury is whether the plan funding levels triggered minimum required contributions.
here,the evidence is undisputed that as of january,under a valuation method approved by congress,the plan was appropriately funded,and grc had no obligation to make further contributions to stabilize the plan finances.under the circumstances,jeffrey allegation that the plan is nonetheless at risk of default is entirely speculative.see david alphin,cir t he risk that appellants pension benefits will at some point in the future be adversely affected as a result of the present alleged erisa violations is too speculative to give rise to article iii standing.harley,at noting that because of minimum contribution requirements,diminutions in plan surplus generally do not result in actual harm to beneficiaries.thus,like the district court,we conclude that the sac fails to allege the actual harm required to sustain constitutional standing for an individual claim of equitable relief under a.
jeffrey also claims that he has standing to seek disgorgement of profits under edmonson,where we recognized that an erisa beneficiary suffers an sufficient to bring a disgorgement claim when a defendant allegedly breaches its fiduciary duty,profits from the breach,and the beneficiary,as opposed to the plan,has an individual right to the profit.at.he is correct that,to pursue such a claim,a plaintiff need not plead a financial loss.nonetheless,the plaintiff must still show an individua
