opinion of the court 
this case requires us to decide whether of the employee retirement and income security act,applies to rehiring decisions.plaintiffs are former employees of defendant mack trucks,who lost their jobs when mack closed its allentown plant in.some plaintiffs had vested pension rights at the time they were laid off.others merely had credit for past service.in,when the economy had improved,mack needed to hire workers for its macungie plant.by this time,all the plaintiffs had either exhausted or forfeited any recall rights with mack.mack declined to rehire plaintiffs because to do so would create a future pension liability disproportionately greater than that incurred by hiring employees without past service or pension credit.plaintiffs contend that mack decision amounts to unlawful discrimination under of erisa.
the district court rejected plaintiffs claims in their entirety on a motion for summary judgment.we will affirm that decision.we agree,as an initial matter,that those plaintiffs without vested pension rights lack standing to pursue their claim.see shawley bethlehem steel,cir.shawley does not foreclose standing for those plaintiffs with vested rights,however thus,we reach the merits of their claims and resolve the question left unanswered in shawley whether an employer refusal to rehire based on a desire to avoid increased pension liability is prohibited activity under.id.at.we conclude that does not proscribe mack refusal to rehire the vested plaintiffs.
defendant mack trucks manufactures and distributes trucks.it operates an assembly plant in macungie,lehigh county,pennsylvania,and,until,operated machining and fabrication plants in allentown,pennsylvania.employees in both locations are and were represented by the united automobile,aerospace and agricultural implement workers uaw and uaw local.the plants in allentown and macungie were covered by the master agreement as well as by local agreements.
the master agreement includes,as appendix a,the pension plan,which is subject to renegotiation every time the master agreement itself is renegotiated.prior to january,an employee covered by the plan became vested under the plan after ten years of service.on and after january,employees became vested after five years of service.the plan also provided that any rehired former employee would be entitled to credit for past service no matter how long the break between employment periods.
when mack closed its facilities in allentown in,a number of employees lost their jobs.some transferred or were absorbed into other mack plants.others,like the plaintiffs,either accepted a cash dislocation benefit to relinquish their seniority rights or were laid off and eventually exhausted their recall rights.some plaintiffs were laid off before meeting the ten year vesting requirement in place at the time other plaintiffs were fully vested by the time they were laid off.
in,a combination of rising production needs and workforce attrition made it necessary for mack to hire new employees at the macungie plant.although mack former employees were initially the first to be offered new jobs,mack soon realized that a rehired former employee with credited service under the plan would receive a disproportionately larger pension than would a newly hired employee.
there are three reasons for this difference in pension benefits between former employees and new hires.first,former employees who had not vested under the plan would receive credit for past service and would become vested in less than the five years applicable to new hires second,former employees were more likely to become eligible for early retirement before age.third,former employees would be entitled to raise their pension rate on retirement above the lower benefit rate in place as of the day they had been laid off in.
as a result,in july of mack decided to stop hiring former employees with credited service under the plan.all plaintiffs are former mack employees who were not considered for due to mack pension liability avoidance policy.
the plaintiffs brought a complaint seeking injunctive and monetary relief based on allegations that mack violated when it refused to rehire them.after mack filed a timely answer admitting the essential facts of the complaint,the parties brought for summary judgment and asked the district court to rule on a core set of stipulated facts.on november,the district court found that mack decision not to rehire plaintiffs was not unlawful and entered judgment in favor of mack.plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have federal question jurisdiction over this case under because plaintiffs have alleged a violation of of erisa.we also have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court november,order granting summary judgment under.
the for summary judgment were submitted with no dispute as to a core set of stipulated facts,and the district court resolved only issues of law in its ruling.as a result the standard of our review for the district court decision is plenary.see west american insurance park,cir.
iii.discussion 
we first address whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue under.a plaintiff may bring a civil action under of erisa if he is a participant or beneficiary of a benefit plan.a b.the statute defines a participant as any employee or former employee of an employer who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan id.at.
while there is no dispute that the plaintiffs are former employees,it is unclear whether they are participants under.to resolve this issue we must decide whether the plaintiffs,as former employees have a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment or a colorable claim to vested benefits.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.while it is clear that the vested plaintiffs have standing under the second element,our opinion in shawley bethlehem steel,cir,establishes that the plaintiffs fail both elements of firestone.
do plaintiffs have a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment 
like the plaintiffs in shawley bethlehem steel,cir,the plaintiffs lack a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment.the plaintiffs in shawley were a group of former employees who had been laid off for several years.when their previous employer considered rehiring them but refused to do so,they sued under erisa.the employees claimed that the employer violated the law by basing its hiring decision upon a desire to avoid increased pension liability.shawley,at.under those facts,where the collective bargaining agreement expressly covers recall rights,and former employees were not hired before the expiration of those believe plaintiffs had no reasonable expectation of reemployment.id.at.
the plaintiffs here are indistinguishable.their collective bargaining agreement also covers recall rights.by the time mack considered rehiring them,all of their recall rights had either expired or been waived in lieu of dislocation benefits.thus,under our holding in shawley,plaintiffs lack a reasonable expectation of reemployment.
the plaintiffs contend nevertheless that their reasonable expectation of reemployment and the consequent vesting of their benefits would have been realized but for mack refusal to rehire them.in support of this proposition,they cite christopher mobil oil,cir.their argument,however,ignores our earlier rejection of standing for similarly situated plaintiffs even under the christopher but for analysis.shawley,at.as we explained there,the but for analysis grants standing only when the employer action in and of itself divests aggrieved parties of their status as covered employees.id.quoting christopher at.
the but for test does not establish standing for former employees who are not rehired after being laid off due to an economic downturn 
bethlehem steel refusal to rehire plaintiffs did not in and of itself strip them of their employee status plaintiffs were not terminated,constructively discharged,or tricked into retiring from bethlehem were laid off because of an economic downturn in the steel industry.
shawley,at.thus,even if there were situati
