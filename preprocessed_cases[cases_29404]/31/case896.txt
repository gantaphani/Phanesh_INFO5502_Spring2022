jeremy braden,an employee of and participant in its employee retirement plan plan,brought this putative class action against and various executives involved in the management of the plan.braden alleges that they violated fiduciary duties imposed by the employee retirement income security act erisa.appellees moved for dismissal under federal rules of civil procedure b and b.the district court granted the motion,concluding that braden lacked constitutional standing to assert claims based on breaches of fiduciary duty prior to the date he first contributed to the plan and that he otherwise failed to state any plausible claim upon which relief could be granted braden timely appealed.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
profit sharing and k plan is an employee pension benefit plan covered by erisa.a.it is also an individual account plan,establishing an individual profit sharing and k account for each participating employee.is the plan sponsor and administrator under.merrill lynch,is the plan trustee,holding its assets in trust and providing various administrative services necessary to the maintenance of participants accounts.
at the end of,the plan had over one million participants and nearly billion in assets.individual participants directed investment of the assets in their plan accounts by selecting from a menu of investment options.during the period relevant to braden claims,the available options included ten mutual funds,a trust,common stock,and a stable value fund.these options were selected by retirement plans committee,the plan named fiduciary and the entity responsible for the operation,investment policy,and administration of the plan.
jeremy braden began working for in may.he became eligible to participate in the plan in june and made his first contribution on october.he continued his employment with and his participation in the plan throughout the period relevant to this appeal.
braden filed his complaint on march,alleging five causes of action against and the individual appellees,executives serving on or responsible for overseeing the retirement plans committee the gravamen of the complaint is that appellees failed adequately to evaluate the investment options included in the plan.it alleges that the process by which the mutual funds were selected was tainted by appellees failure to consider trustee merrill lynch interest in including funds that shared their fees with the trustee.the result of these failures,according to braden,is that some or all of the investment options included in the plan charge excessive fees.he estimates that these fees have unnecessarily cost the plan some million over the past six years and will continue to waste approximately million per year.
braden alleges extensive facts in support of these claims.he claims that retirement plan is relatively large and that plans of such size have substantial bargaining power in the highly competitive k marketplace.as a result,plans such as can obtain institutional shares of mutual funds,which,braden claims,are significantly cheaper than the retail shares generally offered to individual investors.nonetheless,he alleges that the plan only offers retail class shares to participants.braden also avers that seven of the ten funds charge fees,which he alleges are used to benefit the fund companies but not plan participants.
braden alleges further that the relatively high fees charged by the plan funds can not be justified by greater returns on investment since most of them underperformed lower cost alternatives.in support of this claim,he offers specific comparisons of each plan fund to an allegedly similar but more cost effective fund available in the market.in comparison to an investment in index funds,braden estimates that the higher fees and lower returns of the plan funds cost the plan some million by the end of.
finally,the complaint also alleges that the mutual fund companies whose funds were included in the plan shared with merrill lynch portions of the fees they collected from participants investments.this practice,sometimes called revenue sharing,is used to cover a portion of the costs of services provided by an entity such as a trustee of a k plan,and is not uncommon in the industry.braden alleges,however,that in this case the revenue sharing payments were not reasonable compensation for services rendered by merrill lynch,but rather were kickbacks paid by the mutual fund companies in exchange for inclusion of their funds in the plan.the plan trust agreement requires appellees to keep the amounts of the revenue sharing payments confidential.
count i of the complaint spells out braden breach of fiduciary duty claim in detail.count iii alleges that appellees breached their duty of loyalty by failing to inform plan participants of certain information relating to the fees charged by the plan funds,as well as the amounts of the revenue sharing payments made to merrill lynch.count v alleges that the revenue sharing payments were prohibited transactions under a.finally,counts ii and iv allege,respectively,that those appellees with oversight responsibility failed adequately to monitor those who managed the plan and that they are liable for the breaches of their cofiduciaries pursuant to a.
the district court dismissed all claims.it concluded that braden could not personally have suffered injury before october,the date he first contributed to the plan.according to the district court,braden therefore did not have article iii standing to assert claims for breaches before that date.it dismissed the remaining claims on the grounds that braden had alleged insufficient facts to support the claim of imprudent or disloyal management,that appellees had no duty to disclose the information braden sought,and that he had failed to show the alleged prohibited transactions with merrill lynch were not exempted by.because each of the direct claims failed,the court also dismissed the derivative claims based on monitoring and cofiduciary liability.
braden challenges each of the district court conclusions on appeal.we review the court order de novo,accepting as true the complaint factual allegations and granting all reasonable inferences to the party.taxi connection dakota,cir.
in order to proceed with his claims on behalf of the plan,braden must have both article iii standing and a cause of action under erisa.see,glanton ex rel.alcoa prescription drug plan advancepcs,cir.we conclude that braden has made a sufficient showing at this stage of the litigation to satisfy both requirements and that the district court erred in concluding that he lacked standing to maintain claims for the period before he began participating in the plan.
the doctrine of standing limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process.lujan defenders of wildlife,d quoting whitmore arkansas,d.some elements of the doctrine are prudential,involving self imposed limits on judicial power.these limits may be modified or abrogated by congress.bennett spear,d.the heart of standing,however,is the principle that in order to invoke the power of a federal court,a plaintiff must present a case or controversy within the meaning of article iii of the constitution.this irreducible constitutional minimum of standing requires a showing of injury in fact to the plaintiff that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan,at.citations and alterations omitted.
injury in fact is an invasion of a legally cognizable right.whether a plaintiff has shown such an injury often turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.warth seldin,d.in most cases,then,a plaintiff standing tracks his cause of action.that is,the question whether he has a cognizable injury sufficient to confer standing is closely bound up with the question of whether and how the law will grant him relief.see william fletcher,the structure of standing,yale,t he question of whether plaintiff stands in a position to enforce defendant duty is determined by looking to the substantive law upon which plaintiff relies.it is crucial,however,not to conflate article iii requirement of injury in fact with a plaintiff potential causes of action,for the concepts are not coextensive.see ass of data processing serv.orgs.camp,d.
article iii generally requires injury to the plaintiff personal legal interests,see.agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d but that does not mean that a plaintiff with article iii standing may only assert his own rights or redress his own injuries.to the contrary,constitutional standing is only a threshold inquiry,and so long as article iii is satisfied,persons to whom congress has granted a right of action,either expressly or by clear implication,may have standing to seek relief on the basis of the legal rights and interests of others.id.at.in such a case,a plaintiff may be able to assert causes of action which are based on conduct that harmed him,but which sweep more broadly than the injury he personally suffered.see sprint commc ns apcc,d f ederal courts routinely entertain suits which will result in relief for parties that are not themselves directly bringing suit.
the district court erred by conflating the issue of braden article iii standing with his potential personal causes of action under erisa.it concluded that braden had no standing for the period before he began participating in the plan because u nder erisa,a fiduciary relationship does not exist towards potential participants in a plan and such potential participants have no standing to sue for breach of fiduciary duty.it therefore granted appellees motion to dismiss all claims occurring prior to october.in reaching this conclusion,the district court mixed two distinct issues.whether braden may pursue claims on behalf of the plan at all is a question of constitutional standing which turns on his personal injury.whether relief may be had for a certain period of time is a separate question,and its answer turns on the cause of action braden asserts.
at this stage in the litigation it is impossible to say when any particular claim occurred in the sense of when the action giving rise to it began or ended.we must assume for purposes of this appeal,however,that braden allegations are true.taxi connection,at.on that standard braden has made a sufficient showing of standing for the entire period embraced by his complaint.see lujan,at.standing must be shown with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.
braden has satisfied the requirements of article iii because he has alleged actual injury to his own plan account.that injury is fairly traceable to appellees conduct because he has alleged a causal connection between their those taken before his participation in the his injury finally,the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable judgment.see lujan,at.braden has thus made out a case or controversy between himself and appellees within the meaning of art.iii.warth,at.
the question whether recovery might be had for the period before braden personally suffered injury is not one of constitutional standing,but turns instead on whether the statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiff position a right to judicial relief.id.at.in this case,we must answer that question in the affirmative.
a provides for a civil action by a participant for appropriate relief under.it is undisputed that braden is a participant.see adamson armco,cir a participant is defined in erisa as someone who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.quoting.it is well settled,moreover,that suit under a is brought in a representative capacity on behalf of the plan as a whole and that remedies under protect the entire plan.mut.life ins.russell,d larue dewolff,boberg,d section a does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries.
courts have recognized that a plaintiff with article iii standing may proceed under a on behalf of the plan or other participants.see,fallick nationwide mut.ins,cir t he provisions of erisa were not intended to limit a claimant right to proceed under rule on behalf of all individuals affected by the fiduciary challenged conduct,regardless of the representative lack of participation in all the plans involved.thus,a plaintiff may seek relief under a that sweeps beyond his own injury.since braden has standing under article iii,we conclude that a provides him a cause of action to seek relief for the entire plan.the relief that may be appropriate,should braden succeed,is not necessarily limited to the period in which he personally suffered injury.
our decision in harley.mining,cir,is not to the contrary.in harley the plaintiffs were participants in a defined benefit plan who sued to recover losses caused to the plan by the fiduciary allegedly imprudent investments.id.at.because the plan retained a surplus notwithstanding the losses,however,the plaintiffs own benefits remained unchanged and they accordingly suffered no harm.id.at.we concluded that participants or beneficiaries who have suffered no injury in fact do not have standing to sue on behalf of the plan under a.id.at emphasis in original.this is not such a case as pled by braden.
the present case is different for the simple reason that braden has alleged injury in fact that is causally related to the conduct he seeks to challenge on behalf of the plan.unlike the harley plaintiffs,braden has a personal stake in the litigation.his own recovery will stand or fall with that of the plan because a does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries.larue.at.at bottom,the gist of the question of standing is whether a plaintiff has such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination.massachusetts epa,d quoting baker carr,d.this central concern of article iii is satisfied here,and a provides the appropriate vehicle for braden to proceed on behalf of the plan.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in dismissing braden claims for lack of standing.
federal rule of civil procedure requires that a complaint present a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.in order to meet this standard,and survive a motion to dismiss under rule b,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atl.twombly,d.the plausibility standard requires a plaintiff to show at the pleading stage that success on the merits is more than a sheer possibility.id.it is not,however,a probability requirement.id.thus,a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable,and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.twombly,at.quoting scheuer rhodes,d.
a complaint states a plausible claim for relief if its factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.iqbal.at.several principles guide us in determining whether a complaint meets this standard.first,the court must take the plaintiff factual allegations as true.id.at.this tenet does not apply,however,to legal conclusions or formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action such allegations may properly be set aside.id.quoting twombly,at.in addition,some factual allegations may be so indeterminate that they require further factual enhancement in order to state a claim.id.quoting twombly,at.see also brooks ross,cir.
finally,the complaint should be read as a whole,not parsed piece by piece to determine whether each allegation,in isolation,is plausible.see vila.inv,factual allegations should be viewed in their totality tellabs,makor issues rights,d the inquiry under the private securities litigation reform act is whether all of the facts alleged,taken collectively,give rise to a strong inference of scienter,not whether any individual allegation,scrutinized in isolation,meets that standard.ultimately,evaluation of a complaint upon a motion to dismiss is a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.iqbal.at.
with these principles in mind,we turn to braden complaint.count i alleges that appellees breached the fiduciary duties of prudence and loyalty imposed upon them by.in order to state a claim under this provision,a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that the defendant acted as a fiduciary,breached its fiduciary duties,and thereby caused a loss to the plan.pegram herdrich,d roth lumber,cir.only the issue of breach is disputed here.
erisa imposes upon fiduciaries twin duties of loyalty and prudence,requiring them to act solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries and to carry out their duties with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a.the statute prudent person standard is an objective standard that focuses on the fiduciary conduct preceding the challenged decision.roth,at citing katsaros cody,cir.in evaluating whether a fiduciary has acted prudently,we therefore focus on the process by which it makes its decisions rather than the results of those decisions.id.at schaefer.med.soc y,cir fiduciaries must investigate all decisions that will affect the pension plan.
focusing on this standard of liability,the district court found the complaint inadequate because it did not allege sufficient facts to show how appellees decision making process was flawed.we conclude that the district court erred in its application of rule.accepting braden well pleaded factual allegations as true,he has stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
the district court erred in two ways.it ignored reasonable inferences supported by the facts alleged.it also drew inferences in appellees favor,faulting braden for failing to plead facts tending to contradict those inferences.each of these errors violates the familiar axiom that on a motion to dismiss,inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party.northstar indus.merrill lynch,cir.twombly and iqbal did not change this fundamental tenet of rule b practice.see iqbal.at vila,at justice town of cicero,cir ashcroft,cir.
the first of these errors stems from the mistaken assumption that braden was required to describe directly the ways in which appellees breached their fiduciary duties.thus,for example,the district court faulted the complaint for making no allegations regarding the fiduciaries conduct.rule does not,however,require a plaintiff to plead specific facts explaining precisely how the defendant conduct was unlawful.erickson pardus,d per curiam.rather,it is sufficient for a plaintiff to plead facts indirectly showing unlawful behavior,so long as the facts pled give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,id.quoting twombly,at.alteration omitted,and allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.iqbal.at.
braden has satisfied these requirements.the complaint alleges that the plan comprises a very large pool of assets,that the k marketplace is highly competitive,and that retirement plans of such size consequently have the ability to obtain institutional class shares of mutual funds.despite this ability,according to the allegations of the complaint,each of the ten funds included in the plan offers only retail class shares,which charge significantly higher fees than institutional shares for the same return on investment the complaint also alleges that seven of the plan ten funds charge fees from which participants derive no benefit.the complaint states that appellees did not change the options included in the plan despite the fact that most of them underperformed the market indices they were designed to track.finally,it alleges that the funds included in the plan made revenue sharing payments to the trustee,merrill lynch,and that these payments were not made in exchange for services rendered,but rather were a quid pro quo for inclusion in the plan.
the district court correctly noted that none of these allegations directly addresses the process by which the plan was managed.it is reasonable,however,to infer from what is alleged that the process was flawed.taken as true,and considered as a whole,the complaint allegations can be understood to assert that the plan includes a relatively limited menu of funds which were selected by executives despite the ready availability of better options.the complaint alleges,moreover,that these options were chosen to benefit the trustee at the expense of the participants.if these allegations are substantiated,the process by which appellees selected and managed the funds in the plan would have been tainted by failure of effort,competence,or loyalty.thus the allegations state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.see roth,at 
these are of course only inferences,and there may well be lawful reasons appellees chose the challenged investment options.it is not braden responsibility to rebut these possibilities in his complaint,however.the district court erred by placing that burden on him,finding the complaint inadequate for failing to rule out potential lawful explanations for appellees conduct.it stated that appellees could have chosen funds with higher fees for any number of reasons,including potential for higher return,lower financial risk,more services offered,or greater management flexibility.that may be so,but rule does not require a plaintiff to plead facts tending to rebut all possible lawful explanations for a defendant conduct.
to be sure,a plaintiff may need to rule out alternative explanations in some circumstances in order to survive a motion to dismiss.in iqbal,for example,the supreme court concluded that the plaintiff failed to state a claim in light of more likely explanations for the defendants conduct.iqbal.at.iqbal had alleged that in response to the terrorist attacks of september,the attorney general and the fbi director adopted an unconstitutional policy of subjecting arab muslim men to harsh conditions of confinement solely on account of their race,religion,or national origin.see id.at.the court perceived an obvious alternative explanation for the disparate impact of the defendants policies on arab muslims,however the september attacks were perpetrated by arab muslim hijackers who counted themselves members in good standing of al qaeda,an islamic fundamentalist group.al qaeda was headed by another arab bin composed in large part of his arab muslim disciples.id.at.
the court assumed that any rational investigation of the september attacks would thus have focused on arab muslims a disparate impact on this group is exactly what one would expect from such an investigation.it is in this sort of there is a concrete,obvious alternative explanation for the defendant a plaintiff may be required to plead additional facts tending to rule out the alternative.id.quoting twombly,at.twombly,at.plaintiff failed to state a claim where facts alleged described nothing more than defendants natural,lawful reaction to economic incentives.such a requirement is neither a special rule nor a new one.it is simply a corollary of the basic plausibility requirement.an inference pressed by the plaintiff is not plausible if the facts he points to are precisely the result one would expect from lawful conduct in which the defendant is known to have engaged.
not every potential lawful explanation for the defendant conduct renders the plaintiff theory implausible.just as a plaintiff can not proceed if his allegations are merely consistent with a defendant liability,id.at quoting twombly,at,so a defendant is not entitled to dismissal if the facts are merely consistent with lawful conduct.and that is exactly the situation in this case.certainly appellees could have chosen funds with higher fees for various reasons,but this speculation is far from the sort of concrete,obvious alternative explanation braden would need to rebut in his complaint.requiring a plaintiff to rule out every possible lawful explanation for the conduct he challenges would invert the principle that the complaint is construed most favorably to the nonmoving party,northstar,at,and would impose the sort of probability requirement at the pleading stage which iqbal and twombly explicitly reject.see iqbal.at.
to recognize that the pleading standard established by rule applies uniformly in all civil actions,id.at quoting,is not to ignore the significant costs of discovery in complex litigation and the attendant waste and expense that can be inflicted upon innocent parties by meritless claims.see twombly,at.here,however,we must be attendant to erisa remedial purpose and evident intent to prevent through private civil litigation misuse and mismanagement of plan assets.russell,at.
congress intended that private individuals would play an important role in enforcing erisa fiduciary which have been described as the highest known to the law.donovan bierwirth,cir.in giving effect to this intent,we must be cognizant of the practical context of erisa litigation.no matter how clever or diligent,erisa plaintiffs generally lack the inside information necessary to make out their claims in detail unless and until discovery commences.thus,while a plaintiff must offer sufficient factual allegations to show that he or she is not merely engaged in a fishing expedition or strike suit,we must also take account of their limited access to crucial information.if plaintiffs can not state a claim without pleading facts which tend systemically to be in the sole possession of defendants,the remedial scheme of the statute will fail,and the crucial rights secured by erisa will suffer.these considerations counsel careful and holistic evaluation of an erisa complaint factual allegations before concluding that they do not support a plausible inference that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.
the district court erred in dismissing braden fiduciary duty claim because it misapplied the pleading standard of rule,most fundamentally by failing to draw reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party as is required.we conclude that braden has pled sufficient facts to proceed with his claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
erisa and its associated regulations impose upon fiduciaries extensive and specific obligations of disclosure.see generally et.these duties are supplemented by the general duty of loyalty under a.courts have interpreted this duty to impose additional obligations of communication and disclosure under certain circumstances.see kalda sioux valley physician partners,cir.nevertheless,we are not quick to infer specific duties of disclosure under because of the extent of the statutory and regulatory scheme.see jensen sipco,cir barrs lockheed martin,cir.
it is uncontroversial that the duty of loyalty requires fiduciaries to deal fairly and honestly with all plan members,shea esensten,cir,cert.denied,d,and it is a breach of this duty affirmatively to mislead a participant or beneficiary.see kalda,at varity howe,d.morever,in some circumstances fiduciaries must on their own initiative disclose any material information that could adversely affect a participant interests.kalda,at citing shea,at.
braden claims that appellees breached their duty of loyalty by failing to disclose to participants complete and accurate material information about the plan funds and the process by which they were selected.his nondisclosure claims can be separated into two groups.one group relates to the performance of and fees charged by the plan funds and the other to the revenue sharing payments to merrill lynch.with respect to the former,braden alleges that appellees should have disclosed that the funds charged higher fees than readily available alternatives designed to track the same market indices the funds underperformed readily available and more cost effective alternatives all of the fees were paid from plan assets and they consequently depleted participants retirement savings all of the plan funds offered retail shares despite the fact that had access to institutional shares the fees charged by several of the funds did not benefit participants,and comparable alternatives charged no such fees and appellees did not select the plan funds or continually evaluate them based on the reasonableness of the fees they charged.in connection with the revenue sharing payments,braden alleges that appellees should have disclosed the amounts of the payments that they were retained by merrill lynch and not in turn paid to the plan and that the payments were made in exchange for inclusion of certain funds in the plan.
the district court dismissed these claims,concluding that erisa does not require disclosure of revenue sharing arrangements and that the other information braden sought was not material.we disagree.
information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that nondisclosure would mislead a reasonable employee in the process of making an adequately informed decision regarding benefits to which she might be entitled.kalda,at quoting krohn huron mem l,cir alteration omitted.in the context of this case,materiality turns on the effect information would have on a reasonable participant decisions about how to allocate his or her investments among the options in the plan.see edgar avaya,cir.
materiality is a fact intensive issue which can be decided as a matter of law only if no reasonable trier of fact could disagree.see pfahler latex prods,cir in re unisys sav.plan,cir tsc,northway,d the determination of materiality under sec rule requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact.
braden nondisclosure claim relating to fees parallels his claim for breach of fiduciary duty.he alleges,for example,that appellees had a duty to disclose to participants that plan funds charged higher fees than comparable funds,that had access to more cost effective institutional shares,and that appellees did not select or evaluate the funds on the basis of the fees they charged.a reasonable trier of fact could find that failure to disclose this information would mislead a reasonable participant in the process of making investment decisions under the plan.see kalda,at.for example,participants might conclude in light of this information that plan funds were not selected using appropriate criteria and might therefore direct their investments toward other options.accordingly,braden has stated a claim under.see unisys,at finding triable issues of fact where plaintiffs alleged material misrepresentations and omissions regarding risks associated with certain investment options offered by plan.
by the same token,braden allegations are sufficient to state a claim that appellees breached their duty of loyalty by failing to disclose details about the revenue sharing payments.braden alleges that those payments corrupted the fund selection each fund was selected for inclusion in the plan because it made payments to the trustee,and not because it was a prudent investment.if true,this information could influence a reasonable participant in evaluating his or her options under the plan.in shea esensten,we found an hmo had a duty to disclose financial incentives that would discourage doctors from making referrals for conditions covered under the hmo plan.see at.the context of that case was quite different,but the fundamental principle is applicable here.erisa duty of loyalty may require a fiduciary to disclose latent conflicts of interest which affect participants ability to make informed decisions about their benefits.
the district court did not apply the materiality analysis laid out in shea and kalda.instead,it simply concluded that there is no duty to disclose revenue sharing payments.while we agree that there may be no per se duty to disclose such payments,that conclusion is not dispositive here.as we have indicated,materiality is a fact and context sensitive inquiry.on this record,braden disclosure claims can not be decided as a matter of law.
