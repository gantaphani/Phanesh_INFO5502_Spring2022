we conclude that the district court erred in ordering hanna steel to pay penalties to wright and the children.we reject hanna steel contention that the district court abused its discretion in its attorney fees award.
the parties do not dispute the pertinent factual background of this dispute.wright was employed by hanna steel from august,until december.in december,wright,his wife,and their two minor children were enrolled in hanna steel group health plan.hanna steel was the plan administrator for the health plan.claims under the plan were turned over to blue cross blue shield of alabama.wright worked at hanna steel northport plant in tuscaloosa,alabama.connie scott,a hanna steel employee,provided him and the other employees the information and application for enrollment in the plan during and.
wright voluntarily terminated his employment with hanna steel on december.hanna steel was solely responsible for entering employees eligibility data on the blue cross computer system.it did not cancel wright group health insurance when he stopped work.the information hanna steel entered in its database erroneously reflected that wright was employed from until june.in fact,wright began working for alabama windshield on january.hanna steel never supplied wright,wright,or their children with a specific notice of rights,obligations,and premium costs for continuation coverage under the hanna steel health plan.see consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of cobra 
on january,wright completed an application to transfer his family health insurance to the glass doctor health insurance plan,which covered alabama windshield employees.claims under the glass doctor health plan,like claims under the hanna steel plan,were turned over to blue cross.sarah dickinson,the glass doctor employee benefits representative,contacted blue cross about placing wright and his family on the glass doctor plan and faxed wright application to blue cross.blue cross,however,declined the request to place wright and his family on the glass doctor plan because their records indicated he continued to be covered by the hanna steel plan.
wright testified that when he picked up his last check from hanna steel,he spoke with scott about the coverage date for his insurance and she told him that it would have ended on his last day of work.in january or february,he asked her to investigate the circumstances preventing his enrollment in the glass doctor plan.she assured wright that she would investigate,but never got back to him.
in a letter to hanna steel on march,wright explained that wright was trying to enroll in alabama windshield health insurance plan.she advised hanna steel that her husband was no longer employed by hanna steel.she explained that blue cross had informed wright that he and his family continued to have coverage under the hanna steel plan.wright requested that hanna steel reply after checking its records.hanna steel employees testified that they reviewed hanna steel files and found no correspondence from wright.
wright worked for alabama windshield until october.he then went to work for johnson controls.in november,wright was diagnosed with hodgkin disease.following this diagnosis,and wright met with a social worker at the medical clinic.the wrights explained their insurance coverage concerns to the social worker.the social worker immediately telephoned blue cross.blue cross confirmed that the wrights were covered.between december and june,wright received thousands of dollars worth of medical care for cancer treatment,but blue cross denied her claims for payment to her providers.
wright returned to work for alabama windshield in february.he continued working for that company until august.when wright returned to alabama windshield,he again sought to enroll in its health insurance plan through the glass doctor.wright was unable to enroll in the glass doctor health plan until july.
blue cross records reflect that on may,scott inquired about wright insurance coverage.on june,hanna steel informed blue cross that wright employment had terminated on january.that date was incorrect.wright employment with hanna steel had ended on december.the incorrect entry caused blue cross to terminate wright health insurance coverage retroactive to january,thereby creating a gap in coverage from january,through july,the date of wright enrollment in the glass doctor health plan.the incorrect entry also caused blue cross to consider wright cancer a condition under the glass doctor health plan.as a result,blue cross refused to pay any claims related to her cancer.
the wrights retained counsel in late july.in october,their counsel notified hanna steel that the wrights had unpaid health insurance claims.hanna steel,after discussions with the wrights counsel,changed the cancellation date of the wrights health plan to june,and paid the wright family insurance claims from through june.wright paid no premiums for the health insurance coverage he and his family received during that time period.
wright filed his complaint in this action on july.he alleged procedural violations of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,he requested that the district court award him statutory penalties under erisa and attorney fees.on may,wright filed a motion for summary judgment as to claims one and six because of a procedural violation,the district court struck wright brief and evidentiary material filed in support of his motion.wright refiled the materials along with another copy of his motion on may.hanna steel filed a cross motion for summary judgment on may.
the district court granted wright motion for summary judgment and denied hanna steel cross motion.on august,it assessed civil penalties totaling per day for a period of months and awarded attorney fees to wright.the district court also allowed hanna steel an offset for the value of the insurance premiums it paid on behalf of wright and his family between december,and july.
the district court order set a briefing schedule and directed wright to submit an itemized schedule stating the total sum due.on december,the district court entered judgment in favor of wright in the amount of,consisting of in penalties,in attorney fees,in costs,and an offset of.hanna steel timely appeals from the district court final judgment.
this action arises under erisa.the district court had jurisdiction over the action pursuant to e and.we have jurisdiction over hanna steel appeal from the final judgment pursuant to.
hanna steel contends that the district court erred in imposing separate penalties for wright,his wife,and children.it also asserts that the award of per day to wright is excessive.in response,wright contends that hanna steel forfeited its right to challenge the penalty awards because it failed to raise this issue before the district court.alternatively,wright maintains that the district court did not err in awarding penalties.we review civil penalties imposed under erisa for abuse of discretion.daughtrey honeywell,cir.a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.united states pruitt,cir citation omitted.
we must first decide whether we may review the validity of the grant of separate penalties because hanna steel failed to present this question to the district court.an appellant is not precluded from presenting an issue for review on appeal
