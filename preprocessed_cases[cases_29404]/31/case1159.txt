this is a cautionary tale for erisa administrators.we are met with three claimants to an life insurance policy held by the decedent,scott parker anita pietrofitta,his widow eileen marrero,his and the estate of scott parker,which represents zachary dry,a son born to a third woman five months after parker died.metropolitan life insurance company metlife declared the policy proceeds owing but could not identify the proper beneficiary and filed this action in interpleader in the district of arizona.we narrow the field from three to two and remand to the district court for further findings of fact.
background and proceedings 
the employee retirement income security act erisa,et governs the administration of benefit pension plans.congress passed the act to protect the interests of the participants in these plans and their designated beneficiaries and to provide employers with uniform guidelines and rules regarding the administration of benefit plans.see a c,a c.the two most basic components of any erisa plan are the plan administrator and the plan documents.the plan administrator is a fiduciary charged with the duty to administer the benefit plan in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with erisa.a d.the fiduciary is responsible for paying benefits to the beneficiary,who is a person designated by a participant,or by the terms of an employee benefit plan.
scott parker worked for bank of america and participated in the bank of america group benefits program at the time of his death.through the program,parker obtained an insurance policy from metlife for in basic life insurance benefits and in additional option benefits,for a total life insurance coverage of.bank of america plan was subject to erisa.
parker and eileen marrero married in.in,parker executed a will leaving his entire estate to marrero,provided that she survived him for longer than four months.on october,marrero filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in the superior court of maricopa county in arizona,and parker accepted service of the petition four days later.just two weeks later,on october,parker executed a beneficiary designation and change form to distribute his erisa benefits.under the line to designate the primary beneficiary ies,there were five boxes to be filled in name,relationship to you,relationship code,of benefits to be allocated,and social security number if available.the box labeled relationship code referred to six codes listed at the bottom of the page,ren,and.parker filled in three of the five boxes.on the line for name he wrote as indicated in my will.in the space provided under relationship code he wrote es for estate.he then allocated of his benefits and left the remaining two boxes relationship to you and social security number blank.no will was attached to the beneficiary designation form,which bank of america accepted without objection.
on december,the state of arizona dissolved parker and marrero marriage pursuant to her petition for dissolution.eight years later,in,parker married anita pietrofitta.parker died on july,and as far as the parties can document,failed to revise or alter his will or his beneficiary designation form.
in probate proceedings in arizona,the maricopa county superior court ruled that the testamentary devise under parker will was revoked by operation of arizona divorce revocation statute.stat.the court then found that,there being no will,parker died intestate.the court awarded parker estate to pietrofitta.see.stat.a wrinkle appeared when parker son from a different relationship was born on december,more than five months after parker death.the court amended the order of intestacy and declared zachary dry,the recently born son,an heir of parker and entitled to of parker separate property and all of parker undivided community property share.
although the record is silent on this point,it appears that the erisa plan administrators at bank of america had no clue how to distribute parker insurance proceeds.metlife filed this interpleader action in the district of arizona to determine the proper beneficiary of parker life insurance benefits.it named pietrofitta,marrero,dry and other potential claimants as defendants.the district court dismissed metlife from the action and awarded metlife attorneys fees.
three parties filed summary judgment motions,none of whom disputed the underlying facts of the litigation.the parties disagreed as a matter of law as to whether the plan benefits should be paid to marrero under the testamentary devise in parker will pursuant to his designation that benefits be paid as indicated by his will parker estate as indicated by his designation of es or estate under the relationship code box on the beneficiary designation form or pietrofitta as parker surviving wife in accordance with the default plan documents.
the district court held that,although parker wrote as indicated in my will as the name of the only beneficiary on the beneficiary designation form,that designation is not a person under erisa because it does not designate an individual or one of the statutorily defined beneficiaries in.since parker had written es in the relationship code portion of the beneficiary designation form,however,the district court found that the designation of his estate was consistent with parker designation of as indicated in my will.accordingly,the district court found that parker designated his estate as the beneficiary of the plan benefits.the district court also noted that its finding was consistent with erisa policies because the plan administrator would have to look only at the plan the will or state paying the policy benefits to the designated beneficiary.
both marrero and pietrofitta appeal the decision of the district court.

iii.analysis 
we are asked to determine the proper beneficiary of parker benefit plan.under erisa,a beneficiary is determined in one of two ways it is designated by the participant or by the terms of an employee benefit plan.the facts of this case involve the unfortunate situation where neither the participant,nor the beneficiary designation form clearly designate the beneficiary.our task is further complicated by erisa silence on how erisa plan administrators are to determine the proper designee in situations where they are presented with conflicting or ambiguous designations.while erisa does not specifically address these situations,there are general provisions and directives that guide us in our resolution of the issue.
as in any determination of the award of benefits under any erisa plan,we begin with an examination of the governing plan documents.erisa requires a benefit plan to specify the basis on which payments are made to and from the plan.b.it requires the fiduciary to administer the plan in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,a d,and to make payments to a beneficiary designated by a participant,or by the terms of a plan.a beneficiary is defined as a person designated by a participant,or by the terms of an employee benefit plan,who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.emphasis added.person is subsequently defined as an individual,partnership,joint venture,corporation,mutual company,company,trust,estate,unincorporated organization,association,or employee organization.
beyond erisa general requirement that a fiduciary administer the plan
