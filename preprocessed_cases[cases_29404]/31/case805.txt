plaintiff matthew urbania sued his employee pension benefit plan,defendant central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund hereinafter,central states or the fund,because the plan denied his application for a disability pension.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant and urbania appeals.because the plan administrators properly interpreted the plan operative terms in finding that the plaintiff failed to meet the requisite criteria for establishing an entitlement to a disability pension,and thus did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying the benefit,we affirm.
background 
defendant central states and the disability pension 
central states is an employee pension benefit plan,as defined in a of the employee retirement income security act erisa.see a.central states is a,trust fund that is administered by employer and employee trustees.the fund provides retirement and disability pensions to qualified employees who work in the teamster industry under collective bargaining agreements that require employers to make contributions on behalf of covered employees to central states.the central states trust agreement grants the fund trustees the discretion to establish these benefit plans,as well as discretionary authority to administer such plans and decide benefit claims.
payment of plan benefits is governed by the fund pension plan,for purposes of this appeal,the plan document hereinafter,the plan.to become eligible for disability pension benefits,a fund participant under the age of years must be totally and permanently disabled,see plan section a c have ten years of credited service under the plan,see plan section a be eligible for social security disability benefits,see plan section a and become disabled before sustaining three consecutive breaks in service,see plan section a d of the terms introduced by these four individual requirements,three merit immediate note.
first and foremost is the term total and permanent disability.in order to qualify for a disability pension,the plan requires that the participant sustain a total and permanent disability as hereinafter defined.plan section a.that hereinafter definition is supplied by section c,which provides that 
d isability,as used herein,shall be deemed to be total and permanent,for purposes of this section,whenever the participant is wholly disabled by bodily injury or disease,and will as a result be permanently,continuously and wholly prevented for life from engaging in any occupation and performing any work for wage or profit.
with respect to the second a participant have ten years of credited service under the of the plan defines credited service.under this provision,a participant will earn one year of credited service for each year in which a participant had at least hours of covered employment prior to january.for employment after,a participant will earn one year of credited service for each year in which at least weeks of contributions to the fund were made on the participant behalf.
the requirement that the participant become disabled before sustaining three consecutive breaks in service turns in large part,of course,on what constitutes a break in service.toward that end,plan section c provides on or after january,a participant shall sustain a break in service at the end of any calendar year in which he receives less than vesting service weeks.a vesting service week,per plan section b,is a week in which a contribution is made or is required to be made to the pension fund on a participant behalf.suffice it to say,if a participant stops working covered employment for three straight years,he will be ineligible for the disability pension if he is injured thereafter.
urbania employment history and injuries 
plaintiff matthew urbania took on various jobs in the ohio teamster industry for intermittent periods of time between and.during those periods,he was a fund participant,and his employers made contributions on his behalf to central states accordingly.in,however,urbania was laid off from covered teamster employment halls motor transit and moved to florida.since,central states has not received any contributions on the plaintiff behalf.as it stands today,based on his total time in covered employment,urbania has accrued years of credited service and years of vesting service 
after leaving covered employment in early,urbania took on various jobs between and for employers,none of which participated in central states.he suffered two injuries while working those jobs.the first injury occurred on june,while he was working with page avjet corporation.he tripped and fell in the cockpit of an airplane,hurting his back.the second injury occurred on october,when,in the course of his employment with drywall,he tripped and hurt his back while lifting drywall.on both occasions,the plaintiff filed and settled worker compensation page avjet settlement netting him in december,and the drywall settlement bringing in in june.he was also awarded three periods of disability by the social security first from june to december,the second in november,and the third beginning june.
urbania application for a central states disability pension 
on february,urbania filed an application for a disability pension with central states,claiming under oath that he became totally disabled as a result of a job related injury on june.he further claimed that he had not been able to work since that date.the application listed no employment after june,and suggested that worker compensation disability had sustained him in the interim.in addition,several documents from the social security administration were submitted in support of urbania application.one such document was an award certificate dated july,denoting november as his date of entitlement to social security disability benefits.another was a notice of favorable decision and a decision dated october,finding urbania disabled under the social security act and entitled to a period of disability commencing on june.
however,the october,decision,as well as several documents attached thereto,indicated that urbania was able to,and in fact did,return to work after his june his disability pension application claim to the contrary.the decision noted that after his back injury,urbania eventually returned to work.indeed,along with medical records detailing medical advice rendered to urbania encouraging him to return to work within specified physical limits,documents revealed that urbania had taken on jobs as a janitor for four to five months in,a trucker sometime before august,and a drywall hanger sometime before october.in addition,social security records indicated that the plaintiff received income after his injury from various sources,including lodge of the loyal order of the moose in sanford,florida in marietta,georgia eagle pools in granite falls,washington and,of course,drywall in winter park florida.the record also includes urbania worker compensation notice of injury,which he filed after the october accident to claim on the injury he suffered while working as a drywall hanger with drywall.
central states ultimately denied urbania application for a disability pension,finding that he failed to establish that he was totally and permanently disabled before sustaining three consecutive breaks in service.though urbania claims to have been disabled as of june,the defendant,noting in particular the evidence of urbania odd jobs between and,found the disability was not total and permanent until june.and because,in the eyes of central states,urbania disability was not total and permanent until,he had clearly sustained three consecutive breaks in,and,the three years immediately succeeding his last year of covered employment.though the issue of urbania insufficient years of credited service having only when he needed was also at issue from the outset of his,urbania and his union even went so far as to inquire whether central states might allow him to cure this disqualifying defendant did not list this as a reason for denying plaintiff application in its final decision on review.
after exhausting administrative appeals of the defendant decision,urbania filed this action before the district court.the district court granted summary judgment in the defendant favor,finding that the defendant trustee decision to deny the disability application was not arbitrary and capricious.in particular,the court found that urbania failed to meet the requirement of years credited service having accrued only years and to establish that he was totally and permanently disabled before sustaining three consecutive one year breaks in service because,in spite of his claimed june disability onset date,he had worked other jobs thereafter.urbania appeals.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment on erisa claims de novo.hightshue aig life ins,cir.where,as here,the employer erisa plan grants its administrator with discretion to pay or deny claims,we review the administrator benefit claim decisions under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see also firestone tire rubber bruch,d.accordingly,we will reverse central states denial of urbania disability pension application only if that decision was arbitrary and capricious.
consideration of less than years of credited service 
of the four qualifying requirements for a disability pension,one is that a participant must have years of credited service.the district court found it undisputed that plaintiff had not obtained years of credited only years.urbania,however,raises two arguments with respect to this finding.first,he argues that because he had earned vesting service years under the plan,it must follow that he also earned over years of credited services.this argument is patently frivolous,as the terms of the plan make clear that years of vesting service and credited service are calculated differently.the plan clearly defines credited service years and vested service years,and it defines them quite differently.while it takes only vesting service weeks in a calendar year to earn a vesting service year,see plan sections a b,it takes as of weeks of plan contributions to earn a credited service year,see plan section.each such year is accrued and calculated to provide distinct and separate entitlements under the plan.eleven vested service years does not equal eleven credited service years.nor is the eleven years of the former necessarily greater than ten years of the latter.the plan administrators were neither arbitrary nor capricious in refusing to compare apples to oranges.
though the outcome is ultimately the same,urbania second argument with respect to the credited service years does have more appeal.here he contends that the district court improperly considered the fact that urbania had earned less than years of credited service in evaluating whether the defendant denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious,because central states did not cite insufficient credited service as a justification for denying the pension in its final claim denial letter.requires every employee benefit plan under erisa to provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial.indeed,in reich ladish,we noted a plan administrator is required to give a plan participant every reason for its denial of benefits at the time of the denial and that i t may not add new reasons as the litigation proceeds,cir citations omitted.to the extent that central states failed in its final decision to mention the credited years deficiency,urbania argues that the defendant can not rely on such a reason now.
however,as we held in perlman swiss bank.comprehensive disability protection plan,cir,d eferential review of an administrative decision means review on the administrative record.looking to the administrative record as a whole,it is abundantly clear here that the plaintiff was clearly on notice of his credited years deficiency and its effect in disqualifying him from a disability pension.indeed,it would be disingenuous for urbania to claim here that he was not so apprised.in a letter dated february,soon after his application for the pension was first filed,the defendant rejected urbania claim because,among other reasons,you do not have years of service credit.you have years of contributory service credit.that this message was received by urbania loud and clear is evidenced by the level i appeal that teamsters local union filed on his behalf on july.the appeal states,urbania has years of contributory credit through we feel that he should be allowed to make the necessary payments to get the full years of contributory credit to qualify for the disability award.urbania was given further notice of this disqualifying ground in an october,letter from central states,which,in advising him that his appeal to the benefit claims review committee had been denied,stated,it is the decision of the committee that you are not eligible for a disability pension benefit because you have not established at least years of credited service.the benefit claims review committee again noted the credited service requirement of plan section a in a letter to urbania dated february.and finally,the minutes of urbania level iii appeal before the trustees,which repeatedly note that urbania had established only years of credited service,shows that the insufficient credited service years issue was clearly before that reviewing body.
as urbania rightly points out,central states final claim denial letter issued on july,after the trustees review makes no mention of insufficient service credit as a ground for denying the disability pension.rather,the letter rests on the fact that the onset of urbania disability did not occur until three consecutive breaks in service had passed.this omission,however,is readily explainable.having been notified initially that he was just short of the required threshold,urbania and his union made repeated requests that he be allowed to make additional contributions to the fund so as to qualify himself.central states,however,subsequently found an alternative and independently sufficient reason for denying benefits that would render further payments by urbania,the three consecutive breaks in service.rather than tantalize urbania with a putatively curable disqualification,the defendant in its final decision letter provided the incurable disqualification alone.thus,central states,which has consistently maintained insufficient credited service as a justification for denial,did not abandon the ground by omission.it simply put the argument of cure to rest by advancing a separate,incurable ground.while it would have been cleaner had the defendant referenced this ground as well in its final decision,the administrative record makes clear that urbania was on notice of the deficiency.the district court did not err in noticing the disqualification too.
section a does not define total and permanent disability 
urbania next argues that the plan administrators acted arbitrarily and capriciously by not interpreting the plan such that a person eligible for social security benefits would be automatically entitled to benefits under the plan.if that was the proper interpretation,urbania would have been considered disabled as of june,when he was first entitled to social security benefits.
however,urbania interpretation is rendered unreasonable by the plain language of the plan.as discussed above,there are four requirements to qualify for the disability pension,and eligibility for social security benefits is only one of them.see plan section a d supra,and accompanying text.first and foremost among the pension prerequisites is that a participant sustain a total and permanent disability.plan section a.and while section a requires that a totally and permanently disabled participant be eligible for social security,it does not suggest that eligibility for social security renders a participant totally and permanently disabled.rather,section c defines total and permanent disability,and its definition is far more expansive than social security eligibility alone thus,a participant must be both eligible for social security as provided by section a and totally disabled as defined in section c
