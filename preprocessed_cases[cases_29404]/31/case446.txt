upon notification from california officials that its vacation pay practices violated state labor law,denny,brought this action in federal court in south carolina.denny asked the court to declare that the employee retirement income security act erisa preempted these claims,and enjoin the california labor commissioner from applying the state law against denny.shortly thereafter,the commissioner sued denny in state court in california seeking to enforce the state law.several months later,the district court dismissed this action,finding it lacked personal jurisdiction over the commissioner.we believe that the court did have jurisdiction,but conclude that the act bars all of the relief that denny seeks.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for entry of an order dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
denny,a restaurant chain with its principal place of business in south carolina,maintains the denny.vacation plan the plan and the denny.employee benefits trust the trust for the stated purpose of providing vacation benefits to eligible employees.the plan provides that salaried and hourly employees can not use vacation benefit days and will not be paid any vacation benefits upon termination of their employment until and unless they have completed,respectively,six months or one year of continuous employment with denny.
on july,denny received a letter from an attorney at the california department of industrial relations.the purpose of the letter was to come to a global resolution of issues raised by claims of former denny employees filed with the california labor commissioner.the attorney explained that denny policy requiring forfeiture of vacation benefits when employees leave prior to six months or one year of employment violated cal.that statute provides that when an employee is terminated without having taken off his vested vacation time,all vested vacation shall be paid to him as wages and,further,that an employment contract or employer policy shall not provide for forfeiture of vested vacation time upon termination.
the california attorney noted that the department had concluded that denny method of funding its vacation pay plan constituted a payroll practice and the plan is not therefore an erisa plan which preempts state enforcement laws.the attorney recounted prior discussions and litigation between the parties on this issue,including a state court refusal to grant summary judgment to denny on its defense.given the numerous claims filed with the department,the attorney proposed that denny meet with the commissioner and discuss an amicable resolution to avoid the time and expense of litigation.otherwise,the department would have to file an action against denny to finally resolve this issue.
in response,on september,denny filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief in federal court in south carolina against the commissioner and the director of the department of industrial relations collectively,commissioner.denny sought a declaration that the plan and trust constitute an erisa plan a declaration that erisa preempts the california statutes,regulations,and any action or decision of the commissioner having the effect of law that the commissioner seek s to enforce against denny based upon california law and p reliminary and permanent injunctions barring the commissioner from taking any action to enforce california law against denny with regard to the plan and the trust.
three weeks later,the commissioner filed a complaint against denny in california state court,for damages and injunctive relief.the commissioner asked the state court to award it unpaid vacation wages and waiting time penalties pursuant to cal,and to order denny to cease and desist from violating all provisions of the state labor code.in its answer to the commissioner state court lawsuit,denny alleged erisa preemption as an affirmative defense.
the commissioner then moved to dismiss the present action,contending that a federal district court in south carolina lacked personal jurisdiction over the california officials,notwithstanding erisa nationwide service of process provision,e.alternatively,the commissioner contended that the act,and abstention based on younger harris,d,compelled dismissal.on february,the district court granted the commissioner motion,concluding that it had no personal jurisdiction over the commissioner.denny,cake,d.
we turn first to the question of whether the district court could exercise personal jurisdiction over the commissioner under e.in the case at hand the answer to that question hinges on the court subject matter jurisdiction under a.
erisa contains a nationwide service of process provision that permits an erisa enforcement action to be brought in federal court in a district where the plan is administered and process to be served in any other district where a defendant resides or may be found.e.accordingly,since the plan is administered in spartanburg,south carolina,and the commissioner has been served in california,a district court sitting in south carolina would have personal jurisdiction over the commissioner under e if this is a proper erisa enforcement is,if the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the action under a section a provides that a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary may bring an erisa enforcement action in federal court 
a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
a emphasis added.
section a b thus permits an erisa fiduciary to bring an action to enforce any provisions of this subchapter.id.indisputably,this subchapter refers to subchapter i of chapter of the united states code,which codified title i of erisa and includes.t his subchapter thus clearly contains erisa preemption provision.the plain language of a b therefore appears to permit an erisa fiduciary to bring an action to enforce provision of this subchapter.
indeed,the supreme court has expressly stated that u nder a b of erisa a b,a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary of a plan covered by erisa may bring a declaratory judgment action in federal court to determine whether the plan trustees may comply with a state law.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d.the court ultimately rejected the view that a state action brought by the california franchise tax board against an erisa fiduciary for a declaration that the fiduciary must comply with state law arose under erisa and so could be removed to federal only because the tax board itself was not an erisa participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary,as required by a.id.at.the court assumed that the erisa fiduciary could have sought an injunction under erisa against application to it of state regulations that require acts inconsistent with erisa,but held that the declaratory action by the state,not an erisa participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary,did not arise under federal law and so could not be removed to federal court.id.at.
in short,both the plain language of a and the supreme court interpretation of it seem to compel the conclusion that an erisa fiduciary,like denny could bring the instant action to enforce by way of an injunction against application of state regulations that require acts inconsistent with erisa.franchise tax,at.
yet,the district court held that denny declaratory and injunctive action based on erisa preemption provision,did not constitute an action to enforce erisa within the meaning of a b.denny,d at.the court apparently concluded that because denny preemption defense in the california case would not suffice to provide federal removal jurisdiction over it,the instant action,based on,could not be brought under a.id.at.but,as explained above,neither franchise tax board nor the plain language of a provide any basis for treating the present action precisely like one in which a fiduciary seeks removal asserting preemption.
we acknowledge that this result may at first seem odd because,just as the present action depends on whether the plaintiff claim falls within a,so too complete preemption,which provides a basis for federal removal jurisdiction,depends in the erisa context upon whether the underlying state law claim falls within a.see,sonoco prods.physicians health plan,cir.but a court determines complete preemption by determining the plaintiff capacity to bring its state law claims under a,not the defendant.id.at.thus,the fact that a state court defendant assertion of preemption as a defense does not create complete preemption says nothing about whether that defendant could have brought an action to enforce preemption as a plaintiff in federal court under a.in the present case,for instance,the commissioner could not bring his claims in federal court under a because,like the tax board in franchise tax board,he is not an erisa participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary as a result,his state court suit is not completely preempted by denny assertion of a preemption defense under.id.at.but denny,as a fiduciary,does not face the same barrier to bringing the instant a action in federal court.
the district court based its contrary decision almost exclusively on ngs american,jefferson,cir.there the sixth circuit held that an erisa fiduciary federal a declaration that erisa preempted a beneficiary threat to initiate private state court litigation against the fiduciary based on an alleged violation of state not be brought under a see also gulf life ins.arnold,cir holding that a fiduciary declaratory judgment action seeking to determine its liability for benefits claimed by a former employee could not be brought under a but jefferson involved a fiduciary suing for a declaration that erisa preempted the threat of a private suit by a beneficiary,while the case at hand involves a very different situation a fiduciary suing for a declaration that erisa preempts state authorities from enforcing state law against an erisa plan.the district court recognized that the facts of jefferson are easily distinguishable from the facts at hand,but nevertheless concluded that this distinction does not affect the application of the jefferson court reasoning.denny,d at.
the jefferson court itself,however,found this difference extremely significant,taking pains to distinguish the case before it,in which the plaintiff challenged the permissibility of a private cause of action,from earlier sixth circuit precedent,thiokol dep t of treasury,cir,in which the plaintiff challenged the enforceability of an existing state regulation.jefferson,at.in thiokol,as here,an erisa fiduciary sought declaratory and injunctive relief in federal court on the basis of preemption.at.the thiokol fiduciary,like denny in this case,sought to prevent state authorities from enforcing state law provisions against an asserted erisa plan.id.at.the thiokol court unequivocally held that,in these circumstances,the fiduciary could bring a preemption claim in federal court under a.id.at 
in determining whether a case falls within a,we agree with the sixth circuit an action based on erisa preemption brought by a fiduciary to enjoin a private suit critically differs from such an action brought by a fiduciary to prevent the enforcement of a state law against an erisa plan.a party private suit,based on an arguably preempted state law,brought against an erisa plan,poses no threat to violate or any other provision of erisa or the plan.see jefferson,at.the only harm in denying injunctive and declaratory relief to the plan fiduciary in such a case is to force the fiduciary to raise its preemption claim in state court,or to seek removal to federal district court.id.at.but a state suit to enforce a state law against an erisa plan may well violate erisa and the plan.in such a case,the plan fiduciary faces a hobson choice obey the state law,and risk violating the provisions of the plan and hence erisa,a d,or disobey the state law and then raise erisa preemption as a defense in a state enforcement action and risk breaking the law.id.in addition to potentially coercing a plan fiduciary into violating plan provisions and erisa,a state enforcement of an assertedly preempted state law against an erisa plan unlike a private suit based on state law is arguably itself a violation of provides that erisa shall supercede any and all state laws.see,hmi mech,mcgowan,cir noting that a state approach to enforcing a law violated erisa preemption standards.
in sum,denny declaratory and injunctive action to enforce falls within a,and so the district court did have personal jurisdiction over the commissioner under e.therefore,we must vacate its judgment dismissing this action for lack of personal jurisdiction.
because the district court found it lacked personal jurisdiction over the commissioner,it did not address the commissioner alternative act hereinafter the act argument.the commissioner reiterates on appeal that the act bars a federal court from granting the relief requested by denny and so requires dismissal of the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.b.the act provides 
a court of the united states may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.
the act serves as a necessary concomitant of the framers decision to authorize,and congress decision to implement,a dual system of federal and state courts and represents congress considered judgment as to how to balance the tensions inherent in such a system.chick kam choo exxon,d.accordingly,w e take seriously the mandate in the act and recognize that for over two hundred years,the act has helped to define our nation system of federalism.employers res.mgmt,shannon,cir.
the act constitutes an absolute prohibition against any injunction of any proceedings,unless the injunction falls within one of the three specifically defined exceptions in the act.vendo,d plurality opinion.these three exceptions are injunctions expressly authorized by statute necessary to aid the court jurisdiction or required to protect or effectuate the court judgments.chick kam choo,at.atl.coast line of locomotive eng rs,d.none of these exceptions apply here 
notwithstanding the inapplicability of the only exceptions to the act recognized by congress,denny contends that the act does not bar its suit because of a judicial exception created by one of our sister circuits and followed by two others.specifically,denny contends that the act prohibition on enjoining proceedings in state court does not apply because when it filed this action requesting injunctive relief in early september,there were no pending state proceedings,within the meaning of the act or otherwise.reply brief at.
the seventh circuit so held in barancik investors funding,cir see also hyde park partners,connolly,cir dicta city lines,llc,cir.other circuits,however,have rejected this judicial exception.royal ins.of am.capital,cir holding that the act does apply even if the request for federal injunctive relief is filed first roth bank of the,cir,cert.dismissed,d same see also standard microsystems texas instruments,cir criticizing the reasoning in barancik and stating that the court had considerable doubt about whether the barancik rule should be adopted in this circuit city lines,at arnold,dissenting explaining that the mere filing of a motion in a federal court seeking to enjoin proceedings should not in and of itself deprive later filed action of the protection of.
as always,we turn first to the plain language of the statute to determine its meaning.see williams taylor,d.the plain language of the act clearly and unequivocally prohibits a federal court from granting an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court.of course,in order for the act bar to apply,proceedings in state court must have begun.see dombrowski pfister,d the act does not preclude injunctions against the institution of state court proceedings,but only bar s stays of suits already instituted.but nothing in the act confines its bar to situations in which the federal plaintiff requests injunctive relief after the state suit has been filed.see royal ins,at.
courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain,d.a court may not disregard the plain language of a statute unless a literal application of the statutory language would lead to absurd results or would thwart the obvious purpose of the statute.in re trans alaska pipeline rate cases,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.here literal application of the act language would neither thwart its purpose nor produce an absurd result.quite the contrary,abiding by the statutory language clearly furthers the act purpose of avoiding unseemly conflict between the state and the federal courts,d.
moreover,the supreme court has directed that the act,in particular,is not a statute conveying a broad general policy for appropriate ad hoc application but rather is expressed in a prohibition qualified only by specifically defined exceptions.amalgamated clothing workers richman.courts are not to enlarge these exceptions by loose statutory construction.atl.coast line,at.instead,a ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed to finally determine the controversy.id.at.
the barancik court acknowledged the supreme court directive that the act imposes an absolute ban,circumscribing the federal court power to act unless a case falls within one of the explicit exceptions from its command.barancik,at.it also recognized that t he mere fact that the federal complaint was filed before the state proceeding was commenced is not sufficient to avoid the statutory bar.id.at citing kline burke construction.but see city lines,at stating that the act is inapplicable when a federal court has first obtained of a matter in controversy by the institution of suit.nevertheless,the barancik court concluded that the mandatory prohibition in against injunctions staying state court proceedings does not apply to state actions commenced after a motion for injunctive relief is filed in the federal court.barancik,at.
the barancik court advanced several policy concerns in support of its holding.for example,it worried that u nless the applicability of the statutory bar is determined by the state of the record at the time the motion for an injunction is made,a litigant would have an absolute right to defeat a motion by taking the very step the federal court was being urged to enjoin.id.at.but a federal court can eliminate this problem by issuing a temporary restraining order against the filing of a state court suit while considering a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking such relief.see royal,at see also dombrowski,at.noting that the act does not prevent a federal court from restraining a party from instituting state proceedings.the barancik court feared that such reliance on temporary restraining orders might encourage the liberal granting of the kind of protective orders the statute was intended to prevent.barancik,at.however,the basic harm the statute was intended to prevent was not the liberal granting of protective orders,per se,but the needless friction between state and federal courts.mitchum foster,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.temporarily staying a potential state suit before it is filed so that an injunction can be considered would seemingly create significantly less friction than allowing a state suit to be commenced,only to enjoin it after it is filed.
the barancik court also suggested that its ruling had the salutary advantage of discouraging the unseemly race to the state courthouse while the federal court had under consideration a motion for a status quo order.barancik,at.but by hinging the applicability of on whether the state or federal suit is commenced first,the barancik rule creates a race to the courthouse of its own.see roth,at noting that the barancik rule merely moves the finish line.even worse,following barancik would permit a federal court plaintiff who wins this race,to unilaterally nullify the effectiveness of the act with the mere application for injunctive relief.standard microsystems,at see also diane wood,judicial federalism a proposal for reform of the act,arguing that the barancik court result does not seem in line with the statute because the act would become too easy to evade in many cases if the timing of the request for the injunction became the dispositive factor.
although we recognize the legitimacy of the concerns raised by the seventh circuit in barancik,the exception it created to meet these concerns poses its own problems.moreover,even if application of the barancik holding would result in better policy in the eyes of some,this is not the course congress has chosen in the act views as to good policy can not overcome a clear statutory directive.see,sigmon coal,apfel,cir noting that our job is to determine the meaning of the statute passed by congress,not whether wisdom or logic suggests that congress could have done better.therefore,we hold that the act prohibition on enjoining state court proceedings applies to any such proceeding pending at the time the federal court acts on the request for injunctive relief,regardless of when the state court action was filed.since the california proceeding was clearly pending at the time the district court acted on denny request for injunctive relief,the act bars the relief denny requested.
because the act rendered the district court powerless to issue any of the relief denny requested,see supra,its complaint should have been dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.b.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court dismissing for lack of personal jurisdiction and remand with instructions to enter an order dismissing the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is vacated and remanded.
at the outset,i concur completely in the majority jurisdictional analysis.having concluded that the district court had personal jurisdiction over the california state officials,this case requires our court to weigh in on two separate issues related to the act that have divided the courts of appeals.i concur in the opinion of the court that the plain language of the act bars an injunction in this case,unless one of its exceptions applies.in addition,because i believe that the judgment of the court is compelled by our prior decision in employers resource management shannon,cir,i concur in the judgment that erisa does not authorize an injunction of state court proceedings in this case.i write separately to highlight some of my concerns with these latter two issues.
first,i address the application of the act aia to state proceedings filed after federal proceedings are filed.the plain language of the act prohibits injunctions to stay proceedings in a state court.west.nothing in this language limits the prohibition to state actions filed before the federal action is filed.moreover,interpreting a predecessor statute to the aia,the supreme court held in kline burke construction,that the predecessor statute barred the federal court from enjoining a state court action that was filed after the commencement of the federal court action.as my colleagues note,ante at,we may not disregard the plain language of a statute unless a literal application would lead to absurd results or would thwart the statute obvious purpose.although i agree with many of the concerns expressed by stevens in barancik investors funding,cir,especially the fear that our holding will pressure federal courts to grant temporary restraining orders,see id.at,i do not believe that applying the aia to state court proceedings leads to absurd results or thwarts the obvious purpose of the aia.accordingly,i agree with my colleagues that we are bound by the plain language of the statute and that the plain language of the aia bars an injunction in this case,unless one of its exceptions applies.
second,application of the aia expressly authorized by act of congress exception to this case also present
