the trustees of the united mine workers of america pension plan appeal the district court summary reversal of their decision to deny disability pension benefits to ivory mccoy.finding that the decision of the trustees was supported by substantial evidence,we reverse the district court and remand with instructions that summary judgment be entered in favor of the trustees.
ivory mccoy worked as a roof bolter for the pittston coal company in april,mccoy was hit in the head by a falling rock while working and was treated in the emergency room for a sprained neck.he was advised to miss three days of work,and a appointment was scheduled.in may,his attending physician completed a report for the workers compensation commission in which mccoy diagnosis was listed as cervical muscle spasms.the record contains no evidence that mccoy sought any further medical treatment relating to pain in his neck or his back until may.mccoy continued working in the mines until he was laid off in.after being laid off,mccoy worked as a carpenter until august,when,he claims,pain and psychological problems forced him to quit.
starting in may,nearly two years after the mine incident,mccoy began seeking and receiving treatment from a variety of physical and mental health professionals.mccoy first sought treatment from james gardener for neck stiffness,soreness,and right shoulder discomfort.at.gardener diagnosed mccoy with scapulothoracic syndrome he prescribed anaprox ds,an drug,and advised mccoy to apply moist heat and massage to the problem areas.mccoy visited gardener again in january,at which time he complained of headaches and increased pain in his neck and shoulder.gardener gave mccoy a injection of and pain medications.he also recommended that mccoy continue taking anaprox ds and continue applying heat and moisture to his neck and shoulder.
in early,russell mcknight evaluated mccoy psychological condition.mcknight reported in february that mccoy suffered from anxiety depressive syndrome with insomnia secondary to chronic pain and major affective disorder,depression of moderate severity with psychomotor retardation.at.
mccoy next visited calvin johnson of watauga orthopaedics.johnson found that mccoy of the cervical spine reveal ed some degenerative cervical dis c and mild degenerative change at the lumbar spine.at.he determined that mccoy suffered from chronic cervical strain and chronic low back syndrome.
mccoy later visited william brezinski,a licensed psychologist,for an evaluation.brezinski diagnosed mccoy with moderate to moderately severe dysthymic disorder moderate to moderately severe generalized anxiety disorder,and obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
in late,harry kennedy performed an mri of mccoy neck and lumbar region.kennedy noted degenerative changes in mccoy neck.he also found bulging and protruding discs impinging on a neural foramen and displacing a nerve in mccoy lumbar region.
in february,mccoy was referred to loepoldo bendigo by the social security administration for an evaluation in connection with his application for social security disability insurance ssdi benefits.bendigo diagnosed mccoy as suffering from degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine and severe degenerative disease of the lumbar spine.
mccoy continued to visit gardener and mcknight for the next several years,reporting pain in his neck and lower back as well as affective problems.mccoy was treated with a variety of,antidepressant,and pain medications.mccoy also consulted an orthopedic surgeon,schroering,but mccoy failed to introduce the results of schroering evaluations into evidence.
in august,mccoy was examined by alain desy.at.desy diagnosed mccoy with chronic cervical pain as the result of injury over and degenerative changes,chronic low back pain due an aggravation of a condition,and mild reactional depressive state due to the other diagnos e at.desy stated that it wa s believed that all the diagnoses we re in relation to the work injury of.at.
mccoy initially applied for disability pension benefits in.the trustees denied mccoy application because he had not yet been awarded ssdi benefits.in february,an administrative law judge alj determined that mccoy was entitled to ssdi benefits as of august.the alj found that mccoy was disabled primarily because of severe major affective disorder with a secondary diagnosis of degenerative disc disease of the cervical and lumbar spine.at.the alj noted that mccoy was able to perform medium exertion but concluded that his affective disorder prevented him from performing substantial gainful activity.
after mccoy was awarded ssdi benefits,the trustees reconsidered mccoy application.the trustees again denied the application,this time because they determined that the medical evidence did not establish a causal link between the mine accident and mccoy disabling conditions.
mccoy then filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of virginia alleging that the trustees abused their discretion when they denied his disability pension application.both parties moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted mccoy motion and held that the trustees had abused their discretion.accordingly,the district court ordered the trustees to award mccoy a disability pension.the trustees timely appealed.
when an erisa disability pension plan commits eligibility determinations to the discretion of the plan administrator or fiduciary,we review those determinations for abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.it is that the abuse of discretion standard under firestone is applicable to our review of the trustees decisions under the umwa pension plans.hale trustees of united mine workers health ret.funds,cir.under this standard,we will not disturb such a decision if it is reasonable.booth stores.health and welfare plan,cir.
although we may consider many factors in determining the reasonableness of a fiduciary discretionary decision,see booth,at brogan holland,cir lockhart united mine workers of am pension trust,cir,the only factor at issue here is the degree to which the considered materials support the trustees decision.see booth,at listing the adequacy of the materials considered to make the decision as a factor.in other words,given the context of this case,the trustees decision is reasonable if it is supported by substantial evidence.see bernstein capitalcare,cir.
a claimant must make three showings to be eligible for a disability pension under the umwa pension plan.see boyd tr.of united mine workers health retirement funds,cir.first,the claimant must establish that he was involved in a mine accident.id.second,he must show that he has been awarded ssdi benefits,thus conclusively establishing that he has a disability qualifying disability.roberston connors,cir.finally,he must prove that the mine accident proximately caused,or was substantially responsible for,the qualifying disability.boyd,at.
the trustees use a set of inquiries,called q as,to help them interpret the terms of the pension plan.see brogan,at.the trustees promulgate these q as pursuant to their authority under the plan to issue rules and regulations implementing the plan.see lockhart united mine workers of am.pension trust,cir.we afford the trustees interpretation of these rules the same deference that we give the trustees interpretation of the language of the plan itself.brogan,at.according to q a,miners who become disabled by progressive diseases or conditions such as black lung,silicosis,tuberculosis,arthritis,rheumatism,can not be considered disabled as the result of a mine accident.at.when a progressive disease combines with a mine accident to proximately cause a claimant qualifying disability,however,the claimant is eligible for a disability pension.see richards united mine workers of am.health ret.fund,cir explaining that q a k requires benefits when a mine worker suffers a heart attack while pushing a heavy object in the normal course of his job chicarelli united mine workers of am.health ret.funds,cir same.
