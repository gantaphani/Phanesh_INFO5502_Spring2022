the health benefits plan established by petitioner us airways paid in medical expenses for injuries suffered by respondent mccutchen,a us airways employee,in a car accident caused by a third party.the plan entitled us airways to reimbursement if mccutchen later recovered money from the third party.mccutchen attorneys secured in payments,and mccutchen received after deducting the lawyers contingency fee.us airways demanded reimbursement of the full it had paid.when mccutchen did not comply,us airways filed suit under a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,which authorizes administrators to bring a civil action to obtain appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan.mccutchen raised two defenses to us airways request for an equitable lien on the it demanded that,absent on his part,us airways right to reimbursement did not kick in and that us airways had to contribute its fair share to the costs he incurred to get his recovery,so any reimbursement had to be reduced by,to cover the contingency fee.rejecting both arguments,the district court granted summary judgment to us airways.the third circuit vacated.reasoning that traditional equitable doctrines and defenses applied to a suits,it held that the principle of unjust enrichment overrode us airways reimbursement clause because the clause would leave mccutchen with less than full payment for his medical bills and would give us airways a windfall.
in a a action based on an equitable lien by agreement like this one the erisa plan terms govern.neither general unjust enrichment principles nor specific doctrines reflecting those principles such as the or rules invoked by mccutchen can override the applicable contract.
a section a authorizes the kinds of relief typically available in equity before the merger of law and equity.mertens hewitt associates.in sereboff mid atlantic medical services,the court permitted a administrator to bring a suit just like this one.the administrator claim to enforce its reimbursement clause,the court explained,was the equivalent of an action in equity to enforce a lien called an equitable lien by agreement.at.accordingly,the administrator could use a to obtain funds that its beneficiaries had promised to turn over.the parties agree that us airways can do the same here.
b sereboff logic dooms mccutchen argument that two equitable doctrines meant to prevent unjust enrichment the rule and doctrine can override the terms of an erisa plan in such a suit.as in sereboff,us airways is seeking to enforce the equivalent of an equitable lien by agreement.such a lien both arises from and serves to carry out a contract provisions.see,at.thus,enforcing the lien means holding the parties to their mutual promises and declining to apply rules even if they would be equitable absent a contract at odds with the parties expressed commitments.the court has found nothing to the contrary in the historic practice of equity courts.mccutchen identifies a slew of cases in which courts applied the equitable doctrines invoked here,but none in which they did so to override a clear contract that provided otherwise.this result comports with erisa focus on what a plan provides a does not authorize appropriate equitable relief at large,mertens,at,but countenances only such relief as will enforce the terms of the plan or the statute.
while mccutchen equitable rules can not trump a reimbursement provision,they may aid in properly construing it.us airways plan is silent on the allocation of attorney fees,and the doctrine provides the appropriate default rule to fill that gap.
a ordinary contract interpretation principles support this conclusion.courts construe erisa plans,as they do other contracts,by looking to the terms of the plan as well as to other manifestations of the parties intent.firestone tire rubber bruch.where the terms of a plan leave gaps,courts must look outside the plan written language to decide the agreement meaning,cigna amara,and they properly take account of the doctrines that typically or traditionally have governed a given situation when no agreement states otherwise.
b us airways reimbursement provision precludes looking to the rule in this manner because it provides an allocation formula that expressly contradicts the equitable rule.by contrast,the plan says nothing specific about how to pay for the costs of recovery.given that contractual gap,the doctrine provides the best indication of the parties intent.this court cases make clear that the doctrine would govern here in the absence of a contrary agreement.see,boeing van gemert.because a party would not typically expect or intend a plan saying nothing about attorney fees to abrogate so strong and uniform a background rule,a court should be loath to read the plan in that way.the rule rationale reinforces this conclusion without the rule,the insurer can free ride on the beneficiary efforts,and the beneficiary,as in this case,may be made worse off for having pursued a third party.a contract should not be read to produce these strange results unless it specifically provides as much.

us airways,in its capacity as fiduciary and plan administrator of the us airways.employee benefits plan,petitioner james mccutchen et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
respondent james mccutchen participated in a health benefits plan that his employer,petitioner us airways,established under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.that plan obliged us airways to pay any medical expenses mccutchen incurred as a result of a third party actions for example,another person negligent driving.the plan in turn entitled us airways to reimbursement if mccutchen later recovered money from the third party.
this court has held that a administrator like us airways may enforce such a reimbursement provision by filing suit under a of erisa,stat,a.see sereboff mid atlantic medical services.that section authorizes a civil action to obtain appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan.we here consider whether in that kind of suit,a plan participant like mccutchen may raise certain equitable defenses deriving from principles of unjust enrichment.in particular,we address one equitable doctrine limiting reimbursement to the amount of an insured double recovery and another requiring the party seeking reimbursement to pay a share of the attorney fees incurred in securing funds from the third party.we hold that neither of those equitable rules can override the clear terms of a plan.but we explain that the latter,usually called the doctrine,plays a role in interpreting us airways plan because the plan is silent about allocating the costs of recovery.
in january,mccutchen suffered serious injuries when another driver lost control of her car and collided with mccutchen.at the time,mccutchen was an employee of us airways and a participant in its health plan.the plan paid in medical expenses arising from the accident on mccutchen behalf.
mccutchen retained attorneys,in exchange for a contingency fee,to seek recovery of all his damages,estimated to exceed million.the attorneys sued the driver responsible for the crash,but settled for only because she had limited insurance coverage and the accident had killed or seriously injured three other people.counsel also secured a payment from mccutchen own automobile insurer of,the maximum amount available under his policy.mccutchen thus received and after deducting for the lawyer fee.
on learning of mccutchen recovery,us airways demanded reimbursement of the it had paid in medical expenses.in support of that claim,us airways relied on the following statement in its summary plan description 
if us airways pays benefits for any claim you incur as the result of negligence,willful misconduct,or other actions of a third party,y ou will be required to reimburse us airways for amounts paid for claims out of any monies recovered from the third party,including,but not limited to,your own insurance company as the result of judgment,settlement,or otherwise.app.
mccutchen denied that us airways was entitled to any reimbursement,but his attorneys placed in an escrow account pending resolution of the dispute.that amount represented us airways full claim minus a proportionate share of the promised attorney fees.
us airways then filed this action under a,seeking appropriate equitable relief to enforce the plan reimbursement provision.the suit requested an equitable lien on the in the escrow account and more in mccutchen possession.mccutchen countered by raising two defenses relevant here.first,he maintained that us airways could not receive the relief it sought because he had recovered only a small portion of his total damages absent on his part,us airways right to reimbursement did not kick in.second,he contended that us airways at least had to contribute its fair share to the costs he incurred to get his recovery any reimbursement therefore had to be marked down by,to cover the promised contingency fee.the district court rejected both arguments,granting summary judgment to us airways on the ground that the plan clear ly and unambiguous ly provided for full reimbursement of the medical expenses paid.app.to pet.for cert.see,at.
the court of appeals for the third circuit vacated the district court order.the third circuit reasoned that in a suit for appropriate equitable relief under a,a court must apply any equitable doctrines and defenses that traditionally limited the relief requested.and here,the court continued,the principle of unjust enrichment should serve to limit the effectiveness of the plan reimbursement provision.see,at quoting palmer,law of restitution.full reimbursement,the third circuit thought,would leav e mccutchen with less than full payment for his medical bills at the same time,it would provide a windfall to us airways given its failure to contribute to the cost of obtaining the recovery.at.the third circuit then instructed the district court to determine what amount,shy of the entire,would qualify as appropriate equitable relief.ibid.
we granted certiorari,to resolve a circuit split on whether equitable defenses can so override an erisa plan reimbursement provision we now vacate the third circuit decision.
a administrator like us airways may bring suit under a for appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan.that provision,we have held,authorizes the kinds of relief typically available in equity in the days of the divided bench,before law and equity merged.mertens hewitt associates,emphasis deleted.
in sereboff mid atlantic medical services,we allowed a administrator to bring a suit just like this one under a.mid atlantic had paid medical expenses for the sereboffs after they were injured in a car crash.when they settled a tort suit against the other driver,mid atlantic claimed a share of the proceeds,invoking the plan reimbursement clause.we held that mid atlantic action sought equitable relief,as a requires.see,at.the nature of the recovery requested was equitable because mid atlantic claimed specifically identifiable funds within the sereboffs control that is,a portion of the settlement they had gotten,at internal quotation marks omitted.and the basis for the claim was equitable too,because mid atlantic relied on the familiar rul e of equity that a contract to convey a specific object not yet acquired create s a lien on that object as soon as the contractor gets a title to the thing.at quoting barnes alexander.mid atlantic claim for reimbursement,we determined,was the equivalent of an action in equity to enforce such a lien called an equitable lien by agreement.at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,mid atlantic could bring an action under a seeking the funds that its beneficiaries had promised to turn over.and here,as all parties agree,us airways can do the same thing.
the question in this case concerns the role that equitable defenses alleging unjust enrichment can play in such a suit.as earlier noted,the third circuit held that the principle of unjust enrichment overrides us airways reimbursement clause if and when they come into conflict,at.mccutchen offers a more refined version of that view,alleging that two specific equitable doctrines meant to prevent unjust enrichment defeat the reimbursement provision.brief for respondents first,he contends that in equity,an insurer in us airways position could recoup no more than an insured double recovery the amount the insured has received from a third party to compensate for the same loss the insurance covered.that rule would limit us airways reimbursement to the share of mccutchen settlements paying for medical expenses mccutchen would keep the rest,damages for loss of future earnings or pain and suffering,even though the plan gives us airways first claim on the whole recovery.second,mccutchen claims that in equity the doctrine would have operated to reduce any award to us airways.under that rule,a litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney fee from the fund as a whole.boeing van gemert.mccutchen urges that this doctrine,which is designed to prevent freeloading,enables him to pass on a share of his lawyer fees to us airways,no matter what the plan provides 
we rejected a similar claim in sereboff,though without altogether foreclosing mccutchen position.the sereboffs argued,among other things,that the lower courts erred in enforcing mid atlantic reimbursement clause without imposing various limitations that would apply to truly equitable relief grounded in principles of subrogation.at internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,the sereboffs contended that a variant of the rule,called the doctrine,trumped the plan terms.we rebuffed that argument,explaining that the sereboffs were improperly mixing and matching rules from different equitable boxes.the sereboffs asserted a parcel of equitable defenses available when an insurer brought a freestanding action for equitable subrogation,not founded on a contract,to succeed to an insured judgment against a third party.ibid.but mid atlantic reimbursement claim was considered equitable,we replied,because it sought to enforce a lien based on agreement not a lien imposed independent of contract by virtue of equitable subrogation ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.in light of that fact,we viewed the sereboffs equitable defenses which again,closely resemble mccutchen as beside the point.ibid.and yet,we left a narrow opening for future litigants in the sereboffs position to make a like claim.in a footnote,we observed that the sereboffs had forfeited a distinct assertion that the relief mid atlantic requested,although equitable,was not appropriate under a because it contravened principles like the doctrine.at.enter mccutchen,to make that basic argument.
in the end,however,sereboff logic dooms mccutchen effort.us airways,like mid atlantic,is seeking to enforce the equivalent of an equitable lien by agreement.and that kind of lien as its name announces both arises from and serves to carry out a contract provisions.see,at symons,pomeroy equity jurisprudence,ed.so enforcing the lien means holding the parties to their mutual promises.see,barnes,at walker brown.conversely,it means declining to apply rules even if they would be equitable in a contract absence at odds with the parties expressed commitments.mccutchen therefore can not rely on theories of unjust enrichment to defeat us airways appeal to the plan clear terms.those principles,as we said in sereboff,are beside the point when parties demand what they bargained for in a valid agreement.see restatement third of restitution and unjust enrichment,a valid contract defines the obligations of the parties as to matters within its scope,displacing to that extent any inquiry into unjust enrichment in those circumstances,hewing to the parties exchange yields appropriate as well as equitable relief.
we have found nothing to the contrary in the historic practice of equity courts.mccutchen offers us a slew of cases in which those courts applied the or rule to limit insurers efforts to recoup funds from their beneficiaries tort judgments.see brief for respondents.but his citations are not on point.in some of mccutchen cases,courts apparently applied equitable doctrines in the absence of any relevant contract provision.see,washtenaw mut.fire ins.budd,fire of philadelphia wells,eq.in others,courts found those rules to comport with the applicable contract term.for example,in svea assurance packham,the case mccutchen calls his best,see tr.of oral arg.the court viewed the rule as according with the intention of the contracting parties b road as the language is,the court explained,the agreement can not be construed to give the insurer any greater recovery,at,at see also knaffl knoxville banking trust,camden fire ins.prezioso,eq,ch.div.but in none of these cases nor in any other we can find did an equity court apply the or rule to override a plain contract term.that is,in none did an equity court do what mccutchen asks of us.
nevertheless,the united states,appearing as amicus curiae,claims that the rule has a special capacity to trump a conflicting contract.the government begins its brief foursquare with our and sereboff analysis in a suit like this one,to enforce an equitable lien by agreement,the agreement,not general restitutionary principles of unjust enrichment,provides the measure of relief due.brief for united states.because that is so,the government naturally enough concludes,mccutchen can not invoke the rule to defeat the plan.but then the government takes an unexpected turn.when it comes to the costs incurred by a beneficiary to obtain money from a third party,the terms of the plan do not control.at.an equity court,the government contends,has inherent authority to apportion litigation costs in accord with the longstanding equitable doctrine,even if that conflicts with the parties contract,at.
but if the agreement governs,the agreement governs the reasons we have given and the government mostly accepts for looking to the contract terms do not permit an attorney fees exception.we have no doubt that the doctrine has deep roots in equity.see sprague ticonic nat.bank,tracing equity courts authority over fees to the first judiciary act.those roots,however,are set in the soil of unjust enrichment to allow others to obtain full benefit from the plaintiff efforts without contributing to the litigation expenses,we have often noted,would be to enrich the others unjustly at the plaintiff expense.mills electric,see boeing,at trustees greenough,supra,at and.and as we have just explained,principles of unjust enrichment give way when a court enforces an equitable lien by agreement.see supra,at.the agreement itself becomes the measure of the parties equities so if a contract abrogates the doctrine,the insurer is not unjustly enriched by claiming the benefit of its bargain.that is why the government,like mccutchen,fails to produce a single case in which an equity court applied the rule any more than the rule when a contract provided to the contrary.even in equity,when a party sought to enforce a lien by agreement,all provisions of that agreement controlled.so too,then,in a suit like this one.
the result we reach,based on the historical analysis our prior cases prescribe,fits lock and key with erisa focus on what a plan provides.the section under which this suit is brought does not,after all,authorize appropriate equitable relief at large,mertens,at quoting a rather,it countenances only such relief as will enforce the terms of the plan or the statute,a emphasis added.that limitation reflects erisa principal function to protect contractually defined benefits.massachusetts mut.life ins.russell.the statutory scheme,we have often noted,is built around reliance on the face of written plan documents.schoonejongen.every employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,a,and an administrator must act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as they accord with the statute,a d.the plan,in short,is at the center of erisa.and precluding mccutchen equitable defenses from overriding plain contract terms helps it to remain there.
yet mccutchen arguments are not all for naught.if the equitable rules he describes can not trump a reimbursement provision,they still might aid in properly construing it.and for us airways plan,the doctrine though not the rule serves that function.the plan is silent on the allocation of attorney fees,and in those circumstances,the doctrine provides the appropriate default.in other words,if us airways wished to depart from the rule,it had to draft its contract to say so and here it did not 
ordinary principles of contract interpretation point toward this conclusion.courts construe erisa plans,as they do other contracts,by looking to the terms of the plan as well as to other manifestations of the parties intent.firestone tire rubber bruch.the words of a plan may speak clearly,but they may also leave gaps.and so a court must often look outside the plan written language to decide what an agreement means.cigna amara,slip,at see,at.in undertaking that task,a court properly takes account of background legal rules the doctrines that typically or traditionally have governed a given situation when no agreement states otherwise.see stores.health welfare plan wells,posner,c ontracts are enacted against a background of understandings and legal principles that the parties may not have bothered to incorporate expressly but that operate as default rules to govern in the absence of a clear expression of the parties contrary intent lord,williston on contracts ed.restatement second of contracts.indeed,ignoring those rules is likely to frustrate the parties intent and produce perverse consequences.
the reimbursement provision at issue here precludes looking to the rule in this manner.both the contract term and the equitable principle address the same problem how to apportion,as between an insurer and a beneficiary,a third party payment to recompense an injury.but the allocation formulas they prescribe differ markedly.according to the plan,us airways has first claim on the entire recovery as the plan description states,on any monies recovered from the third party mccutchen receives only whatever is left over if anything.see supra,at.by contrast,the rule would give mccutchen first dibs on the portion of the recovery compensating for losses that the plan did not cover,future earnings or pain and suffering us airways claim would attach only to the share of the recovery for medical expenses.see supra,at.the express contract term,in short,contradicts the background equitable rule and where that is so,for all the reasons we have given,the agreement must govern.
by contrast,the plan provision here leaves space for the rule to operate.that equitable doctrine,as earlier noted,addresses not how to allocate a recovery,but instead how to pay for the costs of obtaining it.see supra,at.and the contract,for its part,says nothing specific about that issue.the district court below thus erred when it found that the plan clearly repudiated the rule.see supra,at.to be sure,the plan allocation formula first claim on the recovery goes to us airways might operate on every dollar received from a third party,even those covering the beneficiary litigation costs.but alternatively,that formula could apply to only the true recovery,after the costs of obtaining it are deducted.consider,for comparative purposes,how an income tax is levied on net,not gross,receipts.see dawson,lawyers and involuntary clients attorney fees from funds,harv,t he claim for legal services is a first charge on the fund and must
