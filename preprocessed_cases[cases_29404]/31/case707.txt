michael hamilton and the southern council of industrial workers health and welfare trust fund appeal the district court judgment entered following a bench trial in favor of james carell and various corporations owned,operated,and controlled by carell,including diversified health management,dhm.this action stems from the purchase and handling of certain investments by steven beard,who was employed as comptroller of dhm but who also performed investment services for the trust fund.plaintiffs originally filed suit against numerous defendants,most of whom have been dismissed,claiming joint and several liability for breaches of fiduciary duties arising under title i of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.on appeal,plaintiffs assign error to the district court judgment as follows the district court clearly erred in finding that carell was not a fiduciary to the trust during the applicable time period the district court erred in failing to hold dhm liable for beard actions under the doctrine of respondeat superior and even if respondeat superior liability can not attach to dhm,the district court erred in declining to ignore the corporate form so as to find the carell corporations liable as a single entity under the doctrine of respondeat superior.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
plaintiff southern council of industrial workers health and welfare trust fund is a joint taft hartley trust fund within the meaning of erisa.plaintiff michael hamilton is an independent fiduciary of the trust fund and was engaged to investigate the investment of trust fund assets in derivative collateralized mortgage obligations cmos between august,and april.the trust fund statement of investment principles provides that investments are to be made in secure instruments only and that investments of a speculative nature are not to be made regardless of possible return.it is undisputed that the cmos at issue here were not suitable investments for the trust fund.
although the trust fund has had a number of administrators,up until september,each has been a corporation related,at some point in time,to defendant james carell.carell owned,operated,and controlled defendants achiever corporation achiever,carell administrators consultants,jwca c,and dhm.carell also owned and operated north america administrators naa,an original defendant with whom plaintiffs settled,and carell administrators,jwca,a company never named in plaintiff complaint until january,jwca c was the administrator for the trust fund thereafter,jwca took over as the administrator and remained so until it merged with naa,effective october.thereafter,naa became the administrator of the trust fund and remained so for the duration of the investment period in question.thus,because we are looking at the investment period between august,and april,the trust fund administrators during that period were jwca from august,to october,and its successor in interest,naa from october,to april,
on may,carell suffered a devastating,injury in a watercraft accident.it is undisputed that up until may,carell had provided investment advice to trustees of the trust fund he and employees under his direction and control managed the investment and assets of the trust fund on a basis.one of those employees was beard,who in the late,assumed certain investment responsibilities for jwca c,the administrator of the trust fund at the time.beard actually was employed as comptroller of dhm,a carell company in the business of managing home healthcare agencies,and remained so during all relevant times giving rise to this suit.dhm never was involved in making investments for the trust fund.as found by the district court,beard assumed investment responsibilities for the jwca c on behalf of the fund.the district court also recognized,individuals employed by a carell corporation commonly provided services to other carell corporations as well.plaintiffs conceded this point in their motion for summary judgment,stating,carell employees commonly worked for several different carell companies depending on what services were being provided.when asked by plaintiffs counsel whether he ever performed any work for jwca,beard testified that he handled investments for the trust fund.
with regard to carell accident,defendants point out that although the district court mentioned its occurrence,the district court failed to emphasize the magnitude of carell injuries,and such detail is necessary for purposes of understanding why carell never resumed or attempted to resume his former role of managing trust fund assets after may.in short,carell was at death door for many months following his accident he was in chronic pain and on extensive pain medication until october,when he underwent surgery that allowed him to stop taking his pain medicine.for the years following his accident,he was in a haze of drugs and does not remember much of anything that happened.
many of the key events at issue in this suit took place at the next trustee meeting following carell accident this meeting took place on june,patsy grooms,claims manager for jwca,attended the trustee meeting in carell absence.also at the meeting were trustees ray white and clovis young,each of whom testified that at the time of the meeting,there was much uncertainty as to whether carell would live or die.grooms testified that the trustees asked her if she would handle the investments for the trust fund and that she said no,as she had no investment experience.she testified 
the trustees were very concerned about trust fund investments because it was an area where apparently carell had had a very,oversight of the investment on their behalf,and they expressed that concern.they indicated in the meeting,and i believe it reflected in the minutes that they were going to form an investment committee that would consist of white and young,and that they were going advised me that they were going to be coming to our office,that they were going to review all of the investments in detail with beard,and that they were going to assume responsibility for oversight of the investment for the southern council.
the trustees had accepted or had advised that they were going to be responsible for the investment from june forward 
grooms testified that she was certain that the investment committee would not limit its discretion to the investment of certain securities but would oversee all trust fund investments.grooms also testified that it had been established at the meeting that either white or young would contact beard following the meeting to inform beard of the committee investment decisions.in august,grooms learned from beard that neither trustee had contacted him she suggested that beard contact the trustees and arrange for a meeting,which he did.beard testified that he did in fact contact trustee young in august at grooms behest and that young told him to continue handling the investments as he always had.thereafter,between august,and april,beard purchased fourteen cmos,later determined to have been inappropriate investments for the trust fund and to have caused the trust fund to sustain a substantial loss.this fact is not in dispute.
the minutes of the june meeting corroborate grooms testimony 
white suggested that an investment committee be established and with no objection from the trustees,he appointed young to the committee along with himself.white and young will meet or have a conference with steve beard of the administrator office to discuss a procedure for handling investments.
trustees white and young testified,however,that although they did in fact form an investment committee to manage and monitor trust fund investments,the investment committee was limited to the management of a single kemper had nothing to do with the cmos at issue here.plaintiffs staunchly maintain this position so as to support their contention that there was no investment committee formed to oversee the cmo investments that carell never relinquished authority and control over the purchase and handling of the cmos and that carell never relinquished authority and control over the actions of beard.
the district court did not find the testimony of trustees white and young credible.as noted by defendants,resolution of much of this case turns on the district court findings of fact and credibility determinations.as to whether the investment committee was formed for the limited purpose of monitoring only the kemper high yield fund,the district court expressly discredited the testimony of trustees white and young 
the court simply does not find that testimony of white and young to be credible insofar as they claim that they formed the investment committee with a limited purpose,only to monitor the interest rates as they related to the kemper high yield fund.
the district court also determined that it was beard,not carell,who determined which cmos to purchase during the relevant time period.the district court further found that beard made these investments at the direction of trustee young,who told him to continue doing what he had been doing with regard to trust fund investments.
we are faced with three issues on appeal whether the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that carell was not an individual fiduciary to the trust fund between august,and april,and thus breached no fiduciary duty whether the district court erred in failing to hold dhm liable for the actions of beard under the doctrine of respondeat superior and whether the district court erred in declining to ignore the corporate form so as to find the carell corporations liable as a single entity under the doctrine of respondeat superior.we will address each issue in turn.
standard of review 
this court has not addressed the narrow issue of whether erisa fiduciary status is strictly a factual issue subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review,a legal issue subject to de novo review,or a mixed question of law and fact,also subject to de novo review.other circuits that have addressed the question have held that fiduciary status under erisa is a mixed question of law and fact.see lopresti terwilliger,cir kramer smith barney,cir the existence of a fiduciary relationship under erisa,on the merits,is a mixed question of law and fact.citing reich lancaster,cir other citation omitted.where the facts are not in question,a party status as an erisa fiduciary is purely a question of law.see blue cross blue shield,cir holding that whether an administrator of a benefits plan is an erisa fiduciary is a conclusion of law subject to de novo review citation omitted waxman luna,cir holding that findings of fact that result from application of legal principles to subsidiary factual determinations are subject to de novo review kayes pacific lumber,cir.however,where a party challenges the district court findings of fact underlying its legal conclusion as to a person fiduciary status under erisa,as plaintiffs do here,those findings remain subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review as mandated by.a see lopresti,at distinguishing between a trial court findings of fact,which are reviewed for clear error,and its legal conclusions drawn from those facts,which are reviewed de novo steen john hancock mut.life ins,cir the conclusion that someone is not an erisa fiduciary is essentially a factual conclusion.reich,at w hile the legal conclusions to be drawn from the facts are assessed de novo,the historical facts that underlie the determination whether someone is an investment advisor under erisa are reviewed for clear error.
a district court findings of fact will be deemed clearly erroneous only when the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.bartling fruehauf,cir citing anderson bessemer city,d.accordingly,our review of the district court factual determinations is limited so long as the district court view of the evidence is plausible in light of the entire record,it must stand,even though the reviewing court,had it been the finder of fact,might have judged the same evidence differently.glover johnson,cir citing anderson,at.furthermore,to the extent that a district court findings of fact rest on credibility determinations,rule requires even greater deference.bartling,at.as the supreme court has held

fiduciary status 
under erisa,a fiduciary is defined as follows 
a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,ii he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation,direct or indirect,with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan,or has any authority or responsibility to do so,or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.
a.erisa also defines a person to include a corporation.see.the supreme court has recognized that erisa defines fiduciary not in terms of formal trusteeship,but in functional terms of control and authority over the plan mertens hewitt,d.the sixth circuit recently emphasized the need to examine the conduct at issue when determining whether an individual is an erisa fiduciary 
the fiduciary obligations imposed by erisa are implicated only where an employer acts in its fiduciary capacity.thus,we must examine the conduct at issue to determine whether it constitutes management or administration of the plan,giving rise to fiduciary concerns,or merely a business decision that has an effect on an erisa plan not subject to fiduciary standards.
hunter caliber,cir internal quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted citing sengpiel goodrich,cir t he fact that an action taken by an employer to implement a business decision may ultimately affect the security of employees welfare benefits does not automatically render the action subject to erisa fiduciary duties.akers palmer,cir erisa does not require that corporate business transactions,which may have a collateral effect on prospective,contingent employee benefits,be performed solely in the interest of plan participants o nly discretionary acts of plan management or administration,or those acts designed to carry out the very purposes of the plan,are subject to erisa fiduciary duties.recognizing that a person deemed to be a fiduciary is not a fiduciary for every purpose but only to the extent that he performs one of the described functions,see klosterman,cir,the seventh circuit has described discretion as the sine qua non of fiduciary status,see pohl benefits consultants,cir.
carell did not exercise discretionary authority or control within the meaning of erisa a.
the district court found that carell was not in fact an erisa fiduciary with regard to the cmos purchased between august,and april,because he did not exercise discretionary authority over the management or administration of the fourteen cmos at issue,nor did he render investment advice for a fee.the district court findings were based in part on the fact that plaintiffs presented no evidence showing that carell caused the trustees to relinquish their independent discretion after forming the investment committee and,instead,to follow a course prescribed by him.the district court drew this legal conclusion from a number of witness credibility determinations and other factual findings plaintiffs,in turn,argue that this finding was clearly erroneous and unsupported by the record.
the district court expressly found that at the june trustee meeting,the trustees formed their own investment committee to exercise discretion over all trust fund investments.the testimony of trustees white and young,that the investment committee was limited to control of the kemper fund only,was a bit too to be credible.instead,the district court credited the testimony of grooms and beard,who claimed that the investment committee would oversee all trust fund investments.to further bolster this finding,the district court relied on the fact that the minutes from the meeting,which were reviewed and unanimously approved at the following meeting,did not refer to the kemper fund.
plaintiffs argue that carell stepped back into his role of managing and overseeing trust fund investments upon his return to work in september.in support of this argument,plaintiffs point to the fact that carell attended some of the monthly trustee meetings,specifically,the meetings held in september,november,and april.like the district court,we are not convinced that carell attendance at these meetings was sufficient to demonstrate that he exercised discretionary authority or control over trust fund investments.
at the september meeting,carell simply read some financial reports to the like grooms did at the june meeting,and she had no investment expertise.carell performance was purely a perfunctory,ministerial function.moreover,the trustees informed carell that his services as contract administrator would be terminated in six months,and carell urged the trustees to obtain an investment advisor.in fact,carell brought with him representatives from the investment firm of legg mason to make a presentation.grooms testified that the purpose of the presentation was to encourage the trustees to obtain an investment advisor because the trustees now were responsible for their own investment decisions.the minutes reflect that legg mason suggested that one of its firm managers attend either the october or november trustee meeting,free of charge,to prepare a written investment policy for the trust fund.carell discussed this suggestion with the trustees,but they did not avail themselves of such services.at the november and april trustee meetings,carell simply reviewed investments and discussed the portfolio performance.as noted by the district court,the minutes from the april meeting reflect that carell asked the trustees for investment suggestions,signifying that both carell and the trustees understood that the trustees,and not carell,were responsible for deciding the investments of the fund.the minutes reflect absolutely no input from carell about where or in what to invest the monies of the fund.
plaintiffs also rely on two memoranda from carell to the trustees to support their assertion that carell was a fiduciary during the time in question.on june,carell instructed grooms to send a memorandum to the trustees,under his name,explaining a change in valuation of the kemper fund.although the contract administrator at this point was naa,the memorandum stated that it was from james carell,contract administrator.two days later,another memorandum was sent to the trustees entitled,revision to the minutes from the april,meeting.again,this memorandum stated that it was sent from james carell,contract administrator.plaintiffs point to these two items as further evidence that up until that point,carell continued to exercise discretionary authority and responsibility over administration of the trust fund.we are unpersuaded.carell testified that he did not know why the first memorandum referred to him as contract administrator and that he knew nothing at all about the second memorandum.grooms testified that she had no recollection of the first memorandum and had no idea who prepared the second one.in light of the fact that carell performed only ministerial functions at the trustee meetings,brought legg mason representatives to the september meeting so as to encourage the trustees to obtain an investment advisor,and was not invited to the january trustee meeting,the inadvertent reference to carell as contract administrator is not enough to support a finding that carell continued to administer the fund in a fiduciary capacity.
finally,as additional evidence that the trustees did not consider carell to have had discretionary authority and control over the management and disposition of trust fund assets during the relevant time period,the district court relied on the fact that the trustees did not enter into a contract for independent investment services until june.as the district court noted,carell did not meet with the trustees or attend any other trustee meetings following the april meeting.furthermore,plaintiffs contract with naa was terminated as of september,when accordia,a company unrelated to carell,became the administrator.but it was not until eight months later that the trust fund entered into a contract for investment services with seix investment advisors,the district court found these facts significant in that they supported its determination that the trustees took control of the investments after carell accident and retained that control until they decided,long after carell departure,to obtain the investment services of seix investments.had the trustees obtained other investment services immediately following carell departure,it would support plaintiffs position that the trustees thought,up until that point,carell was providing such services.however,the trustees took no immediate action following carell departure.thus,the district court was entitled to draw the inference that carell was not acting as an erisa fiduciary during the relevant time period.
carell did not receive a fee for rendering investment advice within the meaning of erisa a.
the district court determined that carell did not receive a fee for rendering investment advice within the meaning of the statute because the only compensation carell received was paid pursuant to the january,fund administration agreement,which simply stated various functions of the administrator jwca at the time,none of which involved services.the district court stated 
although the compensation of jwca was derived in part from the fund investment portfolio in that jwca fee was based on a sliding percentage of the fund monthly growth income,the plaintiffs have presented no evidence that such a fee structure was out of the ordinary for a general fund administration agreement in which no investment services are provided.
plaintiffs failed to establish that after carell accident,he received fees specifically attributable to services.plaintiffs do not seriously contest this finding except to argue that carell did render investment advice to the trustees,a point we reject.
in sum,we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed by the district court with regard to its determination that from august,to april,carell did not exercise discretionary authority or control over the management or administration of the trust fund or disposition of its assets with regard to the fourteen cmos at issue.bartling,at.thus,we hold that the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that carell was not an individual fiduciary to the trust fund during the applicable time period within the meaning of a.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court on this ground.
ii.respondeat superior 
plaintiffs second assignment of error alleges that the district court erred in failing to hold dhm liable for the actions of beard under the doctrine of respondeat superior.although erisa specifically provides that a fiduciary may be liable for another fiduciary breaches,see a,the district court found that dhm played no role in the investment of trust fund assets during the relevant time period and was not a fiduciary with regard to the cmos at issue.plaintiffs do not dispute this finding.indeed,plaintiffs do not allege that dhm is directly liable as a corporate fiduciary that breached its duties.rather,they allege that dhm is derivatively liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior simply by virtue of its agency relationship with beard.plaintiffs correctly point out that the district court analysis
