current and former beneficiaries sued their employer benefit plan administrator under the employee retirement income security act charging that their pension plan had been managed imprudently and in a fashion.we must decide,among other issues,whether the act limitations period or its safe harbor provision are obstacles to their suit.
edison international is a holding company for various electric utilities and other energy interests including southern california edison company and the edison mission group collectively edison,which itself consists of the midwest generation.like most offering pensions today,edison sponsors a k retirement plan for its workforce.during litigation,the total valuation of the edison k savings plan was billion,and it served approximately across the entire edison international workforce.unlike the guaranteed benefit pension plans of yesteryear,this kind of plan entitles retirees only to the value of their own individual investment accounts.see.that value is a function of the inputs,here a portion of the employee salary and a partial match by edison,as well as of the market performance of the investments selected.
to assist their decision making,edison employees are provided a menu of possible investment options.originally they had six choices.in response to a study and union negotiations,in the plan grew to contain ten institutional or commingled pools,forty mutual investments,and an indirect investment in edison stock known as a unitized fund.the mutual funds were similar to those offered to the general investing public,mutual funds,which had higher administrative fees than alternatives available only to institutional investors.the addition of a wider array of mutual funds also introduced a practice known as revenue sharing into the mix.under this,certain mutual funds collected fees out of fund assets and disbursed them to the plan service provider.edison,in turn,received a credit on its invoices from that provider.
past and present midwest generation employees glenn tibbie,william bauer,william izral,henry runowiecki,frederick suhadolc,and hugh tinman,beneficiaries sued under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,which governs the k plan,and obtained certification as a class action representing the whole of edison eligible workforce beneficiaries objected to the inclusion of the mutual funds,specifically claiming that their inclusion had been imprudent,and that the practice of revenue sharing had violated both the plan document and a provision.beneficiaries also claimed that offering a unitized stock fund,money investments,and mutual funds,had been imprudent.
the district court granted summary judgment to edison on virtually all these claims.see tibbie edison int l,d.the court also determined that erisa limitations period barred recovery for claims arising out of investments included in the plan more than six years before beneficiaries had initiated suit.id.at see a.
remaining for trial after these rulings was beneficiaries claim that the inclusion of specific mutual funds had been imprudent.without retreating from an earlier decision at summary judgment that retail mutual funds were not categorically imprudent,the court agreed with beneficiaries that edison had been imprudent in failing to investigate the possibility of alternatives.see tibbie edison int l,no.cv,wl,at.july.it awarded damages of.
beneficiaries timely appeal the district court partial grant of summary judgment to edison edison timely cross appeals,chiefly contesting the judgment.
beneficiaries first contention on appeal is that the district court incorrectly applied erisa limitations period to bar certain of its claims.edison argues for application of the shorter period.we reject both parties approaches to timeliness.
for claims of fiduciary breach,erisa provides that no action may be commenced after the earlier of 
six years after a the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation,or b in the case of an omission the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation,or 
three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation 
except that in the case of fraud or concealment,such action maybe commenced not later than six years after the date of discovery of such breach or violation.
beneficiaries argue that the court erred by measuring the timeliness under erisa for claims alleging imprudence in plan design from when the decision to include those investments in the plan was initially made.they are joined in this contention by the united states department of labor dol.because fiduciary duties are ongoing,and because section a speaks of the last action that constitutes the breach,these claims are said to be timely for as long as the underlying investments remain in the plan.essentially,they argue that we should either equitably engraft onto,or discern from the text of section a continuing violation theory.
beneficiaries argument,though,would make hash out of erisa limitation period and lead to an unworkable result.we have previously declined to read the section provision as permitting the maintenance of the,absent a new breach,to restart the limitations period under the banner of a continuing violation.phillips alaska hotel rest.emps.pension fund,cir.in phillips,the controlling opinion did not reach whether the same was true for section a.at.today we hold that the act of designating an investment for inclusion starts the period under section a for claims asserting imprudence in the design of the plan menu.
preliminarily,we observe that in the case of omissions the statute already embodies what the beneficiaries urge for the last action.section b ties the limitations period to the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation.importing the concept into a,then,would render b surplusage.this must be avoided when,as here,distinct meanings can be discerned from statutory parts.see freeman quicken loans,d.
second,beneficiaries logic confuse s the failure to remedy the alleged breach of an obligation,with the commission of an alleged second breach,which,as an overt act of its own recommences the limitations period.phillips,at,concurring.characterizing the mere continued offering of a plan option,without more,as a subsequent breach would render section a meaningless and could even expose present plan fiduciaries to liability for decisions made by their predecessors decisions which may have been made decades before and as to which institutional memory may no longer exist.david alphin,d,aff,cir.we decline to proceed down that path.as with the application of any statute of limitations,we recognize that injustices can be imagined,but section suggests a judgment by congress that when six years has passed after a breach or violation,and no fraud or concealment occurs,the value of repose will trump other interests,such as a plaintiff right to seek a remedy.larson northrop.
finally,we are unpersuaded by dol suggestion that our holding will give erisa fiduciaries carte blanche to leave imprudent plan menus in place.the district court allowed beneficiaries to put on evidence that significant changes in conditions occurred within the limitations period that should have prompted a full due diligence review of the funds,equivalent to the diligence review defendants conduct when adding new funds to the plan.these particular beneficiaries could not establish changed circumstances engendering a new breach,but the district court was entirely correct to have entertained that possibility.see,quan computer scis,cir explaining that fiduciaries are required to act prudently when determining whether or not to invest,or continue to invest.the potential for future beneficiaries to succeed in making that showing illustrates why our interpretation of section a will not alter the duty of fiduciaries to exercise prudence on an ongoing basis.
for its part,edison contends that beneficiaries had actual knowledge of conduct concerning mutual funds,triggering erisa,more than three years before august,when the complaint was filed 
in order to apply erisa limitation periods,the court must first isolate and define the underlying violation.ziegler.life ins,cir.here,as we explore in greater detail below the crux of beneficiaries successful theory of liability at trial was that alternatives to retail shares had not been investigated not simply that their inclusion had been imprudent.second,specific to section,the court must inquire as to when the plaintiffs had actual knowledge of that violation or breach.id.at.edison points to summary plan descriptions provided to all participants,as well as to mutual fund prospectuses furnished to investors,claiming that these materials made the inclusion of retail shares known.similar information was also furnished to the unions during negotiations.
but as the nature of the breach makes apparent,edison is citing evidence of the wrong type of knowledge.when beneficiaries claim the fiduciary made an imprudent investment,actual knowledge of the breach will usually require some knowledge of how the fiduciary selected the investment.brown am.life holdings,cir.for example,in waller blue cross of california,we explained that the erisa limitations period did not run from the time when the plaintiffs had purchased the subject annuities because their theory of breach was that the fiduciaries had unlawfully employ ed an infirm bidding process to acquire such annuities.d,cir see also frommert conkright,cir the flaw with the district court conclusion under section is that the plaintiffs claim for breach of fiduciary duty is not premised solely on the defendants adoption of the phantom account rather,it is based on allegations that the defendants made ongoing misrepresentations about the origins of the phantom account in an effort to justify its usage.
therefore,because these beneficiaries trial claims hinged on infirmities in the selection process for investments,we hold that mere notification that retail funds were in the plan menu falls short of providing actual knowledge of the breach or violation.
on its cross appeal,edison claims that beneficiaries entire case is proscribed by erisa c,a safe harbor that can apply to a pension plan that provides for individual accounts and permits a participant or beneficiary to exercise control over the assets in his account.c a.
as the edison k is clearly such a plan we consider the terms of section c.it provides that 
n o person who is otherwise a fiduciary shall be liable under this part for any loss,or by reason of any breach,which results from such participant or beneficiary exercise of control.
edison reads this statutory language as insulating it from all of beneficiaries claims because each challenged investment was a product of a participant or beneficiary exercise of control,by virtue of his selection of it from the plan menu.disagreeing,the dol directs us to its previously announced interpretations.in a regulation it stated that in order to fall within section ambit,the breach or loss would need to be the direct and necessary result of the action by the beneficiary.c d.a preamble that went through the process and appeared in the agency final rule,stated that the act of limiting or designating investment options which are intended to constitute all or part of the investment universe of an erisa section c plan is a fiduciary function which is not a direct or necessary result of any participant direction.
to reiterate its long held position,july,dol recently codified this guidance in the body of a new regulation so that it now appears in the code of federal regulations,rather than in the preamble to a rule see,codified at pt.section c does not serve to relieve a fiduciary from its duty to prudently select and monitor any service provider or designated investment alternative offered under the plan.this amended regulation,however,was not in effect during the time period at issue in this case our inquiry therefore centers on what appeared in the final rule.
as to these earlier materials,the parties and amici join issue on the status this court should accord them.beneficiaries and dol argue that they are entitled to the robust sort of deference dictated by chevron,natural resource defense council,d.edison claims that a preamble is not the type of material to which courts properly defer.in any event,the california employment law council,as amicus for edison,argues that dol interpretation is an impermissible construction of the statute.see id.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.both edison and the employment council rely on a divided opinion from the fifth circuit,and on an older case from the third circuit in which the alleged violations preceded the effective date of even the rule.see langbecker data,cir in re unisys sav.plan,cir.
several other circuits,by contrast,have accepted the position advocated by dol.see,pfeil state bank trust,cir favoring dol position in its amicus curiae brief in this appeal and with the preamble to the regulations implementing the safe harbor,cert.denied,d howell motorola,cir similar difelice airways,cir implicitly deferring to the rulemaking.
the chevron framework can apply only if two initial conditions are met congress has delegated the power to that agency to pronounce rules that carry the force of law and the interpretation for which deference is sought was rendered pursuant to that authority.price stevedoring servs.of,cir en banc.that was the teaching of united states mead.
congress gave the secretary of labor authority to promulgate binding regulations interpreting title i of erisa,which includes section c.it also empowered the secretary to bring civil enforcement actions.id.a.these charges plainly satisfy the first requirement under mead.see,gonzales oregon,d explaining that i n many cases authority is clear because the statute gives an agency broad power to enforce its provisions.as for mead second consideration,we do not view the fact that the interpretation appears in a final rule preamble as disqualifying it from chevron deference.edison cites nothing authoritative for cabining that doctrine to materials destined for the pages of the code of federal regulations.though not a necessary condition,a rule is virtually assured eligibility for chevron deference.see,mead,at renee duncan,cir.additionally,other factors significant to whether deference is owed are present here.dol has expressed its position for two decades,erisa is an enormously complex and detailed statute,conkright frommert,d,and this question is of central import to its administration.see barnhart walton,d 
because the interpretation clears the mead threshold,we proceed to the chevron inquiry this calls on the court to examine the plain meaning of the text and apply other relevant canons of statutory interpretation to ascertain whether congress had a fixed intention on the precise question at issue that the agency must abide.wilderness soc y fish wildlife,cir en banc.
if so,that intention is the law and must be given effect.id.if not,the court defers to the agency,provided that its interpretation is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at see also cable telecomm.ass brand x internet,d explaining that ambiguities in statutes within an agency jurisdiction to administer are delegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.these inquiries can be pursued in two steps,or all at once.compare wilderness soc y,at,with entergy riverkeeper,d embracing analysis because if congress has directly spoken to an issue then any agency interpretation contradicting what congress has said would be unreasonable.
in langbecker,the fifth circuit concluded that the dol interpretation of section c could not receive chevron deference because it contradicts the governing statutory language.at.respectfully,we disagree.section c speaks of any breach,which results from a participant exercise of control.result from means t o arise as a consequence,effect,or outcome of some action.oxford english dictionary ed see wilderness soc y,at a fundamental canon of construction provides that unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.internal quotation marks ommitted.
thus as cogently explained by dol in its brief,the selection of the particular funds to include and retain as investment options in a retirement plan is the responsibility of the plan fiduciaries,and logically precedes and thus can not result from a participant decision to invest in any particular option.as previously noted,the dol expressed the same position in a rule albeit less succinctly.the preamble to the final rule states 
that the act of limiting or designating investment options which are intended to constitute all or part of the investment universe of an erisa c plan is a fiduciary function which,whether achieved through fiduciary designation or express plan language,is not a direct or necessary result of any participant direction of such plan.thus,for example,in the case of investment vehicles,the plan fiduciary has a fiduciary obligation to prudently select such vehicles,as well as a residual fiduciary obligation to periodically evaluate the performance of such vehicles to determine,based on that evaluation,whether the vehicles should continue to be available as participant investment options.similar fiduciary obligations would exist in the case of an investment universe consisting of investment alternatives which are not investment vehicles but which are specifically designated by plan fiduciaries.
at emphasis added.although this rule invokes the regulatory terms direct and necessary,c d,the agency ability to make the same point in its amicus brief and in the new rule without that terminology suggests that this gloss may not be essential.see langbecker,at.in our view,though,this does not diminish the validity of its interpretation.
in an opinion that has been read by some to support the view,the third circuit keyed in on the fact that section c also speaks of any loss resulting from a participant control.in re unisys,at for a k or for any plan for that matter,it is admittedly the case that monetary damage flowing from a fiduciary imprudent design of the investment menu passes through the participant,as intermediary.but is it proper to conclude that those losses,in the language of section c,result from the participant choice this might seem an odd question given that,literally speaking,there can be no loss without the participant selecting an investment.
but,i njuries have countless causes,and not all should give rise to legal liability.csx,mcbride,d.undoubtedly,in these situations,a fiduciary decision to include an investment option on the plan menu also is a cause of any participant loss.confronted with this difficulty,dol has effectively imported the notion of proximate cause to conclude that the most salient cause as between the two is the fiduciary imprudence.see id.what we mean by the word proximate,one noted jurist has explained,is simply this because of convenience,of public policy,of a rough sense of justice,the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point.omission in original internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
we deem this a reasonable interpretation of the statute.entergy,at.erisa allocates liability for misdeeds in reasonable proportion to the respective actors power to control and prevent the misdeeds.mertens hewitt,d.as compared to the beneficiary,the fiduciary is better situated to prevent the losses that would stem from the inclusion of unsound investment options.it can design a prudent menu of options.second,chevron deference is meant to foster coherent and uniform construction of federal law.orthopaedic hosp.belshe,cir.our acknowledgment of the flexibility inherent in the phrase result from promotes this,because dol adopts a similar interpretation with regard to breaches claims of imprudent plan design do chronologically follow a participant decision.concluding that a fiduciary is relieved of responsibility only for the direct and necessary consequences of a participant exercise of control.at,dol takes the position that errors in carrying out the investment elections of a beneficiary give rise to liability notwithstanding that any associated loss technically also results from such participant or beneficiary exercise of control.c a ii.these are just the sort of difficult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts.brand x,at.
we also reject the argument raised by edison and the employment law council that dol interpretation renders section c a meaningless provision.when certain conditions are complied with the provision safeguards fiduciaries from being liable for participants substantive investment decisions.at.the purpose of section c is to relieve the fiduciary of responsibility for choices made by someone beyond its control.howell,at.these include matters such as,hypothetically,the participant decision to invest of her assets in fund a and in fund b,rather than splitting assets somehow among four different funds,or emphasizing a rather than b.id.
it is,indeed,the contrary view pressed by edison that would render parts of the erisa statute a nullity by making it nearly impossible for beneficiaries to vindicate fiduciary imprudence.larue dewolff,boberg,d citing the dol regulations implementing section c in rejecting the converse interpretation see also langbecker,at reavley,dissenting all commentators recognize that c does not shift liability for a plan fiduciary duty to ensure that each investment option is and continues to be a prudent one.
because dol interpretation of how the safe harbor functions is consistent with the statutory language,we conclude that the district court properly decided that section c did not preclude merits consideration of beneficiaries claims.see tibbie,d at.
edison on its cross appeal raises another argument that could waylay our analysis of beneficiaries substantive claims on their appeal.it contends that the district court improperly certified beneficiaries case as a class action under federal rule of civil procedure.
rule sets out four prerequisites in subsection a.a class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,a,there must be questions of law or fact common to the class,a,the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of the claims or defenses of the class,a,and those representatives must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class,a.classes must also comply with at least one of the requirements of rule b.zinser accufix research inst,cir.
for the first time on its cross appeal and relying on authority,edison argues that this class action was improperly certified because the claims of the representative plaintiffs are not typical to the claims of the class at large.see spano boeing,cir expounding on rule a typicality requirement.in spano,the court stated that it seems that a class representative in a case would at a minimum need to have invested in the same funds as the class members.id.seizing on this statement,edison contends that one of the three funds successfully litigated at trial was not held by any of the six named plaintiffs this violates rule a,it claims,and requires that we reverse the class certification order.
beneficiaries correctly argue that arguments not raised in the district court ordinarily will not be considered on appeal.dream palace cnty.of maricopa,cir.this rule serves to ensure that legal arguments are considered with the benefit of a fully developed factual record,offers appellate courts the benefit of the district court prior analysis,and prevents parties from sandbagging their opponents with new arguments on appeal.id.in contrast to this typicality argument,edison only rule a arguments below were i a lack of commonality because the misrepresentation claims would require individualized proof of reliance and ii a failure of adequacy.edison concedes that it framed its argument strictly as an adequacy issue below but claims that because this inquiry can overlap with the typicality analysis,its presentation in the lower court suffices.
while we have indulged some liberality as to whether a particular rule a subdivision has been pressed the presentation must have been raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it.in re mercury interactive.sec,cir.here,the district court found that d efendants did not challenge whether the claims of the individual plaintiffs are typical to the class.as to adequacy,edison critique below centered on a contention that the named plaintiffs were nothing more than window dressing or puppets for class counsel in that they were not knowledgeable about their legal claims a far cry from its appellate contention about these beneficiaries investments in light of the failure to present the issue to the district court,we expressly reserve the question of whether the ninth circuit should adopt a rule akin to that articulated in spano,or whether the circumstances of that case would be distinguishable from ours 
we now turn to the merits of the main appeal.beneficiaries argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to edison on their claim that revenue sharing between mutual funds and the administrative service provider violated the plan governing document,as well as was a conflict of interest.
because erisa requires fiduciaries to discharge their duties in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,a d,violations of the written plan have been recognized as a basis for liability.see,cal.ironworkers field pension trust loomis sayles,cir 
since,plan section has stated the cost of the administration of the plan will be paid by the company.edison contracted with hewitt associates,llc,for a variety of services,including the drafting of plan updates and regulatory reports.hewitt also maintained the system by which beneficiaries designate their contribution amounts and make their investment elections.the addition of a large menu of mutual funds in made the plan more expensive to administer,so edison availed itself of a practice known in the industry as revenue sharing.under this arrangement,mutual funds transfer a portion of their fees to the plan service provider,hewitt.that revenue reimburses hewitt for its recordkeeping and other costs.in turn,edison receives a credit on its bills from hewitt.
beneficiaries,while conceding this new practice of revenue sharing was disclosed during the negotiations to expand the plan offerings,argue that the arrangement violated the language of the plan because it allowed edison to escape from part of the obligation to pay.with a december,amendment this plan language was revised to state that t he cost of administration of the plan,net of any adjustments by service providers,will be paid by the company.emphasis added.the parties agree that under the new language these offsets are perfectly appropriate.the issue that arises,however,is whether the district court correctly determined that no triable issue existed over whether the version of section allowed offsets.see.a.at bottom,this is a simple interpretive matter,but like most issues arising under erisa there are complications.
in addition to the pension plan at issue in this case,erisa also governs employee welfare benefit plans such as those for health or disability.see.t he validity of a claim to benefits under an erisa plan is likely to turn on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.the supreme court has handed down a trio of opinions explaining the framework for review when those disputes reach the judiciary.see conkright.at discussing the court two prior precedents,firestone and metropolitan life insurance glenn.the proper standard of review hinges,in part,on what the plan instrument says about interpretation.when the plan is silent,judges review its terms de novo.but,when the plan grants interpretive authority to its administrator,as is usually the case,a deferential abuse of discretion standard applies to the administrator determinations.
the edison plan has a provision that speaks to interpretation it vests the company benefits committee with the full discretion to construe and interpret its terms and provisions.see,sandy reliance std.life ins,cir.the plan even purports to make interpretations by the committee final and binding on all parties.taking stock of these principles,the district court applied the abuse of discretion standard and then concluded that edison view that the language did not foreclose revenue sharing had been reasonable.
yet,as we noted at the outset,the supreme court expounded these interpretive principles in the context of a b actions challenging denials of benefits.firestone,at.at least one court has held that in cases implicating erisa fiduciary duties,the standard fleshed out in firestone,glenn,and conkright is not applicable.see john blair commc ns.profit sharing plan telemundo.profit sharing plan,cir.other courts of appeals have declined to follow suit.see hunter caliber,cir moench robertson,cir expressly disagreeing with john blair.we agree with the third and sixth circuits.
at least three considerations prompt us to hold that the usual abuse of discretion standard applies to cases such as this.first,there are disquieting parallels between the john blair exception and that same circuit out approach to,which the supreme court repudiated in.see conkright.at.in so doing,the court explained that firestone set out a broad standard of deference without any suggestion that the standard was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions like the one adopted by the court of appeals.id.
second,though mindful that the firestone case expressed no view as to the appropriate standard of review for actions under other remedial provisions of erisa,we conclude that the principles underlying that decision,as well as subsequent guidance on the matter,leave little doubt that its teaching governs erisa globally.at.after uttering that caveat,firestone,in nearly the next breath,announces that its holding does not stem from an interpretive gloss on the provision,or from any section of erisa for that matter.id.at erisa does not set out the appropriate standard of review for actions under a b challenging benefit eligibility.instead,because erisa abounds with the language and terminology of trust law and because of legislative history to that effect,that body of law not a discrete provision dictated the appropriate standard of review.id.at trust principles make a deferential standard of review appropriate when a trustee exercises discretionary powers 
this precise insight led the third circuit to reject john blair.see moench,at w e believe that after firestone,trust law should guide the standard of review over claims not only under section a b but also over claims filed pursuant to a based on violations of the fiduciary duties set forth in section a.further evidence that the principles underlying the trilogy of benefits cases extend here is that common law trust principles animate the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa.acosta pac,cir see also cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund central,d identifying the statutorily prescribed duties of loyalty and of prudence as imported from trust law.
third,we observe that applying deference across the board,by permitting an employer to grant primary interpretive authority over an erisa plan to the plan administrator,has the added virtue of preserv ing the careful balancing on which erisa is based.conkright.at.in particular,it helps keep administrative and litigation expenses under control,which could otherwise discourage employers from offering erisa plans in the first place.id.alteration in original.
in addition to these primary considerations,there are shortcomings with the john blair decision itself.in it,the second circuit appealed to the notion that fiduciary duty and suits,under erisa,arise when the plan administrator has fallen prey to invalid considerations matters other than the of beneficiaries.see john blair,at.yet when the supreme court had the opportunity to craft a new review standard for plan administrators adjudicating claims under a financial conflict of interest,it saw no reason to forsake firestone reliance upon trust law.metro.life ins.glenn,d see also conkright.at explaining that we held in glenn that a systemic conflict of interest does not strip a plan administrator of deference.furthermore,john blair drew its insight about the need to limit firestone from a third circuit opinion that the third circuit came to read differently.compare john blair,at discussing struble brewery emps.welfare trust fund,cir,with moench,at.
both the affirmative case for the abuse of discretion standard and difficulties with john blair impel us to apply firestone,and so we do.
erisa administrators abuse their discretion if they act without explanation or construe provisions of the plan in a way that conflicts with the plain language of the plan.day v.at t disability income plan,cir.we are instructed not to disturb those interpretations if they are reasonable.see conkright.at.
to start with,we discern no explicit conflict with the plain language of the plan.see day,at.section required the company to pay the costs,and edison did.although beneficiaries argue that the costs are the expenses associated with hewitt before the offsets,the more natural reading is that costs simply are whatever bills hewitt presented edison with.under this commonsense reading,the plan merely assigned edison an affirmative obligation to pay.it did not,as beneficiaries would have it,prohibit hewitt recordkeeping services from being paid by a third party such as mutual funds.that kind of interpretation,nonsensically,would also imply that if hewitt had simply lowered its prices maybe due to efficiency or market pressure edison would be somehow shirking its obligation under plan.
beyond the text,in conducting abuse of discretion review,courts consider various other criteria for determining the reasonableness of a fiduciary discretionary decision.booth wal mart stores.assocs.health welfare plan,cir.viewing the matter in terms of those considerations further establishes the soundness of edison position.its view is most consistent with the goals of the plan,as it facilitated the expansion of the plan mutual fund offerings.id.we also note that section has been applied consistently over time.undisputed evidence showed that the union negotiators and edison had extensive discussions with regard to how revenue sharing from the mutual funds would be used.also,between when the process started,and when the language was modified,on at least seventeen occasions participants were specifically advised that mutual funds were being used to reduce the cost of retaining hewitt.for example,one summary plan description in evidence said the fees received by edison k plan recordkeeper are used to reduce the recordkeeping and communication expenses of the plan paid by the company.another consideration under the abuse of discretion standard is whether the challenged interpretation is at odds with the procedural and substantive requirements of erisa itself.de nobel vitro,cir citing blau del monte,cir.although we explain the reasoning behind this observation next,we are satisfied that revenue sharing as carried out by edison does not violate erisa.
beneficiaries alternatively argue that the statute conflicts provision,erisa b,prohibits the practice of revenue sharing.erisa is similar to a provision.see.mat.life ins.russell,d.it prohibits the type of business deals likely to injure the pension plan.wright or.metallurgical,cir.
erisa b provides that 
a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not receive any consideration for his own personal account from any party dealing with such plan in connection with a transaction involving the assets of the plan.
b.beneficiaries claim is that edison revenue sharing arrangement violated this provision because edison received consideration in the form of discounts for administrative expenses from hewitt,which was a party dealing with the plan.the dol,though,has issued several non binding advisory opinions staking out the position that a fiduciary does not violate section b so long as the decision to invest in such funds is made by a fiduciary who is independent of the fiduciary receiving the fee.dol advisory,wl june,see also dol advisory,wl may,fiduciary that does not exercise any authority or control to cause the suspect investment is not liable.
relying on these concepts,the district court granted summary judgment to edison.to do so,it conceived of edison,not as a unified corporate entity,but in terms of its constituent parts.in brief,the fiduciaries named in the plan include the southern california edison benefits committee and its members,as well as the edison international trust investment committee and its members.the plan sponsor is southern california edison,while its benefits committee is designated under erisa as the plan administrator.see a i,b edison international ceo appoints the investment committee and southern california edison ceo handles appointments to the benefits committee.
in light of this diffusion of responsibility,the district court observed that,as the sole contracting party with hewitt,only the subsidiary southern california edison had received the credit from administrative expenses.it then noted that it was the investment committee of the parent company,edison international,which had selected the mutual funds that featured revenue sharing.from this,the court drew the conclusion that a different fiduciary had received the consideration than the fiduciary which had in the dol parlance exercised authority or control over the offending investment.therefore,the mutual fund revenue sharing had not violated section b.
as amicus curiae,the dol vigorously objects to the lower court parsing of edison international this way,and objects to what it considers an overly broad reading of its advisory opinions.dol maintains that permitting fiduciaries to make plan asset investment decisions that result in the company on which they serve as directors and officers receiving an economic benefit from a third party is precisely the kind of transaction rife with the potential for abuse that congress intended to prohibit in section b.in response,edison argues that the separate legal identities of the committees and companies are meaningful,and calls to our attention the district court finding that beneficiaries had not marshaled evidence that justified disregarding their putative separateness.
we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo,and we are empowered to affirm on any basis the record will support.see gordon virtumundo,cir.in light of that,we reserve for another case whether the lower court control determinations are defensible and,instead,proceed to consider the basis for affirmance expressly advocated by the dol.
the dol directs our attention to its regulatory interpretation at b e,which states that i f a fiduciary provides services to a plan without the receipt of compensation or other consideration other than reimbursement of direct expenses properly and actually incurred in the performance of such services,the provision of such services does not,in and of itself,constitute an act described in section b of the act.assuming that the edison plan permitted revenue sharing as we concluded above,then as dol explains,the discounts on its invoices from hewitt would not constitute the receipt of any consideration by edison within the meaning of the section b prohibition.in further support,the agency cites one of its opinion letters that permitted,under the authority of section b e,a fiduciary to receive reimbursement from an unrelated mutual fund of direct expenses for which the plan would otherwise be liable.see dol advisory,wl.
the district court intimated that our patelco credit union sahni decision might be to the contrary.cir.it is not,although we do not fault the district court for its misconception.it did not have the advantage,afforded us,of dol participation in tackling these regulatory intricacies.in patelco,the fiduciary had wrongfully deposited erisa plan assets two checks payable to the company into his own account.id.at.this straightforwardly constituted consideration for his own personal account from a party dealing with the plan,in violation of erisa b.id.at.confronted with that scenario,we vindicated dol pronouncement that when a fiduciary in violation of erisa b,the reasonable compensation exception found in section b can not be used as a shield from liability.id.at see also dupree prudential ins.of,wl,at,explaining this 
by contrast in our case,section b e,as it is routinely interpreted by the dol,exempts revenue sharing payments from the very definition of consideration.dupree,wl,at.the department position is that rather than constituting consideration,such payments may be considered reimbursement within the meaning of regulation section b e.dol advisory that means it is not a section b violation at all.
aside from citing patelco as the lower court understood it,beneficiaries only response is,in effect,that we ought to read dol regulations and opinion letters differently than dol has counseled in its amicus brief.we decline to do so.notably,courts are instructed to defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulation,advanced in a legal brief unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.chase bank usa,mccoy,d discussing auer deference.we mention this not because we resolve whether this view is permissible either under erisa or the regulation,but simply to explain why beneficiaries have not convinced us to reject dol interpretation in this case.
beneficiaries next claim that edison violated its duty of prudence under erisa by including several investment vehicles in the plan menu i mutual funds,ii a investment fund akin to a money market,and iii a unitized fund for employees investment in edison stock.
erisa demands that fiduciaries act with the type of care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances not of a lay person,but of one experienced and knowledgeable with these matters.a b.fiduciaries also must act exclusively in the interest of beneficiaries.id.a.these obligations are more exacting than those associated with the business judgment rule so familiar to corporate practitioners,howard shay,cir,a standard under which courts eschew any evaluation of substantive due care.brehm eisner,cited in pac.nw.generating coop.bonneville power,cir.to enforce this duty of prudence,we consider the merits of the transaction and the thoroughness of the investigation into the merits of the transaction.howard,at emphasis added.courts are in broad accord that engaging consultants,even and impartial ones,will not alone satisfy the duty of prudence.see george kraft foods global,cir collecting cases from the second,fifth,seventh,and ninth circuits.
under the common law of trusts,which helps inform erisa,a fiduciary is to make such investments and only such investments as a prudent person would make of his own property having in view the preservation of the plan and the amount and regularity of the income to be derived.in re,at quoting restatement second of trusts first alternation in original.
a mutual fund is a pool of assets,chiefly a portfolio of securities bought with the capital contributions of the fund shareholders.jones harris assocs,d.joined by the aarp as an amicus,beneficiaries seek a ruling that including mutual funds of the sort available to the investing public at large retail or funds is categorically imprudent.their position is that under erisa,fiduciaries must offer institutional investment alternatives such as commingled pools or separate accounts.
mutual funds,however,have a variety of unique regulatory and transparency features that make it an comparison to judge them against aarp and beneficiaries suggested options.as chief judge easterbook,writing for the seventh circuit,has usefully summarized 
a pension plan that directs participants into privately held trusts or commingled pools the sort of vehicles that insurance companies use for assets under their management lacks the benchmark provided by a retail mutual fund.it can be hard to tell whether a closed fund is doing well or poorly,or whether its expenses are excessive in relation to the benefits they provide.it can be hard to value the vehicle assets often real estate rather than stock or bonds when someone wants to withdraw money,and any error in valuation can hurt other investors.
loomis exelon,cir.as beneficiaries admit in their briefing,mutual funds are generally easy to track via newspaper or internet sources.this,in fact,was a stated goal of the report issued by the joint study group of human resource managers and employee union representatives empaneled to expand the plan menu.relatedly,as other courts have recognized,fund alternatives such as commingled pools are not subject to the same reporting,governance,and transparency requirements as mutual funds,which are governed by the securities act of and the investment company act of.see renfro unisys,cir harris.at.
further,the undisputed evidence was that during collective bargaining the union requested forty retail mutual funds for inclusion in the plan.while conceding this,the beneficiaries claim that the union did not know what was in its members best interest.because participant choice is the centerpiece of what erisa envisions for plans,these sorts of paternalistic arguments have had little traction in the courts.see,loomis,at renfro,at observing that imprudence is less plausible in light of an erisa k plan having a reasonable range of investment options with a variety of risk profiles and fee rates.
also before us under the mutual fund umbrella is beneficiaries claim that the particular mutual funds edison selected charged excessive fees,which rendered their inclusion imprudent.part of this challenge is a broadside against mutual funds,which do generally have higher expense ratios than their counterparts.as the district court explained in its findings of fact,this is because with mutual funds the amount of assets invested is far greater than that associated with the typical individual investor.the seventh circuit has repeatedly rejected the argument that a fiduciary should have offered only wholesale or institutional funds.see loomis,at hecker,at n othing in erisa requires a fiduciary to scour the market to find and offer the cheapest possible fund which might,of course,be plagued by other problems.we agree.there are simply too many relevant considerations for a fiduciary,for that type of approach to prudence to be tenable.braden wal mart stores,cir acknowledging that a fiduciary might have chosen funds with higher fees for any number of reasons,including potential for higher return,lower financial risk,more services offered,or greater management flexibility.
nor is the particular expense ratio range out of the ordinary enough to make the funds imprudent.in hecker,the court upheld the dismissal of a similar excessive fee claim where the range of expenses varied from to across a pool of twenty mutual funds.at.here,the facts showed that the expense ratio varied from to,and there were roughly forty mutual funds to choose from.
before we leave the topic of mutual funds we find it necessary to make one last observation.much time at oral argument and ink in the briefs were devoted to debating the question of whether the revenue sharing typically associated with mutual funds adversely impacts plan beneficiaries.today we have held that the practice here did not violate the terms of the edison plan or violate erisa b.
mutual funds generate this revenue by charging what is known as a rule fee to all investors participating in the fund edison takes the position that because that fee applies to plan beneficiaries and all other fund investors alike,the allocation of a portion of that total fee to hewitt is irrelevant.as it put the matter at oral argument the mutual fund advisor can do whatever it wants with the fees sometimes they share costs with service providers who assist them in providing service and sometimes they do.this,of course,assumes that the cost of revenue sharing is not driving up the fund total fee and,in turn,its overall expense ratio.it also assumes that fiduciaries are not being driven to select funds because they offer them the financial benefit of revenue sharing.the former was not explored in this case and the evidence did not bear
