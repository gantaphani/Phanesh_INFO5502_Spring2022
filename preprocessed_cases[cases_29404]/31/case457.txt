sabriyana singh commenced this action in state court against prudential health care plan,a health maintenance organization,seeking primarily reimbursement of monies paid to prudential pursuant to a subrogation term in its policy that was issued as an employee benefit plan.singh complaint alleged that the subrogation term was illegal under the provisions of the maryland health maintenance organization act the hmo act.ii et,that have been construed by the maryland court of appeals in riemer columbia medical plan,to prohibit hmos from pursuing subrogation with respect to their members claims against third parties.prudential removed the case to federal court,asserting that singh claims based on state law were completely preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,and then moved to dismiss singh complaint.singh filed a motion to remand the case to state court.the district court denied singh motion to remand and granted prudential motion to dismiss the complaint.
because we agree with the district court that erisa completely preempts singh claims,we affirm the district court denial of singh motion to remand.we reverse,however,its order dismissing singh claims,holding that they must be taken as erisa claims and resolved under a of erisa.
after sabriyana singh was involved in an automobile accident in march,prudential health care plan,prudential,an hmo with whom singh employer contracted to provide healthcare benefits under an employee benefit plan,paid singh in respect to injuries sustained in the accident.singh also made a claim against the other party to the accident,and in settlement of that claim,allstate insurance company paid singh in february.based on a term of the employee benefit plan permitting prudential,through subrogation,to assert members claims against third parties for reimbursement of benefits paid,prudential asserted a subrogation claim against the for reimbursement of the payment that it had earlier made to singh,and in september singh paid the subrogation claim.
contending that the prudential plan subrogation provision was illegal under the maryland hmo act,singh commenced this action in state court as a class action,alleging under state common law that prudential was unjustly enriched and that it negligently misrepresented its right to subrogation.for relief,she sought a declaratory judgment that the subrogation provision in the prudential plan was illegal under the maryland hmo act,an equitable award of restitution for subrogation amounts already paid by hmo members,compensatory damages,and an injunction directing prudential to cease and desist from asserting a subrogation interest in and a lien against any recoveries and prohibiting it from increasing premiums,or other charges to recover the losses incurred in connection with this litigation.
the maryland hmo act,on which singh relied in her complaint,regulates any person or organization that provides its members with healthcare services on a prepaid basis.see.ii f.based on an hmo provision of healthcare on a prepaid basis,the maryland court of appeals construed the hmo act to prohibit hmos from pursu ing its members for restitution,reimbursement,or subrogation after the members have received damages from a tortfeasor.riemer columbia medical plan.accordingly,if maryland law were to apply,the provision of the prudential plan that authorizes prudential to pursue a subrogation claim with respect to benefits it provided under the plan would be illegal.
in response to the holding of riemer,the maryland legislature enacted,and on may,the governor signed,senate bill to provide that an hmo is authorized to pursue subrogation with respect to members recoveries from third parties.that legislation was made effective june,and provided that it would apply retroactively to all subrogation recoveries by hmos since january.after the proceedings in this case were completed before the district court,the maryland court of appeals held that the provision of senate bill authorizing retroactive subrogation by hmos violated the maryland constitution.harvey kaiser foundation health plan.consequently,as maryland law now stands,the subrogation prohibition of the hmo act remained applicable until june.
in response to singh complaint,prudential filed a notice of removal to federal court,pursuant to and,asserting that the employee benefit plan in this case was regulated by erisa and not by state law.
singh filed a motion to remand to state court,arguing that her complaint arose under state law regulating insurance that was saved from preemption under erisa saving clause,b a,b a,and that her claims did not seek impermissible alternative remedies to erisa enforcement provisions,a,a.prudential filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,contending that singh complaint failed to state a claim under erisa upon which relief could be granted.following a hearing on the motions,the district court issued an oral ruling denying singh motion to remand because her claims required interpretation of the terms of an erisa plan and were completely preempted under a of erisa.the district court apparently rejected singh argument that the state law on which her claims were based was saved from preemption under b a.because of this,the court dismissed singh claims,presumably because claims relating to an erisa plan that are not saved from preemption under b a must be dismissed.as an additional basis for its dismissal,the court noted that senate bill was clear on its face in allowing retroactive subrogation by hmos,and that plaintiff would,therefore,be unable to get any relief in any court.the court did not,of course,have the benefit of the maryland court of appeals harvey decision holding the retroactivity provision of senate bill unconstitutional.in view of the district court apparent ruling that the hmo act was not saved under b a,the role of its commentary on the preempted state law,including senate bill,was not made clear.
from the district court order denying remand and dismissing the complaint,singh appealed.
singh contends that her state claims seek only to enforce the antisubrogation provision of the maryland hmo act,which she argues is a state regulation of insurance that is saved from erisa preemption under the express terms of b a.she argues,erisa has no application to this state law dispute,and thus dismissal and removal were improper and the case should be remanded immediately to the state court.
prudential contends that singh complaint seeks remedies for claims based on the hmo act that are preempted and subject to the exclusive remedial provisions of a of erisa,and therefore her claims must,under the doctrine of complete preemption,be treated as federal claims.therefore,according to prudential,the action was properly removed.prudential then argues,in the alternative and perhaps inconsistently,that singh claims can not arise under the maryland hmo act because that act does not create a private right of action.it asserts further that any causes of action to enforce the subrogation prohibition of the hmo act are preempted by of erisa and thus should be dismissed.
in this appeal,we review the district court order denying singh motion to remand and granting prudential motion to dismiss.to decide the remand issue,which actually involves singh challenge to removal jurisdiction,requires a determination of whether singh state claims fall within the scope of erisa exclusive remedial scheme set forth in a,a,and therefore are completely preempted.as we explain herein,singh claims fall within the scope of a if they are claims for benefits,entitlement to which must be determined by passing on the validity,interpretation or applicability of a term of an erisa plan.removal jurisdiction is only proper,then,if singh state claims for unjust enrichment and negligent misrepresentation are,in fact,claims for benefits due under the terms of an erisa plan.in this particular case,singh claims can not be thought of as seeking enforcement of the terms of an erisa plan unless a state law,the maryland hmo act,acts to define a term of the plan.thus,our jurisdictional analysis must answer preliminarily what the terms of the plan are and only then may we proceed to determine whether singh claims are,in fact,claims for benefits due under the terms of the plan.in determining the hmo act impact on the plan at issue here,we take the course of analysis set forth in rush prudential hmo moran,d,a case in which the claimant,like singh here,sought reimbursement from an hmo,relying in part on a state hmo act impact on the plan.see id.discussing the impact of a state hmo act that was saved under erisa b a on the terms of an erisa plan and on the exclusive remedial scheme set forth in a.
in parts iii and iv,therefore,we conduct the rush analysis to determine whether the maryland hmo act subrogation which singh state claims a term of the relevant plan through a and b a of erisa.this requires us to determine whether the hmo act itself is preempted by erisa under the relevant statutory provisions and whether the hmo act conflicts with erisa remedial scheme.concluding that the hmo act is saved from preemption as a state regulation of insurance and therefore is applied to negate the plan subrogation term,we assess,in part v,whether singh claims for the return of funds under state common law are claims for entitlement to benefits under the terms of the plan as modified by the saved state law,such that the claim is completely preempted.
in part vi,after having concluded that the case was properly removed to federal court under the doctrine of complete preemption,we turn to the review of the district court order dismissing the case.
the parties do not dispute that the prudential plan,of which singh is a participant,is an employee benefit plan regulated by erisa.they differ on whether erisa preempts the maryland hmo act,which would prohibit prudential,an hmo subject to maryland regulation,from enforcing the subrogation provision in the plan against singh.
section a of erisa,containing the preemption clause,provides 
except as provided in subsection b of this section,the provisions of this subchapter shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan 
a.defining the scope of this preemption by any state law that relates to an employee benefit plan,this preemption clause is recognized to be broad and expansive.pilot life ins.dedeaux,d see also cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham constr,d reviewing the court many previous acknowledgments that erisa preemption provision is clearly expansive,has a broad scope and an expansive sweep,is broadly worded,deliberately expansive,and conspicuous for its breadth.
subsection b referred to in a contains the saving clause,which excepts from the preemption clause any state law regulating,among other things,insurance.it provides 
except as provided in subparagraph b,nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.
b a.the scope of the saving clause is limited by the deemer clause,subparagraph b referred to in the saving clause,which provides 
neither an employee benefit plan nor any trust established under such a plan,shall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer or to be engaged in the business of insurance for purposes of any law of any state purporting to regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts.
we apply these provisions of sequentially in determining whether the subrogation prohibition of the maryland hmo act is preempted by erisa.
first,the parties do not dispute that the provisions of the maryland hmo act that have been construed to prohibit subrogation by hmos prior to june relate to an employee benefit plan for the purposes of a.indeed,both the supreme court and this court,recognizing the expansive sweep of a preemption,have held that state antisubrogation laws relate to an employee benefit plan.fmc holliday,d pennsylvania antisubrogation law relate s to an employee benefit plan hampton,sparrow,cir holding that a north carolina law limiting subrogation relate s to an employee benefits plan within the meaning of the preemption clause.
the more complex question is whether the saving clause,b a,excepts from application of the preemption clause the state subrogation prohibition on the basis that the prohibition regulates insurance.prudential argues that the saving clause does not apply here for two reasons.first,it argues that the maryland hmo act is not a regulation of insurance because it regulates hmos,and under maryland law,hmos are classified as healthcare providers rather than insurers.second,it argues more broadly that,in any event,antisubrogation laws are not regulations of insurance.
neither of prudential arguments is persuasive.prudential first the maryland hmo act does not regulate insurance because hmos are not considered insurers in based principally on the fact that the hmo act is located in the maryland article of the maryland code.prudential points to statutory language providing that the general assembly intends to exempt health maintenance organizations from the insurance laws of this state,except as set forth in this subtitle.ii.but the exception at the end of the quoted language indicates that hmos are not categorically exempted from insurance laws.nor need it mean that the hmo act does not,or any law concerning hmos could not,provide its own form of insurance law.
more fundamentally,prudential argument fails because it wanders from the guideposts established by the supreme court for determining the applicability of the saving clause,advancing instead a formalistic argument that has already been rejected.the supreme court recently clarified the test for determining the applicability of the saving clause,reducing it to two factors 
first,the state law must be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance.second the state law must substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.
kentucky ass of health plans,miller,d citation omitted.in so holding,the court in miller made a clean break from the factors that previously served as considerations in the analysis but which ultimately added little to the relevant analysis.id.at.nonetheless,it retained the mandate to focus not on how a regulated entity is classified,but on whether the state law is aimed at the provision of insurance.
in metropolitan life insurance massachusetts,for example,the insurer argued that a massachusetts law requiring certain mental health coverage was in reality a health law that merely operates on insurance contracts to accomplish its end,and that it was not the kind of traditional insurance law intended to be saved by b a,d.the supreme court found this argument unpersuasive,and stated that congress did not distinguish between traditional and innovative insurance laws.see also id.appellants assert that laws that regulate the substantive terms of insurance contracts are more recent innovations more properly seen as health laws rather than as insurance laws,which b a does not save.this distinction reads the saving clause out of erisa entirely.
more recently,in rush prudential hmo,moran,d,an hmo proffered a similar argument 
rush contends that seeing an hmo as an insurer distorts the nature of an hmo,which is,after all,a health care provider,too.this,rush contends,should determine its characterization,with the consequence that regulation of an hmo is not an insurance regulation within the meaning of erisa.
the court,however,rejected this argument 
the answer to rush is,of course,that an hmo is both it provides health care,and it does so as an insurer.nothing in the saving clause requires an choice between health care and insurance in deciding a preemption question,and as long as providing insurance fairly accounts for the application of state law,the saving clause may apply.
thus,we reject prudential argument that the subrogation prohibition is not saved because hmos should not be considered insurers.
prudential second argument maintains that,even under the framework established by the supreme court,the antisubrogation provisions of the maryland hmo act are not saved from preemption because subrogation laws are not laws that regulate the business of insurance.when making this argument,prudential did not have the benefit of miller,where the supreme court jettisoned the portion of the analysis that,applying the factors,focused on whether the state law regulated the business of insurance 
rather than concerning itself with whether certain practices constitute t he business of insurance,or whether a state law was enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,b a asks merely whether a state law is a law which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.
at.but even before miller,which did not work any fundamental change in the substance of analysis,both the supreme court and this court rejected prudential argument.in fmc holliday,the supreme court dealt precisely with the question of whether a state antisubrogation law was saved from preemption under b a,and held that it was 
there is no dispute that the pennsylvania antisubrogation law falls within erisa insurance saving clause the antisubrogation law directly controls the terms of insurance contracts by invalidating any subrogation provisions that they contain.it does not merely have an impact on the insurance industry it is aimed at it.this returns the matter of subrogation to state law.unless the statute is excluded from the reach of the saving clause by virtue of the deemer clause,therefore,it is not.
at.citations omitted.following fmc,we noted that limits on subrogation recoveries appear to be aimed at the insurance industry,and therefore would also appear to come within the scope of the saving clause.hampton,at holding that the state law limiting subrogation was not saved,however,because of the applicability of the deemer clause.
controlled by the holding of fmc and consistent with our observation in hampton industries,we conclude that the subrogation prohibition of the maryland hmo act applicable before june is a regulation of insurance that is saved from preemption under b a.but notwithstanding the holding of fmc,it is difficult to imagine an antisubrogation law of this type as anything other than an insurance regulation,as it addresses who pays in a given set of circumstances and is therefore directed at spreading policyholder risk.see miller.at directing focus on whether the state law is specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance and substantially affect s the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.
while the application of the saving clause is limited by the deemer clause,prudential abandoned its argument made below that the deemer clause is applicable.the deemer clause operates to exempt erisa plans from state laws that regulat e insurance within the meaning of the saving clause.fmc,at.emphasis added.because the prudential plan at issue here is an insured plan,the deemer clause does not operate to exempt it from application of the hmo act,which is saved under b a.
in sum,we agree with singh that the saving clause contained in b a appears to exempt the subrogation prohibition of the maryland hmo act from preemption by erisa.but reaching this tentative conclusion does not end the inquiry because we must still assess whether the otherwise saved state law nonetheless frustrates the overall purposes of erisa by inappropriately supplementing or supplanting erisa exclusive remedies.see conover aetna health care,cir a state law otherwise regulating insurance within the meaning of b a may still be preempted if it allows plan participants and beneficiaries to obtain remedies under state law that congress rejected in erisa citations omitted.
the supreme court has recognized a limited exception from the saving clause created by the overpowering reach of a of erisa,in which congress set forth the exclusive remedies available for claims relating to employee benefit plans.rush,at.the supreme court concluded that state laws regulating insurance could be applied to erisa plans,but only so long as doing so would not undermine the objectives of a.id.at.id.at.although we have yet to encounter a forced choice between the congressional policies of exclusively federal remedies and the reservation of the business of insurance to the states,we have anticipated such a conflict,with the state insurance regulation losing out if it allows plan participants to obtain remedies that congress rejected in erisa citations omitted.
in rush,the court was presented with a state law that authorized hmo members to demand an independent medical review of a decision to deny coverage for a procedure deemed by the hmo to be medically unnecessary.concluding that this law was exempt from preemption by the saving clause and did not create a new claim or enlarge the remedies prescribed by a,the court held that the saved state law did not interfere with a and therefore would be enforced as part of an erisa plan.the court explained that the saved state law did not create a conflicting enforcement scheme or an arbitration system that would supplement the specific remedies prescribed by a,but rather provided a standard for making medical judgments 
the practice of obtaining a second opinion is far removed from any notion of an enforcement scheme,and once the state law is seen as something akin to a mandate for a practice in order to insure sound medical judgments,the preemption argument that arbitration under the state law supplants judicial enforcement runs out of steam.
this case therefore does not involve the sort of additional claim or remedy exemplified in pilot life,russell,d,and,but instead bears a resemblance to the rule that we sustained in unum life insurance of america ward,d,holding that a state law barring enforcement of a policy time limitation on submitting claims did not conflict with a a of erisa,even though the state rule of decision,at,could mean the difference between success and failure for a beneficiary.the procedure provided by the state law does not fall within pilot life categorical preemption.
thus,while a state law purporting to supply additional remedies to claimants under erisa plans would impermissibly compete with a remedies,and therefore not be saved from preemption as a result of the limited exception from the saving clause,a state law simply mandating or prohibiting certain terms of policy coverage does not force a choice between state regulation of insurance and the prescribed remedies of a and therefore may be saved under b a.compare mcclendon,d holding preempted state law that purports to provide a remedy for the violation of a right expressly guaranteed by erisa and exclusively enforced by a emphasis added,and pilot life,d holding that,in light of the exclusive a remedies,a state claim that could result in punitive remedy not available to the claimant under the relevant erisa not saved under b a,with rush,at.holding that a state law giving hmo members a right to independent review of certain denials of benefits was saved from preemption because,although the state law replaced a term of the insurance contract,the relief ultimately available would still be what erisa authorizes in a suit for benefits under a,and metropolitan life,d holding that a state law mandating that insurance policies provide certain mental health coverage was saved from preemption under the saving clause.thus,although a state law may not supplement or supplant a remedies available to erisa participants and beneficiaries for claims regarding plan benefits,see pilot life,at,it makes scant sense to suggest that states are powerless to alter the terms of the insurance relationship in erisa plans,unum life ins.ward,d see also metropolitan life,at.nor is there any contrary case authority suggesting that laws regulating the terms of insurance contracts should not be understood as laws that regulate insurance.
the state regulation of insurance at issue subrogation prohibition of the maryland hmo substantially farther removed from any conflict with a than was the procedure in rush.indeed,prudential argues that the subrogation prohibition does not create any right of action under the state hmo act or under state common law.regardless of whether th
