this case presents the question whether the estate and alleged beneficiaries of an employee who was neither enrolled in,nor eligible for,a life insurance plan regulated by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,at the time of her death which preceded the time this action was filed may bring an erisa claim.we hold that these parties may not bring such a claim,and therefore erisa does not preempt appellants state law claims.
factual and procedural background 
connie miller miller was employed by rite aid from approximately until her death on february.for some unknown period of time,rite aid made deductions from miller paycheck to pay for life insurance through a group plan provided by reliastar life insurance company reliastar.appellants claim that the reliastar policy provided for a benefit of approximately and that miller children were the beneficiaries of the policy.
in february,miller was diagnosed with terminal cancer and was placed on disability until her death one year later.on july,before miller death,rite aid terminated its reliastar plan and replaced it with a group plan provided by standard insurance company standard.miller was not enrolled in the standard life insurance plan because she was not included in the list of employees exempt from the plan active at work requirement,which provided that 
if you are incapable of active work because of sickness,injury or pregnancy on the day before the scheduled effective date of your insurance your insurance will not become effective until the day after you complete one full day of active work as an eligible member.active work mean s performing the material duties of your occupation at your employer usual place of business.
therefore,miller was not enrolled in a group life insurance plan after rite aid terminated the reliastar plan.miller also did not convert the reliastar group plan into an individual plan 
appellants allege,without any details,that rite aid offered,as part of the employment agreement with miller,that miller would be provided with life insurance.appellants also allege that after miller became terminally ill rite aid representatives assured her that she would continue to have life insurance through the time of her death.miller allegedly repeated these assurances to her daughter.appellants also allege that after miller death rite aid representatives told her daughter that miller had life insurance at the time of her death appellants later discovered that they were not eligible for any benefits because miller was not enrolled in any life insurance plan.
after miller died,her children and alleged beneficiaries,morgan miller,kylee miller,wayne hoover,individually,and morgan miller as personal representative of miller estate,filed suit in the circuit court of the state of oregon against rite aid corporation,thrifty payless,reliastar insurance company,and standard insurance company.in their amended action,they alleged breach of insurance contract against reliastar and,in the alternative,against standard,for failure to pay death benefits worth approximately.alternatively,appellants alleged breach of employment contract against rite aid for failing to provide miller with life insurance.the millers also alleged that rite aid negligently failed to ensure that miller fringe benefits would be preserved.
the defendants removed the action to the united states district court for the district of oregon,on the ground that the district court had federal question jurisdiction because erisa preempted the appellants state law claims.in the alternative,the defendants claimed that the district court had diversity jurisdiction with respect to rite aid.
appellants voluntarily dismissed their claim against reliastar,and standard and rite aid filed motions for summary judgment.the district judge granted summary judgment in favor of standard,and appellants did not appeal that decision.in the district court,rite aid contended that appellants state common law claims were preempted by erisa.rite aid further argued that the millers did not have valid common law or erisa claims against it because reliastar provided instructions for converting the group policy to an individual policy,and because miller was not even eligible to receive life insurance through rite aid due to the standard policy active at work requirement.the district judge granted summary judgment on the preemption ground and dismissed the action.
the millers appealed.rite aid is the only appellee.
ii.discussion 
state common law claims are preempted by erisa insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan regulated by erisa.a.but before a court wades into this provision veritable sargasso sea of obfuscation,it must first resolve the simpler question of whether a party may assert a claim under erisa.toumajian frailey,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.see also burrey pac.gas,cir curtis.bonding,cir.
a civil action under erisa may be brought by a participant in or beneficiary of an erisa plan.a.erisa does not preempt the claims of parties who do not have the right to sue under erisa because they are neither participants in nor beneficiaries of an erisa plan.curtis,at.as we stated in harris provident life accident insurance,cir,it would be contradictory to rule that state law claims are preempted where the court has already held that the same plaintiffs may not assert a claim under erisa because they are not participants in the erisa plan unlike the chesire sic cat,one can not have the smile of preemption without the stripes of participation.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
appellants,the miller estate and her beneficiaries,may bring a civil suit under erisa only if miller was a participant in an erisa plan at the relevant time.erisa defines a participant as any employee or former employee who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.the supreme court has interpreted this provision to mean that a party is a participant if he is an employee in,or reasonably expected to be in,currently covered employment,or if he is a former employee who has a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment,or a colorable claim to vested benefits.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.
miller was employed by rite aid until the time of her death,so to decide whether miller was a participant,we must ask whether miller was either covered by an erisa life insurance plan at the relevant time,or whether she may have become eligible for benefits from such a plan at such time.in order to establish that miller may become eligible,she must have a colorable claim that she will prevail in a suit for benefits,or that eligibility requirements will be fulfilled in the future.id.at.
in order to answer the questions before us we must first identify the relevant time for determining whether miller was a participant.we have repeatedly held that whether a living party is a participant or beneficiary is determined as of the time the lawsuit is filed.see,chuck hewlett packard,cir schultz plm int l,cir crotty cook,cir curtis,at cir parker bain,cir harris,at olson dynamics,cir,cert.denied,d nishimoto,cir kuntz reese,cir,cert.denied,d,abrogated on other grounds by kayes pac.lumber,cir.however,we have never identified the applicable time for evaluating the claims of a decedent estate and beneficiaries 
in the case of a deceased employee,it would seem to make more sense to look to the time of the employee death to determine whether he is covered by an insurance plan,although it is inconceivable that there could be any change in eligibility between the time of death and the time the suit is filed.this will also be the applicable time for determining whether the decedent had a colorable claim to benefits 
at the time of miller death she did not qualify as a participant in any erisa life insurance plan because at that time she was not covered by any life insurance policy and she did not have a colorable claim to benefits under any plan 
miller was not covered by the reliastar life insurance plan because r
