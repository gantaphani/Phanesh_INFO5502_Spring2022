the cement masons local pension fund is a retirement benefits plan established under the employee retirement income security act erisa.the plaintiffs,alfred gerosa and other trustees of the fund,allege that,as a result of the negligence of their actuary,the defendant,savasta company,the fund is now dangerously underfunded.accordingly,they brought suit against savasta under erisa civil enforcement section,a,as well as under several theories of liability.following the defendant b motion,the district court for the southern district of new york alvin hellerstein,dismissed the trustees claims as preempted,but denied the motion to dismiss the claim under erisa.the district court dual determinations relied in large part on our opinion in diduck kaszycki sons contractors,cir.because we now conclude that diduck has been superseded by subsequent decisions of the supreme court,we must reverse both holdings and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the individual plaintiffs in this case are each trustees of the plaintiff,cement masons local pension fund,a pension plan organized pursuant to the employee retirement income security act,supp.among its numerous other demands,erisa requires the administrator of each plan annually to obtain and publish an actuarial statement,which is in essence an analysis of the plan financial condition by a professional actuary.id.a a,d.
the plaintiffs complaint,which for purposes of this appeal we accept as true,alleges that in fulfillment of their duties,the trustees hired the defendant,savasta company,to serve as the plan actuary and prepare its actuarial statements.in each of its actuarial statements from through,savasta reported that the plan was actually.in other words,the plan assets were more than sufficient to pay all projected benefits claims.the plaintiffs allege that,in reliance on this information,they amended the plan to distribute the excess funding to the plan beneficiaries in the form of improved benefits.savasta analysis at the time indicated that,even under the more generous provisions,the plan was still overfunded by a small margin.
savasta actuarial statement at the end of the next year,however,revealed a dramatically different situation.now,savasta projected,the plan assets would cover only of the plan projected liabilities.savasta explanation for this disparity,according to the complaint,was that there had been a data correction.when pressed for more information,savasta reported that it could not offer any better explanation,because all of its records upon which it had based its calculations were missing.
the trustees subsequently filed this suit,on behalf of themselves and the plan,seeking to recover from savasta the anticipated shortfall between the plan liabilities and its assets the complaint sought redress under the civil enforcement provisions of erisa,see a,as well as under theories of promissory estoppel,breach of contract,and professional malpractice 
savasta then moved to dismiss the complaint,pursuant to.b,arguing that the remedies sought by the plaintiffs are not available under erisa,and that erisa preempts the state law claims.the district court denied the motion to dismiss the erisa claim,holding that the plaintiffs could obtain consequential damages under the statute.see gerosa savasta,d.however,the district court granted the motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims,finding them preempted by erisa.id.it also granted both parties motions to file an interlocutory appeal,pursuant to b.id.another panel of this court agreed that we should hear both savasta appeal and the plaintiffs.the secretary of labor filed an amicus brief urging us to reverse the district court,and we invited the secretary to participate in oral argument.
discussion 
erisa places great responsibilities upon the fiduciaries of a plan to protect the interests of the plan beneficiaries.see,describing some responsibilities of erisa fiduciaries.correspondingly,it also gives to fiduciaries a wide array of powers to superintend the operation of the plan.most pertinently for the plaintiffs here,fiduciaries may bring suit in federal court to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of erisa title i or the terms of the plan,or to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of erisa title i or the terms of the plan.a savasta concedes that some actuarial conduct is regulated by erisa,and therefore that its negligence is at least arguably an act or practice which violates the statute 
the core of the dispute here is thus not whether erisa authorizes suit against savasta,but rather whether the remedy the plaintiffs seek falls within such other appropriate equitable relief as they may obtain.the complaint asks for an order directing defendants to reimburse the plaintiffs for the shortfall the pension fund will experience as a result of defendants violation of their duties under erisa.in determining the propriety of a remedy,we must look to the real nature of the relief sought,not its label.see life annuity ins.knudson,d mertens hewitt,d.
section a permits money awards only in very limited circumstances.classic compensatory and punitive damages are never included within other appropriate equitable relief.see lee burkhart,cir.with regard to defendants,we have said that the only conceivable equitable claim for cash money lies under the antique equitable remedy of restitution.strom goldman,sachs,cir citing geller county line auto sales,cir.in order to make out a claim for restitution,a plaintiff must show that the defendant has unjustly received from the plaintiff a benefit,such as a payment,see,at.geller,at,or that the defendant holds funds or property that in good conscience should belong to the plaintiff,see,at.
we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to make out a claim for restitution.the moneys sought by the plaintiffs were never in savasta possession rather,they are simply consequential damages resulting from savasta alleged negligence like the defendants in geller,savasta was never unjustly enriched,and therefore no restitution claim can lie against it.at.
although the district court in its thoughtful decision found that the plaintiffs have no restitution claim,it concluded,in reliance on our opinion in diduck kaszycki sons contractors,cir,that it had the authority to imply a damages remedy under erisa.see gerosa savasta,d.in diduck,at,we considered a claim by participants and beneficiaries in an erisa plan against a,who was alleged to have knowingly participated in a plan fiduciary breach of duty.we acknowledged that erisa does not expressly or even impliedly create a right of action in those circumstances.see id.at.we found,however,that the underlying purposes of erisa would be frustrated in the absence of such liability.see id.at.accordingly,we concluded that there was a need for interstitial lawmaking,and determined that we would recogniz e a federal common law right of action in favor of plan participants against.id.at.
we think,however,that this aspect of diduck has not survived subsequent supreme court determinations.in mertens,the court rejected the central holding of diduck,finding that who knowingly participate in a fiduciary breach can not be liable for ordinary money damages.at.see also mullins pfizer,cir avoiding mertens problem by assuming defendant was a fiduciary.in rejecting several arguments based on erisa general purposes,the court emphasized erisa comprehensiveness,as well as the clear text of the erisa civil remedies provisions,which in combination it argued provided strong evidence that congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly.mertens,at.quoting.mut.life ins.russell,d.twice in its most recent term,the court has repeated its belief that erisa express remedies,as the product of long and careful study and compromise,should remain exclusive.see rush prudential hmo,moran,d,at.we see little room in this framework for,interstitial remedies.
nor are we convinced by the district court efforts to distinguish mertens and.the arguments it offers,although quite thoughtful,are ultimately not in keeping with the supreme court directives.for example,the district court argued that mertens was not controlling because it believed the purposes of exempting from joint and several liability do not apply when the trustees are plaintiffs,not defendants.see gerosa,d at.similarly,the district court responded to by pointing to congress underlying goals in enacting erisa.id.at.is quite explicit,however,that i t is not our job to find reasons for what congress has plainly done.at.that comment,taken in the context of other recent court opinions applying a strong presumption that creation of an express remedy clearly forecloses others,see,alexander sandoval,d,makes evident that we are no longer free to fill in unwritten gaps in erisa civil remedies.accordingly,whatever may be the truth of the district court observation that the diduck approach is sounder than the mertens alternative,gerosa,d at,the supreme court has instructed that it is not for us to decide the best erisa remedial scheme 
in short,our conclusion that the plaintiffs have no claim for restitution means that there is no remedy available under erisa to redress the grievance alleged in their complaint.we must reverse the judgment of the district court on this ground.
the plaintiffs also the district court determination that erisa preempts their claims.in urging us to affirm,savasta asks us to find,in effect,that congress intended completely to immunize actuaries from claims for damages.we disagree,and instead join a chorus of the courts of appeals in ruling that erisa does not preempt professional negligence claims against.again,however,we have occasion to revisit our opinion in diduck,which held to the contrary.
a.the erisa preemption standard 
preemption is fundamentally a question of congressional intent.see state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.naturally,as with any matter of congress intentions,we must begin with the statutory language.see also rush prudential,at.erisa provides that it shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.as the supreme court has recognized,however,erisa nearly limitless relates to language offers no meaningful guidelines to reviewing judges.rush prudential,at.travelers,at.therefore,w e simply must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term,and look instead to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive.id.at.see also egelhoff egelhoff,d cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d cicio does,cir.in conducting that analysis,we begin with the assumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law,travelers,at.citing maryland louisiana,d,a presumption that is particularly strong for state action in fields of traditional state regulation,id.citing hillsborough county automated med,d rice santa fe elevator.
amidst the proliferation of lower court opinions attempting to apply the supreme court still not entirely determinate principles,several clear trends have emerged.the most pertinent for our purposes is a focus on the core erisa entities beneficiaries,participants,administrators,employers,trustees and other fiduciaries,and the plan itself.courts are reluctant to find that congress intended to preempt state laws that do not affect the relationships among these groups.see,leblanc cahill,cir.state carpenters pension trust fund citibank,cir in home health,v.the prudential ins.of,cir morstein ins,cir,cert.denied,d airparts custom benefit servs.of austin,cir perkins time ins,cir.in addition,state laws that would tend to control or supersede central erisa as state laws affecting the determination of eligibility for benefits,amounts of benefits,or means of securing unpaid typically been found to be preempted.see,cicio,at leblanc,at noting that congress intended to preempt state laws providing alternate enforcement mechanisms for employees to obtain erisa plan benefits internal quotations and citation omitted airparts,at howard parisian,cir.
one product of these tendencies has been that courts routinely find that malpractice or negligence claims against plan advisors,such as accountants,attorneys,and consultants,are not preempted.see,leblanc,at.carpenters,at coyne delany selman,cir custer sweeney,cir airparts,at painters of philadelphia dist.council welfare fund price waterhouse,cir harmon city,nielsen senior,utah.the third circuit reasoning in philadelphia painters is typical.observing that state law has traditionally prescribed the standards of professional liability,philadelphia painters,at,the court concluded that such suits merely placed the plaintiff erisa plan in the same position as any other state economic actor,id.at.there was therefore no reason to believe that congress would have wanted to preempt the claim.id.
savasta argues,however,that the relationship between a plan and its actuary is not the same as the routine dealings a plan might have with its lawyer or its landlord.erisa,it claims,sets out a code of behavior for actuaries,which in savasta view is enforceable through a suit by a fiduciary to obtain appropriate equitable relief to enforce any provisions of erisa title i.a.pointing to the supreme court opinion in mcclendon,d,savasta claims that congress decision to provide a remedy,however limited,for actuarial negligence necessarily displaces any regulation of the same conduct.
as in part i,we assume,without deciding,that erisa would give the trustees a claim against savasta nevertheless,we are not convinced that ingersoll controls the outcome of this case.in ingersoll,the supreme court held that erisa preempted a texas wrongful discharge statute that had been construed to extend to employees who were terminated because the employer wished to avoid making plan contributions on their behalf.at.an existing erisa provision,already targeted the same conduct,and was enforceable through.the court thus observed that permitting parallel state actions could expose employers to several different standards simultaneously,thereby transgressing a central erisa goal of protecting the planning interests of contributing employers.id.at.another problem with the texas statute,the court found,was that congress intended a to be the exclusive remedy for rights guaranteed under erisa.id.at.citation omitted.otherwise,t he policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that congress rejected in erisa.id.quoting pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.
in our view ingersoll represents not a categorical rule barring state causes of action that might overlap with erisa,but rather an application of the general principle that preemption depends on whether state remedies are consistent with erisa core purposes.taken alone,the limited language of permits two possible inferences that the remedies listed are the only remedies available under any law,or merely that the remedies listed are an exclusive enumeration of what can be granted under federal law.under the latter reading,obviously,parallel remedies would still be permissible.it was erisa broad preemption language,along with consideration of its larger purpose in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans through reduced planning costs,that supplied the crucial additional inference in ingersoll that no such state claims could be permitted.see ingersoll,at.see also rush prudential,at.explaining ingersoll as based on erisa policy of inducing employers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of liabilities,under uniform standards of primary conduct and uniform remedial orders and awards.however,where there is no comparable statutory objective that would be served by preemption,the erisa text is open to the possibility that alternate state remedies might be available.therefore,the extent to which erisa remedial provisions preempt state law is not necessarily absolute as with any provision,preemption must be considered in light of congress purposes in enacting the statute.
our approach finds common ground with the reasoning of several other courts,as well as the implicit logic of one of our prior holdings.for example,in trustees of the aftra health fund biondi,cir,the seventh circuit distinguished ingersoll and found that,notwithstanding the possibility of equitable relief under erisa,a fraud claim by a plan trustees against a participant was not preempted,because the trustees common law fraud claim does not implicate any of erisa fundamental concerns.similarly,in leblanc,the fourth circuit allowed a fraud claim by a set of trustees against the plan investment advisor to proceed because it found that such claims would not undermine any of erisa objectives.at.this in spite of the fact that the plaintiffs also had a claim under erisa.id.at.an earlier fourth circuit opinion appears to view the existence of an alternative enforcement mechanism as a basis for preemption only or at least most forcefully when it allows an alternate avenue for employees to sue.coyne delany,at.in geller,we likewise permitted the plaintiff fraud claim to stand,regardless of some available equitable remedies under erisa,see at,because the preemption provision should not be read to contravene the statute underlying design,id.at but see rutledge seyfarth,shaw,fairweather geraldson,cir stating that a core factor leading to the conclusion that a state law claim is preempted is that the claim bears on an relationship citing blue cross of cal.anesthesia care assocs.med.group,cir,cert.denied,d smith provident bank,cir when an erisa plan relationship with another entity is not governed by erisa,it is subject to state law.citing.affiliated healthcare,cc.of,cir.carpenters,at.
finally,we think the supreme court discussion of ingersoll in rush prudential,although offered in a slightly different context,is consistent with our approach.the rush prudential court held that an illinois statute providing for independent review of disputes between hmos and physicians was not preempted,even though erisa,too,offered a remedy for complaining beneficiaries.see at.it distinguished ingersoll by pointing out that the illinois law provides no new cause of action under state law and authorizes no new form of alternate relief.id.at.in essence,then,the argument was that ingersoll apparent presumption against additional,remedies did not apply where the result of the alternative state enforcement scheme constituted no more than indirect economic effects on the administration of a plan.id.at.quoting travelers,at.that is,while some alternative remedies interfere with central erisa purposes,and are therefore preempted,others do not,and therefore are not.
however,before moving on to the question of congress intent in this case,we must pause to consider the status of our opinion in diduck kaszycki sons contractors,cir.the question there,again,was whether we would permit damages under a against who knowingly participate in a breach of fiduciary duty.a critical factor in our affirmative answer to that question was our conclusion that,because erisa provided equitable relief in those circumstances,any damages remedy would be preempted.diduck,at.we appear to have based that belief on our observation that erisa broadly preempts state law causes of action that relate to an plan,id.at quoting shaw delta air lines,d,as well as upon a ninth circuit opinion that had reached a similar determination,id.at citing gibson prudential ins.of,cir.thus the diduck rule if applied in this case,might require us to find that the plaintiffs claims are preempted.
our preemption analysis in diduck,however,is no longer consistent with prevailing supreme court precedent.indeed,several of our sister circuits have noted that travelers occasioned a significant change in preemption analysis,and required careful reconsideration of any preexisting precedent dependent on the expansive view of related to that held sway before it.see aftra,at.carpenters,at coyne delany,at cicio,at t he supreme court has thrown cold water on the idea that state regulation of health and safety is necessarily preempted even when it overlaps with rights protected by erisa.quoting pegram herdrich,d.in one case a panel actually reconsidered its initial holding based on the intervening travelers opinion,concluding that in light of the new standard there was no preemption.see.carpenters,at.subsequent supreme court opinions have continued to adhere to the view of preemption outlined in travelers.see,rush prudential,at egelhoff,at.it is true that not all of our opinions necessarily embraced an expansive notion of preemption.in one case,we anticipated travelers,noting that we would not supersede the historic police powers of the states unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.aetna life ins.borges,cir.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,cert.denied,d.at this remove,however,it would be difficult to sort out from diduck considerations the supreme court has disavowed from those that might still be permissible.travelers ins.cuomo,cir rejecting argument based on previous panel opinion because earlier analysis was poisoned by view since discredited by the supreme court,rev sub nom.state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.we also note that the broad view of preemption appearing in diduck is difficult to reconcile with our subsequent and narrower interpretation in geller,at.we therefore conclude that,to the extent that diduck is not distinguishable here,it has,in any event,been superseded.
whether congress intended to preempt the trustees claims 
we now come,at long last,to congress intent.again,we begin with the presumption that congress does not intend to displace state law,especially in traditional areas of state control.travelers,at.regulating the professions,particularly under a rubric of professional malpractice,is a traditional state function.see custer sweeney,cir pappas buck consultants,cir philadelphia painters,at harmon city,at.
erisa principal goal is to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries.b see boggs boggs,d.this is not to say that beneficiaries must necessarily prevail in every dispute.ultimately,as the supreme court has observed,the interests of beneficiaries may be better served by offering prospective participating employers a measure of certainty and shelter from undue administrative and litigation costs.see varity howe,d.thus,the planning interests and administrative burdens of employers and plan administrators are also a significant erisa concern.see travelers,at.noting that t he basic thrust of the clause is to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.
we see relatively little in the central purposes of erisa that would weigh in favor of preempting the plaintiffs claims.savasta echoes the district court in arguing that state resolution of disputes between plans and actuaries will necessarily involve the interpretation and application by various state courts of erisa actuarial standards,and presumably thereby at least complicate employers and administrators planning.first,even assuming that erisa does create any meaningful and enforceable standards for actuarial behavior,those provisions have little to do with the conduct of the plan or its sponsors.see leblanc cahill,cir.there is no danger,for instance,that the plan will be subject to two sets of inconsistent state obligations.id.and,as we have said,erisa does not create a fully insulated legal world for plans they must deal with outsiders,such as landlords or,under the same diverse of state law as any other economic actor.rebaldo cuomo,cir,cert.denied,d see also leblanc,at rejecting preemption argument where the pension fund is simply in the role of an investor allegedly wronged.
savasta argument may be,though,that erisa demands that the core erisa entities must have certainty as to the standards that will bind their actuaries,if not other outside actors.that is,one of erisa express purposes is
