subsequently,joshua,through werber as his next friend,filed a tort claim in the superior court of hall county,georgia,against the driver and received a settlement.the superior court ordered division of the settlement as follows to werber for any claims she might have had as joshua custodial parent as attorney fees to joshua attorney and to be deposited into the hall county probate court account for the benefit of joshua.pursuant to georgia law,the probate court appointed werber as joshua conservator.werber,in her capacity as conservator,took possession of joshua portion of the settlement and deposited it in a trust account at regions bank

ii.discussion 
the administrative committee,as fiduciary of the plan,seeks relief under erisa a,which reads as follows 
a persons empowered to bring a civil action 
a civil action may be brought 
by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan 
a.the supreme court first analyzed this section other appropriate equitable relief language in mertens hewitt associates,d.the mertens court rejected a broad interpretation of the phrase,instead reading equitable relief to include only those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.id.the court further narrowed the definition in life annuity insurance knudson,d,a case with facts similar to those in the case at bar.
in knudson,a woman who had been severely injured in an auto accident received medical benefits from her husband employer health and welfare plan.id.at.at.subsequently,the woman settled a tort claim arising out of the accident,and her portion of the settlement was paid directly into a special needs trust.id.at.at.the insurer of the benefit plan sought full reimbursement from the settlement funds pursuant to a provision in the plan.id.at.at.when the woman refused to pay,the insurer sued her under erisa a to enforce the plan,seeking,inter alia,restitution,which it characterized as a form of equitable relief.id.at.at.the supreme court,however,characterized the insurer claim as legal rather than equitable,noting that not all relief falling under the rubric of restitution is available in equity.id.at.at.
the knudson court explained that whether restitution is legal or equitable in a particular case and hence whether it is authorized by a remains dependent on the nature of the relief sought.id.at.at.for instance,a plaintiff might seek restitution at law in cases in which he could not assert title or right to possession of particular property,but in which nevertheless he might be able to show just grounds for recovering money to pay for some benefit the defendant had received from him.id.at.at quoting dan dobbs,law of remedies ed.such claims,which impose a merely personal liability upon the defendant to pay a sum of money,were viewed essentially as actions at law for breach of contract whether the contract was actual or implied.id.quoting restatement of restitution cmt.a.on the other hand,a plaintiff could seek restitution in equity,ordinarily in the form of a constructive trust or an equitable lien,where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.id.in sum,for restitution to lie in equity,the action generally must seek not to impose personal liability on the defendant,but to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant possession.id.at.at.because the knudson plaintiff sued the injured woman for funds not in her possession the funds resided in the special needs trust,the court characterized the claim as legal,rather than equitable,and therefore unavailable under a.id.at.at.
after knudson,a circuit split developed over whether an erisa benefit plan could ever use a to recover money from beneficiaries that refused to honor subrogation and reimbursement provisions.see sereboff mid atl.med,d discussing the split.on one side of the split,some circuits had held that all such claims are legal in nature because they arise from the breach of a contract to pay money.see,qualchoice,rowland,cir.the supreme court,however,rejected this position and resolved the circuit split in sereboff,a case with facts very similar to knudson and the instant case.in sereboff,like in knudson and here,an erisa plan paid medical benefits to the victim of an accident.sereboff.at.when the subsequently settled a tort claim,the plan sought to recover the medical benefits in accordance with the plan subrogation and reimbursement clause,eventually suing for restitution under erisa a.id.at.the sereboff court acknowledged that the plan alleged breach of contract and sought money,but the court stressed that the plan sought its recovery through a constructive trust or equitable lien on a specifically identified fund,not from the victim assets generally,as would be the case with a contract action at law.id.at emphasis added.unlike in knudson,the disputed funds in sereboff were in the possession of the.id.based on this distinction,the sereboff court held that when a plan seeks restitution from a beneficiary who is in possession of particular,identifiable funds,such a suit sounds in equity and is cognizable under a see id.at.
both knudson and sereboff involved suits where an erisa plan sought restitution directly from a plan beneficiary,and the key distinction,which determined whether the suit qualified as other appropriate equitable relief under a,was whether the possessed
