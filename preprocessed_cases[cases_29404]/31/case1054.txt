on remand from the supreme court,the en banc court vacated the district court judgment in favor of an employer and its benefits plan administrator on claims of breach of fiduciary duty in the selection and retention of certain mutual funds for a benefit plan governed by erisa.
the court of appeals had previously affirmed the district court holding that the plan beneficiaries claims regarding the selection of mutual funds in were under the limit of.the supreme court vacated the court of appeals decision,observing that federal law imposes on fiduciaries an ongoing duty to monitor investments even absent a change in circumstances.
rejecting defendants contention that the beneficiaries waived the argument,the en banc court held that the beneficiaries did not forfeit the argument either in the district court or on appeal.rather,defendants themselves failed to raise the waiver argument in their initial appeal,and thus forfeited this argument.
the en banc court distinguished phillips alaska hotel rest.emps.pension fund,cir,which held that when a fiduciary violated a continuing duty over time,the limitations period set forth in began when the plaintiff had actual knowledge of a breach in a series of discrete but related breaches.the panel held that phillips did not apply to the continuing duty claims at issue under.thus,only a breach or violation,such as a fiduciary failure to conduct its regular review of plan investments,need occur within the statutory period of the initial investment need not be made within the statutory period.
looking to the law of trusts to determine the scope of defendants fiduciary duty to monitor investments,the en banc court held that the duty of prudence required defendants to reevaluate investments periodically and to take into account their power to obtain favorable investment products,particularly when those products were substantially identical other than their lower cost to products they had already selected.
the en banc court vacated the district court decisions concerning the funds added to the erisa plan before and remanded on an open record for trial on the claim that,regardless of whether there was a significant change in circumstances,defendants should have switched from fund shares to fund shares to fulfill their continuing duty to monitor the appropriateness of the trust investments.the en banc court also directed the district court to reevaluate its award of costs and attorneys fees in light of the supreme court decision and the en banc court decision.

after a bench trial,the district court ruled for the beneficiaries on the funds selected within the period,because edison did not offer any credible explanation for why the retail share classes were selected instead of the institutional share classes,and a prudent fiduciary acting in a like capacity would have invested in the institutional share classes.id.at.indeed,the court held that there was no evidence that edison even considered or evaluated the different share classes when the funds were added.id.at emphasis in original.
as to the funds initially selected before the statute of limitations,the district court held that the triggering events proffered by the beneficiaries for two of the funds a name change because of a partial change in ownership of a subadvisor,and a name change related to a ownership change were insufficient to trigger a full diligence review,and that a change in strategy in a third fund from to triggered a review to which edison responded adequately by adding another option.id.at.

plaintiffs successfully petitioned for certiorari,and the supreme court reversed our decision concerning the statute of limitations,holding that regardless of when an investment was initially selected,a fiduciary allegedly imprudent retention of an investment is an event that triggers a new statute of limitations period.tibble iv,at.the court specifically rejected the conclusion that only a significant change in circumstances could engender a new breach of a fiduciary duty.id.at.we were cautioned against applying a statutory bar to a claim of a breach or violation of a fiduciary duty without considering the nature of the fiduciary duty,and told to recognize that under trust law a fiduciary is required to conduct a regular review of its investment with the nature and timing of the review contingent on the circumstances.id.at.the court instructed us to decide the scope of edison fiduciary duty to monitor investments.id.at.
the court also left to us on remand any questions of forfeiture,acknowledging edison contention that the beneficiaries did not raise the claim below that edison committed new breaches of the duty of prudence by failing to monitor their investments and remove imprudent ones absent a significant change in circumstances.id.

ii.forfeiture 
before addressing the statute of limitations and law issues remanded to us by the supreme court,we address edison claims that the issues presently on appeal have been forfeited by the beneficiaries.we conclude that the beneficiaries did not forfeit their argument in either the district court or on appeal.instead,we conclude that edison itself forfeited the forfeiture argument in its initial appeal.
a.there was no forfeiture by the beneficiaries on appeal 
we begin with the appeal.the beneficiaries argued in their opening brief that 
defendants had a continuing duty to ensure that each of the plans investment options was and remained prudent and had reasonable expenses.merely because they allowed an imprudent fund into the plan at one point does not mean defendants could just leave it in the plan forever.within six years prior to the commencement of this action,defendants could have switched the plan out of the retail shares and into the institutional shares of three excluded mutual funds and saved the plan millions in unnecessary fees 
similarly,the beneficiaries argued 
at any time in that period defendants could have switched from retail to institutional class shares.their failure to do so caused the plan to pay unnecessary,retail fees in each of those six years.therefore,the last action which constituted a part of the breach using retail class shares occurred within six years and the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach replacing retail with institutional shares also occurred within six years.
and,the beneficiaries argued that f und fiduciaries were under a continuing obligation to advise the fund to divest itself of unlawful or imprudent investments.citing buccino cont l assurance,supp.
thus,the beneficiaries argued on appeal for an ongoing duty to monitor investments and to remove imprudent investments a duty that was not limited to changed circumstances.the theory was simply that i n light of the continuing duty of prudence imposed on plan fiduciaries by erisa,each failure to exercise prudence constitutes a new breach of duty,that is to say,a new claim squarely embracing the theory accepted by the supreme court.see tibble iv,at.in response,edison argued for a duty that was limited to changed circumstances plan fiduciaries do have a continuing duty under erisa to monitor investment options for changed circumstances rendering a investment now imprudent,but plaintiffs here allege no changed circumstances.the tibble iii panel accepted edison limiting theory,but the supreme court rejected it.the claim was not forfeited on appeal.
b.there was no forfeiture by the beneficiaries in the district court 
nor did the beneficiaries forfeit their claim in the district court.edison briefing stated 
the court expressly held in its first summary judgment ruling that plaintiffs could not revisit the prudence of selecting mutual funds that became part of the plan investment lineup more than six years prior to the filing of the complaint.by challenging the prudence of maintaining retail share classes of the three name change funds,plaintiffs have done what the court has forbidden,by attempting to resurrect claims that were properly held barred by the statute of limitations.
emphasis added and citation omitted.given this contemporaneous statement that any claim challenging the prudence of maintaining retail share classes first selected before the limitations period had been rejected on summary judgment,it is hard to see how edison can now argue that the beneficiaries forfeited the argument by not presenting any evidence establishing that a prudent fiduciary would have identified the alleged issue during regular,periodic reviews.
simply put,the district court held at summary judgment that because the initial decision to add retail mutual funds was made outside of the limitations period,the prudence claims arising out of these decisions are barred by the statute of limitations.tibble i,supp.at.and,the district court stated in its trial decision three funds were added to the plan before the statute of limitations period thus,plaintiffs challenged the failure to switch to an institutional share class upon the occurrence of certain significant events within the limitations period.tibble ii,dist.lexis at emphasis added.the district court used the causal thus to describe why plaintiffs relied on a significant changes theory because prudence claims arising out of the initial selection were outside the statute of limitations,and barred by the summary judgment order absent changed circumstances.
edison also pointed to the district court questioning of the beneficiaries expert,steven pomerantz,who attempted to identify changed circumstances that would have triggered a duty to switch the share class,such that the claim would not be barred by the district court statute of limitations ruling.in conversation with pomerantz,the district court said that it did not understand the connection between a name change of a fund and whether edison should have switched to institutional class shares,and asked whether edison should have removed the funds even without a name change.the court asked w ould you contend that during the relevant time period due diligence would have required the plan to nevertheless buy an institutional share class,all things being equal,assuming the institutional share class had a lower fee pomerantz mostly stuck to his significant changes theory in response.edison argued that this exchange showed that the district court did not forbid a claim indeed,according to edison,the district court invited pomerantz to make a claim,but he refused to agree,sticking to the significant changes theory.
it is certainly possible that the district court had forgotten a portion of its voluminous summary judgment ruling,and was at that time open to a theory imposing a continuing duty in the absence of changed circumstances.or it could be,as the beneficiaries suggest,that the district court was checking to see whether the theory pomerantz was articulating was in substance the same as the theory the district court had excluded.it does not matter which interpretation is correct,because neither shows forfeiture.whatever the intent behind the district court hypothetical questions to an expert,they did not constitute a change in its earlier ruling sufficient to put the beneficiaries on notice that they could then,contrary to the court earlier ruling,put on evidence to prove their preferred continuing duty theory.
finally,edison emphasizes that the district court allowed the beneficiaries to put on a continuing duty case concerning a different investment,the money market fund.see tibble ii,dist.lexis at.it is true that the claims have much in common,and it is not clear why the district court provided a distinct treatment of the money market fund.perhaps it was because edison continued to negotiate the rate for the fund throughout the period at issue,while edison employed a set it and forget it approach with the mutual funds.whatever the reason,that the district court allowed a similar claim as to the money market fund simply does not show that,contrary to both
