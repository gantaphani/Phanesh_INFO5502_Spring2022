in this interlocutory appeal we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion in certifying,under.b,a class consisting of as many as participants and beneficiaries of hundreds of group health plans.the plaintiffs seek a refund of their calendar year deductibles from their common claims administrator,blue cross and blue shield of alabama blue cross.they claim that because the summary plan descriptions spds issued by blue cross in connection with their respective plans stated that there was no calendar year deductible,blue cross violated the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,by imposing the deductibles.the complaint asserts a claim to enforce the plaintiffs rights under their plans that claim arises under erisa a b,a b.it also asserts breach of fiduciary duty claims arising under erisa a and a,a,a.
we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in certifying under rule b the plaintiffs erisa a b and a claims because in order to prevail each plaintiff must prove reliance on the spd,thereby making final injunctive or declaratory relief inappropriate for the class as a whole.we also conclude that the district court abused its discretion by failing to address separately the plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claim under a seeking relief for their respective plans.accordingly,we will vacate the district court class certification order and remand the case for further proceedings.
in robert heffner began working as a division claims manager at consolidated insurance management corporation in mobile,alabama.shortly thereafter,he and his family enrolled in a group health care plan sponsored by funding plus of america,made available through his employment with consolidated.the heffners coverage under the funding plus plan began april.
the funding plus plan is an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa,see a,as well as a group health plan,see id.a.it also may be referred to as an employee benefit plan or as,simply,a plan.see id.all employee benefit plans must be established,maintained,and administered in accordance with the provisions of erisa.see id.a.erisa has two central goals protection of the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans and uniformity in the administration of employee benefit plans horton reliance standard life ins,cir citations omitted.
during all time periods relevant to this case,blue cross underwrote and administered the funding plus plan in which the heffners were enrolled.that plan gave blue cross complete discretion to interpret and administer the provisions of the plan and provided that blue cross administrative functions include paying claims,determining medical necessity,in addition to underwriting plans such as the funding plus plan,blue cross serves as administrator for plans in which the employer or plan sponsor is responsible for paying claims.as the party that controls administration of the plan,blue cross is t he proper party defendant in an action concerning erisa benefits.see garren john hancock mut.life.ins,cir.
to the extent that it has discretionary authority or control over a plan,blue cross is a fiduciary under erisa.see a i,iii firestone tire and rubber bruch,d see cotton.mut.life.ins,cir.as a fiduciary,blue cross must administer each plan for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan a a i,d.
under erisa,each plan participant or beneficiary must be provided a summary plan description spd within days of enrollment.b a.spds must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.id.a.they must contain certain information about the administration of the plan and a participant rights under it.id.b.additionally,spds for group health care plans such as the funding plus plan are required to include information concerning,premiums,deductibles,coinsurance,and copayment amounts,limitations on benefits,the plan coverage,rules governing the plan network,and conditions or limitations on obtaining care or benefits under the plan.see j.
upon enrolling in the funding plus plan,heffner received a copy of the funding plus spd,which was prepared by blue cross specifically for that plan in june.blue cross used standardized templates to generate each plan spd,varying the language according to the specific requirements of the plan.blue cross issued new spds for the funding plus plan in august and june to reflect amendments made to the plan.
both the august and june spds also incorporated language that blue cross contends was a scrivener error and which is the root of this lawsuit.specifically,those spds indicated that no deductible was required for certain medical services obtained from a participating provider organization ppo.for example,the june spd provided under the heading ppo in the prescription drugs section that coverage of brand name drugs was when purchased at a participating pharmacy,subject to the calendar year deductible.that provision was set out in the spd in a table like this one 
the june spd,in the general provisions section,also provided that the calendar year for services obtained from a ppo was,in fact,no deductible.that provision of the spd was set out in table form like this 
read together,these two provisions indicate that the plan covered eighty percent of the cost of brand name drugs purchased at a participating pharmacy subject to a calendar year deductible of nothing.other provisions that could be read this way included those involving durable medical equipment,ambulance service,chiropractic services,and outpatient psychiatric services for some plan participants.
heffner interpreted the june spd provisions as imposing no calendar year deductible for prescription drugs and was not pleased when blue cross imposed one after discussing the matter with members of the human resources department where he worked,heffner contacted blue cross three times from september to march.he demanded that blue cross reimburse him for the improperly withheld deductibles.blue cross responded that there was a deductible requirement for all drug benefits under the funding plus plan and advised heffner that he could request arbitration if he wished to dispute its interpretation.
arbitration was never begun.instead,heffner filed suit against blue cross in the middle district of alabama in july.heffner sought to represent a class of plaintiffs to whom blue cross issued spds containing language identical or similar to the no deductible language in the funding plus spd and against whom blue cross had imposed deductibles.heffner asserted two counts against blue cross on behalf of the class and sought various forms of relief which we will describe in more detail later.
during class issues discovery,blue cross produced evidence that it used spd templates containing the no deductible language from april through september,two months after this lawsuit was filed,and that spds containing that language may have been sent to plan participants and beneficiaries as late as october.by its own estimate,blue cross stated that during that time,the language may have found its way into spds for approximately employee benefit plans,including plans underwritten and administered by blue cross and plans these plans covered potentially individuals.
the district court certified the class action in august.the court adopted heffner proposed class definition all participants and beneficiaries in medical benefit plans for which blue cross served as claims administrator.order at.class membership was limited to participants and beneficiaries in blue plans whose spd contained the term no deductible under ppo in a matrix identical or similar to the general provisions table shown earlier and who had a calendar year deductible imposed upon them by blue cross for various services id.at.the court modified heffner class definition to include the stipulation that heffner only represents those participants and beneficiaries whose spds contain language defining the summary plan description as the plan.id.at.the court also reserved the right to create a subclass,modify the class definition,or otherwise specially treat the class members subject to arbitration at a later juncture.id.at.
the court found that all four rule a,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of satisfied.id.at.the court concluded that the class was most appropriately certified under rule b.id.at.certification of a class action under that provision is proper only if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.b.
the district court determined that blue cross had acted on grounds generally applicable to the class by uniformly appl ying deductibles to ppo services despite plan language indicating that no deductible was required.order at.the court also determined that the relief sought a declaration of rights,injunctive and equitable relief,disgorgement,interest and lost earnings,and be appropriate for all class members if heffner succeeded on the merits.id.at.the court rejected blue cross contention that the plaintiffs sought predominantly monetary relief,finding instead that the character of the relief was still injunctive.id.at.in a footnote,the court indicated that certification under rule b a b along with rule b would also be appropriate id.at.

we will begin our analysis of the class certification issue with an assessment of the plaintiffs claims in light of the carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme created by erisa a,a.see mertens hewitt,d.this approach is appropriate because of the comprehensive and reticulated nature of erisa,id.at,ct at quoting nachman pension benefit guar,d,and the significant supreme court caselaw,discussed in relevant detail below,describing the nature of relief available under the various provisions of erisa a.
in conducting our analysis,we are mindful that while a court should not determine the merits of a claim at the class certification stage,it is appropriate to consider the merits of the case to the degree necessary to determine whether the requirements of rule will be satisfied.valley drug geneva,cir see also telfair first union mortgage,cir it was within the court discretion to consider the merits of the claims before their amenability to class certification.citations omitted.
the plaintiffs first claim seeks to enforce their rights under their respective plans where the spds produced by blue cross stated that the calendar year deductible was no deductible.the plaintiffs seek two remedies with this claim a declaration that blue cross was required to determine claims under these plans without the calculation or assessment of a calendar year deductible and injunctive and equitable relief requiring blue cross to and remove all deductibles which were assessed or imposed in contravention of the no deductible language of the spds.complaint at.
erisa a b states that a plan participant or beneficiary may bring suit to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.the supreme court has explained that there are three distinct remedies available to a participant or beneficiary under a b an action to recover accrued benefits,to obtain a declaratory judgment that she is entitled to benefits under the provisions of the plan contract,and to enjoin the plan administrator from improperly refusing to pay benefits in the future.mut.life ins.russell,d see also jones am.life and accident ins,cir.
we construe plaintiffs first claim as arising under a b because the nature of the claim and the remedies sought with it fall within the scope of relief authorized by that erisa provision.one wrinkle,of course,is that a b speaks about benefits,not deductibles,and the first claim is about deductibles or the lack of them.unlike most erisa cases where the plaintiff seeks an order requiring the plan to provide a more traditional benefit such as covering a health care cost at all,the plaintiffs here seek to remedy the imposition of a deductible which they contend is contrary to their plans.this difference does not affect our conclusion that the claim falls under a b,however,because that erisa provision specifically authorizes an action to enforce rights under the terms of the plan and the deductible provision at issue in this case is a plan term.a statement that there will be no deductible is a right under the plan.
not only that,but the existence and amount of a plan deductible directly affects the value of benefits offered under the plan.all other things being equal,imposing a deductible decreases the value of the plan benefits,and the value of those benefits varies inversely with the amount of the deductible.viewed in these real economic terms,not having to pay a deductible is a benefit of a plan.an action to recover overstated deductibles,to enforce a no deductible provision of a plan,or to enjoin the imposition of deductibles that are not authorized by the plan is just as properly brought under erisa a b as is an action to recover a benefit,to enforce a benefit provision,or to enjoin the nonpayment of benefits.see forsyth humana,cir affirming summary judgment for plaintiffs seeking recovery of portion of copayment under erisa a b magliulo metro.life ins,holding that a lower insurance premium is a benefit of an insurance plan because the benefit due from plaintiff insurance plan is to receive health coverage for a certain price.
plaintiffs second pleaded claim seeks relief for blue cross breach of its fiduciary duties.as part of this claim,the plaintiffs allege that blue cross improperly favored itself at the expense of its participants and beneficiaries by imposing the deductibles in contravention of the spd language.complaint at.with this claim the plaintiffs seek appropriate equitable relief,including disgorgement of blue cross profits from its improper administration of calendar year deductibles,restitution of the amounts overpaid to the providers by the participants and beneficiaries,and unspecified other relief requiring blue cross to remedy its wrongs id.at.
erisa a imposes personal liability on fiduciaries for breaching their fiduciary duties.a.erisa a authorizes a plan participant or beneficiary to seek appropriate relief to enforce.id.a.the supreme court has explicitly stated that the relief available under can only be obtained on behalf of the plan itself.russell,at.at.
in certain circumstances,however,relief to individual plan members or beneficiaries for a breach of fiduciary duty may be available under erisa a.varity howe,d.that provision allows a plan participant or beneficiary to bring suit a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter of erisa or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter of erisa or the terms of the plan.erisa a,a.in its varity decision the supreme court explained that a is a kind of catchall provision that act s as a safety net,offering appropriate equitable relief for injuries caused by violations that does not elsewhere adequately remedy.at.at.w here congress elsewhere provided adequate relief in erisa for a beneficiary injury,there will likely be no need for further equitable relief,in which case such relief normally would not be appropriate.id.at.at.
we construe plaintiffs second claim seeking individualized relief for blue cross breach of fiduciary duties as arising under erisa a.the plaintiffs allege that blue cross breached its fiduciary duties under erisa a,a,by imposing calendar year deductibles where the spds stated that no deductible was necessary.the plaintiffs also seek relief on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries,rather than on behalf of the plans themselves.as we have already explained,individualized relief for a fiduciary breach of its duties is available under a it is not available under a.
we note that as part of their second claim the plaintiffs also allege that blue cross employee bonus program created conflicts of interest between its employees and plan participants and may have caused its employees to engage in prohibited transactions,in violation of erisa b,b.complaint at.erisa b prohibits a fiduciary from receiv ing any consideration for his own personal account from any party dealing with such plan in connection with a transaction involving the assets of the plan.b.this is part of the fiduciary duties erisa imposes,and the breach of those duties triggers erisa a imposition of personal liability on the fiduciary.id.a.as we have said,erisa a authorizes a plan participant or beneficiary to bring an action to enforce,id.a,but relief can be obtained only on behalf of the plan.russell,at.at.accordingly,to the extent that the plaintiffs second claim seeks relief for the plans themselves,that claim arises under erisa a.
without addressing the plaintiffs erisa claims separately,the district court certified this class action under rule b.certification under that rule is proper where the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class and final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole is appropriate.b.
at first blush,plaintiffs claims to recover their deductibles and to obtain other equitable relief seem to fit neatly into the rule b paradigm.the plaintiffs have alleged that the no deductible language made its way into the spds of hundreds of blue plans covering as many as individuals.blue cross has more or less admitted that this is true,although it has not said exactly how many spds contained the language or how many plans actually gave their participants the spds with that language.blue cross does not deny imposing calendar year deductibles on all plan participants without regard to the language of the spds.accordingly,blue cross has acted on grounds generally applicable to the class.
the plaintiffs have also requested relief that is appropriately awarded in rule b class actions.they seek both a declaration that blue cross should not have imposed the calendar year deductibles and an injunction requiring blue cross to and remove the deductibles.they also seek other equitable relief including disgorgement of blue cross profits from the deductibles it imposed and restitution of the amounts overpaid by them,monetary relief which they claim would flow directly from the other declaratory and injunctive relief.that relief might not preclude certification under rule b,although it likely would be a close call.see murray auslander,cir monetary relief may be obtained in a rule b class action so long as the predominant relief sought is injunctive or declaratory.citing allison citgo petroleum,cir.
based on just this analysis,we would leave the class certification order undisturbed.however,we have to go further because reliance is a critical element of the plaintiffs case,and it renders certification under rule b inappropriate.this court has repeatedly held that in order to prevent an employer from enforcing the terms of a plan that are inconsistent with those of the plan summary,a beneficiary must prove reliance on the summary.branch bernd,cir holding that a mandatory minimum cobra election period specified in the employer plan controlled where the employee did not rely on the election period as provided in the spd accord liberty life assurance of boston kennedy,cir quoting branch but holding that reliance was not at issue because there was no conflict between the plan and the spd collins am.cast iron pipe,cir quoting branch and holding that plaintiff was bound by plan language because he did not read the spd.see also buce allianz life ins,cir carnes,concurring in the result explaining that when a plan and its summary description conflict,and the employee or beneficiary demonstrates the requisite reliance,the terms of that description determine her eligibility for benefits mcknight so.life and health ins,cir finding that in the event of a conflict,the terms of the spd should prevail over the plan because otherwise u nfairness will flow to the employee for reasonably relying on the summary booklet.
the district court,in discussing rule a,considered the reliance problem but reasoned that it was not an obstacle to class certification 
heffner recovery of benefits claim does not rest on a theory of inconsistent plan documents,plan terms,or ambiguities.instead,heffner argues that the language in his and plans regarding deductibles for ppo services was unambiguous and that blue cross failed to adhere to this clear language.in other words,the instant case is an action to enforce the plan provisions as written and for plaintiff to succeed on this claim,individual participant interpretation and reliance does not necessarily need to be proven.
order at.this reasoning is flawed.it ignores blue cross position,which is not refuted by the plaintiffs,that formal erisa plan documents other than the spds show that none of the plans insured or administered by blue cross provided coverage.if that position is correct,under our branch decision,each plaintiff would have to prove reliance on his spd no deductible term in order to prevent blue cross from enforcing a calendar year deductible provision contained in other plan documents.see at.
the district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the spd and the plan are one and the same.that much is clear from the district court amendment of the proposed class definition,limiting it to only those participants and beneficiaries whose spds contain language defining the summary plan description as the plan.order at.an examination of several erisa sections,however,reveals that the summary plan description is not the sum total of an erisa plan.for instance,erisa a,which requires that a plan administrator provide each plan participant and beneficiary with a summary plan description of any employee benefit plan,indicates that an spd is derived from an employee benefit plan,not that it is the plan.a.moreover,erisa b mandates that each plan must provide information about the plan financial and administrative procedures,including procedures for amending the plan however,erisa b,which sets forth specific spd requirements,does not require that spds contain any information about plan amendment procedures.compare b with b.
other erisa provisions also show that the spd is not the only erisa plan document that counts.for example,erisa a,which sets forth fiduciary duties,mandates that an erisa fiduciary must administer any plan in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan id.a d emphasis added.erisa b requires the plan administrator to make the bargaining agreement,trust agreement,contract,or other instruments under which the plan was established or is operated available to plan participants and beneficiaries.id.b.these provisions clearly contemplate that there are documents other than the spd which control the operation of the plan.
in short,the spd does not necessarily contain all of the information about a plan,and the plan is governed by documents other than the spd.as the term summary plan description suggests,the spd is a document that describes,in summary fashion,the relevant features of an
