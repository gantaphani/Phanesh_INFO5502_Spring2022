before the court is liberty life assurance company of boston petition for rehearing en banc of our opinion in doyle liberty life assurance of boston,cir.about the time liberty life filed this petition,the supreme court of the united states granted certiorari in a case from the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit involving an issue we admonished our court,in our previous opinion,to consider en banc.see glenn metro.life ins,cir,cert.granted,d.we postponed ruling on the petition pending the supreme court decision.on june,the court issued its decision in metro.life ins.glenn,d.
we construe liberty life petition for rehearing en banc to include a petition for panel rehearing,see cir,and grant the petition for panel rehearing.we withdraw our previous opinion and substitute the following opinion in its place 
the issue in this case is whether the district court correctly decided that the administrator of an disability plan did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award disability benefits to a plan participant.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the administrator because the court applied a proper standard of review and because the administrator did not abuse its discretion in denying benefits to the plan participant.
background 
the plaintiff,robin doyle,began working for choicepoint services on february,as a registered information line specialist.choicepoint sponsored for its eligible employees a disability ltd benefit plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of,et.the defendant,liberty life assurance company of boston,insured the plan pursuant to a group policy,and administered the plan.
on january,doyle filed a claim with choicepoint for disability benefits under the plan,claiming that an anal fissure,enlarged internal hemorrhoids,and external anal skin tags prevented her from working.on february,she underwent a fissurotomy and sphincterotomy in an attempt to alleviate these problems.liberty life granted doyle disability std benefits through the maximum date available,may.
while doyle was receiving std benefits,liberty life obtained her medical records to determine whether she would qualify for ltd benefits,for which she had applied,after her std benefits expired.after receiving medical records from six of doyle treating physicians,liberty life retained an independent physician to review her records.liberty life notified doyle that she would not receive ltd benefits because she was still able to perform the duties of her own occupation.doyle would qualify for ltd benefits for the initial months only if she were unable to perform the duties of her own occupation.thereafter,she would qualify for ltd benefits only if unable to perform the duties of any occupation.specifically,the policy provided 
for persons other than pilots,and crewmembers of an aircraft 
if the covered person is eligible for the month own occupation benefit,disability or disabled means that during the elimination period and the next months of disability the covered person,as a result of injury or sickness,is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his own occupation and 
thereafter,the covered person is unable to perform,with reasonable continuity,the material and substantial duties of any occupation.
after liberty life denied her claim for ltd benefits,doyle visited a rheumatologist who diagnosed her with fibromyalgia.in light of this new diagnosis,doyle appealed the denial of her claim.liberty life reviewed her additional medical records and received further peer review from a specialist in internal medicine.liberty life upheld its decision denying doyle benefits,stating that she could still perform the duties of her own occupation,and so did not qualify for ltd benefits under the policy.
invoking erisa jurisdiction,a b,e,doyle filed this action against liberty life seeking judicial review of its decision.liberty life filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted.doyle appeals.
ii.erisa framework and the district court proceeding 
erisa does not set out standards under which district courts must review an administrator decision to deny benefits.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.in order to fill this void,the supreme court held in firestone that district courts should review de novo benefit decisions made by an administrator who is without discretion to determine eligibility or construe the terms of an plan.id.at.at.on the other hand,the court said that where the administrator exercises discretion,deferential,arbitrary and review is appropriate according to trust principles,which guide review of decisions affecting plans.id.at.at.finally,the court observed that when an administrator with discretion operates under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a facto r in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.id.at.at quoting restatement second of trusts cmt.d.
following firestone,we undertook the task of develop ing a coherent method for integrating factors such as into the legal standard for reviewing benefits determinations.brown blue cross blue shield of,cir.in brown,we reasoned that trust principles mandated that some deferential level of review applies to benefits decisions,id.at,but refused to apply highly deferential review when the administrator operated under a conflict of interest,id.at.we settled on what came to be known as the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard hereinafter the heightened standard,the hallmark of which is its requirement.under this standard,the burden shifts to the fiduciary to prove that its interpretation of plan provisions committed to its discretion was not tainted by.id.at.we said that an administrator plan interpretation that advances the conflicting interest of the fiduciary at the expense of the affected beneficiary was arbitrary and capricious,unless the administrator justifies the interpretation on the ground of its benefit to the class of all participants and beneficiaries.id.at.
our more recent cases condense the holdings of firestone and brown into a six step analysis to guide district courts in reviewing an administrator benefits decision 
apply the de novo standard to determine whether the claim administrator decision is wrong,the court disagrees with the administrator decision if it is not,then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.
if the administrator decision in fact is de novo wrong,then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims if not,end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.
if the administrator decision is de novo wrong and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims,then determine whether reasonable grounds supported it hence,review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.
if no reasonable grounds exist,then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator decision if reasonable grounds do exist,then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.
if there is no conflict,then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.
if there is a conflict of interest,then apply heightened arbitrary and capricious review to the decision to affirm or deny it.
williams bellsouth,cir summarizing analysis set forth in hca health servs.of,employers health ins,cir footnotes omitted.
the district court began its discussion in this case by noting that choicepoint plan vested liberty life with discretion in making claims decisions step.the court next found that genuine issues of material fact precluded a determination of whether liberty life decision was right or wrong so,for purposes of summary judgment,the court assumed that liberty life decision was wrong step.next,the court recited the measures taken by liberty life in reviewing doyle claim for benefits and concluded that liberty life denial of her claim was reasonable step.
finally,the court found that liberty life operated under a conflict of interest since it was responsible for both determining eligibility and paying benefits under the plan step.but,instead of applying the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard,as required under step,it applied a modified heightened arbitrary and capricious standard.the court modified the heightened standard in the following way instead of requiring liberty life to prove that its decision was not influenced by the the heightened standard court reviewed the record and concluded that there does not appear to be any evidence that liberty in any way manipulated or improperly influenced doyle ltd benefits process in order to achieve a financially beneficial result.at.the court said that given the lack of any indication to the contrary,liberty would have reached the same conclusion in this case even if it had not been operating under a conflict of interest.id.
the court offered two justifications for not applying the heightened standard.first,the court thought that the question of whether the heightened standard applied to an administrator factual determinations remains open in this circuit,although it acknowledged that the heightened standard applies in plan interpretation cases.id.second,the court reasoned that a modified standard was more in line with firestone and principles of trust law than was our heightened standard.id.at.
iii.issues on appeal and standard of review 
doyle initially raised two arguments on appeal.first,she argued that the district court erred in finding that liberty life decision was reasonable.second,she argued that the district court erred in applying a modified,rather than heightened,standard of review.
after the supreme court decided glenn,we ordered doyle and liberty life to brief the impact of glenn on this petition for rehearing while doyle now concedes that,the heightened standard of review is inappropriate,she does argue that the district court did not place as much weight on the conflict of interest in this case as glenn requires.
liberty life responds that the district court did not err in finding that its decision was reasonable,even if,as the court assumed,its decision was wrong.liberty life agrees that,the heightened standard of review is inappropriate and that the district court use of a modified standard was correct.while liberty life admits that a conflict existed,it argues that glenn does not compel the district court to give greater weight to the conflict than it did.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same legal standards that governed the district court decision.williams,at.
iv.discussion 
reasonableness finding 
doyle argues that the district court erred in finding that liberty life denial of her claim for disability benefits was reasonable.specifically,she argues that it was unreasonable for liberty life not to consider her subjective claims of pain and suffering,which she argues are substantiated by her fibromyalgia diagnosis.
liberty life considered doyle medical records and employed the services of two independent physicians to review those records.it concluded that she was still able to perform the duties of her own occupation,and so did not satisfy the prerequisite for obtaining ltd benefits under the choicepoint policy.we conclude that it was not unreasonable for liberty life to disregard doyle complaints of intangible pain and suffering.under choicepoint policy,a plan beneficiary must provide proof that she is disabled in order to obtain ltd benefits.the policy defines proof as including chart notes,lab findings,test results,other forms of objective medical evidence in support of a claim for benefits.at emphasis added.therefore,it was reasonable for liberty life to rely only on objective medical evidence supporting doyle claim,evidence which liberty life reviewing physicians found lacking.see,at statement of liberty life reviewing physician,silver,that doyle complaints are unsubstantiated by objective clinical orthopedic findings at statement of liberty life reviewing physician,truchelut,that doyle subjective reports are disproportionate to the physical,radiological,laboratory,and neurodiagnostic records.
after reviewing the record,we find no error in the district court determination that liberty life decision was reasonable.we express no opinion on whether it was right or wrong.
standard of review in the district court 
doyle initial argument was that the district court erred in applying a modified,rather than heightened,standard of review.but,in light of glenn,both doyle and liberty life agree that an application of the heightened standard of review would have been inappropriate.we agree that the district court did not err in refusing to apply the heightened standard.
doyle now argues,however,that the same facts which led the glenn court to give greater weight to the existence of a conflict in that case are also present in this case.accordingly,doyle argues that under glenn,the district court should have placed greater weight on the existence of a conflict than it did.
in glenn,the administrator of sears,roebuck company disability plan,metlife,which also served as the plan insurer,denied ltd benefits to the plaintiff.the plan vested metlife with discretion to determine eligibility and provided that a participant incapable of performing the material duties of any gainful occupation for which she was reasonably qualified was entitled to ltd benefits.at.metlife denied benefits to the plaintiff because she was capable of performing full time sedentary work.id.the plaintiff appealed.
the district court denied relief,but the sixth circuit,applying a deferential standard of review,set aside metlife decision.it treated as a relevant factor metlife conflict arising from its dual role as administrator and insurer.the court considered the conflict,but relied more heavily on other factors,including questionable actions taken by metlife,to conclude that metlife abused its discretion in denying the plaintiff benefits.
the supreme court granted certiorari on two issues whether an entity dual role of administrator and insurer creates a conflict of interest,and if a conflict exists,how to account for that conflict in judicial review of benefits decisions.with respect to the first issue,the court,relying on principles of trust law,held that the dual role does create a conflict of interest.it explained that an entity that determines whether an employee is eligible for benefits and pays benefits out of its own pocket,such as an employer or insurance company,operates under a conflict of interest.at.
the court then turned to the question of how a conflict,once identified,affects judicial review of an administrator decision.the court held that a conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.id.at quoting firestone,at.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court emphasized that the word factor implies,namely,that when judges review the lawfulness of benefit denials,they will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one.id.at.the court approved the sixth circuit treatment of the conflict as a relevant factor,and affirmed its decision because the conflict,along with other factors,showed that metlife decision was arbitrary.id.at.
as we now show,glenn implicitly overrules and conflicts with our precedent requiring courts to review under the heightened standard a conflicted administrator benefits decision.our prior opinion in this case identified three troubling aspects of the heightened standard,doyle,at,two of the glenn court denounced as contrary to firestone.first,our heightened standard conflicts with the adoption in firestone of two standards under which an administrator decision should be reviewed,de novo and abuse of discretion.the heightened standard,which essentially imposes greater than de novo review,is not required by,and more importantly is contrary to,firestone reliance on two standards of review.see chambers family health plan,cir rejecting brown heightened standard as inconsistent with the supreme court dictum in firestone.the glenn court criticized the heightened standard for conflicted administrators,approving firestone reliance on trust law,which still applies a deferential standard of review to the discretionary decisionmaking of a conflicted trustee glenn.at.
