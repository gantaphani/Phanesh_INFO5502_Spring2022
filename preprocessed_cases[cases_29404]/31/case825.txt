as a retired truck driver,anthony militello received pension benefits from the central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund the fund.after learning that militello ran his own trucking company,the fund board of trustees the trustees suspended his benefits and sent him a benefits denial letter.militello sued both the fund and the trustees under the employee retirement income security act erisa for unlawful suspension of benefits.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and militello appeals.
we affirm,finding that the district court appropriately applied an arbitrary and capricious standard of review,the administrative record and denial letter were satisfactory and militello received a full and fair review.we further find that both federal regulations and the plan language allow for suspension of benefits under these circumstances.
background 
anthony militello participated in the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund by virtue of his employment as a truck driver with alco express.after working at alco express for years,he retired on march,at age and promptly applied for pension benefits.militello stated in a letter to the fund that he owned trucks.a letter from alco express also indicated to the fund that militello owned trucks and that he did not have any control over the drivers or the equipment.based on this information,the fund approved militello application and began to pay him benefits on april.
on november,a representative from a local union informed the fund that militello owned and operated a trucking business that employed drivers.the fund sent militello a letter,indicating that it had received information that he was the owner of a trucking company,and requesting his federal income tax returns and information regarding his duties at the company.militello replied that he had no duties or drivers and that he leased his equipment to american motor lines,which hired and paid the drivers.because he did not submit a full copy of his tax returns,the fund once again requested the returns.the fund received the requested tax documents which revealed that in,militello listed his business as trucking,and spent almost in fuel expenses and over for a driver bonus.the fund reemployment committee determined that militello ownership of the trucking business constituted prohibited reemployment and gave militello thirty days to terminate his ownership or face suspension of benefits.
militello appealed the reemployment committee decision to the benefits claim appeals committee bcac which affirmed,stating in part that t he committee made its decision regarding your reemployment because work,in any capacity,requiring the same skills as those used by fund participants while employed by contributing employers in the same metropolitan area in which you work is considered prohibited reemployment.
militello appealed the bcac decision to the trustees and the trustees agreed with the earlier decisions,concluding that militello was engaged in prohibited reemployment and that his retirement benefits would be suspended.the pension processing department sent a letter to militello informing him that he had received of benefits from april through august,and that as a result,the overpayment would be deducted from future benefits.
militello brought suit against the fund and the trustees under erisa,et,for unlawful termination of pension benefits.on for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment for the defendants,holding that the appropriate standard of review of the trustees decision was arbitrary and capricious,the trustees decision to suspend militello benefits was not arbitrary and capricious,and the fund could recoup the in benefits paid.militello appeals these determinations.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
summary judgment is warranted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.fritcher health care serv,cir quoting celotex catrett,d.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in militello favor.id.
we must first address whether the district court applied the correct standard of review to the trustees decision to suspend benefits.the standard of review depends on the amount of discretion that plan documents afford the plan administrator,in this case the trustees see johnson allsteel,cir.a denial of benefits will be reviewed de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire and rubber bruch,d.if the plan confers discretionary authority,then a denial of benefits will be reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.see hess hartford life accident ins,cir.
we have designated the following phrase as safe harbor language that clearly gives the plan administrator broad discretionary power and thus ensures deferential review benefits under this plan will be paid only if the plan administrator decides in his discretion that the applicant is entitled to them.herzberger standard ins,cir.while this language ensures deferential review,that precise wording is not required.see id.noting that the courts have consistently held that there are no magic words determining the scope of judicial review of decisions to deny benefits.
here,central states trust agreement contains numerous references to the trustees broad discretion.for instance,article v states that trustees are vested with discretionary and final authority in making all decisions,including trustee decisions upon claims for benefits by participants and beneficiaries of the pension fund and other claimants,and including trustee decisions construing plan documents of the pension fund,and the plan makes clear that it incorporated the language of the trust agreement.see pension plan,article vii t he board of trustees has authority to control and manage jointly the operation and administration of the pension fund and of this pension plan in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement and of this pension plan and amendments thereof emphasis added.because the trust agreement language confers substantially the same discretion as the safe harbor language discussed above,we find it sufficient to trigger the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.in light of this finding,we need not make an independent determination as to whether the language of the plan itself is sufficient to trigger this standard 
under the arbitrary and capricious standard,an administrator decision will not be overturned if it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome,the decision is based on a reasonable explanation of relevant plan documents,or the administrator has based its decision on a consideration of the relevant factors that encompass important aspects of the problem.hess,at quoting exbom central states,areas health welfare fund,cir see also trombetta cragin fed.bank for sav.employee stock ownership plan,cir absent special circumstances such as fraud or bad faith,the committee decision may not be deemed arbitrary and capricious so long as it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for that decision.additionally,because the standard of review is deferential,we consider only the evidence that was before the administrator when it made its decision.hess,at see perlman swiss bank.comprehensive disability prot.plan,cir.
b.the trustees decision 
the administrative record 
the administrative record upon which the trustees decision was based is a major bone of contention between the parties.the tension is due in part to an affidavit submitted by albert nelson,benefits director for the fund,in support of the summary judgment motion of the fund and the trustees,indicating that the trustees june,meeting minutes contain both an agenda portion consecutively bates stamped and an attachments portion consecutively bates stamped.nelson aff.of.according to nelson,the attachments include the correspondence between the fund and militello,militello federal tax returns,and lease agreements between militello and american motor lines.militello argues that the administrative record should be limited to the agenda portion of the minutes,because the minutes make no reference to the attachments.he views nelson affidavit as an impermissible augmentation of the administrative record,and further contends that because nelson is the benefits director and not a trustee,nelson is not qualified to testify about the record contents.
under the terms of the trust agreement,the trustees are required to make and maintain a record of the actions of the trustees taken at any meeting thereof.article vi,cs.nevertheless,we see no reason why nelson,as benefits director for the fund and a regular attendee of the trustees meetings,would not be qualified to testify to the contents of the administrative record and the nature of the trustees discussion.he has performed this function adequately in the past,see whisman robbins,rev on other grounds,cir,and is specifically referenced in the minutes 
moreover,the minutes suggest that the administrative record consisted of both an agenda section and an attachment section.the agenda section specifically acknowledges receipt of several documents in the background section,including militello tax returns and truck leases additionally,the action portion of the agenda references a letter to militello from william schaefer dated april,attached page.in any event,militello can not have it both ways although he complains that the attachments can not be considered part of the record,he cites to certain attachments namely,the leases to bolster his claim that he was not running a trucking business.therefore,we find no error in the district court determination that the administrative record on appeal consists of both the agenda section and the attachments 
after reviewing the entire record,it is clear that the trustees decision to suspend benefits can not be characterized as arbitrary and capricious.militello listed his business as trucking on his tax returns and also described fuel expenses totaling nearly and a driver bonus exceeding.based on this information which was consistent with the union representative statement that militello was running a trucking business that employed drivers,it was not unreasonable for the trustees to determine that militello was doing more than leasing.
relying on the leases,militello argues that he could not be running a trucking business.the leases state that the lessees shall exercise the degree of control required by the department of transportation dot.according to the dot,lessees shall have exclusive possession,control,and use of the equipment for the duration of the lease,and shall assume complete responsibility for the operation of the equipment for the duration of the lease.c.however,in his briefs,militello did not even attempt to explain how this language squares with his tax returns 
plain language 
next,militello insists that the trustees decision to suspend benefits is contrary to the plain language of the pension plan.specifically,he alleges that nothing in the plan suggests that benefits can be suspended based on ownership of trucks.
we begin by examining the plan language.the plan states that absent special circumstances not relevant here,a pensioner shall have his benefit payments suspended for any calendar month in which he works in prohibited reemployment.pension plan a.prohibited reemployment is defined as 
e mployment in any position,including a managerial or supervisory position and including,but not including government employment,either in the same industry in which the participant or pensioner earned any contributory service credit while covered by the pension fund,or in any other industry if the participant or pensioner is in the same job classification as are other participants then employed by a contributing employer located within the same standard metropolitan statistical area.
pension plan f.
based on this language,we agree with militello that nothing in the plan allows the trustees to bar him from owning trucks if he wants to keep his pension.however,militello benefits were not suspended merely because he owned trucks indeed,the fund was told that he owned and leased trucks when it initially approved his request for benefits.militello funds were suspended because the fund determined that he owned and operated a trucking business employing drivers.it was not contrary to the plan plain language for the trustees to determine that owning a trucking business that employed drivers violated the plan prohibition against managing employees,supervising employees,or engaging in in the trucking industry.
the denial letter 
militello also has numerous procedural complaints.for instance,he alleges that the benefits denial letter issued by the trustees does not satisfy statutory and regulatory requirements.erisa dictates that specific reasons for denial be communicated to the claimant.see e very employee benefit plan shall provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant,and afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim g although the applicable regulations are specific in pronouncing the requirements,strict compliance is not mandated rather,substantial compliance with the regulations is sufficient tolle carroll touch,cir citations omitted.
in this case,the trustees denial letter stated that militello was not eligible to receive pension benefits for any period that he is the owner of anthony militello trucking,and that the trustees made this decision because work,in any capacity,requiring the same skills as those used by fund participants while employed by contributing employers in the same metropolitan area in which you work is considered prohibited reemployment.the letter also indicated that in order to avoid the suspension of benefits,militello must provide documentation verifying that he no longer ha d any ownership in the anthony militello trucking company in the next thirty days.furthermore,it cited the specific plan provision militello had allegedly violated.
the district court properly determined that this letter satisfied statutory and regulatory requirements.the letter indicated,in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant,that the trustees found militello ineligible for pension benefits because his actions as owner of anthony militello trucking constituted prohibited reemployment.although the letter is sparse,the trustees were required to give only specific reasons,not the reasoning behind the reasons.gallo amoco,cir all the plan administrator has to give the applicant is the reason for the denial of benefits he does not have to explain to him why it is a good reason.to require that would turn plan administrators not just into arbitrators,for arbitrators are not usually required to justify their decisions,but into judges,who are.emphasis in original.
full and fair review 
militello argues that his claim was not afforded a full and fair review for three reasons he was denied a step in the appeal process articulated in the plan the trustees applied a interpretation of the plan in rejecting militello claim and the trustees failed to adequately explain their decision.
with respect to militello first contention,we agree that the fund did not follow the plan provisions to the letter.the plan outlines a appeal procedure for the review of any claim that has been denied review by the benefits claim review committee the review committee,review by the bcac,and review by the board of trustees.militello case took a different route.the reemployment committee,which is not mentioned in the plan,initially decided to suspend militello pension benefits.militello was then allowed to appeal to the bcac,and finally to the trustees.thus,militello was only allowed two appeals 
we are troubled by the fund inability to follow its own rules.nevertheless,we have sta
