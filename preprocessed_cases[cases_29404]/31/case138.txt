plaintiffs initially filed the complaint in this case in new york state court,seeking,among other things,to enjoin defendant insurers under oblig.law from obtaining reimbursement of medical benefits from plaintiffs tort settlements.defendants removed this action to the eastern district of new york joseph bianco,district judge,where the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss under rule b for failure to state a claim on the basis that plaintiffs claims were subject to both complete and express preemption under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.
we hold that plaintiffs claims do not satisfy the supreme court test for being subject to complete erisa preemption,which would have conferred federal jurisdiction.see aetna health davila,d.such jurisdiction exists,however,under the class action fairness act cafa,d.we thus reach the merits of the express preemption defense and conclude that oblig.law is saved from express preemption under erisa,as a law that regulates insurance.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings on plaintiffs claims.
background 
the new york statute at issue in this appeal,oblig.law states that a personal injury settlement presumptively does not include any compensation for the cost of health care services or other losses that are obligated to be paid or reimbursed by a benefit provider such as an insurer,and that benefit providers have no right of subrogation or reimbursement against any such settling party.when section was enacted in,it eliminated an asymmetry between jury verdicts and settlements that tended to discourage the settlement of personal injury lawsuits 
in february,plaintiffs meghan wurtz and mindy burnovski filed a class action complaint in new york state court,alleging section violations by the three defendants,which are related companies in the insurance business the rawlings company,llc oxford health plans,and unitedhealth group,according to the complaint,both named plaintiffs had received medical benefit payments from defendants for personal injuries.wurtz also settled her personal injury lawsuit,thereby recovering from the tortfeasor.defendants had asserted liens under plaintiffs insurance plans to recover medical expenses that they had paid to plaintiffs,and wurtz paid a reimbursement sum of to the rawlings company,llc.in filing their action,plaintiffs sought a declaration that based on section defendants did not have a right to seek reimbursement or subrogation of medical benefits against plaintiffs tort settlements,and they also sought damages for unjust enrichment and deceptive business practices under bus.law.
defendants removed this action to the eastern district of new york and then moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim based on erisa preemption.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,holding that plaintiffs claims are superseded under two parallel and independent principles of preemption complete preemption under erisa a,and express preemption under erisa.wurtz rawlings,llc,d.the complete preemption holding permitted plaintiffs claims to be recast as claims under erisa,but the district court concluded that the claims could not successfully proceed under erisa because plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies and because the terms of their plans allow reimbursement.id.at.the district court also held that plaintiffs claims for damages were simply a reassertion of their declaratory judgment claim and were thus also expressly preempted.id.at.plaintiffs timely appealed.
discussion 
we review a district court erisa preemption ruling and b dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo.arditi lighthouse int l,cir.the purpose of erisa is to provide a uniform regulatory regime over employee benefit plans.davila,at.however,because the states are independent sovereigns in our federal system,we have long presumed that congress does not cavalierly causes of action.medtronic,lohr,d.thus,analysis of erisa preemption must start with the presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law.stevenson bank of,cir quoting gerosa savasta,cir.
federal subject matter jurisdiction 
we begin by addressing our special obligation to satisfy ourselves of our own jurisdiction.arnold lucks,cir internal quotation mark omitted quoting bender williamsport area sch,d.the district court held that plaintiffs claims were subject to both complete preemption and express preemption.as explained below,complete preemption can be the basis for federal jurisdiction,but express preemption can not.because we hold below that the district court erred in finding oblig.law to be completely preempted by erisa,we normally would decline to reach the merits of the express preemption defense.in this case,however,there is another basis for federal jurisdiction under cafa,d.
preemption and federal jurisdiction 
express preemption is one of the three familiar forms of ordinary defensive preemption along with conflict and field preemption.sullivan am.airlines,cir.it occurs when congress withdraw s specified powers from the states by enacting a statute containing an express preemption provision.arizona united states,d.as an ordinary defensive preemption claim,express preemption can not support federal jurisdiction because it would not appear on the face of a complaint.see metro.life ins.taylor,d sullivan,at the complaint rule mandates that in assessing jurisdiction,a federal court must disregard allegations that a complaint would not include,allegations about anticipated defenses.
in contrast,under the complete preemption doctrine,which is distinct from the three forms of defensive preemption,a plaintiff state cause of action may be recast as a federal claim for relief,making its removal by the defendant proper on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.vaden discover bank,d alterations in original quoting wright miller,fed.prac.proc.juris.see also metro.life,at extending complete preemption doctrine to the erisa context and stating that complete preemption,unlike ordinary defensive preemption,supports federal jurisdiction.in concluding that a claim is completely preempted,a federal court finds that congress desired not just to provide a federal defense to a state law claim but also to replace the state law claim with a federal law claim and thereby give the defendant the ability to seek adjudication of the claim in federal court.fed.prac.proc.juris.this does not mean simply that congress intended the federal court to adjudicate a state law claim rather,when a claim is completely preempted,the law governing the complaint is exclusively federal.vaden,at see also arditi,at.
thus,in a case such as this,complete preemption may be crucial to the existence of federal jurisdiction.sullivan,at.below,we hold that plaintiffs claims were not completely preempted.thus,in the absence of an alternative basis for jurisdiction,it would be inappropriate to reach the merits of the ordinary express preemption defense.see id.at because it follows from our holding of no complete preemption that the district court lacked jurisdiction over this case,we have no occasion to consider the merits of defendant argument that the plaintiffs claims are subject to ordinary preemption.
class action fairness act 
in this case,defendants have asserted an alternative basis to justify removal to federal court.under cafa,federal courts have jurisdiction over a class action filed under.or a similar state statute or rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action to be brought by or more representative persons as a class action if the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs and the parties are minimally diverse.d.cafa does not apply when the number of members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate is less than.id.d b.
we generally evaluate jurisdictional facts,such as the amount in controversy,on the basis of the pleadings,viewed at the time when defendant files the notice of removal.with this in mind,a court must assess the three prerequisites for cafa jurisdiction no fewer than members of the plaintiff class,minimal diversity,and million in controversy.blockbuster,galeno,cir internal citation omitted.the defendant bears the burden of establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction by showing that there is a reasonable probability that each of the jurisdictional prerequisites is satisfied.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
defendants have satisfied this burden.plaintiffs filed this action as a class action under article of the new york civil practice law and rules.with regard to the number of class members,the complaint states that p laintiffs reasonably believe that there are hundreds of members in the proposed class.with regard to minimal diversity,the complaint states that the named plaintiffs are residents of arkansas and new york but makes no declaration as to citizenship.as defendants state in their notice of removal,however,e ven if both were citizens of new york,minimal diversity exists since unitedhealth is both incorporated and has its principal place of business in minnesota.see blockbuster,at i t seems plain to us that defendant is able to meet its burden of showing there is a reasonable probability that at least one of these class members is a citizen of new york and thus is a citizen of a state different from defendant.quoting d a.finally,with regard to the requirement of million in controversy,the complaint states that defendants have collect ed hundreds of millions of dollars in fully insured health insurance liens that they were not entitled to enforce or collect following the enactment of gol.in their notice of removal,defendants confirm that d efendant rawlings has handled subrogation and reimbursement claims totaling more than million with respect to new york insureds covered by fully insured plans since the adoption of gol.
cafa also contains express exceptions to jurisdiction.for example,federal jurisdiction would not exist here if over of the proposed plaintiffs were citizens of new york at least one defendant from whom significant relief is sought was a citizen of new york principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct were incurred in new york and during the year period preceding the filing of that class action,no other class action has been filed asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same or other persons.d.the second circuit has declined to reach the issue of who bears the burden with regard to cafa exceptions.see blockbuster,at.here,plaintiffs have not claimed that any cafa exceptions apply or contested cafa jurisdiction at all,so as in blockbuster,these exceptions are not before us,and therefore we need not comment further.id.
because cafa supplies a basis for federal jurisdiction,we reach defendants express preemption defense in addition to their complete preemption argument.we discuss both forms of preemption below.
ii.express preemption 
erisa expressly preempts any state law that relate s to any employee benefit plan,but not if that law regulates insurance.erisa a b,a b.it is undisputed that oblig.law relate s to erisa plans,but we conclude that it is saved from express preemption as a law that regulates insurance.a law regulates insurance under this savings clause if it is specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance,and substantially affect s the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.kentucky ass of health plans,miller,d.
the district court holding that oblig.law does not fall within this savings clause is contrary to the supreme court decision in fmc holliday,d.fmc concerned a pennsylvania antisubrogation statute similar in relevant respects to the one at issue here,and the supreme court stated that t here is no dispute that the pennsylvania law falls within erisa insurance saving clause and that such laws are saved from express preemption.id.at emphasis added.
here,the district court concluded that section is not specifically directed at insurance because it regulates not only insurers but also all other benefit provider s,including employer plans.wurtz,d at.but the antisubrogation statute at issue in fmc was also broadly addressed to a ny program,group contract or other arrangement for benefit payments,not just insurance companies.at.indeed,the specific issue in fmc related to the law application to a plan nonetheless,the supreme court recognized that the law does not merely have an impact on the insurance industry it is aimed at it.id.at.
the district court also concluded that section does not substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured because the law only applies to a subset of benefit providers,specifically,those without a statutory right of reimbursement and who do not intervene in underlying third party actions in which the third party settles.wurtz,d at.but the test is not whether the law substantially affects the whole insurance market the test is whether the law substantially affects how risk is shared when it applies.for example,even though only a subset of insureds suffer from mental illness,the supreme court has held that a law requiring minimum mental health care benefits regulates insurance and is thus saved from preemption.metro.life ins.massachusetts,d.section requires that insurers bear the risk of medical expenses whether or not the insured settles or goes to trial,and it thus substantially affects risk pooling between insurers and insureds.
because oblig.law is specifically directed toward insurers and substantially affects risk pooling between insurers and insureds,we conclude that it is saved from express preemption under erisa as a law that regulates insurance.
iii.complete preemption 
the district court held that plaintiffs claims are completely preempted under erisa a b,a b,which allows an erisa participant to bring an action to receive or to clarify his plan benefits.in davila,at,the supreme court established a test for determining whether a claim is completely preempted by a b.as we have explained,
under davila,claims are completely preempted by erisa if they are brought i by an individual who at some point in time,could have brought his claim under erisa a b,and ii under circumstances in which there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant actions.
montefiore med.ctr.teamsters local,cir footnote omitted quoting davila,at.state law claims are completely preempted only if both parts of this test are satisfied.id.in this case,plaintiffs claims under oblig.law satisfy neither part of the davila test.
davila part one 
in montefiore,we expressly disaggregate ed the first prong of davila first,we consider whether the plaintiff is the type of party that can bring a claim pursuant to a b and second,we consider whether the actual claim that the plaintiff asserts can be construed as a colorable claim for benefits pursuant to a b.montefiore,at.in this case,it is undisputed that the plaintiffs are the type of party that can bring a claim pursuant to a b.the only issue under the first part of the davila test is thus whether plaintiffs claims to prevent defendants from asserting subrogation claims against plaintiffs tort recoveries in settlement can be construed as colorable claims for benefits under a b.we conclude that they can not.
erisa a b allows a plaintiff to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.the claims in plaintiffs complaint seek to do none of these things.plaintiffs do not contend that they have a right to keep their tort settlements under the terms of their plan s rather,they contend that they have a right to keep their tort settlements under oblig.law.they also do not seek to enforce or clarify their rights under the terms of their plan s because the state right they seek to enforce to be free from subrogation is not provided by their plans.indeed,the terms of plaintiffs erisa plans are irrelevant to their claims.plaintiffs claims are thus unlike the claims for benefits that were held completely preempted in davila,for which
