the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,provides that assets of an erisa plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.c.as an exception to this general rule,the statute permits the return of an employer plan contribution that was the result of a mistake of fact or law,but only after the plan administrator determines that the contribution was made by such a mistake.id.c a ii.here,the district court ordered return of certain allegedly mistaken employer contributions even though the plan administrator determined that the contributions were not made by mistake.because we find that the administrator decision was not an abuse of discretion,we must reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
teamsters local union local is a labor organization representing workers in various industries in parts of maryland,delaware,and virginia.local is currently party to collective bargaining agreements cbas with approximately employers,including appellee foodservice usf.pursuant to its cba with local,usf makes contributions on behalf of its employees to appellant truck drivers and helpers local union health and welfare fund the health fund,an erisa multiemployer welfare benefit plan.since,usf or its predecessor companies have been party to various cbas with local.each cba has required usf to contribute a certain amount to the health fund based on the number of hours worked by usf employees.
the health fund was established in and is governed by a board of trustees pursuant to a trust agreement.local has also established an associated pension fund the pension fund.as permitted by erisa,the trustees of both funds have designated a administrator,benefits administration corporation bac,to oversee their operations.bac serves at the pleasure of the trustees,who are ultimately responsible for any decisions made on behalf of the funds.section of the health fund trust agreement contemplates the possibility of mistaken employer contributions and provides bac and the trustees with the following directive in no event shall any employer,directly or indirectly,receive any refund on contributions made by them to the trust except in case of a mistake,to the extent permitted by law.
at issue in this appeal are contributions made pursuant to article,section of usf cba with local,which states 
the company,as of date,agrees to pay into the fund,amount for each straight time hour or fraction thereof paid to each employee covered by this agreement or by subsequent collective bargaining agreements between the parties hereto up to but not in excess of fifty straight time hours in any one work week in the case of each employee.
similar language has appeared in every cba between usf and local since the two parties entered into their first cba in.only the effective date and dollar amount to be paid have changed.it is undisputed that from at least through early,usf consistently paid the specified contribution amount for each hour worked up to fifty hours per week per employee,even though each employee through fiftieth hours were generally paid at an overtime rate.
in march,following the replacement of a payroll clerk,usf discovered that it may have been contributing more to the funds than was required by the governing cba.usf subsequently completed an internal audit and concluded that it had mistakenly contributed too much to both the health fund and the pension fund for the period from january through march.as relevant to this appeal,usf determined that it had made contributions to the health fund for hours paid at the overtime rate even though usf believed the governing cba only required contributions for hours paid at the rate.usf halted the allegedly mistaken contributions in march and has not resumed those contributions to date.
on september,usf notified the funds of the alleged overpayments and requested a refund of the relevant amounts.with respect to the contributions in dispute here,usf argued that it made payments to the health fund for hours paid at the overtime rate even though the governing cba required contributions only for each straight time hour or fraction thereof.usf interpreted straight time hour to include only hours paid at the rate,not hours paid at the overtime rate.
on january,the funds,acting through counsel,responded to usf and formally determined that no overpayments were made,and that usf has correctly paid employee benefit contributions for its employees in accordance with the cba to which it is signatory.the straight time modifier,the funds stated,indicates that contributions for each employee first fifty hours of work each week are owed at the applicable contribution rate and not at any premium contribution rate regardless of the rate of pay earned by the company employee for the particular hour.the funds further explained 
to interpret the cba as limiting contributions to the health fund for hours worked by employees to forty hours per week because foodservice was paying its employees time and one half for hours in excess of forty per week is contrary to the terms of the cba which requires contributions on up to fifty hours per week.
the funds thus declined to return any of the requested contributions.
on february,usf filed suit in the district of maryland against,inter alia,the health fund and the pension fund,seeking recovery of allegedly mistaken contributions for the period from january through march.usf brought its claims under both erisa section and the federal common law of unjust enrichment.the main issue in dispute was whether contributions for overtime hours were required by the cba.
the district court granted usf motion for summary judgment and denied the funds.the court held that the cba language is clear and unambiguous straight time is time that does not include overtime or premiums.therefore,as written in the cba,straight time modifies the word hour such that contributions are required only for the straight time hours the employee is paid,and not for overtime hours.id.the district court rejected the funds alternative construction as untenable and declined to consider extrinsic evidence because it found the cba language to be unambiguous.
usf moved for summary judgment on the amount of restitution and proffered evidence indicating that the health fund owed it for mistaken payments during the period from january,through march.the district court again granted usf motion for summary judgment,setting the restitution figure at.the court entered final judgment in the case,and the health fund timely noted this appeal.
erisa is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans,shaw delta airlines,d,and it provides a clear framework for our analysis in this case.we thus begin with a discussion of how the statute treats the circumstances under which an employer may obtain a refund of mistaken plan contributions.
as discussed above,erisa section c,also known as the provision,chao malkani,cir,provides that the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.c.congress intended for the provision to establish uniform fiduciary standards to prevent transactions which dissipate or endanger plan assets.cong.rec.the supreme court has emphasized that section c was crafted to discourage abuses such as,imprudent investment,and misappropriation of plan assets,by employers and others.raymond yates,p.profit sharing plan hendon,d.in short,section c exists to protect plan assets and ensure that they benefit the participating employees for whom,after all,the plans were established.
but the provision does not transform every erisa plan into a lockbox from which mistaken contributions may never be sprung free.section c provides that if a contribu
