opinion of the court 
at issue is whether erisa preempts pennsylvania bad faith statute for insurance claims,through express or conflict preemption.the district court denied defendant.b motion moving for dismissal of plaintiff bad faith claim based on erisa preemption.barber unum life ins.of,filed.because we hold.is conflict preempted by erisa,or alternatively expressly preempted under erisa a,we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss barber bad faith claim.
this matter involves a dispute over disability benefits provided to plaintiff james barber by his employer under an employee benefit plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of,as amended.benefits under the plan were insured under a group disability policy barber employer obtained from defendant unum life insurance company of america.
after barber became disabled,he applied for and received disability benefits.but unum subsequently terminated the benefits after determining barber was no longer disabled under the policy terms.barber brought suit for breach of contract and for bad faith,requesting punitive damages under.for unum alleged bad faith in denying benefits 
unum moved under.b to dismiss the bad faith claim,citing erisa preemption.unum contends conflict preemption applies because.remedial scheme conflicts with congress intent in enacting erisa exclusive civil enforcement provision in a,a.a allows an participant to recover benefits,to obtain a declaratory judgment that he is entitled to benefits,and to enjoin an improper refusal to pay benefits.a.unum contends erisa preempts.because it is a separate enforcement scheme with a punitive damages provision that adds to the detailed provisions of erisa remedial mechanism.
citing express erisa preemption,unum also contends.falls outside the protective ambit of erisa saving clause.erisa a,the express preemption clause,broadly provides that e xcept as provided in subsection b of this section,the provisions of this title shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.in apparent tension,however,and reflecting its concern with limiting states rights to regulate insurance,banking,or securities,congress drafted a saving clause,erisa b a,that provides except as provided in subparagraph b,nothing in this title shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.b a barber responds that,the bad faith statute,regulates insurance and accordingly falls within the saving clause parameters.

conflict preemption 
under the doctrine of conflict preemption,a state law may be preempted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law,english,d,that is,where it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.hines davidowitz.unum contends conflict preemption applies because.is a separate enforcement scheme that enlarges the remedies otherwise available under the detailed civil enforcement provision of erisa a.
until the supreme court recent decision in aetna health davila,d,the debate over erisa conflict preemption centered on two supreme court life,d,and rush prudential,d.in pilot life,an insurance company terminated an injured employee disability plan.at.the employee brought a common law tort and contract action asserting improper processing of a benefits claim.id.the court found the saving clause did not save the bad faith claim because it did not regulate insurance.id.at.but stating it was obliged to consider the role of the saving clause in erisa as a whole,the court noted an understanding of the saving clause must be informed by the legislative intent concerning erisa civil enforcement provisions,which,the court said,were intended to be exclusive.id.at.in ruling that punitive damages in a bad faith cause of action constituted an additional remedy,the court explained 
the provisions of erisa set forth a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme that represents a careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans.the policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that congress rejected in erisa.
id.at.the court stated the six carefully integrated civil enforcement provisions found in a of the erisa statute as finally enacted provide strong evidence that congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly.id.quoting.mutual life ins.russell,d emphasis in original.accordingly,the court found the state claims permitting punitive damages were preempted by erisa.id.at.
the supreme court revisited conflict preemption in rush prudential,d,narrowly reaffirming the applicability of conflict preemption in the erisa context.the court recognized a limited exception from the savings clause for alternative causes of action and alternative remedies,describing this exception as pilot life s categorical preemption.id.at.the court noted 
although we have yet to encounter a forced choice between the congressional policies of exclusively federal remedies and the reservation of the business of insurance to the states,we have anticipated such a conflict,with the state insurance regulation losing out if it allows plan participants to obtain remedies that congress rejected in erisa.
id.at.quoting pilot life,at.citation and internal quotations omitted.the court explained the civil remedies provided in erisa a are an interlocking,interrelated,and interdependent remedial scheme,id.at.quoting.mutual,at,that represent s a careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans.id.at.quoting pilot life,at.erisa a civil enforcement provisions are the sort of overpowering federal policy that is so strong it even overrides a statutory provision designed to save state law from being preempted.id.at.
the parties here have focused on whether the supreme court treatment of conflict preemption in pilot life and rush prudential is dicta,noting rosenbaum ii found it to be dicta that was unpersuasive.rosenbaum ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at whatever the outcome of that debate,it is no longer material because in aetna health,d the court confirmed that state laws that supplement erisa civil enforcement scheme conflict with congress intent to make the erisa remedy exclusive.id.at.
in aetna health,the court held the plaintiffs claims under the texas healthcare liability act,which imposed a duty of ordinary care in the handling of coverage decisions,were completely preempted by erisa and therefore removable to federal court.id.at.noting that erisa integrated enforcement mechanism,erisa a,is essential to accomplish congress purpose of creating a comprehensive statute for the regulation of employee benefit plans,the court held any cause of action that duplicates,supplements,or supplants the erisa civil enforcement remedy conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the erisa remedy exclusive and is therefore.id.at citing pilot life,at.the court explained congress intent to make the erisa civil enforcement mechanism exclusive would be undermined if state causes of action that supplement the erisa a remedies were permitted,even if the elements of the state cause of action did not precisely duplicate the elements of an erisa claim.id.at.in short,aetna health confirms that conflict preemption applies to any state cause of action that provides an alternative remedy to those provided by the erisa civil enforcement mechanism because such a cause of action conflicts with congress clear intent to make the erisa mechanism exclusive.id.at.
reading pilot life,rush prudential,and aetna health together,a state statute is preempted by erisa if it provides a form of ultimate relief in a judicial forum that added to the judicial remedies provided by erisa,rush prudential,at,or stated another way,if it duplicates,supplements,or supplants the erisa civil enforcement remedy.aetna health,at.at citing pilot life,at.is such a statute because it is a state remedy that allows an participant to recover punitive damages for bad faith conduct by insurers,supplementing the scope of relief granted by erisa.accordingly.is subject to conflict preemption.
express preemption and the saving clause 
the saving clause effect on conflict preemption 
barber contends.is a law that regulates insurance,and therefore,under erisa b a,his bad faith claim is saved from preemption,including conflict preemption.he notes congress could have qualified b a saving clause by limiting its applicability if state law remedies conflict with or add to erisa remedies,but it did not do so.
in aetna health,d,the supreme court found a similar argument unavailing,holding that the presence of erisa saving clause does not disrupt the normal conflict preemption analysis 
erisa b a must be interpreted in light of the congressional intent to create an exclusive federal remedy in erisa a.under ordinary principles of conflict,then,even a state law that can arguably be characterized as regulating insurance will be if it provides a separate vehicle to assert a claim for benefits outside of,or in addition to,erisa remedial scheme.
id.at citing pilot life,d,the court noted congress policy choices reflected in erisa exclusive remedial provision would be undermined by state laws allowing alternate remedies,and concluded that pilot life s reasoning applies here with full force.aetna health,at.at.for those reasons,even if.were found to regulate insurance under the saving clause,it would still be preempted because the punitive damages remedy supplements erisa exclusive remedial scheme.
express preemption 
in the alternative,we believe the district court erred in finding.regulates insurance under the saving clause.accordingly,express preemption under erisa a would apply.as stated,in miller,d,the supreme court set forth a test which clarified that a statute regulates insurance and satisfies the saving clause only if it is specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance and substantially affect s the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.id.at.
for the first prong of the.is specifically directed towards entities engaged in insurance,at.at the inquiry must be answered in the affirmative.is entitled actions on insurance policies,and its first sentence limits the provision scope to insurers in an action arising under an insurance policy,if the court finds that the insurer has acted in bad faith toward the insured id.emphasis added.moreover,the remedies offered under.are awarded or assessed against the insurer.id.
unum responds that.fails this prong because it regulates the insurer conduct rather than the underlying insurance by creating remedies for certain types of insurer conduct.we believe miller forecloses this argument.in miller,the supreme court considered kentucky any willing provider law which regulated insurers conduct with regard to providers.at.the court explained erisa savings clause is not concerned with how to characterize conduct undertaken by private actors,but with how to characterize state laws in regard to what they regulate.id.the court provided the following analogy 
suppose a state law required all licensed attorneys to participate in hours of continuing legal education cle each year.this statute regulates the practice of though sitting through hours of cle classes does not constitute the practice of the state has conditioned the right to practice law on certain requirements,which substantially affect the product delivered by lawyers to their clients.
id.at.the court concluded the any willing provider law similarly regulates insurance by imposing conditions on the right to engage in the business of insurance.id.at.this case presents a similar situation in which pennsylvania bad faith statute regulates insurers conduct by imposing conditions on the insurance business.accordingly,the first prong of the miller test is satisfied.
under the second prong,however.does not substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and insured.miller,at.in miller,the court explained the any willing provider statute under review,the law in metropolitan life,d,the rule in unum life,d,and the independent review provision in rush prudential,d,alter the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds and therefore substantially affect the type of risk pooling arrangements that insurers may offer.at.in comparison,the bad faith statute here is remedial in is a remedy to which the insured may turn when injured by the bad faith of an insurer.see kidneigh unum life ins.of,cir b ad faith claims,whether common law or statutory,merely provide an additional remedy for policyholders.does not affect the kinds of bargains insurers and insureds may make.it provides that whatever the bargain struck,if the insurer acts in bad faith,the insured may recover punitive damages.pilot life,at.holding the common law of bad faith does not define the terms of the relationship between the insurer and the insured it declares only that,whatever terms have been agreed upon in the insurance contract,a breach of that contract may in certain circumstances allow the policyholder to obtain punitive damages.
moreover,claims for bad faith insurance breaches bear no relation to the risk risk of loss the insurer agrees to bear on behalf of the insured.within the insurance industry,risk means the risk of occurrence of injury or loss for which the insurer contractually agrees to compensate the insured.with risk pooling,a number of risks are accepted,some of which involve losses,and the losses are spread over all the risks so as to enable the insurer to accept each risk at a slight fraction of the possible liability upon it.union labor life ins.pireno,d internal quotations omitted hollaway unum life ins.of,explaining that risk pooling groups those with greater and lesser risks together to better account and minimize the unpredictable risk for everyone and results in spreading the costs of risk of loss for which an insurer must pay across the span of insureds.here,the risk pooled,in this case the risk of disability,is reflected in the policy itself.the tort of bad faith breach of an insurance contract is not ordinarily a risk identified in the insurance policy as a risk of loss the insurer agrees to bear for its insured.
our conclusion is buttressed by pireno,d in pireno,a plaintiff brought suit,alleging antitrust violations by a peer review committee used to assess whether chiropractors fees were reasonable.id.at.the court found the use of the peer review played no part in the spreading and underwriting of insurance risk 
plaintiff argument contains the unspoken premise that the transfer of risk from an insured to his insurer actually takes place not when the contract between those parties is completed,but rather only when the insured claim is settled.this premise is contrary to the fundamental principle of insurance that the insurance policy defines the scope of risk assumed by the insurer from the insured.
id.at.emphasis added.here,the transfer of risk occurred when barber entered into the insurance contract,not when his claim was settled.the scope of the risk pooled is defined by the pol
