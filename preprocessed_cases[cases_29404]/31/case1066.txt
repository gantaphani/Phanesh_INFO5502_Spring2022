edison international is a holding company which includes southern california edison company and other energy interests collectively edison.as an,edison offers a k savings plan plan to its workforce.that plan is a fund,meaning that the value of any employee retirement benefits is limited to his or her own individual investment account.participants invest a part of their wages combined with a company contribution in the investment options they choose from the plan menu.ultimately,the value of those individual investments is determined by the market performance of employee and employer contributions,less expenses such as management or administrative fees.as of,the plan held roughly billion in assets for the benefit of approximately participants.
the plan investment menu originally contained six options.in response to a study and negotiations with unions representing some of the workforce,edison expanded the plan dramatically in.particularly relevant here,edison added three mutual funds.these funds were generally available to the public and had higher administrative fees than other alternatives available only to institutional investors.edison added three more mutual funds to the plan after.
on august,glenn tibble and other current and former beneficiaries sued edison pursuant to a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,which allows a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary to bring an action for breach of fiduciary duty.a.among other claims,beneficiaries asserted that edison violated its fiduciary duties under erisa by selecting mutual funds when cheaper,funds were available.edison moved for summary judgment,asserting that the beneficiaries claims regarding the three mutual funds added to the plan in were barred by section of erisa,which states that no action for fiduciary breach can be commenced six years after the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation.the district court agreed,granting partial summary judgment and observing that these mutual funds were added to the plan more than six years before beneficiaries lawsuit.tibble edison int l,d.in so holding,the district court reasoned that t here is no continuing violation theory to claims subject to erisa statute of limitations.id.at quoting phillips alaska hotel rest.emps.pension fund,cir.
following partial summary judgment,beneficiaries proceeded to trial on whether edison violated its fiduciary duty by selecting the mutual funds added to the plan in.during trial,however,the district court also allowed beneficiaries to allege a violation of the duty of prudence relating to the added mutual funds on the theory that significant events within the limitations period should have triggered a review of these funds.to support this theory,beneficiaries offered testimony from their expert,steven pomerantz.pomerantz pointed out that two of the funds added in had undergone a name change and another had changed from a growth fund to a growth fund.pomerantz asserted that these changes were significant enough that edison should have conducted a full due diligence review.
during trial,beneficiaries also asserted that edison violated its duty of prudence by keeping a certain money market fund in the plan that allegedly charged excessive management fees.although edison initially added the money market fund more than six years before litigation commenced,the beneficiaries claimed that edison violated its fiduciary duty within the relevant time period by failing to monitor the fund fees and switch to one with lower fees.the district court allowed beneficiaries to proceed on this claim,notwithstanding its ruling related to the added mutual funds.
ultimately,the district court ruled in favor of edison on almost all of beneficiaries claims.with respect to the mutual funds added in,the district court concluded that the changes identified by beneficiaries within the limitations period were insufficient to justify a full due diligence review.the district court also ruled in favor of edison with respect to the money market fund,concluding that edison did in fact monitor this fund within the relevant time period and that its decision to maintain the money market fund was not imprudent.
following judgment in the district court,beneficiaries appealed to this court of appeals.they argued that the district court erred in concluding that erisa limitation barred their claim that edison breached its fiduciary duty by adding mutual funds to the plan in.they did not contest the district court conclusion that no significant events occurred within the relevant period that would have triggered a due diligence review.rather,they contended that under section of erisa,the limitation incorporates the continuing violation doctrine.in response,edison acknowledged that it had an ongoing duty to ensure that each of the plan investment options remained prudent.but edison pointed out that the beneficiaries were not alleging acts that constituted a violation within the period,but instead arguing their lawsuit should be deemed timely because of the continuing effects of decisions made previously,in.
we sided with edison,holding that the act of designating an investment for inclusion starts the period for claims asserting imprudence in the design of the plan menu.tibble edison int l,cir.we declined beneficiaries invitation to equitably engraft onto,or discern from the text of section a continuing violation theory.id.we reasoned that c haracterizing the mere continued offering of a plan option,without more,as a subsequent breach would render erisa time limitation meaningless and could make fiduciaries liable for decisions.id.at.we also concluded that the district court was correct in allowing beneficiaries to assert evidence of changed circumstances engendering a new breach,but noted that it found that no such circumstances were present.id.
following our decision,beneficiaries successfully petitioned for certiorari to the supreme court.there,they asserted that their case was unlike those in which the plaintiff bases a claim on an unlawful act that occurred prior to the limitations period but that has continuing effects during that period.instead,they argued that the alleged breach underlying their claims was edison failures prudently to review and remove shares within the limitations period incidentally,an argument which was not raised before us.edison responded by arguing that beneficiaries had asserted no such claim before the trial court even though they were perfectly free to do so.accordingly,edison argued the petition should be dismissed as improvidently granted.
the supreme court disagreed with our simple conclusion that erisa time limitation applied and vacated our decision.see tibble edison int l,d.according to the court,we erred by applying a statutory bar to a claim of a breach or violation of a fiduciary duty without considering the nature of the fiduciary duty.id.at.the court emphasized that under trust law,a fiduciary normally has a continuing duty of some kind to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones.id.at.correspondingly,the court reasoned that a claim for breaching such duty is timely under erisa so long as the alleged breach of the continuing duty to monitor occurred within six years of suit.id.at.the court acknowledged that beneficiaries may have forfeited their claim that edison committed new breaches of the duty of prudence by failing to monitor their investments.id
