although our decisions in kurz philadelphia,cir,and its predecessors gluck unisys,cir,and int l union of,salaried,mach.and furniture workers,murata erie,cir,were addressed by the district court,the standard prescribed for the analysis of the erisa statute of limitations bar was not employed in accordance with these precedents.subsequent to the district court summary judgment ruling in favor of new england,montrose med.grp.participating sav.plan bulger,cir,was filed,clarifying the standard we discuss infra.

for our purposes here,we have detailed only those facts that bear on our current disposition.
a.the plan 
on december,roush executed the new england age based contribution plus profit sharing plan adoption agreement,which was designed by new england and constituted an amendment and restatement of roush existing profit sharing plan.roush then adopted the new england age based contribution plus profit sharing plan the plan.new england issued a group annuity policy policy on march,which it designed to pay the benefits under the plan.the policy provided that new england would maintain a general account and various separate accounts in which it would invest funds received from roush,according to roush employees designations.funds in the general account earned a fixed rate of interest determined by new england.the general account funds were unaffected by market movements,whereas funds deposited in the separate accounts received earnings based on market movements and thus had the potential for much higher returns to plan participants.on may,roush transferred plan assets in the amount of to new england for allocation into these separate accounts.
b.the investment delay 
during the period of may to september,roush made numerous requests to new england for a complete accounting of the funds transferred to new england and the return on those funds.in september and later in november,new england provided accountings to roush but did not furnish information as to the specific principal amounts transferred into each fund,nor the return on such funds for each participant.roush informed new england,several times,that the account allocation and balances were incorrect and demanded that adjustments be made,and that correct accountings be provided.
new england december,letter 
on december,stephen chiumenti,an attorney employed by new england,wrote a letter to roush admitting new england failure to invest properly roush funds.among other matters,chiumenti represented that 
we want to confirm that the instructions that we received dated may,continue to be valid directions.if so,we will implement them immediately without prejudice to your rights regarding the intervening delay.
subsequently,most of the plan funds in the general account were transferred to the separate accounts on december,except for approximately which,contrary to roush instructions,apparently remained in new england general account.in a july,letter to roush,chiumenti wrote that new england wished to put roush in the same place he would have been put,as i t is our intention,as expressed in my prior letter and every communication we have had,to adjust your plan accounts to reflect the instructions as you believe they should have been implemented.
settlement discussions 
on july,roush demanded by letter to chiumenti that funds be increased to account for the loss of interest from the investment delay,that an accurate and complete accounting be provided,and that all funds be transferred out of new england without a surrender charge in an august,letter,however,chiumenti stated that new england would not waive the surrender charge nor make any adjustment for the lost interest should roush decide to transfer the funds.he also wrote that new england would adjust the balance to reflect dividends from the investment delay,in the amount of,only if roush executed a settlement agreement and release or rolled over the funds into a new policy.based on an independent audit,roush claimed that new england owed roush at least.
roush filed a complaint against new england in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania on march.roush alleged erisa and state law claims regarding mismanagement of assets under an employee pension benefit plan.after new england filed a motion to dismiss roush state law claims based on erisa preemption,roush filed an amended complaint on june.roush asserted,in count i,breaches of fiduciary duty under erisa from the investment delay failing to provide a complete accounting failing to credit accounts according to roush instructions failing to provide administrative services and failing to return the plan funds with the returns generated by the funds.the amended complaint also asserted,in an alternative count ii,various prohibited transactions under erisa.complaint.
roush moved for partial summary judgment on liability on june.new england moved for summary judgment on july.on october,the district court denied roush motion and granted new england motion.roush filed a timely notice of appeal on november,seeking reversal of the district court judgment.
as we have earlier noted,this case presents the issue of when the three year limitations period in erisa,which is triggered by the plaintiff having actual knowledge of a breach or violation under erisa,begins.
the applicable statute of limitations for breach of fiduciary duty under erisa is found in.it provides 
no action may be commenced under this subchapter with respect to a fiduciary breach of any responsibility,duty,or obligation under this part,or with respect to a violation of this part,after the earlier of 
six years after a the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation,or b in the case of an omission,the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation,or 
three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation 
except that in the case of fraud or concealment,such action may be commenced not later than six years after the date of discovery of such breach or violation.emphasis supplied.
because the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense and because new england is the movant for summary judgment,the burden of proof that the statute of limitations bars roush action rests on new england.thus,to prevail in its summary judgment motion,new england had to prove that roush had actual knowledge of the breach more than three years before his action was filed on march,which would be before march.we have interpreted actual knowledge in the context of as requiring not only actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to the fiduciary violation but also as requiring actual knowledge that those facts support a cause of action under erisa.m
