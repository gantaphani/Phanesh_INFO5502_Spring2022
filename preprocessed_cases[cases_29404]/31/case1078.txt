james tapley and michael chapman appeal a judgment of the district court upholding the interpretation of plan language by the trustees of their pension plan.the trustees determined that appellants respective jobs as a traffic flagger and snow plow operator fell into the same job classification as their former union jobs as skilled mechanics.on that basis,each appellant was precluded from working his job if he wanted to collect retirement benefits.tapley and chapman brought suit against the trustees under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,alleging that the trustees interpretation of plan language was an abuse of discretion.the district court affirmed the trustees decisions.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse.
background 
the relevant facts are largely undisputed.appellants james tapley tapley and michael chapman chapman spent the bulk of their careers working as skilled mechanics and members of the international union of operating engineers the union in alaska.tapley worked as a heavy duty mechanic,station mechanic,fabricator,and welder from approximately to.chapman worked as a service oiler,mechanic,fabricator,and welder from approximately to.their respective employers made contributions to locals and of the international union of operating engineers employers construction industry retirement plan the plan,a,collectively bargained pension plan as defined by erisa,a.
the plan permits participants to take early retirement if they have attained age and completed ten or more years of credited service.the plan also permits early and retirees to work while receiving retirement income as long as they completely refrain from post retirement service of or more hours during any calendar month.section of the plan defines post retirement service as all employment that is 
a within the geographic area covered by the plan which for purposes of this section shall consist of all of the state of alaska and the state of washington 
b in a job classification in which the participant was employed while in covered employment,whether or not such employment is under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or written contribution agreement or in a supervisory capacity over such job classification and 
c in the industry in which the individual employers participate any business activity of the type engaged in by the individual employers maintaining the plan.
if a retiree works the proscribed number of hours in post retirement service,retirement benefits are temporarily suspended.
the plan does not define the term job classification or otherwise clarify what would be suitable employment.this obvious ambiguity in plan language is the focus of this appeal.tapley and chapman each found jobs with the state of alaska department of transportation dot that they believed would allow them to continue working without sacrificing retirement income.but in both cases,the trustees found that appellants dot jobs were in the same job classification as their union positions hereinafter covered employment and were therefore post retirement service.
james tapley 
tapley applied to retire early,at age,after more than years in covered employment as a heavy duty mechanic.at the time of his application for retirement in july,he was working for the state of alaska as a light duty mechanic a transition to cars and trucks from his covered employment focus on heavy duty machinery.after an administrative hearing,the trustees denied his request for early retirement benefits.as a result,tapley abandoned mechanic work entirely and commenced early retirement on august.
a few months later,tapley was offered a temporary job with the state of alaska as a traffic flagger work he described as holding a sign and directing traffic.he sought a determination from the trustees as to whether the flagger position was considered post retirement service under the plan,but passed up the job when his request went unanswered for several weeks.
when another flagger opportunity arose in april,tapley accepted the position and began working for fewer than hours per month while he awaited the trustees approval.in late april,the trust administration office informed him that the flagger job was also considered post retirement service because it is in the industry.once again,tapley discontinued work and appealed the trustees decision.
the trustees held a hearing on august.tapley was represented in person,by counsel,and testified telephonically.following the appeal,the trustees issued a written decision explaining their finding that tapley dot job is in the same job classification as his covered employment.
michael chapman 
chapman took a different approach to early retirement.rather than requesting the trustees approval,he transitioned to his dot job as a snow plow operator and worked for more than six years in that capacity before applying for early retirement benefits in december,at age.the job description chapman provided listed duties such as snow and ice removal responsibility for highway safety equipment,signs,guardrails,drainage,and traffic control clearing debris and brush and patching potholes.
on february,the trust administration office informed chapman that the snow plow operator job was post retirement service.chapman conceded that the jobs were in the same geography and industry,but appealed the trustees determination that the jobs were in the same job classification.the trustees held a hearing on march,and issued a written decision on april,reaffirming their original determination.
c.the trustees interpretation 
although tapley and chapman appeals were based on different underlying facts and decided separately,the trustees employed essentially the same investigative and interpretive processes to reach the same outcome.because the plan did not define the term job classification,the trustees acknowledged their independent obligation to determine its meaning and application.in both cases,the trustees declined to adopt a particular definition.instead,they offered two explanations for why tapley and chapman dot jobs fell within the same job classification as their past covered employment.
the trustees first interpretation looked to the master labor agreement,the union employment contract.although flagger and snow plow operator were not listed anywhere in the agreement,the trustees grouped appellants dot jobs and covered employment into the single generic class of operating engineers,a term borrowed from one of the five wage and classification groups in the agreement.the district court readily rejected the approach as unreasonable,and the issue has been abandoned on appeal.
this appeal focuses on the trustees second interpretation,which the district court upheld as reasonable.there,the trustees employed a duties and skills test comparing appellants covered employment and jobs.they reviewed submitted job descriptions and dispatch cards documenting daily assignments.they also took appellants testimony.from this information,the trustees identified similarities between the jobs in terms of duties,skills,and general competencies.
in tapley case,the trustees looked to the request for referral form,which classifies his dot position not as a flagger,but as an equipment operator wage grade.the enclosed job description included many duties beyond flagging traffic 
grounds maintenance,brush cutting,flagging,raking,shoveling and general labor.simple or routine maintenance with hand and power tools,drives ton trucks.sets up signs for traffic control and prepares the equipment for the crew.
the trustees also requested clarification on the duty prepares the equipment for the crew,which they learned refers to inspections involving checking oil,tires,and lights,and loading tar blocks,cones,signs,and stands.
ultimately,the trustees concluded that the duties and skills tapley required as a flagger were similar or analogous to those required in his covered employment as a skilled mechanic.they observed that as a skilled mechanic,tapley had duties and skills related to equipment operation the broader career area to which the dot assigned the flagger job.specifically,they noted that as a mechanic and welder,tapley sometimes operated equipment in order to move it into position for servicing,and drove a service truck to carry tools,parts,and lubricants.they also emphasized that tapley was qualified to operate certain equipment,though he did so only once,on a failed dispatch to operate a backhoe.likewise,when reviewing tapley flagger job,the trustees looked for any duties and skills comparable to the repair and maintenance of heavy duty machinery that tapley performed as a mechanic.they listed examples of duties for all subjourney level employees at tapley wage grade,such as checking oil,tires and lights,operating a truck and other vehicles and basic equipment such as a sander or grader,and performing ground maintenance.on that basis,and without elaboration,the trustees concluded that the two jobs were in the same job classification.
the trustees employed the same analysis in chapman case,though with some fidelity to the duties and skills actually performed and used.but as in tapley appeal,the trustees concluded that chapman was working within the same job classification for the dot based on similar,though incidental,duties and skills.for example,they found chapman duties as a mechanic performing preventative maintenance on heavy machinery to be similar to the routine maintenance necessary to operate a snow plow,such as checking tires,fluid and oil levels,and brakes prior to operation.they also pointed to the dot listed competencies,which require general knowledge of equipment functions.the trustees compared chapman duties as a snow plow operator to the operation of machinery required of him as a skilled mechanic,when he would occasionally move equipment for servicing.they also noted that chapman drove a truck in both positions.
procedural history 
tapley and chapman jointly filed this action in the united states district court of alaska pursuant to a b,a seeking to overturn the trustees decisions.following a trial on the record,the district court upheld the trustees use of a duties and skills test as reasonable.the district court also affirmed the trustees decisions with respect to tapley and chapman,observing that t he trustees found numerous skills and duties that were the same for each job,which is a reasonable basis for the trustees conclusion that the positions were in the same job classification.
the district court also denied appellants motion to compel the production of documents related to the post retirement service of another union mechanic.tapley and chapman allege that the other mechanic collected early retirement benefits while working more than hours per month as a commercial fuel truck driver.

although we agree with the district court that it is reasonable to interpret the term job classification to mean more than job title,this observation does not resolve the dispute.the plain language of the plan imposes another clear constraint job classification under section b must be less encompassing than industry under section c,which refers to the broader types of business activities engaged in by the employers maintaining the plan.an interpretation that conflates the two terms conflicts with the plain language of the plan by rendering the term job classification nugatory.see richardson,at each provision in an agreement should be construed consistently with the entire document such that no provision is rendered nugatory.brown cal.ibew neca trust funds,cir holding that a plan administrator abuses its discretion if its interpretation of the plan creates a much broader category of prohibited activities than is supported by the plain language of the plan.

tapley case illustrates the problem.his covered employment as a skilled mechanic was a far cry from his dot position as a flagger or road crew worker both based on the type of duties performed and the level of skill required.yet the trustees ignored these fundamental differences and chose instead to emphasize any similar and analogous duties,skills,and general competencies many of which were listed in broad job abstracts without properly considering how incidental they were,how seldom the duties were performed,or whether the skills tapley developed during the many years of covered employment were ever used or required at all.
in fact,tapley did not engage in flagging or other roadside work in covered employment as a skilled mechanic.it was only in anticipation of early retirement that he completed additional training through the state of alaska to obtain a flagger card.upon close review of the record,it ap
