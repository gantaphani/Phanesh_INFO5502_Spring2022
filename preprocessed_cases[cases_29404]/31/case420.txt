john alvis jackson,and larry andrew carey together,the defendants,were prosecuted in the western district of virginia on multiple fraud and theft offenses involving a loss of more than million.the defendants were each convicted by a jury in early of the following offenses two counts of bank fraud,in contravention of the bank fraud offenses 
five counts of wire fraud,in violation of the wire fraud offenses 
a single count of making false statements in documents required by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,in contravention of the erisa false statement offense 
two counts of theft from an pension plan,in violation of the erisa theft offenses and,
a single count of theft from a health care benefit program,in contravention of the health care program theft offense.
jackson was also convicted of conspiracy to commit various federal offenses,in violation of the conspiracy offense.in late,jackson was sentenced to months in prison and carey was sentenced to months.these consolidated appeals ensued.
on appeal,the defendants present multiple contentions of error.first,they challenge their convictions on the erisa theft offenses,raising the primary issue in this appeal whether,pursuant to of title,unpaid employer erisa pension plan contributions constitute assets of the plan.second,the defendants contest the sufficiency of the evidence supporting certain of their convictions.finally,they challenge their sentences on several grounds.as explained below,we reject their contentions and affirm.
on september,a grand jury in the western district of virginia returned an indictment against the defendants,charging them with,inter alia,the bank fraud offenses counts one and two,the wire fraud offenses counts three through seven,the erisa false statement offense count ten,the erisa theft offenses counts eleven and twelve,the health care program theft offense count thirteen,and the conspiracy offense count fourteen the defendants pleaded not guilty and were tried before a jury over an period in february and march.
the prosecution trial evidence consisted primarily of extensive business records and the testimony of several fact and expert witnesses.jackson testified on his own behalf,denied involvement in any criminal activity,and presented six witnesses in support of his defense.carey presented expert testimony in his defense,but did not testify.the trial evidence is summarized below 
the burruss company,a wood products business involved in the manufacturing of flooring for and residential homes,was headquartered in galax,virginia,with offices in lynchburg,virginia,and manufacturing plants in virginia,tennessee,and kentucky.jackson served as president and chief executive officer of burruss from until october.carey began working for burruss in and eventually became its chief financial officer,a position he held until october.
in,investor grant minor wilson and two others purchased burruss.wilson served as one of burruss directors from through.in,wilson created burruss holding company and exchanged his burruss stock for the ownership of burruss holding the refinance.burruss and burruss holding then retired the balance of burruss stock for approximately million procured by loan from fleet capital,and issued a promissory note for million to buy out the other burruss shareholders.burruss,as a result,became a wholly owned subsidiary of burruss holding.wilson,by controlling burruss holding,became its primary representative and dealt directly with jackson,burruss president and ceo,and carey,its cfo 
the refinance resulted in a loan agreement that burruss negotiated with fleet,dated april.in his newly acquired capacity,wilson discussed the fleet loan agreement extensively with jackson and carey.the loan agreement was,and burruss collateralized the fleet loan with its and.the portion of the fleet loan was secured by burruss real estate,machinery,and equipment,and was initially for million.between and,the fleet loan agreement was amended multiple times to increase burruss borrowing capacity under the portion of the loan.the balance of the portion of the loan,as of september,reached over million.the second aspect of the fleet loan related to burruss,and was secured by its accounts receivable and inventory.the portion comprised the lion share of the loan,with the amount thereof varying from.as of september,the principal of the part of the fleet loan was over million,and at other times it exceeded million.
the terms of the fleet loan agreement required that all of burruss assets be pledged as collateral.consequently,any funds received by burruss from selling its assets were to be paid to fleet.under the loan agreement,burruss was entitled to sell only worth of equipment annually without fleet approval.in addition to pledging burruss assets as collateral for the fleet loan,a support agreement required its officers to operate and maintain burruss in a manner that would properly support the fleet loan,and to promptly inform fleet of any fraud,conversion,or misapplication of burruss assets,or any breach of the loan agreement.wilson,jackson,and carey executed support agreements with respect to the fleet loan.
by,burruss began having problems paying its vendors in a timely fashion and was unable to maintain its inventory and raw materials.several of burruss small vendors needed to be paid in a shorter time frame than the business could accommodate,and thus declined to sell supplies to it.jackson discussed with wilson the creation of an entity to purchase timber from small vendors and resell it to burruss with an markup,enabling burruss to accumulate and maintain the inventory it needed.soon thereafter,jackson and his wife,along with carey,formed a separate business called virginia wood products vwp.vwp served as a broker to secure timber for burruss and provided it with sixty to payment terms.burruss was then able to secure raw materials primarily timber through vwp from vendors who would no longer sell directly to burruss.
the books and records of burruss,however,revealed that many of the small vendors selling to vwp were also continuing to sell supplies to burruss.although vwp had no storage facilities and did not physically handle the timber it purchased for delivery to even though vwp work was actually performed by burruss the price of such timber by to before reselling it to burruss.vwp did not typically pay its vendors any more expeditiously than burruss did.
in addition to its inventory issues,burruss had additional difficulties in.one of its most profitable facilities was largely destroyed by fire,severely impacting burruss profits.in addition,a canadian company entered the flooring business,competing with burruss and severely reducing its most profitable component.burruss recovered from those difficulties,however,and eventually became an even larger producer of residential flooring.
in,jackson asked wilson for a salary increase and a bonus,explaining that he had not received either in some time.in response,wilson raised jackson salary to per year,plus a yearly bonus.wilson agreed that jackson could draw his bonuses from a burruss holding account maintained at wachovia bank in lynchburg the secret wachovia account,in order to conceal payment of the bonuses from other burruss personnel.the secret wachovia account was not referenced or listed in any of burruss records,and was thus concealed from fleet.
between and,the fleet loan agreement was amended at least eight times to increase burruss borrowing limits.under the portion of the loan agreement,burruss had a borrowing base of against its eligible accounts receivable,against its raw materials,and against its finished goods.in order to obtain an advance under the loan agreement,burruss was obligated to submit a borrowing base certificate bbc to fleet,on which it reported the current status of its inventory and eligible accounts receivable carey was primarily responsible for preparing the bbcs,and,in doing so,compiled a list of burruss inventory and eligible accounts from inventory reports and sometimes by fabricating them.a carey subordinate,donna office manager and corporate secretary in completed the bbcs and transmitted them by fax to fleet in north carolina.in response,fleet wired the advanced funds to a burruss account at wachovia in lynchburg 
as burruss financially deteriorated throughout,jackson and carey began inflating the company assets on the bbcs they used to obtain advances under the fleet loan.bbcs were inflated in several ways by falsely creating inventory from a closed plant by creating false invoices for goods that had not been sold by falsely overvaluing inventory and by altering the original dates of accounts receivable.in carrying out this asset inflation scheme,jackson repeatedly instructed carey to mischaracterize raw lumber as purchased goods,thereby inflating the bbcs.jackson also suggested to carey that such raw lumber be characterized as finished product,thus increasing burruss borrowing power.at carey direction,elliott faxed false inventory reports and inflated bbcs to fleet on four occasions in september and october of 
in and,jackson sold nine pieces of burruss equipment,valued at a total of approximately,without notifying fleet as required by the loan agreement.although these assets were owned by burruss and pledged to fleet,the proceeds from the sales were deposited into the burruss holding secret wachovia account.carey largely used the secret wachovia account for deposits of insurance receipts,tax refunds,and other funds representing assets of burruss that had been pledged to fleet.neither jackson,carey,nor any other burruss representative notified fleet that its collateral had been sold,or that funds representing collateral under the fleet loan agreement had been deposited in the secret wachovia account.jackson and carey paid themselves from the secret wachovia account the sums of approximately and,respectively,between may and february.jackson also directed carey to pay to vwp from the secret wachovia account,without any supporting invoices.during that same period,vwp was used to distribute substantial sums of money from burruss to jackson and carey personally.between and,vwp paid jackson over,and carey over.
during the relevant period,burruss maintained three separate erisa plans,for both pension and health purposes,that covered most of its to employees.first,burruss maintained a pension plan for its salaried employees the company plan.second,it maintained a pension plan for its unionized employees the union plan third,burruss established and utilized a health care benefit program for its employees the health plan.each of these erisa plans was used by the defendants as a vehicle for carrying out offenses underlying these appeals.the relevant details of the three erisa plans and their relationships to the various offenses are described further below.
under the company plan,an account was maintained for each eligible participant,and the funds and moneys in each participant account resulted from employer contributions made by burruss.burruss was obligated to contribute of the aggregate annual compensation of all eligible participants to the company plan.the company plan obligated burruss to provide each plan participant with an annual account statement,as of the last day of the calendar year.pursuant to an adoption agreement of,the company plan required burruss to allocate and credit the annual employer contributions to the proper participant accounts 
the union plan required burruss to establish a bookkeeping account for each eligible unionized employee,to pay into each account the participant share of burruss annual plan contributions,and to prepare annual participant statements after making the proper allocations for each plan year.the union plan defined the valuation date as the last day of the plan year,and gave each participant a vested and nonforfeited interest in his plan account.the adoption agreement defined a plan year as twelve consecutive months ending december,and it required burruss to contribute fifteen cents to the account of each plan participant for each hour of service.
burruss was designated as the plan administrator for the company plan and carey served as assistant to the plan administrator.carey was designated as plan administrator for the union plan.jackson and carey both performed administrative duties for each of the plans.accordingly,jackson signed the bargaining agreement with the union and both carey and jackson signed the plan contribution checks.the trustee for both plans was crestar bank,which was later renamed suntrust bank.each plan administrator possessed the primary authority for filing the various reports,forms and returns with the department of labor and the internal revenue service.for example,carey,on behalf of the company plan,filed a form annual of employee benefit plan for plan year with the department of labor.
as of december,burruss owed approximately to the company plan for plan year.pursuant to irs regulations,burruss was entitled to defer its contribution until its federal income tax return was due on march,or,if it obtained a filing extension,until september.on october,burruss filed its form for the company plan with the department of labor,signed by jackson.on the form,jackson stated that burruss owed to the company plan and that it had made the plan contribution in that amount.the form question c required that the sum of any funding deficiency be reported,and jackson left the question blank.as of october,however,burruss had made no contributions to the company plan for plan year.
in early,frank dishman,a pension account manager with crestar bank,met with jackson and carey concerning burruss erisa plan obligations.according to dishman,jackson and carey believed that they did not have to make these contributions,that they had discontinued making contributions to the plan.dishman advised them that burruss could cease making its plan contributions only by terminating the plans according to law.dishman also advised the defendants that burruss had not made its company plan contribution.in response,carey falsely asserted that he had mailed the contributions for both plans to crestar in december.dishman,however,advised them that crestar had not received any such payments.
carey thereafter directed elliott to falsely record,on burruss general ledger of march,that burruss had sent a check to crestar bank on december,for the company and union plan contributions on april,dishman again advised carey by letter that crestar had not received the company plan contribution.on april,however,the trustee received a burruss check dated december,signed by jackson and carey,for the company and union plan contributions.when dishman successor from suntrust bank,sybill wolff,asked carey about the late contributions,carey asserted that he had given the check to dishman earlier,who had probably lost it.
burruss was obligated,for plan year,to contribute over to its company and union plans.in,jackson and carey separately observed in the company records that the contributions to the plans were due by september,and jackson mentioned the possibility of terminating the company plan.wolff met with carey in and reminded him that the contributions to the plans were due by september.as that date approached,wolff repeatedly called carey and advised him to make the contributions.although carey assured her that burruss would make those contributions,it never did.wolff thereafter called carey several times concerning the missed payments.carey avoided most of those calls.when he did respond,he simply asserted that a mistake must have been made.wolff also called jackson,who directed her to speak to carey about the problem.on october,wolff advised carey by letter that burruss had not made its contributions to the company and union plans,and that burruss could be penalized for not making them.
in early september,suntrust bank sent burruss the individual account statements for the participants of both plans.each statement reflected a participant account balance for the plan year ending december,reflecting burruss contribution for that plan year.suntrust later advised the participants of both plans that,although it had mistakenly credited their accounts with accrued benefits for the plan year,an earnings reversal had been made because burruss failed to submit the required contribution for the plan year.suntrust also informed the participants that s ince the statement you received last year included an accrual for that contribution,an adjustment has been made on the enclosed statement to reflect the fact that no contribution was received.id.
as mentioned above,burruss also maintained an erisa health plan for its employees,and contracted with the piedmont community health plan pchp to process health care claims.jackson signed the pchp contract on behalf of burruss,and carey administered the health plan in conjunction with jacqueline mosby,pchp controller.in order to finance the plan,burruss made weekly withholdings from its employees earnings for contributions to the health plan.
in,burruss began paying pchp only part of its employee withholdings for the health plan,resulting in a deficiency by june of that year.on august,burruss failed to pay pchp more than,even though those moneys and funds had been withheld from its employees earnings for health care contributions.by early october,pchp had ceased paying health care claims under the health plan,resulting in substantial unpaid medical expenses for the covered burruss employees 
in june of,jackson and carey hired ray equi to oversee burruss reporting to fleet on the bbcs.equi promptly discovered that burruss inventory and accounts receivable had been overstated on the bbcs and,in august,he prepared and directed memoranda to that effect to both jackson and carey.equi also refused to sign any inflated bbcs.on august,equi advised jackson that burruss inventory and accounts receivable were being overstated,that burruss was close to its lending limits on the fleet loan,and that much of its inventory and accounts receivable were not.in august,carey fired equi,who later served as a key witness for the prosecution 
on october,wilson and carey flew to atlanta for a meeting with fleet.during the trip,carey advised wilson that burruss was suffering from inventory shortages and,after the meeting,wilson travelled to galax to examine burruss finances.after examining burruss records,wilson ascertained that it had overstated its assets on the bbcs submitted to fleet by more than million,and that burruss was in serious financial trouble.
on october,wilson hired kevin,a crisis manager from newbridge management llc,to operate burruss.and ralph brotherton,a cpa,then conducted an extensive review of burruss records.they interviewed carey repeatedly,seeking to ascertain burruss true financial condition.carey admitted that he had intentionally inflated the bbcs submitted to fleet in order to obtain working capital for burruss and to make the business more attractive to potential buyers.carey also acknowledged that he had deposited burruss insurance receipts,tax refunds,and other funds into the secret wachovia account.carey asserted that he had not made the and erisa contributions to the company and union plans because there were more pressing expenses due.carey explained that burruss financial problems should be resolved after being sold,and that he expected a personal financial benefit from the sale significantly,and brotherton testified against the defendants at trial.unfortunately,all efforts to sell burruss failed.ascertaining that it had no other option,burruss declared bankruptcy on november.
at the conclusion of the prosecution,and again at the conclusion of the trial evidence,the defendants moved for judgments of acquittal.see.a authorizing motion for judgment of acquittal after conclusion of prosecution and again at conclusion of all evidence.the court denied these acquittal motions,however,and the jury found jackson guilty on all charges,and carey guilty on all charges except the conspiracy offense.
in proceedings,jackson and carey renewed their motions for judgments of acquittal and also sought,in the alternative,a new trial.see.a and.the district court denied those requests,explaining its rulings in a memorandum opinion filed on june,the opinion the opinion bases for these rulings,specifying that the various convictions were amply supported by the evidence and that there was no sound reason for awarding the defendants a new trial,included the following 
on the bank fraud and wire fraud offenses,the evidence was sufficient to support jackson convictions because he oversaw the daily operations of burruss,was carey superior,was familiar with the borrowing arrangement with fleet,had directed carey to inflate inventory,had instructed elliott to overvalue inventory to increase burruss borrowing power,and had been advised by equi that the accounts receivable were inflated.see opinion.
on the wire fraud offenses,the evidence supported jackson convictions because he knew of and approved previous faxes to fleet,and could foresee that the inflated bbcs would continue to be faxed.id.at.
on the bank fraud offenses,the court observed that,although a bank must be the intended victim of a bank fraud scheme,it need not be the immediate victim.id.at.here burruss was a victim of the fraud scheme,but fleet suffered the ultimate risk of loss.id.
on the erisa false statement offense,the evidence was sufficient to sustain jackson conviction because company policy required him to sign checks above a certain sum,and he had not sought to correct the form although he knew that a plan contribution had not been made.id.at.
the evidence was sufficient to support carey conviction on the false statement offense in count ten,in that he was a on company checks and had created false accounting entries to nonpayment of the erisa contributions.id.at.
on the erisa theft offenses,the employer contributions to erisa pension funds became assets of the erisa plans when they became due and payable.the defendants were not required to be fiduciaries of the plans because prohibits any person from committing a offense,and makes no reference to fiduciary status.id.at.
jackson was not entitled to judgment of acquittal on the erisa theft offenses because the handwriting from his planner and notepads indicat ed that he knew the pension contributions were due,demonstrating his reckless disregard for the interest of the pension plans.id.at.
on the health care program theft offense,the government,by showing that funds were withheld from employee paychecks for contribution to the healthcare plan,presented sufficient evidence to sustain the defendants convictions.id.at.
on the conspiracy offense,the evidence was sufficient to establish that jackson had conspired with elliot in inflating the bbcs.id.at.
finally,the defendants were not entitled to a new trial,because the evidence was sufficient to sustain their convictions and because they were not prejudiced by the improper exclusion or admission of evidence.id.at.
the presentence investigation reports the psrs for jackson and carey calculated their advisory sentencing ranges under the edition of the sentencing guidelines.the psrs grouped their offenses and awarded them base offense levels of,see ussg a,to which they added the following increases because the grouped offenses involved more than minimal planning,id.b a increases for substantially jeopardizing the safety and soundness of a financial institution,id.b a increases for embezzling from erisa plans while serving as plan fiduciaries,id.and increases because the loss exceeded million,id.b r.jackson psr also recommended a increase because he committed perjury while testifying at trial.id.premised on criminal history categories of i,jackson total offense level was and his advisory sentencing range was to months,and carey total offense level was and his advisory sentencing range was to months.
the district court conducted jackson and carey sentencing hearings on january,and,after largely accepting the psrs recommendations,the court denied the prosecution motion for enhancements against jackson and carey.importantly,the court also ruled that the psrs recommended increases for causing a loss exceeding million were applicable.the defendants objected to this ruling,contending that the loss calculations made in the psrs were incorrect.they asserted that the loss calculations should reflect only the actual and foreseeable loss,which was less than million.they also claimed that burruss and its assets had been overvalued from the beginning and that the loss suffered by fleet was due to burruss unforeseeable decision to file for bankruptcy.the court rejected these contentions and,after weighing the evidence,the advisory guidelines ranges,and the a sentencing factors,sentenced jackson and carey at the bottom of their advisory ranges and months,respectively.the defendants thereafter filed these appeals,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
in their consolidated appeals,the defendants first contend that they can not be subjected to criminal liability under of title for the two erisa theft offenses.additionally,they contest the sufficiency of the evidence to support certain of their convictions.we address these contentions in turn 
with respect to their convictions on the erisa theft offenses in counts eleven and twelve,the defendants contend that the district court erred when it ruled that unpaid employer contributions to the company and union plans constituted assets of the plans under specifically,they assert that their convictions on the erisa theft offenses must be vacated,as a matter of law,because unpaid employer contributions are not assets of a plan until they are paid into the plan unless the plan documents specifically state otherwise.br.of appellants.because the plan documents fail to specify that unpaid employer contributions constitute plan assets,the defendants maintain that they can not be guilty of the erisa theft offenses.they further contend that,even if the unpaid erisa contributions were assets of the company and union plans,they can not be guilty because they were never fiduciaries of the plans.
relying primarily on the second circuit opinion in united states labarbara,cir,the district court ruled that unpaid employer contributions become credits and are erisa plan assets when they are due and payable to the plan.opinion.the court deemed irrelevant the defendants claim that they had never served as fiduciaries of the plans,because explicitly applies to any person who steals or embezzles the moneys,funds,or assets of an erisa plan.we review de novo a ruling by a district court on an issue of statutory interpretation.united states green,cir see also labarbara,at,reviewing de novo district court interpretation of statutory term assets under.
in order to prove the erisa theft offenses,the prosecution was obligated to establish the elements of,that jackson and carey committed acts of embezzlement or conversion that such acts of embezzlement or conversion involved the moneys,funds,or assets of an erisa plan and that such acts were committed with the specific intent of depriving the erisa plan of its moneys,funds,or assets.see see also united states whiting,cir observing that is violated when any person willfully or intentionally converts erisa funds to his own use or use of another united states krimsky,cir observing that,for conviction under,prosecution must prove accused embezzled or converted funds,moneys,or assets of erisa plan with specific intent of depriving plan of such moneys,funds,or assets although does not explicitly provide that unpaid employer contributions constitute erisa plan assets,of title specifies that such assets are held in trust,and not for the employer benefit.the second circuit concluded that,when an erisa employer has paid wages or salaries to its employees,it is contractually bound to contribute to any erisa plan that it maintains.in its labarbara decision,the court decided that an employer must comply with its contractual obligations to make contributions to its erisa plan,and that such a contractual obligation constitutes an asset of the erisa plan.see at see also in re luna,cir holding that contractual right to collect unpaid contributions is plan asset.
notwithstanding the defendants assertions that burruss unpaid employer contributions did not constitute assets of the company and union plans for purposes of the erisa theft offenses,the relevant facts and legal principles support the district court ruling.when burruss established its erisa pension plans,it bound itself to the terms thereof.both plans mandated annual contributions based upon hours worked,and wages and salaries paid.burruss could properly extricate itself from those erisa obligations only by proper termination of the plans.see.we thus agree with the district court and the second circuit,and are satisfied that burruss unpaid contributions to the plans constituted the moneys,funds,or assets thereof for purposes of.as a result,the defendants contention in that regard must be rejected.
the defendants also contend that,even if the unpaid erisa contributions were assets of the company and union plans,they nevertheless can not be guilty of the erisa theft offenses because they were never fiduciaries of the plans.the defendants assert that,in order for them to be criminally liable under,the prosecution had to prove that they were such fiduciaries.see luna,at,observing that for defendant in civil erisa fraud action to be personally liable,he must be fiduciary of erisa plan.indeed,as they point out,counts eleven and twelve actually allege that the defendants were fiduciaries.see alleging that defendants,while fiduciaries of the plans,embezzled and converted moneys,funds,and assets of plans.
the district court ruled against the defendants on this point,however,because plainly applies to any person who steals or embezzles the moneys,funds,or assets of an erisa plan.opinion.importantly,the court instructions to the jury were consistent with,and did not mandate a jury finding that either jackson or carey were fiduciaries.counts eleven and twelve,in alleging that the defendants were fiduciaries of the plans,were thus at odds with the express terms of.such surplusage does not constitute appellate error,however,for at least three reasons.first,the defendants did not pursue a variance or surplusage claim in the district court or on appeal second,does not require that an accused be a fiduciary,but is plainly drawn in terms of any person.
finally,in these circumstances,the defendants were shown to be fiduciaries of the plans.under erisa,a fiduciary is a person who exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,or discretionary responsibility with respect to an erisa plan.a.erisa also provides that an administrator is an example of a fiduciary.id.a.erisa defines an administrator as the person specifically so designated by the terms of the instrument under which the plan is operated.id.a i.
the defendants contend that suntrust,rather than either of them,was the plan administrator of the company and union plans.carey,however,was expressly named as plan administrator in the union plan documents,and as assistant plan administrator in the company plan documents.furthermore,in phelps,cir,we observed that,even though an officer of a business is not a named fiduciary of an erisa plan,he is nevertheless a fiduciary when he assumes plan responsibilities or exercises control over whether to pay plan contributions.jackson,as burruss ceo,was thus a fiduciary of the company and union plans,because he assumed plan responsibilities and exercised control over whether burruss made its erisa plan contributions.under the undisputed facts,both jackson and carey performed administrative duties associated with the plans jackson signed form as plan administrator and sponsor for plan year carey signed the form as plan administrator for plan year jackson signed the collective bargaining agreement with the union and both carey and jackson signed the erisa plan contribution checks 
the defendants next challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in support of certain of their defendants challenge the evidence on a bank fraud offense count two jackson challenges the evidence on the other bank fraud offense count one,as well as on each of the wire fraud offenses counts three through seven and carey challenges the evidence on the erisa false statement offense count ten.under our precedent,an app
