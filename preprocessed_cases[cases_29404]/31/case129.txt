background 
plaintiffs are former employees of world airways,and participants in local pension trust fund the fund.the fund provides pension benefits to participants and beneficiaries pursuant to an employee benefit plan the plan.the plan is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of section of erisa.pension benefits are paid based on service credits.service credits are generally earned based on an employee years of covered service,that is,service for a contributing employer while an employee is a participant in the plan.service credits may also be awarded based on past credited service,which is a credit for an employee periods of covered service with an employer that predate the employer joining the plan.the plan also allows for the cancellation of past service credits if the participant employer is no longer a participating employer in the plan and cancelling the past service credits is in the interest of preserving the fund actuarial soundness.the plan grants the fund trustees the trustees the exclusive right,power,and authority,in their sole and absolute discretion,to administer,apply,and interpret the plan,and to decide all matters arising in connection with the operation or administration of the plan.app x at.
until,world airways employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by the international brotherhood of teamsters local.the collective bargaining agreement between the world airways and local provided that plaintiffs were to be enrolled in world airway retirement plan the target benefit plan.world airways was obligated to pay percent of each employee gross annual salary into the target benefit plan.
in,local merged with the international brotherhood of teamsters local,after which plaintiffs were represented by local.in the spring of,local took over negotiations with world airways for a new collective bargaining agreement.plaintiffs allege that,as part of those negotiations,local offered to replace the target benefit plan with the plan.plaintiffs allege that local promised them that world airways would be required to make a monthly contribution for post service and for past service time after participants completed a five year vesting period and local would assume all pension liability for past service credit if world airways could not or would not fund the plaintiffs past service credits.
a june,letter sent from the local negotiating team to local members,including plaintiffs,stated in relevant part 
pension and pension vesting guarantee 
international brotherhood of teamsters demand 
the t arget b enefit p lan provided by world airways is woefully inadequate and must be replaced.it operates on the assumption that the money contributed by world airways will earn interest and it has consistently failed to do so.world airways refused to take on the financial burden that would provide each of us with a decent retirement.
we are very pleased to advise that local offers retirement plans for its members where the employer does not have sufficient funds or is unwilling to commit the necessary cash to provide a viable retirement.local has designed a federally insured,funded,defined benefit plan to which world airways will provide monthly contribution with a past service credit after a year vesting period.this will provide an extraordinary improvement in our benefit from today level.
this is possible because,while world airways will never contribute enough money to have purchased the benefit for us,our union and the members of our local who will vote to accept us into their plan are willing to accept the liability to protect and make a long term commitment to represent us.
in a july,letter to all local members on reaching a new agreement,local trustee agent stated 
i would like to explain to you the depth of commitment this local union has for its new members.with the approval of secretary treasurer angelo martin,this local created a new pension plan for the employees at world airways.this plan which i negotiated into your contract,gives pension credit to all members back to the date of hire,after vesting.in other words if you have worked for the company for ten years to date,and you work another five years,at retirement you will receive per month for life.
this pension plan has a cost to the union of over which we are willing to pay to secure a better tomorrow for our new members.
plaintiffs allege that,as a result of these representations,they agreed to ratify the collective bargaining agreement,switch to the plan,and accept a lower amount of wage increases in return for payments into the fund by world airways.plaintiffs,who all have five years of post work credit with world airways,allege that each was advised,on numerous occasions,that he or she had been given past service credit,and that,as a result,each was to receive percent of their service credit for the years before world began to contribute to the plan.app x at.plaintiffs also allege that world airways made contributions between and over and above what they were obligated to pay for post pension credit for each of the plaintiffs,so that by they had funded the pre service credits and turned them into future service credits under the terms of the plan.app x at.
world airways filed for bankruptcy protection in.once it entered bankruptcy,world airways ceased to be a contributing member of the fund and was assessed withdrawal liability pursuant to erisa in excess of million.world airway withdrawal liability was discharged in bankruptcy.
in december,the fund trustees the trustees voted to cancel the past service credits of world airways employees,including plaintiffs,pursuant to the terms of the plan that vests the trustees with discretion to act in the interests of preserving the actuarial soundness of the fund.that language vests the trustees with broad authority to cancel the past service credits in the interests of preserving the fund actuarial soundness.app x b.on remand,the district court need not reconsider the plaintiffs arguments related to whether the trustee had authority to cancel credits under the plan terms.
the trustees told plaintiffs that neither world airways,nor any other party,had funded the pre service credits.plaintiffs,through counsel,asked to review the record of contributions from world airways to the fund,but the request was denied.plaintiffs allege that the cancellation of credits from before drastically reduced their monthly pension benefit.
the trustees informed plaintiffs that the fund third party administrator verified that world airways did not make any contributions for service prior to.the trustees asked plaintiffs to submit any documentation that supported their claim that past service credits had,in fact,been funded.plaintiffs submitted a letter to the fund on may,stating that 
we are not saying that contributions were made prior to.we are saying that
