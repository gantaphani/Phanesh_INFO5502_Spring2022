facts and proceedings 
on april,leonard scott was admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment of severe burns scott sustained after falling or walking into a bonfire.he remained hospitalized until his death on april.during that time,the hospital rendered medical services and provided goods to scott valued at.
at all relevant times,scott was a participant in the associates health and welfare plan the plan,an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.several times during scott stay at the hospital,hospital representatives contacted stores,scott employer and the sponsor of the plan,through its authorized representative,international rehabilitation associates,intracorp intracorp,to request approval for the hospitalization and to report on scott condition.during these interactions,the hospital informed plan representatives that scott had been drinking at the time of his accident.through intracorp,the plan certified to the hospital that scott treatment and hospitalization were medically necessary,although at no time did the plan guarantee payment of benefits.
after scott death,the hospital billed the plan for the services rendered and goods furnished to scott.in june,the plan notified scott mother and the hospital that the claim for benefits had been denied,citing a plan provision excluding benefits for charges for any treatment or service that was the result of the participant being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.both scott representative and the hospital appealed the plan denial of benefits pursuant to plan procedure,but their appeal was ultimately rejected by the administrative appeals committee.

iii.discussion 
erisa confers standing to sue to recover benefits due under a plan on participants and beneficiaries.a vega national life ins,cir.because a health care provider has no independent right of standing to seek redress under erisa,such a provider must be capable of classification as a participant or a beneficiary to invoke erisa.memorial hosp.northbrook life ins,cir.
the hospital does not contend to be,nor is it,a participant in the plan.rather,the hospital maintains that it possesses standing either derivatively,as an assignee of a beneficiary,or independently,as a designated or intended beneficiary.
derivative standing as an assignee 
the hospital claim to derivative erisa standing is predicated on the assignment of medical benefits executed in its favor by mildred scott,scott mother and sole heir it is clear in this circuit that a health care provider may possess standing under erisa by virtue of a valid assignment.in sharp contrast to the express prohibition of the assignment of benefits under an erisa pension plan,d,erisa contains no provision prohibiting the assignment of benefits under an erisa welfare plan,nor does it contain language that even remotely suggests that such assignments are proscribed or ought in any way to be limited.hermann hosp.meba med.benefits plan hermann i,cir.finding the absence of such proscriptive language in the context of welfare plans to be significant,this court in hermann i held that a health care provider with a valid assignment of plan benefits has a derivative right of standing under erisa.it reasoned that a n assignment to a health care provider facilitates rather than hampers the employee receipt of health benefits and thus would further erisa policies.the court explained 
to deny standing to health care providers as assignees of beneficiaries of erisa plans might undermine congress goal of enhancing employees health and welfare benefit coverage.many providers seek assignments of benefits to avoid billing the beneficiary directly and upsetting his finances and to reduce the risk of.if their status as assignees does not entitle them to federal standing against the plan,providers would either have to rely on the beneficiary to maintain an erisa suit,or they would have to sue the beneficiary.either alternative,indirect and uncertain as they are,would discourage providers from becoming assignees and possibly from helping beneficiaries who were unable to pay them.the providers are better situated and financed to pursue an action for benefits owed for their services.allowing assignees of beneficiaries to sue under a comports with the principle of subrogation generally applied in the law.
id.at.having determined that a health care provider with a valid assignment may possess standing,the hermann i court remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether the hospital possessed a valid assignment in light of the language in the plan forbidding the assignment of benefits.
on appeal after remand,the court held that,despite the plan clause,the provider had a valid assignment and thus had standing to sue the plan.hermann hosp.meba med.benefits plan hermann ii,cir.it found that the plan was estopped to assert its clause because of its protracted failure to assert the clause when hermann requested payment pursuant to a clear and unambiguous assignment of payments for covered benefits.id.at.furthermore,the court noted that even if the plan had not been estopped from invoking the clause,the clause would not have invalidated the assignment of benefits received by the hospital because the clause and its typical spendthrift language applied only to unrelated,than the health care provider of assigned as creditors of debts having no nexus with the plan or its benefits.id.the court continued 
the clause should not be applicable,however,to an assignee who,as here,is the provider of the very services which the plan is maintained to furnish.were we to conclude otherwise,health care providers such as the hospital,which is entitled to payment for the services it provided as benefits covered under the plan,would be unable to recover for those services unless the participant were to sue the plan for recovery of benefits and the hospital in turn sue the participant.such a result would be inequitable as the participant,knowing that any recovery from the plan would immediately go to the hospital,would have no incentive to pursue might be reluctant to sue the plan maintained by his own employer or his own union.thus,the clause,even if
