after medical problems forced petitioner hardt to stop working,she filed for disability benefits under her employer disability plan.upon exhausting her administrative remedies,hardt sued respondent reliance,her employer disability insurance carrier,alleging that it had violated the employee retirement income security act of erisa by wrongfully denying her benefits claim.the district court denied reliance summary judgment,finding that because the carrier had acted on incomplete medical information,the benefits denial was not based on substantial evidence.though also denying hardt summary judgment,the court stated that it found compelling evidence in the record that she was totally disabled and that it was inclined to rule in her favor,but concluded that it would be unwise to do so without giving reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its approach.the court therefore remanded to reliance,giving it days to consider all the evidence and to act on hardt application,or else the court would enter judgment in hardt favor.reliance did as instructed and awarded hardt benefits.hardt then filed a motion under g,a statute that applies in most erisa lawsuits and provides that the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney fee and costs to either party.granting the motion,the district court applied the circuit framework governing attorney fee requests in erisa cases,concluding,inter alia,that hardt had attained the requisite prevailing party status.the fourth circuit vacated the fees award,holding that hardt had failed to establish that she qualified as a prevailing party under the rule set forth in buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources,that a fee claimant is a prevailing party only if he has obtained an enforceable judgmen t on the merits or a consent decre e.the court reasoned that because the remand order did not require reliance to award hardt benefits,it did not constitute an enforceable judgment on the merits.
a fee claimant need not be a prevailing party to be eligible for an attorney fees award under g.interpreting the section to require a party to attain that status is contrary to g plain text.the words prevailing party do not appear in the provision.nor does anything else in g text purport to limit the availability of attorney fees to a prevailing party.instead,g expressly grants district courts discretion to award attorney fees to either party.emphasis added.that language contrasts sharply with g,which governs the availability of attorney fees in erisa actions to recover delinquent employer contributions to a multiemployer plan.in such cases,only plaintiffs who obtain a judgment in favor of the plan may seek attorney fees.g d.the contrast between these two paragraphs makes clear that congress knows how to impose express limits on the availability of attorney fees in erisa cases.because congress failed to include in g an express prevailing party requirement,the fourth circuit decision adding that term of art to the statute more closely resembles invent ing a statute rather than interpret ing one.pasquantino united states.
a court may award fees and costs under g,as long as the fee claimant has achieved some degree of success on the merits.ruckelshaus sierra club.the bedrock principle known as the american rule provides the relevant point of reference each litigant pays his own attorney fees,win or lose,unless a statute or contract provides otherwise,at.this court prevailing party precedents do not govern here because that term of art does not appear in g.instead,the court interprets g in light of its precedents addressing statutes that deviate from the american rule by authorizing attorney fees based on other criteria.ruckelshaus,which considered a statute authorizing a fees award if the court determines that such an award is appropriate,f,is the principal case in that category.applying that decision interpretive approach to g,the court first looks to the language of the section,at,which unambiguously allows a court to award attorney fees in its discretion to either party.ruckelshaus also lays down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising that discretion.because here,as in the statute in ruckelshaus,congress failed to indicate clearly that it meant to abandon historic principles and intuitive notions of fairness,at,a fees claimant must show some degree of success on the merits before a court may award attorney fees under g,see,at.hardt has satisfied that standard.though she failed to win summary judgment on her benefits claim,the district court nevertheless found compelling evidence that she is totally disabled and stated that it was inclined to rule in her favor.she also obtained the remand order,after which reliance conducted the review,reversed its decision,and awarded the benefits she sought.accordingly,the district court properly exercised its discretion to award hardt attorney fees.

justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
in most lawsuits seeking relief under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et,a reasonable attorney fee and costs are available to either party at the court discretion.g.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit has interpreted g to require that a fee claimant be a prevailing party before he may seek a fees award.we reject this interpretation as contrary to g plain text.we hold instead that a court in its discretion may award fees and costs to either party,as long as the fee claimant has achieved some degree of success on the merits,ruckelshaus sierra club.
in,while working as an executive assistant to the president of textile manufacturer dan river,petitioner bridget hardt began experiencing neck and shoulder pain.her doctors eventually diagnosed her with carpal tunnel syndrome.because surgeries on both her wrists failed to alleviate her pain,hardt stopped working in january.
in august,hardt sought disability benefits from dan river group disability insurance program plan plan.dan river administers the plan,which is subject to erisa,but respondent reliance standard life insurance company decides whether a claimant qualifies for benefits under the plan and underwrites any benefits awarded.reliance provisionally approved hardt claim,telling her that final approval hinged on her performance in a functional capacities evaluation intended to assess the impact of her carpal tunnel syndrome and neck pain on her ability to work.
hardt completed the functional capacities evaluation in october.the evaluator summarized hardt medical history,observed her resulting physical limitations,and ultimately found that hardt could perform some amount of sedentary work.based on this finding,reliance concluded that hardt was not totally disabled within the meaning of the plan and denied her claim for disability benefits.hardt filed an administrative appeal.reliance reversed itself in part,finding that hardt was totally disabled from her regular occupation,and was therefore entitled to temporary disability benefits for months.
while her administrative appeal was pending,hardt began experiencing new symptoms in her feet and calves,including tingling,pain,and numbness.one of her physicians diagnosed her with neuropathy,a condition that increased her pain and decreased her physical capabilities over the ensuing months.
hardt eventually applied to the social security administration for disability benefits under the social security act.her application included questionnaires completed by two of her treating physicians,which described hardt symptoms and stated the doctors conclusion that hardt could not return to full gainful employment because of her neuropathy and other ailments.in february,the social security administration granted hardt application and awarded her disability benefits.
about two months later,reliance told hardt that her plan benefits would expire at the end of the period.reliance explained that under the plan terms,only individuals who are totally disabled from all occupations were eligible for benefits beyond that period,app.to pet.for cert,and adhered to its conclusion that,based on its review of hardt records,hardt was not totally disabled as defined by the plan.reliance also demanded that hardt pay reliance to offset the disability benefits she had received from the social security administration.the plan contains a provision coordinating benefits with social security payments.hardt paid reliance the offset.
hardt then filed another administrative appeal.she gave reliance all of her medical records,the questionnaires she had submitted to the social security administration,and an updated questionnaire from one of her physicians.reliance asked hardt to supplement this material with another functional capacities evaluation.when reliance referred hardt for the updated evaluation,it did not ask the evaluator to review hardt for neuropathic pain,even though it knew that hardt had been diagnosed with neuropathy after her first evaluation.
hardt appeared for the updated evaluation in december,and appeared for another evaluation in january.the evaluators deemed both evaluations invalid because hardt efforts were submaximal.at.one evaluator recorded that hardt refused multiple tests for fear of pain complaints.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.
lacking an updated functional capacities evaluation,reliance hired a physician and a vocation rehabilitation counselor to help it resolve hardt administrative appeal.the physician did not examine hardt instead,he reviewed some,but not all,of hardt medical records.based on that review,the physician produced a report in which he opined that hardt health was expected to improve.his report,however,did not mention hardt pain medications or the questionnaires that hardt attending physicians had completed as part of her application for social security benefits.the vocational rehabilitation counselor,in turn,performed a labor market study based on hardt health in that identified eight employment opportunities suitable for hardt.after reviewing the physician report,the labor market study,and the results of the functional capacities evaluation,reliance concluded that its decision to terminate hardt benefits was correct.it advised hardt of this decision in march.
after exhausting her administrative remedies,hardt sued reliance in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.she alleged that reliance violated erisa by wrongfully denying her claim for disability benefits.see a b.the parties filed for summary judgment,both of which the district court denied.
the court first rejected reliance request for summary judgment affirming the denial of benefits,finding that reliance decision to deny benefits was based on incomplete information.app.to pet.for cert.most prominently,none of the functional capacities evaluations to which hardt had submitted had assessed the impact of neuropathy and neuropathic pain on hardt.ibid.in addition,the reviewing physician report was itself incomplete the basis for the physician medical conclusions wa s extremely vague and conclusory,and the physician had failed to cite any medical evidence to support his conclusions,at,or to address the treating physicians contradictory medical findings,at.the court also found that reliance had improperly rejected much of the evidence that hardt submitted,at,and had further ignored the substantial amount of pain medication hardt treating physicians had prescribed to her,at.accordingly,the court thought it clear that reliance decision to deny hardt disability benefits was not based on substantial evidence.at.
the district court then denied hardt motion for summary judgment,which contended that reliance decision to deny benefits was unreasonable as a matter of law.in so doing,however,the court found compelling evidence in the record that hardt wa s totally disabled due to her neuropathy.at.although it was inclined to rule in hardt favor,the court concluded that it would be unwise to take this step without first giving reliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its approach.ibid.in the district court view,a remand to reliance was warranted because t his case presents one of those scenarios where the plan administrator has failed to comply with the erisa guidelines,meaning hardt did not get the kind of review to which she was entitled under applicable law.ibid.accordingly,the court instructed reliance to act on hardt application by adequately considering all the evidence within days o therwise,it warned,judgment will be issued in favor of hardt.at.
reliance did as instructed.after conducting that review,reliance found hardt eligible for disability benefits and paid her in accrued,benefits.
hardt then moved for attorney fees and costs under g.the district court assessed her motion under the framework that governed fee requests in erisa cases under circuit precedent.at step one of that framework,a district court asks whether the fee claimant is a prevailing party.at quoting martin blue cross blue shield of virginia,and citing buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources.if the fee claimant qualifies as a prevailing party,the court proceeds to step two and determin es whether an award of attorneys fees is appropriate by examining five factors.app.to pet.for cert.finally,if those five factors suggest that a fees award is appropriate,the court must review the attorneys fees and costs requested and limit them to a reasonable amount.at citing hensley eckerhart.
applying that framework,the district court granted hardt motion.it first concluded that hardt was a prevailing party because the court remand order sanctioned a material change in the legal relationship of the parties by ordering reliance to conduct the type of review to which hardt was entitled.at.the court recognized that the order did not sanctio n a certain result on remand,but found that it quite clearly expressed the consequences to reliance were it to fail to complete its reconsideration in an expeditious manner.at.accordingly,the remand order signif ied that the court was displeased with the cursory review that reliance had initially given to hardt claim,but was inclined to reserve judgment and permit reliance to conduct a proper review of all of the medical evidence.ibid.the court next concluded that a fees award was appropriate under the test,see,at,and awarded in fees and costs,at.
reliance appealed the fees award,and the court of appeals vacated the district court order.according to the court of appeals,hardt failed to satisfy the inquiry,she failed to establish that she was a prevailing party.in reaching that conclusion,the court of appeals relied on this court decision in buckhannon,under which a fee claimant qualifies as a prevailing party only if he has obtained an enforceable judgmen t on the merits or a consent decre e.fed.appx,per curiam quoting,at.the court of appeals reasoned that because the remand order did not require reliance to award benefits to hardt,it did not constitute an enforceable judgment on the merits as buckhannon requires,thus precluding hardt from establishing prevailing party status.fed,at brackets omitted.
hardt filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of two aspects of the court of appeals judgment.first,did the court of appeals correctly conclude that g permits courts to award attorney fees only to a prevailing party second,did the court of appeals correctly identify the circumstances under which a fee claimant is entitled to attorney fees under g we granted certiorari.
whether g limits the availability of attorney fees to a prevailing party is a question of statutory construction.as in all such cases,we begin by analyzing the statutory language,assum ing that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.gross fbl financial services,slip,at i
