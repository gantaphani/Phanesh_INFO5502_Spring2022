introduction 
plaintiff patelco credit union patelco and related parties brought this action under the employee retirement income security act erisa for breach of fiduciary duties by sudhir sahni and his companies collectively sahni in administering patelco employee health benefit plan.the case was tried to the bench before district judge robert schnacke however,he died before making findings of fact or conclusions of law.the case was reassigned to district judge saundra brown armstrong,who granted partial summary judgment in favor of patelco.the case was later reassigned to district judge susan illston,who entered summary judgment in favor of patelco on the remaining claims.
sahni argues on appeal that due process requires a new trial when a judge dies after a bench trial without making findings of fact that federal rule of civil procedure was violated because the successor judges did not certify familiarity with the record that the plan was not an erisa plan that benefits checks from the employer carrier were not erisa assets that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether sahni was a fiduciary that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether sahni breached his fiduciary duties or whether,instead,the money he retained was reasonable compensation that had been disclosed to and approved by patelco that evidence and a witness were erroneously excluded and that sanctions were imposed in violation of rule and rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.
ii.factual background 
plaintiffs in this action are patelco credit union,the patelco credit union health plan the plan,and amanda jones,a vice president of patelco and a fiduciary of the plan.defendants are sudhir sahni,an insurance broker,sahni associates,and sudhir sahni associates,a sole proprietorship.
patelco established the plan to provide health and medical benefits for its employees.prior to the plan was fully insured by travelers,with employees paying a annual deductible.in,upon the advice of sahni,patelco decided to partially the plan in order to avoid paying rising premiums.under the new arrangement,the employees would continue to pay a annual deductible,but patelco would cover any annual excess up to,at which point an insurance policy with jordan jones associates would cover the remainder.
sahni managed the plan and had control over its assets.for example,he selected jordan jones as the insurer of the claims in excess of.each month,patelco paid to sahni,at his direction,an amount of money that he estimated would be necessary to cover benefit checks that he would write to medical care providers,insurance premiums for the jordan jones policy,and the administrative fee that sahni alleges patelco had agreed to pay him.none of these components was itemized.as the employees filed claims for benefits,sahni either approved or denied them and then wrote checks to medical care providers for those services that were covered.sahni based his coverage decisions on patelco plan booklet,which he had created by combining travelers previous booklet with a vision plan and a dental plan.each month,sahni produced and provided to patelco lists of the under and over claims.
sahni accounting for the assets of the several plans that he administered can only be described as sloppy.he maintained three accounts one for premiums that came in from clients like patelco one for paying claims and one for his own company.however,the money of multiple plans was commingled in the accounts for premiums and claims.as to patelco,the entire amount received each month pursuant to sahni estimate which included money for premiums,money to pay claims,and his alleged administrative fee was initially placed in the premiums account.later,sahni would transfer money from the premiums account to the claims account to cover the checks that he had written to medical care providers.sahni had sole control over these accounts patelco employees did not have authority,nor did they even know the account number or location of the accounts.
in,the plan became fully.as before,employees paid the first each year,but patelco now paid everything over that amount.patelco purchased insurance from standard insurance company of oregon to protect it from catastrophic annual losses exceeding per employee or for the plan.sahni was the one who shopped around for an insurer to replace jordan jones and selected standard insurance.patelco terminated sahni as of march,however,sahni continued to retain his administrative fees for three more months.
iii.procedural history 
on april,patelco filed suit against sahni in the united states district court for the northern district of california.the complaint alleged that sahni breached his fiduciary duties and engaged in transactions prohibited by erisa sections a and b,which are codified at a and b.on march,patelco filed an amended complaint adding a rico cause of action.
on december,the parties appeared before judge armstrong for a pretrial conference and oral arguments on various motions before the court.judge armstrong orally denied all of the motions with the exception of patelco request for sanctions,which she took under advisement.
on january,a bench trial commenced before judge schnacke it concluded january.at the close of the plaintiff case,on january,judge schnacke dismissed the rico cause of action due to insufficiency of the evidence.however,before entering findings of fact or conclusions of law,judge schnacke unfortunately died.the case was reassigned to judge armstrong and later reassigned to judge illston.they entered several orders that are the subject of this appeal and which are discussed in detail below.final judgment was entered by judge illston on march.a notice of appeal was timely filed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
february,order granting sanctions armstrong,
in an order dated february,judge armstrong set forth in detail the reasons for the oral pretrial rulings that she had made on december.of relevance to this appeal is her ruling denying sahni motion for an order excluding evidence from trial or,in the alternative,compelling discovery and continuing the trial 
sahni motion was premised on the following facts.in october,gerald beaudoin,sahni first of four sets of attorneys in this case,served patelco with a request for production of documents and a notice of deposition of plaintiff amanda jones.production was to occur at beaudoin office at the time of jones deposition however,prior to the scheduled date,beaudoin withdrew as counsel.nevertheless,patelco responded to the request,agreeing to produce certain documents but objecting to the remainder on a variety of grounds,including relevance.this response was served on sudhir sahni personally.
no further action occurred regarding these discovery requests until sahni fourth and current counsel,chris rillo,took over on december.rillo came across these requests and sought the documents from patelco.patelco offered to produce the documents that it previously agreed to produce,but it refused to produce the documents to which it had previously objected.dissatisfied,rillo filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude all the evidence that patelco had refused to produce.he argued that patelco could not claim that the documents were irrelevant during discovery and then later admit them at trial.in the alternative,the motion sought to depose jones,obtain the requested documents,and continue the trial.
judge armstrong ruled that if sahni had wished to pursue the discovery,he should have done so within a reasonable time via federal rule of civil procedure.she did not consider his motion,filed on the eve of trial and over two years after service of the discovery requests,to be timely.instead,she attributed sahni failure to obtain the requested documents to lack of diligence.considering sahni motion to be legally and factually frivolous as well as untimely,and noting that patelco counsel had explained to rillo what had happened and warned that it would seek sanctions,judge armstrong granted patelco request for sanctions by a later order dated november,judge illston awarded sanctions in the amount of.
march,order granting partial summary judgment and ruling that sahni answer was not effectively amended at trial armstrong,
in the fall of,both sides of this lawsuit moved for summary judgment based on the evidence presented at the trial before judge schnacke and produced during discovery.on march,judge armstrong granted partial summary judgment for patelco and indicated that evidentiary hearings would be necessary on the remaining claims.judge armstrong held that the undisputed facts indicated that the plan was an erisa plan that the insurance policy was an asset of the plan that sahni was a fiduciary that sahni breached his fiduciary duties by charging the plan more in premiums than he paid to jordan jones to insure the plan and that sahni breached his fiduciary duties by depositing into his own account two checks totaling made payable to patelco from the plan insurer,standard insurance.judge armstrong ordered sahni to reimburse the above amounts.
judge armstrong also held that summary judgment was not appropriate as to patelco claims regarding administrative fees and insurance commissions.she concluded that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding sahni alleged disclosure of administrative fees that he was charging and insurance commissions that he was receiving.
finally,judge armstrong ruled that evidence admitted at trial did not effectively amend sahni answer to include a statute of limitations defense.she concluded that patelco failure to object to evidence that sahni had disclosed his administrative fees to patelco in did not imply consent to try a statute of limitations defense because the evidence was relevant to pleaded issues 
november,order denying reconsideration and setting amount of sanctions illston,
sometime after judge armstrong march,order discussed above,this case was reassigned to the honorable susan illston.both parties moved for judge illston to reconsider judge armstrong march order,and both parties moved regarding judge armstrong february,sanctions order.judge illston denied the motions for reconsideration.
as to judge armstrong february,order granting patelco motion for sanctions,judge illston denied sahni motion for reconsideration and set the amount of sanctions at.sahni had argued that the sanctions order failed to comply with rule,as amended in december,because patelco motion for sanctions was not made separately,but rather was combined with its opposition to sahni motion and patelco had not offered sahni the safe harbor of withdrawing his motion.
september,order granting summary judgment as to remaining claims illston,
on september,judge illston granted summary judgment on the claims that remained after judge armstrong order of march.the remaining issues were whether sahni was liable to restore insurance commissions that he had received and administrative fees that he had retained.judge illston stated pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,the court has determined that no further trial or hearing is necessary and hereby enters the following order based on the record developed in this action.based on the undisputed fact that sahni had received insurance commissions from jordan jones,judge illston concluded that this was a per se breach of fiduciary duty in violation of b.she concluded as a matter of law that b admits of no exceptions therefore,disclosure of prohibited transactions will not immunize a defendant from liability.judge illston ordered sahni to restore to the plan in undisputed commissions that he had received from jordan jones.
next,judge illston concluded that,based on the undisputed fact that sahni had retained administrative fees from patelco monthly payments to him,sahni likewise breached his fiduciary duties as established by b.judge illston restated her conclusion that disclosure could not redeem sahni retention of fees.
judge illston then turned to the question of what amount of fees sahni must restore to the plan.because the parties disputed what evidence judge schnacke admitted at trial and what testimony had been given,judge illston ordered further briefing,instructing the parties to cite to the exhibits admitted at trial and the testimony of witnesses.
march,order awarding patelco administrative fees and attorney fees illston,
on march,judge illston ordered sahni to restore in administrative fees to patelco.sahni contended that the administrative fees retained by him were only and that the remainder had been paid out to the employees medical care providers.therefore,the only dispute was over the amount of benefits that sahni had paid.because sahni was the breaching fiduciary,judge illston placed the burden on him to demonstrate the amount that he had paid on the plan behalf.she rejected sahni purported accounting because it relied upon checks that judge schnacke had excluded as unverifiable.she also declined to consider the declaration of donald lowell bailey,who opined as to the amount of administrative fees that remained unaccounted for,in part because he had relied upon the same excluded checks.having concluded that sahni had not carried his burden,judge illston ordered sahni to restore the full amount of unaccounted for funds.
iv.analysis 
proceedings following the unavailability of a judge 
sahni contends that,absent consent by both parties,due process requires a new trial when a judge becomes unavailable after conducting a bench trial but before entering findings of fact and conclusions of law.sahni per se rule is not compatible with federal rule of civil procedure 
if a trial or hearing has been commenced and the judge is unable to proceed,any other judge may proceed with it upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the proceedings in the case may be completed without prejudice to the parties.in a hearing or trial without a jury,the successor judge shall at the request of a party recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify again without undue burden.the successor judge may also recall any other witness.
when rule is applicable,its qualifying language assures that due process will not be violated when the successor judge proceeds where the original judge left off rather than ordering a new trial.the real issues in this case are to what extent did rule apply,and did the district court comply with the rule 
sahni argues that rule does apply in this case and that the district court failed to comply with it.it appears,however,that rule applies only where the successor judge steps into the shoes of the original judge in order to finish something that the original judge had started.the epitome of this would be for the substitute judge to make a finding of fact at a bench trial based on evidence heard by a different judge.advisory committee note to amend.in a less extreme situation,this court held that a successor judge must make a rule certification before deciding a motion for a new trial following a judgment entered by the original judge after a bench trial.canseco united states,cir.and the circuit recently held that rule applied to three motions a motion for a new trial,a motion to amend the original judge findings,and a motion to correct inadvertent omissions in the damages calculation.mergentime.metro.area transit,by refusing to consider the motions,the successor judge failed to comply with rule.after all,the original judge could not have refused to consider them.
however,as an alternative to stepping into the shoes of the unavailable district judge under rule,t he successor judge may examine the trial transcript as if it were supporting affidavits for summary judgment purposes and enter summary judgment if no credibility determinations are required.moore federal practice ed.a significant body of case law supports this proposition.see bromberg moul,cir see also chicago prof l sports.basketball ass n,cir suggesting that on remand successor judge could decide the case on the existing record if credibility determinations were unnecessary medicare glaser guardian photo,cir affirming resolution on summary judgment emerson,cir citing with approval rule from bromberg but reversing summary judgment because credibility was at issue mesa petroleum coniglio,cir affirming resolution on summary judgment in re schoenfield,cir citing with approval the rule from bromberg and affirming grant of new trial because credibility was at issue.thus,rule is not violated when no material facts are in dispute and the successor judge rules as a matter of law.
the law discussed above indicates that treating the trial record as affidavits in support of summary judgment is appropriate and does not run afoul of rule because this is the manner in which judge armstrong and judge illston proceeded,the issue becomes whether summary judgment was properly granted,an issue we discuss below.
summary judgment 
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.balint carson city,cir en banc.the court of appeals must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law and whether there are any genuine issues of material fact.id.we conclude that the district court did correctly apply the relevant substantive law and that there are no genuine issues of material fact.
statute of limitations 
there is no merit to sahni threshold argument that the evidence adduced at trial effectively amended his answer to include a statute of limitations affirmative defense.although federal rule of civil procedure b does provide for amendment w hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties,there was no such consent here.sahni does not contend that patelco expressly consented to try the statute of limitations issue.and,w hile it is true that a party failure to object to evidence regarding an unpleaded issue may be evidence of implied consent to a trial of the issue,it must appear that the party understood the evidence was introduced to prove the unpleaded issue.campbell trustees of leland stanford junior,cir.as we have explained 
the rule does not permit amendments to include issues which may be inferentially suggested by incidental evidence in the record.collecting cases an adverse party can not be expected to object to the introduction of evidence that is only tangentially related to the issues actually pleaded prior to trial unless the party has notice that the evidence is being introduced as proof on some other unpleaded issue.

sahni contends that patelco failure to object to evidence concerning alleged disclosures in constituted implicit consent to try the statute of limitations defense.we disagree.the evidence of sahni alleged disclosures was independently relevant to another issue being litigated,namely,sahni breach of fiduciary duties.the introduction of evidence that directly addresses a pleaded issue does not put the opposing party on notice that an unpleaded issue is being raised.acequia,clinton in re acequia,cir where evidence alleged to have shown implied consent was also relevant to the other issues at trial,it can not be used to imply consent to try the unpleaded issue.quotations and brackets omitted.therefore,patelco can not have been expected to object to the evidence,and its failure to do so does not signal its implicit consent to add the statute of limitations issue.compare galindo stoody,cir holding that numerous,direct references during trial raised issue.the district court did not err in rejecting this argument made by sahni in his motion for summary judgment.
erisa plan 
an erisa employee welfare benefit plan is a plan,fund or program,established or maintained by an employer through the purchase of insurance or otherwise,for the purpose of providing medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits to its participants or their beneficiaries,qualls blue cross of,cir kanne.life ins,cir.
sahni admitted in his answer that the plan is an employee welfare benefit plan.now,however,he contends that because the jordan jones policy which insured the over claims until patelco those claims itself was part of a welfare arrangement,patelco plan is not an employee welfare benefit plan.he relies upon mdphysicians assocs.state bd.of,cir,a case holding that a particular welfare arrangement was not itself an erisa employee welfare benefit plan.
however,whether a welfare arrangement itself is an employee welfare benefit plan is a separate question from whether an employer subscribing to a welfare arrangement has established an erisa employee welfare benefit plan its own employees.see id.at,credit managers ass of cal.kennesaw life accident ins,cir.the question is whether patelco plan is an erisa employee welfare benefit plan,not whether jordan jones welfare arrangement is one.crull gem ins,cir.here,the undisputed facts show that patelco established the plan to provide medical benefits to its employees,paying in one form or another all of the costs except an annual deductible.thus,the plan is an erisa employee welfare benefit plan.id.at.
erisa assets 
sahni contends that the two checks for benefits from standard insurance made payable to patelco are not erisa assets and,therefore,can not be the basis of erisa fiduciary liability under b.sahni argues that the policy was meant to protect patelco,not its employees,and cites department of labor advisory opinion,wl,for support.the opinion letter concludes that a policy is not a plan asset when purchased by an employer who has a plan that pays claims from its general assets.however,this authority is not binding 
an advisory opinion is an opinion of the department of labor as to the application of one or more sections of erisa,regulations promulgated under erisa,interpretive bulletins,or exemptions.the opinion assumes that all material facts and representations set forth in the request are accurate,and applies only to the situation described therein.only the parties described in the request for opinion may rely on the opinion,and they may rely on the opinion only to the extent that the request fully and accurately contains all the material facts and representations necessary to issuance of the opinion and the situation conforms to the situation described in the request for opinion.
erisa procedure,emphasis added.
moreover,sahni characterization of the policy as being for the protection of patelco rather than the employees is inaccurate and conflicts with statements made by this court.we have instructed that plan assets as used in b should be construed broadly in order to effectuate congress overriding concern with the protection of plan participants and beneficiaries.acosta pac,cir.patelco plan covers all claims above the employees deductible,so the policy protects the employees by ensuring that benefits will be available even in the case of catastrophic losses.the term funds or other property is intended to encompass all property which is used or may be used as a source for the payment of benefits to plan participants it does include all items in the nature of quick assets,such as cash,checks and other negotiable instruments 
furthermore,t o determine whether a particular item constitutes an asset of the plan,it is necessary to determine whether the item in question may be used to the benefit financial or otherwise of the fiduciary at the expense of plan participants or beneficiaries.acosta,at kayes pac.lumber,cir.the standard insurance benefit checks could certainly be used to the benefit of sahni.he received the checks directly from standard insurance and exercised exclusive control over the accounts in which the plan funds were kept.accordingly,the undisputed facts indicate that the checks are assets of the plan.
fiduciary status 
erisa defines fiduciary 
a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.
a emphasis added.the undisputed evidence of sahni control over plan assets is more than sufficient to establish that he was a fiduciary.dispositive in the instant case is this court explanation 
a treats control over the cash differently from control over administration.the statutory qualification,that control must be discretionary for it to establish fiduciary status,applies to the first and third phrases,management and administration but not to the second,assets.any control over disposition of plan money makes the person who has the control a fiduciary.
it am.life ins,cir see also yeseta baima,cir a fiduciary includes a person who exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of a plan assets.second brackets in original.
it is undisputed that sahni determined the amount of the monthly payments that patelco paid,which were deposited into an account under his sole control.then,at his own initiative and not at the direction of patelco,sahni transferred some of these funds to a different account from which he wrote checks to pay claims.furthermore,sahni alleges that he was entitled to keep,as his administrative fee,a portion of patelco monthly payments,so he necessarily exercised dominion over this portion of patelco funds as well.finally,sahni received and deposited benefits checks issued by standard insurance that were made payable to patelco.sahni significant,and in most respects exclusive,control over the plan assets makes him a fiduciary.see it,at the right to write checks on plan funds is authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets.
breach of fiduciary duties 
sahni was required to discharge his duties with respect to the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to them and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.a a in addition,sahni was prohibited from 
a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not 
deal with the assets of the plan in his own interest or for his own account,or 
receive any consideration for his own personal account from any party dealing with such plan in connection with a transaction involving the assets of the plan.
b pursuant to a patelco sought to have sahni make good to such plan any losses and to restore to such plan any profits.
sahni counters that c provides that the prohibition of b does not prohibit him from receiving any reasonable compensation for services rendered,or for the reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred,in the performance of his duties with the plan.therefore,sahni argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact existed regarding his disclosure of his compensation and the reasonableness of the amount.specifically,sahni contends that he disclosed his administrative fees in a meeting and letter that he made similar oral disclosures in and that,in any event,the funds he received or retained during the time he handled the plan were reasonable.sahni argues that not allowing him to receive reasonable compensation is unfair because he unquestionably incurred expenses in administering patelco plan.
the appropriateness of summary judgment turns on whether the reasonable compensation exception can apply to fiduciary in violation of b.if the reasonable compensation exception does not apply to fiduciary,then any issues of fact regarding alleged disclosures by sahni and the reasonableness of the amount of compensation become immaterial.
erisa provisions and department of labor regulations support the conclusion that the reasonable compensation exception applies only to transactions with parties in interest in violation of a and not to fiduciary in violation of b or a breach of the general duty of loyalty in violation of a a.a prohibits fiduciaries from causing the plan to engage in specified transactions with parties in interest e xcept as provided in section of this title.but b,which prohibits fiduciary,makes no mention of the exceptions in.department of labor regulations indicate that the exception in b applies only to a,not to b or a.
b exempts from the prohibitions of a payment by a plan to a party in interest,including a fiduciary,for office space or any service however,b does not contain an exemption from acts described in b relating to fiduciaries dealing with assets of plans in their own interest or for their own account or b relating to fiduciaries receiving consideration for their own personal account from any party dealing with a plan in connection with a transaction involving the assets of the plan.such acts are separate transactions not described in b b does not contain an exemption from other provisions of the act,such as 
a.more importantly,dol regulations also suggest that c,specifically at issue here,does not establish an independent exception,but rather only modifies b.
section b refers to the payment of reasonable compensation by a plan to a party in interest for services rendered to the plan.section c and b through b clarify what constitutes reasonable compensation for such services.
a accord donovan daugherty.
the few cases that have considered the applicability of to b are in accord that reasonable compensation does not apply to fiduciary.see lascala scrufari,d,the court finds that c reasonable compensation exemption,even if distinctly operative,will not provide a safe harbor to a plan fiduciary who has allegedly violated b.daniels employee benefit,thus,does not apply to b,because fiduciaries are prohibited from receiving or not a third party for transactions involving the plan to which they owe their fiduciary obligations.whitfield tomasso,t he exemptive provisions of sections b and c apply only to violations of section a,not violations of b.gilliam edwards,noting in dicta that a suggests that c has no independent exemptive power.under this reasoning,c does not provide a safe harbor to fiduciaries who.the gilliam court,referring to b,summarized this principle 
section b thus creates a per se erisa violation even in the absence of bad faith,or in the presence of a fair and reasonable transaction,b establishes a blanket prohibition of certain acts,easily applied,in order to facilitate congress remedial interest in protecting employee benefit plans.in essence,a combined reading of and and the relevant regulation suggests that a fiduciary,normally permitted to receive reasonable compensation for services rule is preserved by the not if is involved in the transaction securing the payment.
at citation omitted.
we conclude that the reasonable compensation provision does not apply to fiduciary therefore,any factual disputes about sahni alleged disclosures are immaterial.summary judgment was thus appropriate if the undisputed facts established that sahni engaged in.
it is undisputed that sahni received commissions from insurance companies with whom he placed patelco coverage,in violation of b.by his own admission,it is also undisputed that sahni paid insurance premiums for patelco coverage but marked up those premiums when charging that expense to patelco,in violation of b.and,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sahni,it is undisputed that at the very least he determined his own administrative fees and collected them himself from the plan funds,in violation of b.finally,it is undisputed that sahni received,deposited,and has failed to account for two benefits checks from standard insurance made payable to patelco in violation of b.thus,the undisputed facts establish,as a matter of law,that sahni breached his fiduciary duties by engaging in prohibited.
finally,in answer to sahni argument that disallowing him to retain any compensation would be unfair the apparent harshness of this rule is mitigated by a,which permits the secretary of labor to grant exemptions from b restrictions if special formal procedures are followed.gilliam.at.sahni does not contend that he followed those procedures.accordingly,the district court did not err in concluding that sahni had breached his fiduciary duties as a matter of law.
the amount to be restored 
having correctly concluded that sahni breached his fiduciary duties,judge illston next determined the amount that he would be required to restore to the plan.sahni
