for nearly thirteen years,plumbing services,psi made contributions to the plumbers and pipefitters national pension fund the fund,a multiemployer pension benefit plan governed by the employment retirement income security act of erisa,et.on march,however,psi stopped contributing to the fund.the fund,in turn,informed psi that it and its successor entity,psi mechanical,collectively defendants owed withdrawal liability pursuant to.when defendants failed to pay the sum owed,the fund filed suit.
defendants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the district court did not have personal jurisdiction over them.in the alternative,they sought a change in venue.the district court denied both motions.on the merits,defendants claimed that psi never agreed to be bound by an existing collective bargaining agreement requiring participating employers to make contributions to the fund.the district court disagreed,and granted the fund motion for summary judgment.because we find that the district court had personal and subject matter jurisdiction,venue was proper in virginia,and psi bound itself to make contributions to the fund,we affirm.
we begin by briefly setting out the relevant statutory framework.congress enacted erisa to promote the soundness and stability of employee benefit plans in private industry.a.specifically,erisa protects the interests of employees and their beneficiaries by establishing minimum standards assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.id.to further that end,congress in passed the multiemployer pension plan amendments act the mppaa.in part,the mppaa 
requires that an employer withdrawing from a multiemployer pension plan pay a fixed and certain debt to the pension plan.this withdrawal liability is the employer proportionate share of the plan unfunded vested benefits,calculated as the difference between the present value of vested benefits and the current value of the plan assets.

an employer owes withdrawal liability when it makes a complete or partial withdrawal from a pension plan.a.in the building and construction industry,a complete withdrawal occurs when an employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan,and the employer continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required.b.erisa treats all trades or businesses that are under common control as a single employer.b 
an employer who disputes an assessment of withdrawal liability may file an objection with the plan sponsor.b a.after a reasonable review of any matter raised,the plan sponsor must notify the employer of its decision,the basis for its decision,and the reason for any change in the determination of the employer liability or schedule of liability payments.id.b b.
an employer dissatisfied with the plan sponsor response must demand arbitration within a day period after the earlier of the date of the plan sponsor notification that it has rejected the employer request for review,or days after the employer request for review.a.u nlike the federal arbitration act,the mppaa treats an award issuing from such a arbitration like an agency arbitrator decides the issues in the first instance but then the decision is subject to judicial review.bd.of,sheet metal workers pension fund bes,cir.
if,however,the employer does not pursue arbitration,the amount assessed by the plan sponsor as withdrawal liability shall be due and owing on the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor,which may then bring an action in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction for collection.b.in such a circumstance,an employer is deemed to have waived review of all issues concerning the determination of withdrawal liability.bes,at.
the fund is a multiemployer pension benefit plan maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between the associated plumbing,heating and cooling contractors of jefferson county,alabama the multiemployer association and affiliated local unions of the united association of journeymen and apprentices of the plumbing and pipefitting industry of the united states and canada the union.defendants are alabama corporations engaged as plumbing and pipefitting contractors.
on april,kenneth julian psi sole in writing on behalf of psi to be bound by provisions of the current labor agreement executed and presently existing between the multiemployer association and the union.psi further agreed to make contributions to the plumbers and pipefitters national pension fund as provided for by the labor agreements now existing and as hereafter.id.
the collective bargaining agreement then in effect,as well as all successor agreements,required participating employers to make contributions to the fund for each hour worked by their employees.psi began making contributions to the fund in,and continued to do so until march.on that date,psi through julian wrote to the union stating that it wished to abolish its working relationship with the union.under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,psi obligation to contribute to the fund ended sixty days after tendering the march letter.psi went out of business sometime in the summer of.shortly before then,psi mechanical filed articles of incorporation.
well over a year after psi sent the march letter,the fund notified julian that because psi was continuing to perform work of the type for which it was previously obligated to make contributions to the fund in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement,psi had incurred withdrawal liability of.specifically,the fund suspected that psi and psi mechanical were trades or businesses under common control.in fact,julian was the sole shareholder of both corporations.
the fund gave psi the option to pay the amount owed in one lump sum or in monthly installments.psi objected and sought review of the imposition of withdrawal liability.the fund in turn asked psi to respond to a questionnaire so as to better enable the fund to assess psi objection.psi,however,refused to answer any questions related to psi mechanical,stating that it was not privy to information necessary to answer them.
in the meantime,psi was still required to make monthly payments on its withdrawal liability.see c.yet,psi did not comply with its obligation.the fund sent two notices to psi and received no response to either.the fund subsequently rejected psi objection to the imposition of withdrawal liability,declared psi in default,and demanded payment of the entire sum of its withdrawal liability plus accrued interest.defendants made no payments,nor did they demand arbitration.
the fund filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia against both psi and psi mechanical,seeking to collect psi unpaid monthly withdrawal liability payments,along with interest,liquidated damages,and attorney fees and costs it also sought to compel defendants to make future monthly payments when due.the fund later amended its complaint to ask for the entire outstanding withdrawal liability 
defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction,or alternatively,on forum non conveniens grounds.they argued that because psi and psi mechanical are alabama corporations engaged in business exclusively in alabama,they do not have sufficient minimum contacts with virginia for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.in the alternative,defendants urged that the lawsuit be dismissed because there is an adequate alternative forum in the northern district of alabama.
the district court denied the motions.the court found it pelucidly sic clear that there is personal jurisdiction.it noted that erisa provides for nationwide service of process and permits lawsuits to be brought in the district where the plan is administered.as a result,the court exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants comported with fifth amendment due process principles.
the district court construed defendants forum non conveniens claim as one seeking a change of venue under a.it declined to grant relief,however,because the eastern district of virginia was the plaintiff forum of choice and only moderately inconvenient for defendants.the court further observed that witnesses were unlikely to be needed,and that the interest of justice weighed in favor of keeping the case in virginia.
the fund then moved for summary judgment on the sole count of its amended complaint,which the district court granted.thereafter,the fund sought liquidated damages,interest,and attorney fees and costs.defendants opposed the request,claiming that the contract that the fund was seeking to enforce was not sufficiently definite.to assess this claim,the district court reviewed the collective bargaining agreement in effect when julian signed the letter of assent,as well as a successor agreement.
the district court held that the collective bargaining agreement was neither fatally vague nor unclear the agreement makes clear that a breaching party will be liable for unpaid contributions upon complete withdrawal,interest on those unpaid contributions,liquidated damages,and attorney fees and costs.the court found immaterial and unpersuasive defendants allegation that julian never read nor understood the agreement because he nevertheless agreed to be bound by it.id.the court entered judgment in favor of the fund in the amount of.
from the district court judgment,defendants appeal.
we first consider the district court order denying defendants motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and to transfer venue.we review the district court decision as to personal jurisdiction de novo,although the underlying factual findings are reviewed for clear error.carefirst of,carefirst pregnancy,cir.we review decisions on whether to transfer venue under for abuse of discretion.brock entre computer,cir.
defendants say that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them because they are alabama corporations that do business exclusively in alabama and have no contacts with virginia.the district court correctly rejected this contention.
as the district court noted,any action brought under erisa may be brought in the district where the plan is administered.e.furthermore,erisa provides for nationwide service of process.id.the fund is administered in alexandria,virginia,which is within the eastern district of virginia,and defendants were properly served.where a defendant has been validly served pursuant to a federal statute nationwide service of process provision,a district court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant so long as jurisdiction comports with the fifth amendment.esab,centricut,cir.
to make out a fifth amendment challenge to personal jurisdiction,defendants had to show that the district court assertion of personal jurisdiction over them would result in such extreme inconvenience or unfairness as would outweigh the congressionally articulated policy evidenced by a nationwide service of process provision.denny,cake,cir quoting esab,at.normally,when a defendant is a united states resident,it is highly unusual that inconvenience will rise to a level of constitutional concern.esab,at internal quotation marks omitted.
defendants have not satisfied this heavy burden.indeed,in their brief,defendants fail to apply the correct rule of law,citing the minimum contacts standard we consider when assessing whether personal jurisdiction is consistent with the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see int l shoe washington,als scan,digital serv.consultants,cir.that standard,however,is not relevant when the basis for jurisdiction is found in a federal statute containing a nationwide service of process provision.given defendants failure to show that the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction raises a fifth amendment concern,they must look primarily to federal venue requirements for protection from onerous litigation.esab,at quoting hogue milodon eng g,cir.
on that score,defendants contend that because they are alabama corporations with no business ties to virginia,the district court was obligated to transfer this case to the northern district of alabama we do not agree.
under a,f or the convenience of parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.district courts within this circuit consider four factors when deciding whether to transfer venue the weight accorded to plaintiff choice of venue witness convenience and access convenience of the parties and the interest of justice,lynch vanderhoef builders,d,bd.of,sheet metal workers fund baylor heating air conditioning,citing gulf oil gilbert.
as a general rule,a plaintiff choice of venue is entitled to substantial weight in determining whether transfer is appropriate.bd.of trs.sullivant,llc,d.moreover,congress intended in erisa cases to give a plaintiff choice of forum somewhat greater weight than would typically be the case,as evidenced by erisa liberal venue provision.cross fleet reserve ass pension plan,d,internal quotation marks omitted.given the substantial weight accorded to this first factor,defendants need to make a compelling showing on the remaining factors to persuade us that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to transfer venue.this they fail to do.
the salience of the witness convenience and access factor is obviated by psi failure to demand arbitration.by failing to arbitrate,psi waived its right to raise any defenses to the assessment of withdrawal liability.thus,the district court properly concluded that there would be little,if any,need for witnesses.
as to the third factor,defendants have not persuaded us that defending this case in virginia was so inconvenient to them as to warrant transfer.on this point,defendants emphasize that alabama is where all events relative to the litigation took place.appellant br.at.however,it is not unusual for some or all of the relevant acts in an erisa lawsuit to have taken place outside the district where the plan is administered.congress nonetheless saw fit to lay venue there,and we see no reason why that legislative intent should yield in this case.defendants also make no argument as to why the interest of justice favors hearing this case in alabama.consequently,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to transfer venue.
defendants also urge that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the fund claim.their first there was no enforceable contract requiring psi to make contributions to the a merits argument that we address later.here,we consider only defendants claim that the fund action for withdrawal liability is actually a claim for postcontract contributions and therefore arises under of the national labor relations act,a,rather than erisa.in essence,defendants argue that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the fund claim involves an unfair labor practice that should have been brought before the national labor relations board.that is not correct.
under erisa,an employer that is contractually obligated to make contributions to a retirement fund must do so in accordance with the operative collective bargaining agreement.section thereby creates a federal right of action allowing a multiemployer pension plan to collect delinquent contributions.bakery confectionary union and indus.int l pension fund ralph grocery,cir.
an action to compel an employer to pay overdue withdrawal liability is treated the same as an action to collect delinquent contributions.b.and federal district courts have jurisdiction to hear actions compelling an employer to pay withdrawal liability.id.c.this being an action to collect overdue withdrawal liability payments,the district court plainly had subject matter jurisdiction.
