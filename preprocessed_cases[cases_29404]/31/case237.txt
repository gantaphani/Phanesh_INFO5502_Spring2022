plaintiff sally burke sued the retirement income plan administrators of her deceased husband employer,the eastman kodak company kodak,for denying her survivor income benefits.she alleged that defendants kodak retirement income plan krip and kodak retirement income plan committee kripco collectively,the plan administrators based their denial on a deficient summary plan description spd in violation of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.
the united states district court for the western district of new york larimer,granted defendants summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.the court held that the spd complied with erisa disclosure requirements.the court further concluded that even if the spd were defective,burke could not show that she relied on the spd to her detriment.we disagree with both conclusions.
the spd was defective for omitting a critical restriction on burke eligibility for survivor income benefits as a domestic partner.moreover,requiring plan participants or beneficiaries to show detrimental reliance to recover for a deficient spd contravenes erisa objective to promote distribution of accurate spds to employees.we now adopt a prejudice standard and find that burke was prejudiced as a matter of law.
background 
kenneth burke was a kodak employee for years.before their marriage on may,and burke lived together for eight years as domestic partners.in,burke suffered a physically and mentally debilitating stroke.in the fall of,after the couple had been married for less than six months,burke died of lung cancer.
burke was a participant in kodak survivor income benefits sib plan,which provided payments to spouses,domestic partners,dependent children or dependent parents upon the death of the employee.as required by erisa,kodak distributed an spd contained in an approximately page employee handbook,summarizing its employee benefits plan the plan,including sib.the plan and sixteen sections of the spd explicitly require domestic partners to file a joint affidavit on a form provided by the plan administrator if they wish to be eligible for various types of benefits.significantly,the section of the handbook that deals with sib fails to mention the affidavit requirement.
to publicize the benefits available to domestic partners,kodak circulated a employee benefits newsletter and a benefits update.the newsletter and update explained that domestic partners had to file an affidavit of domestic partnership to qualify for certain employee benefits,including sib.after the newsletter and benefits update were circulated,kodak issued a revised version of its spd.the sib section of the new spd,however,omitted the affidavit requirement.
the week after burke death,kodak sent burke a letter describing the benefits available to a surviving spouse of more than one year.in response,burke called kodak to explain that she had been married for less than a year.by a second letter,kodak informed burke that,because she was married for less than a year,she was ineligible for sib.this letter referred to page of an enclosed handbook for spousal eligibility requirements.
the handbook also happened to contain a paragraph stating that aggrieved beneficiaries should file an appeal of kodak initial denial within ninety days.in this case,ninety days from kodak initial denial was february.almost five months later,burke finally appealed to the plan administrators.
in her appeal,burke included an affidavit describing her domestic partnership status.in her appeal letter,she cited her distraught emotional state upon the death of her husband as the reason for her failure to appeal within the limitations period.unmoved,the plan administrators denied her appeal as untimely and further stated that,even had her appeal been timely,burke was ineligible for sib as a domestic partner because the burkes never filed the joint affidavit required by the plan.
burke then filed this erisa action.her claim is that the spd was deficient because it failed to set forth the affidavit requirement in the section dealing with sib.after discovery,kodak moved for summary judgment.
the district court rejected the plan administrators attempt to invoke the limitation.in the court view,kodak notice to burke of the period was inadequate.the court also held that burke could qualify for benefits both as a surviving spouse and as a domestic partner.it therefore reached the merits of her claim,but affirmed the plan administrators denial of survivor income benefits because the burkes had failed to comply with the domestic partnership affidavit requirement.it also held,in the alternative,that even if the spd was deficient,burke failed to demonstrate that she relied to her detriment on the spd.see burke kodak ret.income plan,d.
burke now appeals.
discussion 
preliminarily,the plan administrators argue that burke claims were barred by her failure to exhaust her administrative remedies and her application for survivor income benefits as a domestic partner was moot.we find these arguments without merit.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
the plan administrators claim that burke failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and thus the district court erred in reaching the merits of her erisa claim.burke concedes,as she must,that she appealed krip denial of benefits after the limitations period.the district court,nevertheless,refused to enforce the limitation and we agree.
whether burke exhausted her administrative remedies under erisa is a question of law we review de novo.see kinkead sw bell.sickness accident disability benefit plan,cir exhaustion is a threshold legal issue we review de novo.
we require the exhaustion of administrative remedies for the denial of erisa benefits.see,chapman choicecare long island term disability plan,cir.the erisa regulations adopted by the department of labor dol allow employers to impose a time limit on the right to appeal,so long as it is not shorter than sixty days.see h i.where a claimant fails to appeal a denial of benefits under an employee plan within the prescribed time limit,the court will generally not reach the merits of her claim.see,chapman,at.
under the erisa statute and the dol regulations,the denial must notify the claimant of appeal procedures under the plan.see.a written notice of denial must be comprehensible and provide the claimant with the information necessary to perfect her claim,including the time limits applicable to administrative review.id.a notice that fails to substantially comply with these requirements does not trigger a time bar contained within the plan.see white jacobs eng g group long term disability benefit plan,cir.
kodak notice was inadequate for two reasons.
first,kodak initial denial letter does not expressly say that burke had ninety days to appeal.rather,the letter contains a to page of the handbook,which deals with spousal eligibility.that handbook also contains an appeals on page,but on page that an aggrieved beneficiary should appeal within days.this section,however,does not help kodak.based on the denial letter exclusive reference to spousal eligibility,burke focus in turning to the handbook would justifiably have been on her eligibility,not on the time limit for appeals.see ross diversified benefit plans,notice insufficient where denial letter did not mention the plan appeal procedure or specifically refer the claimant to the plan book for information about the appeal procedure.
the plan administrators argue that the denial letter need not inform an individual of her appeal rights provided that the materials accompanying the letter do so.their position,however,is disingenuous.the cases the plan administrators cite for this proposition involved denial letters that contained notice of appeal rights.see white,at denial letter informed white that he had days to appeal gruber unum life ins.of,d,denial letter stated that plaintiff could have the decision reviewed if she made a request in writing within days kenavan empire blue cross blue shield,wl,at,explanation of benefits form contained the following notice important if you do not agree with the amount approved you may ask for a review.to do this you must write to us within six months.
secondly,even if kodak denial letter had the time limitation provision in the handbook,the language requiring appeal within ninety days is opaque 
if you remain dissatisfied and wish to appeal,you should,within days of the date the claim was denied or within days of the date the claim is assumed to be denied,write a letter to the plan administrator asking for a review.
bold and italics in original.
the kodak handbook use of the word should is grossly uninformative.harris county hosp.dist.shalala,aff,cir should,in administrative manual,is mandatory only when used as the past tense of shall.otherwise,should is precatory.emphasis in original.it is not necessary to hold that should can never be construed as mandatory.see doe hampton,use of should rather than shall or must is not automatically determinative of whether regulation is mandatory or merely precatory.in this case,however,we decline to equate should with shall or must.
here,kodak could easily have used unambiguous mandatory language.see,carpenter frontier,slip op.at,finding that the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies where the denial of claim letter stated that s hould you desire a review,you must send a written request emphasis added see also gruber,d at the letter clearly sets forth the procedures and time limit for obtaining a review.in fact,in at least sixteen places other than the sib section,kodak knew how to employ mandatory language.for example,it admonished that a n affidavit of domestic partnership must be signed by you and your domestic partner.emphasis added.moreover,the appeals provision in the handbook does not even suggest the adverse consequences of failing to appeal within ninety days.
under these circumstances,we conclude that burke was denied the opportunity for the full and fair review contemplated by and the dol regulations.
ii.mootness 
the plan administrators also argue that burke marriage mooted her efforts to qualify as a domestic partner and,consequently,the district court erred in reaching the merits of her claim.although it did not address this issue,the district court assumed that burke could apply for benefits as either a spouse or domestic partner.see burke,d at.we agree.
the plan administrators are vested with discretion to interpret the plan.accordingly,their interpretation of burke eligibility under the plan provisions is subject to the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.see kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir.
their interpretation that burke could not qualify as a domestic partner once she was married smells of the lamp.it does not appear in their denial letter,but was explicitly raised for the first time in the ensuing litigation between the parties.regardless of timing,their interpretation of domestic partnership and spousal eligibility as mutually exclusive is arbitrary and capricious.
surprisingly,the plan administrators assert that their interpretation is obvious.however,neither the sib section,nor the spd provides that once an otherwise eligible domestic partner marries,the couple forfeits any claim to benefits as domestic partners if the plan participant dies less than a year later.such a bizarre consequence of entering into a marriage should not be left to inference.
finally,kodak interpretation is not only arbitrary,but probably illegal.if,as the plan administrators argue,marriage moots domestic partnership status,the plan requirement means that domestic partners face a year of if they decide to get married.this result can not be condoned.as burke correctly points out,it would be blatantly discriminatory to provide for a forfeiture of benefits by reason of marriage alone for an otherwise qualified and eligible beneficiary.
the district court was therefore correct to consider whether burke could apply for benefits as either a spouse or domestic partner.
iii.burke erisa claims 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to,and drawing all inferences in favor of,the.see,ibm liberty mut.fire ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if it can be established that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
the parties agree that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies to the plan administrators decision to deny benefits to burke for her failure to comply with the domestic partnership affidavit requirement.under this deferential standard,we can reverse their decision only if it is without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence,or erroneous as a matter of law.see,celardo gny auto.dealers health welfare trust,cir.despite the parties agreement,however,the standard of review to be applied when the question is whether the spd complies with erisa disclosure requirements is not so clear.at least one court has applied a de novo standard.see rhorer raytheon eng constructors,cir.we have not decided the applicable standard.see layaou xerox,cir because we find that xerox spd failed to provide adequate notice under either an arbitrary and capricious or de novo standard of review we express no view on whether the deferential standard is applicable to a plan administrator interpretation of an spd,where it has been determined that the spd violates the disclosure requirements of erisa.nor are we required in this case to resolve the applicable standard because,as in layaou,burke would prevail under either standard.
erisa requirements 
erisa requires employers to distribute spds describing the plan benefits to their employees.a b.the spd must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and must be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to apprise participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.id.at a.significantly,the spd must contain the plan eligibility requirements for benefits as well as the circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility or denial or loss of benefits.id.at b see also l.
erisa further requires that the spd format not mislead or fail to inform participants and beneficiaries about the plan and any limitations or restrictions of plan benefits must not be minimized,rendered obscure,or otherwise made to appear unimportant.see b.restrictions on benefits need not be disclosed in close conjunction with the description or summary of benefits provided that adjacent to the benefit description the page on which the restrictions are described is noted.id.requirement see also id.at a the use of clear is usually required in an spd.
where the terms of a plan and the spd conflict,the spd controls.see heidgerd olin,cir.this may be startling at first blush but it makes sense when it is recalled that the spd will be an employee primary source of information regarding employment benefits,and employees are entitled to rely on the descriptions contained in the summary.id.at.
kodak does not dispute that the burkes would have satisfied the requirements for domestic partnership,if only they had filed the domestic partnership affidavit.burke argues that this requirement can not be applied to her because it was not mentioned in the sib section.we agree.
the district court noted that the eligibility requirements for domestic partnership status are spelled out sixteen times in various benefits sections of the spd.burke,d at.in all sixteen places,this affidavit requirement states 
an affidavit of domestic partnership must be signed by you and your domestic partner,and filed with kodak in order to qualify your domestic partner for plan benefits.
the affidavit must also be prepared on a form provided by the plan administrator.
emphasizing the explicit domestic partnership requirements in sixteen sections of the spd,the district court concluded that,when read as a whole the affidavit requirement could not have been set forth more clearly.burke,d at.however,the fact remains that none of these references is noted under sib,which appears as a section in a page handbook.because the relevant section of the spd omits the affidavit requirement,it conflicts with t
