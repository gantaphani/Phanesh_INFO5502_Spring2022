to ensure the viability of multiemployer pension plans against the failure of a contributing employer,the mppaa has broad provisions that disregard the usual legal barriers between affiliated,but legally distinct,businesses.all trades or businesses under common control are treated as a single employer for the purpose of collecting withdrawal liability,and each is jointly and severally liable for the withdrawal liability of another.see b corbett macdonald moving,cir citing.b and c to.

under the mppaa,an employer incurs withdrawal liability when it withdraws from a multiemployer pension plan.see a.the purpose of withdrawal liability is to relieve the funding burden on remaining employers and to eliminate the incentive to pull out of a plan which would result if liability were imposed only on a mass withdrawal by all employers.ilgwu ret.fund levy.frocks,cir quoting,pt,at,as reprinted in.the mppaa thus protect s the interests of participants and beneficiaries in financially distressed multiemployer plans and encourage s the growth and maintenance of multiemployer plans,welfare pension funds,of local int l longshoremen ass n,cir.withdrawal liability discourages employers from evading their obligations to pension funds by fractionalizing or balkanizing their operations.see bd.of trs.of the conf.of teamsters pension tr.fund johnson,cir.
