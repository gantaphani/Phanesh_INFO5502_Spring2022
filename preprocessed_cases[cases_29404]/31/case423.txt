the plaintiffs,each of whom purports to represent a class of others similarly situated,are former employees who maintained accounts in k defined contribution retirement plans sponsored by their employers and who,upon leaving employment,voluntarily sought and obtained full distribution of the vested benefits in their respective accounts.they commenced these actions under the employee retirement income security act of erisa against the fiduciaries of their respective retirement plans,for breach of their fiduciary duties to the plans based on the fiduciaries knowing investment in mutual funds that allowed investors to practice market timing,an abusive form of arbitrage activity that favored the market timers and harmed investors in the funds,such as the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs sued the fiduciaries under a and a of erisa,which allow for a derivative action to be brought by a retirement plan participant on behalf of the plan to obtain recovery for losses sustained by the plan because of breaches of fiduciary duties.
the defendants filed motions to dismiss the plaintiffs claims,challenging their standing to assert the claims under both erisa and article iii of the constitution.the district court granted their motions,finding that the plaintiffs did not fall within the class of individuals authorized to sue under erisa a because,having of the plans,they were no longer seeking benefits,as required to have statutory authority to sue,but rather money damages.
because we conclude that former employees remain participants in defined contribution retirement plans for purposes of a of erisa when they seek to recover amounts that they claim should have been in their accounts had it not been for alleged fiduciary impropriety,we find that they have statutory standing.and because the plans at issue are defined contribution plans,rather than defined benefit plans,we reject the defendants argument that the plaintiffs injuries are not redressable and therefore that they lack article iii standing.accordingly,we reverse the judgments of the district court and remand these cases for further proceedings.
when craig wangberg miriam calderon,jessica corbett,and anita walker retired from their respective employments,they voluntarily cashed out their vested interests in defined contribution retirement plans that their employers had sponsored.defined contribution plans are plans that provide for individual accounts and that define the participants benefits as the contents of their accounts,including contributions from both participants and employers,as well as the investment gains minus investment losses and any allocable plan expenses.see.before these employees had been paid the value of their accounts in the defined contribution plans,the plans had invested in various mutual funds that allowed investors to practice a form of arbitrage known as market timing,in which investors move in and out of the funds to take advantage of the temporary differentials between the mutual funds net asset value nav and the market price of the component stocks during the course of a day.not only does market timing favor the market timers at the expense of investors in mutual funds,it also increases the funds costs and impairs investment performance.see generally sec pimco advisors fund mgmt.llc,d,prusky reliastar life ins,cir see also disclosure regarding market timing and selective disclosure of portfolio holdings,proposed,describing mutual fund market timing in detail.
market timing can harm mutual fund investors by causing mutual funds to manage their portfolios in a manner that is disadvantageous to shareholders.disclosure regarding market timing.at.for example,investment advisors might maintain a larger percentage of fund assets in cash or liquidate certain portfolio securities prematurely to meet higher levels of redemptions due to market timing activity occurring within the fund.id.it would make little sense for a fund manager to invest in assets with significant potential but high volatility if a market timer redemptions could force the quick sale of fund assets.pimco,d at.moreover,market timing can increas e trading and brokerage costs,as well as tax liabilities,incurred by a fund and spread across all fund investors.id.
market timing can be especially problematic when it occurs in mutual funds that invest in overseas securities because the time zone differences allow market timers to purchase shares of such funds based on events occurring after foreign market closing prices are established,but before the fund nav calculation.disclosure regarding market timing.at.prior to the daily nav calculation,which in the united states generally occurs at or near the closing time of the major securities markets,the fund price would not take into account any changes that have affected the value of the foreign security.therefore,if the foreign security had increased in value,the nav for the mutual fund would be artificially low.id.after purchasing the shares at the low price,the market timer would redeem the fund shares the next day when the fund share price would reflect the increased prices in foreign markets,for a quick profit at the expense of fund shareholders.id.market timing opportunities also exist in mutual funds that do not invest in foreign markets,such as stocks and bonds,which are relatively illiquid assets and are not frequently traded.see also richard levine,yvonne cristovici richard jacobsen,mutual fund market timing,fed.lawyer,at.
the harm that market timing can cause to the interests of investors,especially investors,has led many mutual funds to adopt policies and to impose fees intended to limit market timing within their funds.it has also led to increased regulatory action by the securities and exchange commission.see,disclosure regarding market timing.at.in addition,in,both state and federal regulators began investigating mutual funds that allowed the practice.these investigations led to settlements totaling more than billion paid by investment advisors to mutual funds in approximately mutual fund complexes.in the wake of this regulatory activity,hundreds of civil actions alleging abusive mutual fund market timing were filed by mutual fund investors and participants in employee retirement plans.
the civil actions concerning mutual fund market timing,including the four cases appealed to us,were transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to three judges in the district of maryland for coordinated pretrial proceedings.see in re janus mut.funds inv,d.
the plaintiffs in the four cases initially before us filed class action claims against their employers and other fiduciaries of their defined contribution retirement plans,which had invested in mutual funds allowing activity.at the time they commenced these actions,none of the plaintiffs remained employed by the companies sponsoring their plans,nor did any continue to have open accounts with these plans.they had all cashed out their vested benefits.in their complaints,brought under erisa a,the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant fiduciaries knowingly invested in mutual funds that allowed improper and abusive market timing,materially diluting the value of the funds and therefore the value of their individual retirement accounts,in violation of the fiduciary duties imposed by erisa a.they alleged that due to the breach of fiduciary duties,their individual retirement accounts in the defined contribution plans suffered a diminution in value and that therefore they did not receive the full benefits to which they were entitled under the relevant plans when they cashed out.the defendants filed motions to dismiss,arguing that because each of the named plaintiffs had terminated his or her employment and had cashed out of his or her retirement plan,taking a full distribution of the account contents before filing suit,the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue.
the district court initially denied the defendants motions to dismiss in three of the cases,finding that the plaintiffs in those cases had standing to bring their erisa claims.corbett marsh mclennan,no,civ,wl,calderon amvescap plc,no,civ,wl,walker.financial servs,no,civ,wl.when it came time to decide the motion to dismiss in wangberg case,however,the district court reached a contrary conclusion and granted the motion,concluding that former employees are not afforded the right to sue under erisa a.wangberger janus capital group,in re mut.funds inv,no,civ,wl.explaining the discrepancy in outcomes,the court stated that after deciding the first three cases,it was persuaded by a number of district courts that had in the interim found a lack of standing in similar cases after reversing its position in deciding wangberger,the district court then reconsidered its earlier decisions in corbett,calderon,and walker and granted the motions to dismiss for lack of standing in each of those cases also.in dismissing the four cases,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs claims were more in the nature of claims for damages than for payment of a vested benefit.in re mutual funds invest,wl,at.it explained 
my ruling should not be read as implying that former participants do not have standing to sue plan fiduciaries or the plan itself in the event that a plan obtains a recovery in an investor class action and then chooses not to distribute a pro rata portion of the recovery to former participants whose retirement accounts held shares in the relevant mutual funds during the class period.if that were to occur,the focus of litigation instituted by a former plan participant would be upon how to allocate a sum certain among various beneficiaries with conflicting claims,not upon determining the fiduciaries asserted liability for making imprudent,in the event of a finding of to a set amount alleged investment losses of inherently inchoate value.these questions are quite different from one another,and former participants may have the right to assure that the plan or its fiduciaries distribute to them,rather than giving to others or retaining for the plan itself,benefits that in fairness and good conscience are due to them.
the plaintiffs in each of the four cases appealed,and we consolidated their appeals to decide the single issue of whether the plaintiffs have statutory and constitutional standing.subsequently,the parties to the walker case filed a stipulation of voluntary dismissal,leaving us with three cases on appeal.
arguing from the language of erisa,the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred because participants benefits in a defined contribution plan are vested in all contributions and earnings and any other plan assets allocated to their individual accounts.because the plans assets including recovery from loss are considered the benefits of the plans participants,when each plaintiff took the distribution of his or her account,the account had lost value due to defendants actions,and therefore each has a colorable claim to the appropriate increase in his or her vested benefit,giving each standing to assert that claim.
the defendants contend that because the plaintiffs have already been paid their full contributions,they do not have a colorable claim to vested benefits,citing firestone tire rubber bruch,d.they argue that benefits are defined in the present as the amount contributed to the participant account as well as any income,expenses,gains and losses which may be allocated to such participant account.amplifying on this,they state 
here,plaintiffs have already received the entirety of the net contributions to their accounts,and thus have no claim much less a colorable one that they are owed some or all of those contributions.upon termination of their employment,plaintiffs received lump sum distributions of their respective contributions net of expenses,is,all benefits then vested.they make no claim that these amounts were miscalculated or misstated.for this reason,plaintiffs err in arguing that i t is the claim to that amount that must be colorable,not the amount itself.plaintiffs have no colorable claim to any amount of vested benefits.
we begin with the relevant texts,noting that erisa a provides that a participant may bring a civil action against fiduciaries for breaches of their duties as articulated in erisa a.see a.section a provides 
any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities,obligations,or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach,and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary,and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate,including removal of such fiduciary.
a emphasis added.the participant who may so sue is defined to be 
any employee or former employee of an employer,or any member or former member of an employee organization,who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization,or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.
emphasis added.as noted,the supreme court in firestone defined a participant under these sections of erisa to include a former employee with a colorable claim to vested benefits.firestone,at.
after the district court entered its judgments in these cases,denying the plaintiffs standing,the supreme court decided larue dewolff,boberg associates,d,in which the court took firestone a step further and held that erisa authorized a former employee to sue his former employer and the defined contribution plan for breach of fiduciary obligation that caused a loss in his individual plan account,to claim any profit which would have accrued to the plan if there had been no breach of trust.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.while plaintiff larue had argued in the district court that he only wanted the plan to properly reflect that which would be his interest in the plan,but for the breach of fiduciary duty,the district court rejected that argument and concluded that since the defendants did not possess any disputed funds that rightly belonged to him,the plaintiff was seeking damages rather than equitable relief.id.at.reversing the district court and the court of appeals,the supreme court concluded that the plaintiff was authorized to bring his claim for loss of plan assets in his individual account under erisa a,notwithstanding its earlier decision in massachusetts mutual life insurance russell,d.in russell,the court had held that a provided remedies only for entire plans,not for individuals.at.the larue court,however,distinguished russell on the basis that the russell court addressed a defined benefit plan rather than a defined contribution plan as the larue court explained 
misconduct by the administrators of a defined benefit plan will not affect an individual entitlement to a defined benefit unless it creates or enhances the risk of default by the entire plan.
at emphasis added.but in a defined contribution plan,the court pointed out,the benefit is the participant interest in an individual account,and the misconduct need not threaten the solvency of the entire plan to reduce benefits below the amount that participants would otherwise receive.id.at.the court noted that the diminishment of plan assets payable through individual accounts was the kind of harm that concerned the draftsmen of.id.thus,the larue court held 
a lthough a does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries,that provision does authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant individual account.
id.at emphasis added.
we believe that the holding in larue controls the outcome here.
thus,while firestone held that former employees who maintained active retirement accounts with funds invested in them would qualify as participants under erisa,larue took the short additional step to conclude that even a former employee who cashed out his vested benefits in a plan would remain a participant,so long as the fiduciaries are chargeable with any profit which would have accrued to the plan if there had been no bre
