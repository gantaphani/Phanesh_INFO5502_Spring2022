opinion of the court 
appellant metropolitan life insurance company metlife is the claims fiduciary of an employee welfare benefit plan.see employee retirement income security act of erisa.after one of the plan participants died,metlife received competing claims to the decedent benefits.it responded by filing this interpleader action against the competing claimants.the district court raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte and dismissed.in our view,however,the district court had federal question jurisdiction.accordingly,we will vacate and remand.
the new jersey transit corporation sponsors a basic life plan for the benefit of its employees.the plan is funded through a group life insurance policy issued by metlife to new jersey transit.metlife is the plan claims fiduciary.
paul price was a participant in the plan.he was a bus driver with new jersey transit and had enrolled for in life insurance benefits.in may,paul passed away.he was survived by his widow,sandra price,and his children from a previous marriage,shannon and andre price.
after paul death,his widow and his children submitted competing claims for the life insurance benefits.metlife investigated the matter and discovered that,in or around february,paul designated his widow as the primary beneficiary.metlife then informed the children attorney that it was denying their claims.metlife explained that it had a fiduciary duty to administer claims in accordance with erisa and the terms of the plan.appendix app.as such,it had to pay the proceeds to the named beneficiary only.
the children attorney requested a review of the claim.paul first marriage had ended in with a final judgment of divorce in new jersey superior court.paragraph of that judgment specifically referenced paul life insurance 
the husband currently has life insurance upon his life.the husband shall amend these policies in order to name the children of the marriage as irrevocable beneficiaries until such time as andre price,the son of the marriage,is emancipated.the husband shall name the wife as trustee.
app.since andre remained unemancipated at the time of paul death,the children claimed they were the rightful beneficiaries under the divorce judgment plain terms.
this left metlife in a quandary.under erisa,it had a duty to administer claims in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.a d.these documents instructed metlife to pay the benefits to paul designated widow.under the new jersey divorce judgment,however,the children were to be designated irrevocable beneficiaries.
normally,erisa preempts any state law that relate s to an employee benefit plan.a egelhoff egelhoff,d.however,erisa as amended by the retirement equity act of contains an exception from this general rule for qualified domestic relations orders qdros.b,d b e see boggs boggs,d.a qdro assigns to an alternate payee the right to receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan.d b i 
metlife informed the competing claimants that it could not tell whether a court would find that th e divorce decree is a qdro.app.it noted that if the new jersey judgment is a qdro,then in all likelihood the children should get the.it further noted that if the judgment is not a qdro,then price widow is entitled to the money metlife stated that if the claimants did not resolve the matter amicably,it would bring suit.price widow and the children negotiated,but they failed to reach an agreement.the children attorney then asked metlife to k indly initiate an interpleader action.app.
metlife obliged,bringing this suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.on its own motion,the district court raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed.this appeal followed.we review de novo the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.ifc interconsult,ag safeguard int l partners,llc,cir.
the equitable remedy of interpleader allows a person holding property to join in a single suit two or more persons asserting claims to that property.nylife,adherence group,cir.the plaintiff in an interpleader action is a stakeholder that admits it is liable to one of the claimants,but fears the prospect of multiple liability.interpleader allows the stakeholder to file suit,deposit the property with the court,and withdraw from the proceedings.the competing claimants are left to litigate between themselves.see zechariah chaffee,the federal interpleader act of i,yale.the result is a situation.the stakeholder avoids multiple liability.the claimants settle their dispute in a single proceeding,without having to sue the stakeholder first and then face the difficulties of finding assets and levying execution.id.at.
there are two methods for bringing an interpleader in federal court.the first is the interpleader statute.district courts have subject matter jurisdiction under this provision if there is minimal diversity between two or more adverse claimants,and if the amount in controversy is or more.see state farm fire cas.tashire,d.the second is federal rule of civil procedure.unlike its statutory counterpart,rule interpleader is no more than a procedural device the plaintiff must plead and prove an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction.see nylife,at commercial union ins.united states.
in this case,metlife does not rely on the interpleader statute,nor could it,as the adverse claimants are all new jerseyans.rather,it has styled its lawsuit as a rule interpleader action.metlife argues that jurisdiction exists under the federal question statute,and erisa jurisdictional provision,e.
a federal question interpleader is a rarity.see charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice procedure ed.see also donald doernberg,what wrong with this picture rule interpleader,the act,in personam jurisdiction,and escher,the dearth of reported cases involving interpleader and federal question jurisdiction implies that although such cases can arise,they will be a small proportion of all federal interpleader actions.statutory arising under jurisdiction requires that a federal question appear on the face of the plaintiff complaint.see louisville nashville mottley.this requirement poses a problem for an interpleader plaintiff,as all the complaint seeks is an order releasing and discharging the plaintiff from liability.it is difficult to characterize such a request as asserting either federal or state rights.morongo band of mission indians cal.state bd.of equalization,cir quoting banco de ponce hinsdale supermarket.thus,at least at first blush,it is hard to see how a request for interpleader could raise a federal question.
but only at first blush.some interpleader actions do raise federal questions.indeed,our sister courts of appeals have recognized that an interpleader arises under federal law when brought by an erisa fiduciary against competing claimants to plan benefits.see,metro.life ins.bigelow,cir aetna life ins.bayona,cir metro.life ins.marsh,cir.
we agree with these courts.federal question jurisdiction exists when the plaintiff complaint establishes that federal law creates the cause of action.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d metlife brings this suit under section a of erisa,a.that provision creates a cause of action for fiduciaries to obtain appropriate equitable relief to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.a b ii.as courts have noted,t he interconnection between the basis of the district court the elements of an erisa claim makes it easy to confuse the question of the court subject matter jurisdiction with the question of the plaintiff ability to state a claim.carlson principal fin.group,cir.the test we must apply is a familiar one.for jurisdictional purposes,the issue is not whether metlife will ultimately be successful in sustaining its cause of action under section a.see bell hood.rather,d ismissal for lack of jurisdiction because of the inadequacy of the federal claim is proper only when the claim is so insubstantial,implausible,foreclosed by prior decisions of the supreme court,or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.steel citizens for a better env t,d quoting oneida indian nation of county of oneida,d see also primax recoveries,gunter,cir an erisa claim can be or sufficiently substantial even if it is unsuccessful and possibly verging on the foolhardy in light of prior precedent barring the relief sought.quotation marks omitted cement masons health welfare trust fund for cal.stone,cir d ismissal of an erisa claim under a is properly a dismissal on the merits rather than a dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction.
here,metlife brings suit as a fiduciary,and it adequately invokes the district court subject matter jurisdiction by seeking appropriate equitable relief to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.erisa a,a.specifically,metlife seeks interpleader,which is a form of equitable relief.see fire ins.asbestospray,cir.through its interpleader action,metlife seeks to enforce the provisions of erisa and the plan by ensuring that funds are disbursed to the proper beneficiary.see aetna life,at.metlife thus presents a substantial,claim for relief under section a.this is enough to confer subject matter jurisdiction under erisa.see bell,at.
presumably,the district court agreed that metlife cause of action arises under federal law.its jurisdictional inquiry focused on a different issue exhaustion.except in limited circumstances,we have held,a federal court will not entertain an erisa claim unless the plaintiff has exhausted the remedies available under the plan.harrow prudential ins.of,cir quotation omitted.relying on that rule,the district court noted that metlife assert ed federal jurisdiction under erisa despite having made no initial determination about which potential plan beneficiaries should be paid.district court order at.it reasoned that a federal court sits in review of a decision of a plan administrator,and it is the plan administrator duty to make its own initial determination regarding who should be paid.id.at.absent such a determination,there was no administrative record for th e court to review.id.at.thus,the district court held that jurisdiction was lacking.
the district court gloss on the exhaustion requirement raises two questions.first,should courts label erisa exhaustion requirement as a jurisdictional prerequisite to federal court adjudication second,labels aside,is there a reverse exhaustion requirement that limits a fiduciary ability to bring an interpleader action we address these questions in turn.
a recent series of supreme court decisions provides helpful guidance on the uses and misuses of the word jurisdiction.see bowles russell,d arbaugh y h,d eberhart united states,d per curiam kontrick ryan,d.these cases clarify that nonstatutory rules are not properly labeled jurisdictional.true jurisdictional limitations are set by the constitution and by congress,not by rules of procedure or doctrine.see kontrick,at.only congress may determine a lower federal court jurisdiction.see also bowles.at same.nonstatutory rules,even if unalterable on a party application,can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.see kontrick,at.
as it explained these principles,the supreme court noted that its own past decisions had sometimes mislabeled nonstatutory rules as jurisdictional.the court described these casual invocations of the term as jurisdictional rulings that should be accorded no precedential effect on the question whether the federal court had authority to adjudicate the claim in suit.arbaugh.at quotation marks omitted.
informed by the supreme court instruction,we must assess whether erisa exhaustion doctrine is a jurisdictional mandate.certainly,it is an important legal rule.we have recognized that requiring exhaustion of plan remedies helps to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits under erisa to promote the consistent treatment of claims for benefits to provide a nonadversarial method of claim settlement and to minimize the costs of claims settlement for all concerned.harrow,at quoting amato bernard,cir.in addition,exhaustion enhances the ability of fiduciaries to expertly and efficiently manage their funds by preventing premature judicial intervention in their processes.id.quoting amato,at.it also has the salutary effect of refining and defining the problem for final judicial resolution.amato,at.
but as important as the rule may be,erisa nowhere mentions the exhaustion doctrine.id.at.it is a judicial innovation fashioned with an eye toward sound policy.id.at.we have not required exhaustion where the claim seeks to enforce a statutory right under erisa.zipf v.at t,cir.in addition,the failure to exhaust will be excused in cases where a balancing of factors reveals that exhaustion would be futile.see harrow,at.
this is not the stuff of a jurisdictional rule.congress has expressly provided for jurisdiction over erisa cases in e.neither that provision nor any other part of erisa contains an exhaustion requirement.thus,as a doctrine,exhaustion places no limits on a court adjudicatory power.see arbaugh.at kontrick,at.see also paese hartford life accident ins,cir erisa exhaustion is purely a concept that developed in the absence of statutory language demonstrating that congress intended to make it a jurisdictional requirement.chailland brown root,cir same.
furthermore,even aside from the supreme court instruction,our own cases carefully distinguish between prudential exhaustion and jurisdictional exhaustion.wilson mvm,cir see also zipes trans world airlines,d.prudential exhaustion is generally judicially created.wilson,at.it reflects a judicial desire to respect agency autonomy by allowing it to correct its own errors.id.unlike a rigid jurisdictional rule,prudential exhaustion provides flexible exceptions for waiver,estoppel,tolling or futility.id.erisa exhaustion requirement bears all the hallmarks of a nonjurisdictional prudential rule.in addition to being,the doctrine futility exception involves a discretionary balancing of interests.judicial prudence,not power,governs its application in a given case.
in reaching this conclusion,we have not overlooked the several cases that refer to erisa exhaustion as jurisdictional.two are particularly noteworthy.in wolf national shopmen pension fund,cir,we described our analysis as a jurisdictional inquiry and classified exhaustion as a necessary predicate to federal jurisdiction.id.at.in addition,the leading case in this area,amato bernard,cir,referred to the exhaustion of plan remedies in jurisdiction al terms.id.at.neither case,however,explained why or how a doctrine borne of sound policy qualified as jurisdictional.amato,at.the opinions simply sprinkled their analyses with offhanded references to the term.see arbaugh.at.they do not alter our conclusion that erisa exhaustion doctrine places no limits on a federal court subject matter jurisdiction.
metlife brought this interpleader action against paul price widow and his children.before the widow and the children ever filed a responsive pleading,the district court acted in the name of subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed on exhaustion grounds.this was error.the exhaustion requirement is a nonjurisdictional affirmative defense.see paese,at williams runyon,cir.
the question remains whether the affirmative defense of exhaustion bars metlife interpleader action.as noted above,our cases hold that persons claiming plan benefits must generally exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief.berger edgewater steel,cir.of course,metlife is not a person claiming plan benefits.it is a fiduciary attempting to interplead the competing claimants.there is no third circuit precedent addressing the applicability of exhaustion principles in this context.the question for us,then,is whether a reverse exhaustion requirement bars a plan fiduciary from bringing an interpleader action without first developing a record and rendering a final benefits decision.
the consensus view is that a fiduciary need not make a final benefits decision.many courts have allowed the use of interpleader in erisa benefits cases.see,al
