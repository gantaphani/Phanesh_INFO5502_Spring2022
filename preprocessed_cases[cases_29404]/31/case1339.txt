the principal question in this case is whether marian wagener and donald champoux stated a claim upon which relief can be granted in their complaint alleging that,the sbc pension benefit program sbc plan or plan,impermissibly discriminated against plaintiffs and other plan participants in the administration of the sbc plan.we conclude that plaintiffs have indeed stated a claim under a b of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a b.therefore,we reverse the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims.
according to their complaint,wagener and champoux worked for companies that are affiliated with the plan sponsor,sbc communications,sbc.wagener and champoux are both participants in the plan and,in november,they retired pursuant to an enhanced benefit program that was designed to encourage early retirement.the calculation of benefits under the terms of this program depends in part on the amount of a participant compensation between january,and december.the present dispute turns on how to calculate plaintiffs compensation during this period.according to the defendant,plaintiffs compensation between january,and december,includes only the amount of pay plaintiffs actually received during this period,thus excluding a paycheck that wagener and champoux received on january,for work they performed in.by contrast,wagener and champoux argue that their level of compensation for benefit calculation purposes includes compensation earned between january,and december,even though one paycheck for this period was received at the beginning of the calendar year.they also allege that other similarly situated plan participants have been paid benefits based on compensation earned,not received,in the base period,thus confirming their entitlement to benefits under a clause in the plan.
we hold that wagener and champoux have alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for denial of benefits under erisa,a b,because their complaint includes the allegation that plan officials discriminated against them similarly situated plan participants in contravention of the plan plain language.any deference we owe to discretionary decisions of plan officials does not extend to decisions that discriminate among plan participants in violation of the plain terms of the plan.therefore,we reverse the district court decision granting the plan motion to dismiss.we also vacate the district court denial of the motion filed by wagener and champoux,as that motion is no longer moot in light of our disposition of this appeal.
background 
the following facts are taken from plaintiffs complaint,as well as the exhibits attached to,and the documents incorporated by reference in,that complaint.because we are reviewing the district court decision to grant the sbc plan motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,we assume that the facts alleged in plaintiffs complaint are true.world wide minerals,republic of kazakhstan.
the sbc pension benefit program is a defined benefit plan within the meaning of erisa,sponsored by sbc,which is the plan administrator and a named fiduciary of the plan.compl,reprinted in joint appendix.the benefit plan committee committee is also a named fiduciary of the plan and has primary responsibility for the review of benefit claims under the plan.id.the committee has delegated administrative responsibility and authority to review claims to the sbc pension plan service center service center,which services,administers,and operates the plan on a basis.id.plaintiffs wagener and champoux were at all relevant times participants in the plan.id.
sbc altered the plan benefit structure in,but preserved the structure for certain employees,including plaintiffs,who retained a grandfathered benefit.see id,sbc communications.board of directors resolutions amending the plan effective.it is undisputed that the plan amendment has no bearing on the merits of this case.
in,sbc began requiring some companies that participated in the plan to change the method that they used to determine the basic compensation portion of a plan participant pension compensation,which ultimately affected the amount of the participant benefits under the plan.compl.under the regime in place prior to,basic compensation was calculated based on a participant basic rate of pay over a specified period.id.under this approach,basic compensation meant that a participant would obtain credit for his or her base pay rate,whether or not she worked full time during that period.id.
beginning in,sbc required some participating companies to use actual base pay instead of basic rate of pay to determine an employee basic compensation under the plan.the purpose of this change,which was implemented through a series of plan amendments actual base pay amendments,was to allow participants to accrue pension credits only for work they actually performed.id.under the terms of an april,plan amendment april actual base pay amendment,sbc switched sbc management services,which employed plaintiffs wagener and champoux,from the basic rate of pay to the actual base pay method for calculating employee participants basic compensation,effective july.id.
on june,sbc,acting as plan administrator,sent a written notice to wagener,champoux,and others,which stated in relevant part 
the plan is being amended effective july,to change the method that is used to calculate your pension compensation,which may affect the amount of your benefit the basic rate of pay portion of pension compensation will be replaced by actual base pay.the basic rate of pay is your full time monthly base pay,whether you worked it or not.the actual base pay is the base pay you actually receive.
id,alterations in original see also copy of the notice attached as an exhibit to the complaint.
on january,actual base pay was defined in the plan,id,to mean a participant compensation that has actually been paid out by a participating company on such participant behalf and that has been identified by such participating company as base pay.plan amendment,attached as exhibit to the complaint.
on september,as part of a downsizing,sbc adopted a plan amendment that added an enhanced pension and retirement program epr program to the plan.the epr program was designed to encourage thousands of employees of sbc and companies to take early retirement by offering them a larger retirement benefit than they would have otherwise received.compl.the epr program provided that employees who decided to retire under its terms would receive the largest of several alternative benefits for which they were eligible.see id.
plaintiffs wagener and champoux were eligible for the epr program,and they elected to retire under it.their last day of work was november.id.for wagener and champoux,the largest benefit available under the epr program was the enhanced grandfathered benefit.id.the enhanced grandfathered benefit calculated participants benefits as if they were five years older and had worked five years longer for a sbc company than they actually had.see sbc pension benefit plan nonbargained program,as restated effective incorporating epr amendments sbc plan or plan.except for that enhancement,the plan amendments creating the epr program explicitly provided that the enhanced grandfathered benefit shall be a benefit calculated in the same manner as the grandfathered benefit would be calculated under the current plan.id.
the present dispute emanates from the committee calculation of plaintiffs benefits under the epr program.to calculate the enhanced grandfathered benefit under the epr program,the committee must first determine a participant adjusted career income,which is a function of,among other things,the participant average annual compensation for the period from january,through december.compl.as the term was used in the portion of the plan providing for the grandfathered benefit at the time that the epr program was adopted,average annual compensation meant a participant pension compensation which included basic compensation plus other forms of compensation during the averaging period,divided by five years.id,see also copy of the sbc plan.thus,with regard to plaintiffs and other individuals eligible for the enhanced grandfathered benefit,average annual compensation was their total pension compensation between january,and december,relevant averaging period divided by five.
on september,plaintiff champoux wrote the sbc pension plan service center,complaining that one full pay period from had been excluded from the averaging period used to calculate his pension compensation.he stated 
since sbc paid the management employees on a basis,the total number of payments necessary for a full year compensation is.as you will note in the attached table regarding the calculation of champoux benefits,the total number of payments for the year is only.all years except have payments if sbc believes it is appropriate to exclude some compensation from within the total base period compensation,then it should also exclude the applicable time period from the averaging calculation.
id,emphasis added by complaint omitted.on december,the service center denied champoux request,stating that,because the april actual base pay amendment changed the method used to calculate pension compensation from basic rate of pay to actual base pay effective july,one of the paychecks champoux received in july was not included in the calculation of his pension compensation.see id.
in february,champoux appealed this denial to the plan benefit plan committee.the committee wrote champoux in may,informing him that his appeal had been denied.the denial letter did not endorse the position taken by the service center in its december letter to champoux.instead,the committee explained 
what actually happened was that the april actual base pay amendment caused a delay in the recognition of pay,so that the pay you received for the period ended december,was recognized as pay in the calendar year because it was paid on january,prior to the amendment,pay received for the period ended december,would have been recognized in.therefore,as a result of the amendment,pay periods were included in pay instead of.it was the accounting change to actual base pay in that resulted in what appeared to you to be discrepancy in your pension calculation.
id,emphasis added by complaint omitted.
the committee reached this decision notwithstanding that it had previously endorsed a contrary interpretation of the actual base pay amendments for grandfathered retirees who were not participants in the epr program.specifically,the plaintiffs complaint alleges that 
between january,and today,the plan has consistently administered the grandfathered benefit for all the enhanced grandfathered benefit for epr including all pay periods as part of average annual compensation for the year in which they were earned,notwithstanding the actual base pay amendments,and notwithstanding the fact that one full pay period was not received until after the end of the averaging period.
champoux submitted two appeals of the benefit committee decision,which were denied in august and october.see id.
with regard to this appeal,the material facts relating to plaintiff wagener claim for benefits are virtually identical to those relating to champoux.she also sought additional benefits from the sbc plan and,like champoux,she was informed that her benefits had been calculated by excluding one full pay period from from the calculation of her pension compensation.wagener claim for additional benefits was also denied by both the service center,and,on appeal,by the committee.see id.
wagener and champoux allege a number of facts that they assert demonstrate that the committee decision to deny their claims for additional benefits was influenced by a conflict of interest.specifically,the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs correct interpretation of the plan would cost sbc roughly million plus interest in additional contributions to what is already an underfunded plan.id.according to plaintiffs,on information and belief,the members of the benefit plan committee are officers and employees of sbc and its affiliates whose jobs and prospects for raises and promotions are affected,are seen by them to be affected,by decisions interpreting the plan in a manner disadvantageous to sbc,especially one which would cost sbc some million plus interest.id.the complaint further alleges that this conflict of interest has influenced not only the committee ultimate interpretation of the plan,but also other matters relating to the committee handling of plaintiffs requests regarding their benefits,including the committee refusal to provide plaintiffs with documents relating to their benefit claims,the committee failure to provide plaintiffs with a reasoned basis for its decisions denying their claims for additional benefits,and the committee october adoption of an plan amendment to make it appear that the disparate treatment of epr grandfathered retirees similarly situated grandfathered retirees had a textual basis when in fact the discriminatory treatment had been ongoing prior to the promulgation of the amendment.id.
having fully exhausted the internal claims procedures of the plan,id,plaintiffs wagener and champoux filed suit against the sbc plan in district court in march.in count two of their complaint,plaintiffs sought,on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries,additional benefits under erisa,a b,which authorizes individuals,inter alia,to bring civil actions to recover benefits due to them under the terms of their pension plan.plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification concurrent with the filing of their complaint.in addition,in count one of their complaint,plaintiffs sought additional disclosures of documents relating to their individual claims,as authorized by erisa,and its accompanying regulations.plaintiffs complaint also included two additional counts,which are not at issue here.
in may,the sbc plan moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.plaintiff wagener then moved for summary judgment on the document disclosure claim.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint and denied wagener motion for summary judgment.wagener sbc pension benefit program,civ,reprinted in.the district court stated 
the central question presented is whether the defendant pension benefit plan was required to include a payment made on january,in the calculation of each plaintiff average annual compensation.the defendant benefit plan committee,which interpreted the plan and calculated the benefits,decided that the plan did not authorize inclusion of the january,payment because it was received after december,the end of each plaintiff averaging period.the court finds that the committee interpretation of the plan is reasonable,and since that is all that is required due to the owed to the committee decision,that is the end of the matter.
the district court further concluded that the plaintiffs other claims were derivative of the benefit claim and thus dismissed them as well.in a separate order issued the same day,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for class certification as moot in light of its decision granting the sbc plan motion to dismiss.wagener sbc pension benefit program,civ,reprinted in.plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their claim for additional benefits under a b and the dismissal of their motion for class certification as moot plaintiff wagener also appeals the district court dismissal of the document disclosure claim count one and the denial of her motion for summary judgment on that claim.
