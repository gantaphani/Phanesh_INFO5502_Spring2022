an employee of wells fargo,whom we will call jane jones,was covered under the wells fargo company health plan the plan,governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.united behavioral health ubh is a claims administrator of the plan.jones was admitted to pacific shores hospital psh for acute inpatient treatment for severe anorexia nervosa.ubh refused to pay for more than three weeks of inpatient hospital treatment.ubh based its refusal in substantial part on mischaracterizations of jones medical history and condition.psh continued to provide inpatient treatment to jones after ubh refused to pay.jones assigned to psh her rights to payment under the plan.
psh sued the plan and ubh,seeking payment for the additional days of inpatient treatment.we conclude that ubh abused its discretion in refusing to pay for these days of treatment.
background

emphasis added.
ubh formally notified psh of its decision not to pay for acute inpatient treatment beyond february in a letter dated february.on february,nurse wolpert requested on jones behalf an urgent appeal of zucker denial of benefits coverage for inpatient hospital treatment after february.on either february or,the appeal was referred by ubh to barbara center of prest associates.center spoke by telephone to fredrick on february and on the same day sent written findings to ubh.center wrote 
case summary 
the patient is a year old female who was admitted to inpatient psychiatric eating disorder level of care on.the patient has a long history of chronic eating disorder behaviors.at the time of this admission,the patient was tall and weighed pounds.she is described as taking to laxatives daily.the patient was not suicidal,homicidal,or psychotic.the patient reported some vague suicidal thoughts,including thoughts of overdosing on the laxatives that she had been abusing.
the patient has an extensive history of prior treatment,including a previous stay at this facility in and a stay at another facility in.it is unclear to what extent the patient has been following up near her home in another state the patient medical history is remarkable for acute pancreatitis which was diagnosed on admission.
following admission,the patient had slow weight gain the patient was compliant with her meal plan and gained eight pounds over the course of her stay 
findings opinions

the patient was not suicidal,homicidal,or psychotic.
in the opinion of this reviewer,the patient does not meet united behavioral health medical necessity guidelines for continued stay at the acute inpatient psychiatric level of care after the current last covered date,ubh continued service criteria,and,not met.treatment at the partial hospital level of care should be considered.
emphasis added.
on february,the same day ubh received center report,william barnard,ubh assistant medical director,denied psh appeal.in a letter addressed to jones,he wrote 
as requested,i have completed a first level urgent appeal review on on a request we received on.
this review involved a telephone conversation with your provider.after fully investigating the substance of the appeal,including all aspects of clinical care involved in this treatment episode,i have determined that benefit coverage is not available for the following reason s 
emphasis added.barnard then quoted nearly verbatim the three numbered paragraphs contained in center report.
zucker made a number of obvious mistakes in his summaries of his two reviews.in his february summary,written after his first review,zucker wrote that jones weight at admission had been either or pounds.both weights are contradicted by information then in the administrative record.jones admission weight was never listed as pounds.from january,the date of her admission,until february,three days after zucker summary,jones weight on admission was consistently listed in ubh treatment notes as pounds.on february,her admission weight was changed in ubh notes to pounds.zucker also wrote in his report that jones had made no prior attempts at suicide.this statement is contradicted in the administrative record.ubh january treatment notes state,in took whole bottle of laxatives in a suicide attempt.
zucker minimized the risk of suicide.he wrote in his february summary,ho wever,on fur th er questioning fredrick reports that pt has no immed iate plan,has not gathered means,has made no prep,and ther e is no or even line of site sic in the program.but fredrick reports,on further questioning by zucker,do not undermine her assessment that jones was at risk for suicide.repeated entries in ubh treatment notes indicate that jones continued to have active suicidal ideation,with plans either to overdose or starve herself to death.given that jones was in acute inpatient care,she did not have access to large quantities of tylenol or laxatives,her planned means of overdosing.so long as jones remained in acute inpatient care,she would not have been able to gather means or otherwise prep for suicide.the lack of supervision did not support zucker implicit suggestion that the hospital did not itself believe that jones was at risk for suicide,for ubh treatment records indicate that psh staff continued to check jones every fifteen minutes as a precaution against suicide.
in zucker february summary,written after his second review,he again made a number of obvious mistakes,despite his review of all available information.zucker wrote that jones had a chronically low weight.he then relied on this chronicity to refuse further authorization of inpatient treatment.zucker wrote that jones was now at day with minimal wt gain desp it e diet of cal.this statement is contradicted in the administrative record.ubh treatment notes nowhere indicate that jones had been eating calories per day.ubh notes on january indicate that,at the time of her admission,jones was eating just calories per day,and that her treatment plan required go ing slow on carbs and fat.notes on february indicate that jones was eating only calories per day.three days later,on february,the hospital was still keeping cal plan.
zucker wrote in his february summary,md states patient has been do in g well un ti l dietician raised cals today.one may possibly infer from this statement that jones calories were raised today to calories,from calories on february though zucker does not specify the number of calories by which jones cals were raised.but this does not support zucker rationale for discontinuing coverage after february.first,it is unclear whether today means february,the last date for which ubh authorized payment,or february,the date of zucker conversation with fredrick and of his report.read in context,the later date seems more likely.even if zucker meant february when he wrote today,this would mean only that jones caloric intake was raised to on the last day of her stay.on either reading,zucker statement that jones had minimal weight gain after days desp it e diet of cal ories makes no sense.
zucker wrote further that jones laboratory test results were normal,and that she had finished laxative taper without refeeding symptoms.but according to ubh notes,as of february,the date of zucker summary,jones most recent lab results came from tests performed on february.those tests showed elevated levels of amylase and lipase related to jones acute pancreatitis a condition caused by refeeding.jones amylase levels on february were higher than they had been on february,when ubh case management notes already described her labs as abnormal.
finally,zucker wrote in his february summary,md states patient not express ing.we have only zucker summary of his conversation with fredrick to support this statement.we know from ubh treatment notes that on february,only two days before the february date,that jones still complains of si to starve or od.there is nothing in ubh treatment notes,as distinct from zucker recounting of his conversation with fredrick,to indicate that jones was no longer experiencing suicidal ideation two days later.
center also made a number of obvious mistakes.she wrote,at the time of this admission,the patient was tall and weighed pounds.there is nothing in the administrative record to support an admission weight of pounds.from january to february,ubh treatment notes repeatedly indicate that jones admission weight was pounds.on february,the treatment notes indicate that her admission weight was pounds.center wrote further,she is described as taking to laxatives daily.this is contradicted in the administrative record.ubh treatment notes repeatedly indicate that jones was taking sena s laxatives per day when she was admitted.
center wrote further,the patient was not suicidal,homicidal,or psychotic.the patient reported some vague suicidal thoughts,including thoughts of overdosing on the laxatives that she had been abusing.this is contradicted in the administrative record.on admission,jones was actively suicidal,and she continued to have specific not vague suicidal ideation until at least february.ubh treatment notes on january state that jones had attempted suicide in by overdosing on a whole bottle of laxatives.ubh treatment notes on january,january,february,february,and february consistently record jones suicidal ideation and plan to commit suicide through overdose or starvation.nowhere in ubh treatment notes after february is there any statement that jones no longer had suicidal ideation.
center also wrote,the patient medical history is remarkable for acute pancreatitis which was diagnosed on admission.this,too,is contradicted in the administrative record.ubh treatment notes are specific in stating that jones did not have pancreatitis on admission.rather,as her january treatment plan stated,psh expected that jones would later develop pancreatitis as a consequence of her treatment.as stated by nurse wolpert,she have pancreatitis and anemia from refeeding.treatment notes indicate that jones was suffering from pancreatitis on january,four days after being admitted to psh,but not before.
finally,center wrote,following admission,the patient had slow weight gain by the current last covered date,the patient weighed lbs the patient was steadily gaining weight.these statements are contradicted in center own report,as well as in the administrative record.according to the inaccurate numbers recited by center,upon which she ostensibly relied,jones did not steadily gain weight.center wrote that jones weighed pounds at admission on january,even though there is nothing in ubh notes to indicate that this was jones admission weight.center then notes that jones weighed pounds on february.to state the obvious,this is a loss rather than a gain.if jones weight at admission was pounds,as indicated in ubh treatment notes up to february,jones lost five pounds between the date of her admission and february.or if jones admission weight was pounds,as indicated in treatment notes of february,she did gain weight but she did not do so steadily.on this assumption,she started out at pounds on january and dropped to pounds on january.she then weighed pounds on february,and pounds on february.ubh treatment notes do not give a weight after february,but center wrote that jones weighed pounds on february,one pound less than she weighed five days earlier,on february.
barnard wrote in his february letter to jones that he had decided on february to deny her appeal a fter fully investigating the substance of the appeal,including all aspects of clinical care involved in this treatment episode.after referring to his own full investigation,barnard quoted almost verbatim from center erroneous report,which center had sent to ubh earlier that same day.
on february,one month after her admission to psh and eleven days after ubh ceased paying for her treatment,jones was discharged.after her discharge,jones assigned to psh her right to payment under the plan.psh brought suit under a b,alleging that ubh and the plan had wrongfully denied benefits to jones.the district court held that,despite numerous errors in zucker and center reports,the administrative record provided a reasonable basis for determining that acute inpatient care was not necessary after february.the court concluded that it was not left with a definite and firm conviction that ubh benefits determination was in error,and therefore could not disturb that decision.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of appellate review 
we review de novo the district court choice and application of the standard of review of an erisa plan administrator decision.abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc.we review for clear error the district court underlying findings of disputed fact.id.
iii.discussion 
standard of review of ubh benefits denial 
we begin by addressing the standard under which we should review the denial of benefits by ubh.the essential first step of the analysis is to examine whether the terms of the erisa plan unambiguously grant discretion to the administrator.id.at.when the terms of the plan do not grant discretion to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,we review de novo the administrator denial of coverage.id.when a plan unambiguously confers such discretion,we review a denial of benefits for abuse of discretion.id.if there are procedural irregularities or if an administrator operates under a conflict of interest,we consider the irregularities or conflict as a factor in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.id.at.
the district court concluded that the plan unambiguously granted discretion to the administrator.it then reviewed ubh denial of benefits for abuse of discretion.psh does not challenge the district court determination that the plan explicitly grants discretion to wells fargo,and derivatively to its administrator ubh.however,psh makes three arguments in favor of less deferential review of ubh denial of benefits.
first,psh contends that there were procedural irregularities in ubh benefits denial such that we should review the denial de novo.even when a plan confers discretion on an administrator,if that administrator engages in wholesale and flagrant violations of the procedural requirements of erisa,its decision is subject to de novo review.id.at.however,most procedural errors are not sufficiently severe to transform the standard into a de novo standard.anderson suburban teamsters of.pension fund bd.of trustees,cir.instead,we weigh any procedural errors as a factor in determining whether ubh abused its discretion.abatie,at.
it is painfully apparent that ubh did not follow procedures appropriate to jones case.ubh treatment notes describe her case as requiring evaluation by ubh regional director zucker due to its medical and psychiatric complexity.yet the treatment notes in ubh administrative record,upon which ubh ostensibly made its decision in this complex case,are based entirely on telephone conversations and voicemail messages.no psh hospital records were ever put into the administrative record.no ubh doctor or other claims administrator ever examined jones.the choice to conduct only a paper review raise s questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of the benefits determination.montour hartford life accident ins,cir alteration in original quoting bennett kemper,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,zucker evaluations and coverage decisions,made after telephone conversations with fredrick,were based on obvious factual errors that could easily have been corrected if only the ubh administrative record,let alone psh hospital records,had been consulted.similarly,center independent evaluation and coverage decision were based on obvious factual errors that could easily have been corrected if the ubh administrative record had been consulted.see saffon wells fargo.long term disability plan,cir explaining that an administrator
