background 
central states is a multiemployer employee benefit plan governed by a trust agreement and administered by ten trustees,five of whom are selected by contributing employers and five of whom are selected by unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters.central states is regulated by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,as amended by the multiemployer pension plan amendment act of mppaa.
under central states plan,actuaries created benefit classes which determine the fixed benefit amount a participating employee will receive from retirement until the end of his or her life.the benefit classes are based upon the cost estimates of the actuaries and assume the fund will receive contributions from younger employees to help pay the benefits of retired employees.if central states does not receive contributions from younger employees,the actuarial assumptions may become financially unsound,and central states may be unable to pay guaranteed benefits.
to guard against central states becoming financially unsound,article iii of the trust agreement creates an adverse selection rule,which provides,in part,
the trustees are authorized to reject any collective bargaining agreement of an employer and all contributions from the employer whenever they determine either that the agreement is unlawful inconsistent with any rule or requirement for participation by employers in the fund that the employer is engaged in one or more practices or arrangements that threaten to cause economic harm to,impairment of the actuarial soundness of,the fund including but not limited to any arrangement in which the employer is obligated to make contributions to the trust fund on behalf of some but not all of the employer bargaining unit employees,and any arrangement in which the employer is obligated to make contributions to the trust fund at different contribution rates for different groups of the employer bargaining unit employees.any such rejection by the trustees of a collective bargaining agreement shall be effective as of the date determined by the trustees which effective date may be retroactive to the initial date of the term of the rejected agreement and shall result in the termination of the employer and all employees of the employer from further participation in the fund on and after such effective date.
in,central states promulgated special bulletin,which expounded on the adverse selection rule.special bulletin explained the adverse selection rule protect s the financial soundness of central states by prohibiting employment practices which restrict pension coverage to only those employees likely to receive a benefit and exclude those employees less likely to receive a benefit.the bulletin also provided a list of three examples of adverse selection,including unequal contribution on behalf of employees who perform the same type of work contribution for certain individuals rather than a group of employees,or the creation of a employee group and classification of employees subject to contribution as casual,or temporary.
crst contributed to central states under a collective bargaining agreement with chauffeurs,teamsters and helpers local union local,and a separate collective bargaining agreement with chauffeurs,teamsters and helpers local union local.as a participating employer,crst signed a participation agreement with central states which bound crst to the terms,rules,and regulations of the trust agreement.
in march,central states notified crst that central states was reviewing crst actions in relation to local and local for possible violations of the adverse selection rule.central states investigation of crst revealed crst participating employees in local decreased from six employees in to two employees in with no new hires in the ten years before the investigation,and also found crst admitted it outsourced work when local employees departed from crst.central states similarly found crst participating employees in local declined from seventeen in to seven in with no new hires since march,and crst admitted participation in central states on behalf of local employees declined based upon decreased business and crst decision to replace departing local employees with independent contractors.central states actuarial services department further determined the future benefit accruals of crst employees covered by the collective bargaining agreements with local and local would exceed the contributions central states would receive from crst for these employees.
on august,central states contracts subcommittee recommended the board of trustees expel crst from central states.based upon the recommendation and the findings of central states investigation and actuarial services department,the board of trustees unanimously voted to expel crst from central states because crst collective bargaining agreements violated central states rules and requirements of participation,and crst was engaged in practices and arrangements that cause,and threaten to cause economic harm to,and impairment of the actuarial soundness of the pension fund.central states terminated the participation of crst and its participants in central states on september,and assessed complete withdrawal liability against crst under erisa.
ii.procedural history 
on september,crst and the participants filed a complaint in the district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against central states for wrongful expulsion of crst.crst and the participants amended the complaint to include the following five causes of action central states wrongfully expelled crst central states expulsion of crst tortiously interfered with crst collective bargaining agreements with local and local central states violated erisa,when central states expelled crst central states,as a third party beneficiary to crst collective bargaining agreements with local and local,breached the collective bargaining agreements and violated the act by expelling crst and central states engaged in disparate treatment by failing to enforce equally the adverse selection rule against another participating employer,united parcel service ups.crst and the participants based subject matter jurisdiction for their suit upon.the amended complaint asked the district court to reinstate crst into central states require central states to receive contributions from crst grant crst employees retroactive credits for service since the expulsion order reimbursement of the withdrawal liability assessed against,and paid by,crst and award costs and attorney fees to crst.
central states moved to dismiss crst and the participants amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim under.b and.the district court found subject matter jurisdiction was proper under and denied central states rule b motion,but granted central states rule b motion on counts two,three,four,and five of the amended complaint.
on july,crst and the participants filed a second amended complaint which added e,and federal common law as bases for jurisdiction.central states moved to dismiss the second amended complaint based upon.b and,and the district court,for the same reasons provided on the first motion to dismiss,denied the motion.
while central states motions to dismiss were being litigated,crst and the participants moved the district court to compel discovery of documents outside the administrative record which pertained to central states application of the adverse selection rule to ups.the district court denied the motion,and crst moved the district court to remand the case to the trustees for further development of the record regarding central states application of the adverse selection rule to ups.the district court granted crst and the participants motion,remanded the case to the trustees,and ordered central states to allow crst and the participants discovery regarding central states treatment of ups.
central states appealed to this court the district court remand order and the district court denial of central states motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.see borntrager cent.states,se.and sw.areas pension fund,cir.we dismissed central states appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,holding the district court rulings were not final appealable orders or actions.see id.at.in a footnote,we addressed the subject matter jurisdiction issue,stating,
as our decision in cent.hardware cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund,cir,makes clear,the contention there is no federal jurisdiction over crst wrongful expulsion claim is plainly without merit.before enactment of erisa in,of the labor management relations act,a,conferred federal jurisdiction over claims alleging breach of a pension or welfare benefit trust agreement that was an integral part of a collective bargaining agreement.erisa of course greatly expanded federal regulation of pension funds and granted federal courts broad jurisdiction over civil actions to interpret and enforce those plans.in central hardware,the district court accepted jurisdiction over a wrongful expulsion claim under e,and we reviewed the merits of that claim without discussing the jurisdiction issue.
in this case,the district court may have erred in assuming jurisdiction under if expulsion is not an act under subtitle e of erisa,but that issue can be taken up on appeal from the final judgment.moreover,if the expulsion was valid,the district court will need to decide whether such an expulsion triggers withdrawal liability under the mppaa,an issue that may be subject to mandatory arbitration.section clearly confers federal jurisdiction over crst claim for reimbursement of that statutory liability.
id.at citations omitted.
on remand,the trustees affirmed their earlier decision to expel crst,and crst and the participants filed a third amended complaint.the third amended complaint,which only alleged a claim for wrongful expulsion,added a as a basis for subject matter jurisdiction,and asked the district court to reimburse crst withdrawal liability payment and distribute the payment to the participants pro rata rather than reinstating crst into central states.central states moved to dismiss the third amended complaint,and the district court denied the motion.
on october,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court denied crst and the participants motion,granted central states motion,and dismissed the third amended complaint.the district court found central states lawfully exercised its authority to expel crst under article iii of the trust agreement central states did not abuse its discretion or arbitrarily or capriciously expel crst based upon crst employment practices or central states treatment of ups and central states did not act in bad faith or with an improper motive in expelling crst.
after judgment was entered on central states motion for summary judgment,central states moved the district court for attorney fees and litigation costs based upon article iii of the trust agreement,which provides,
whenever the trustees exercise their authority to reject a collective bargaining agreement of an employer and effect the termination of the employer and all employees of the employer from further participation in the fund on and after an effective date determined by the trustees,and there is related litigation to which the trustees or any of the trustees the fund and the employer are parties regardless of which entity or entities commenced the litigation,the trustees and the fund,at the conclusion of the litigation by judgment or settlement except by judgment that in effect invalidates the trustees rejection of the collective bargaining agreement,shall be entitled to recover from the employer a payment in the amount of the attorney fees and litigation costs incurred by the trustees the fund in the course of the litigation.
crst and the participants argued central states was not entitled to attorney fees under erisa,g,but the district court granted central states motion under the trust agreement,and awarded central states in attorney fees and litigation costs.crst and the participants appeal the district court summary judgment ruling and the district court award of attorney fees and litigation costs.
iii.discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,central states argues the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on the bases alleged by crst and the participants in the third amended complaint.we have the right and duty to raise and determine the district court subject matter jurisdiction at any time.see arnold wood,cir we are required to ascertain the existence of jurisdiction,whether or appellate,at the outset of an appeal.we must resolve outstanding questions of jurisdiction before proceeding to analyze the merits.it is our obligation to notice jurisdictional infirmities,whether the parties notice them or not.citations omitted.we review the district court subject matter jurisdiction de novo.see keene cass,cir.
in borntrager,at,we stated provides federal jurisdiction over the wrongful expulsion claim,and declared erisa,specifically,greatly expanded federal jurisdiction over interpretation and enforcement of pension funds.id.we agree with the statement in borntrager that the district court had jurisdiction over the wrongful expulsion claim under.see schneider moving storage robbins,d section a of the labor management relations act,a,provides a federal forum for suits to enforce labor contracts,including pension and welfare fund agreements.section of erisa also provides a federal forum for enforcement of the various duties imposed by such trust fund agreements.
motion for summary judgment 
crst and the participants contend the district court erred in granting summary judgment to central states because central states lacked the contractual authority to expel crst,crst expulsion was contrary to federal labor law and erisa,and crst expulsion was contrary to this court precedent.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see cardinal health,cyrus,llc,cir.v iewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,summary judgment should be granted if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.franklin local of the sheet metal workers intern.ass n,internal marks and citation omitted.
central states expulsion authority 
crst and the participants first argue central states did not have the contractual authority to expel crst based upon the use of independent contractors and a decline in employee participation.crst and the participants concede central states can expel an employer for adverse selection in certain circumstances involving the employer employees.however,crst and the participants contend the collective bargaining agreements,the participation agreement,and the trust agreement do not allow central states to expel crst based upon alleged adverse selection involving the use of independent contractors because the documents authorize crst to use independent contractors who are barred by federal law to participate in central states,and under the doctrine of ejusdem generis,the language and examples of adverse selection in the trust agreement and special bulletin limit expulsion based upon adverse selection to employment practices involving employees,not independent contractors.crst and the participants contend central states expulsion of crst was unlawful because crst had enrolled all eligible employees in central states,and crst was not in violation of the collective bargaining agreements,participation agreement,or the trust agreement.
we review the terms of a contract de novo.see cardinal health,at citation omitted.central states authority under the collective bargaining agreements,the participation agreement,and the trust agreement is freely reviewable.cent.hardware,at internal marks and citations omitted.however,central states determination that the trust documents authorize their actions has significant weight,for the trust agreement explicitly provides that any construction of the agreement provisions adopted by the trustees in good faith shall be binding upon the union,employees and employers.cent.states,se.and sw.areas pension fund cent,d see also cent.hardware,at.
central states did have the contractual authority to expel crst.article iii of the trust agreement allows central states to reject any collective bargaining agreement when the employer is engaged in one or more practices or arrangements that threaten to cause economic harm to,impairment of the actuarial soundness of,the fund.this language does not limit central states authority to certain forms of employment practices.central states only has to find an employer is engaged in one or more employment practices which may threaten the financial or actuarial viability of the fund.once central states makes such a determination,it is authorized to act.see cent.hardware,at concluding the trust agreement gives central states authority to reject payments from participating employers which threaten central states actuarial soundness see also cent,at.stating central states has all such powers as are necessary or appropriate for the carrying out of the purposes of the trust,including the authority to fulfill fiduciary duties to protect plan beneficiaries internal marks and citations omitted.
the examples provided in article iii and special bulletin do not limit central states authority,because the examples are not.the example in article iii is preceded by included but not limited to,and special bulletin states the list of examples is not exhaustive and not intended to be an all inclusive list of unacceptable arrangements.special bulletin further disclaims that a ny collective bargaining arrangement that encourages adverse selection is subject to rejection by the board of trustees.the examples,thus,did not limit central states authority to expel an employer if the employer uses an employment practice which threatens to harm or impair the fund.
crst legal right to use independent contractors also does not affect central states authority to expel crst under the adverse selection rule.central states did not expel crst because crst was using independent contractors.there is no evidence in the record indicating central states was attempting to prohibit crst use of independent contractors or require contributions on behalf of independent contractors.central states expelled crst because crst had an actuarially adverse employment group when crst shifted work to independent contractors rather than hiring new employees.central states determination that this transfer of work was adverse to the fund was permissible under article iii.
similarly,crst compliance with the collective bargaining agreements does not impair central states expulsion authority.the bargaining agreements do not override the authority granted central states in article iii of the trust agreement.see cent.hardware,at,holding central states had authority under the trust agreement to expel an employer even though the employer had tendered payments to central states in compliance with a collective bargaining agreement see also schneider moving storage,at.explaining central states was not bound by an arbitration provision found in collective bargaining agreements.
given the broad language of article iii of the trust agreement and the significant weight afforded central states determination that it had the authority to expel crst,we are convinced central states did have the authority to expel crst.see cent.hardware,at.
contravention of federal labor law 
crst and the participants next argue central states expulsion of crst was unlawful because the expulsion was contrary to federal labor law.crst and the participants contend,if the expulsion was based upon crst use of independent contractors,central states expulsion of crst contravened the labor management relations act lmra because lmra prohibits independent contractors from participating in the fund.crst and the participants also assert central states expulsion was contrary to mppaa because congress established withdrawal liability as a fund specific remedy for declining employee participation.crst and the participants maintain central states expulsion of crst was not authorized by,and outside of,the mppaa withdrawal provisions because the expulsion created an unauthorized complete withdrawal which substituted central states judgment for congress,and crst transfer of work to independent contractors did not trigger mppaa partial withdrawal liability.
on de novo review,see wwc license,boyle,cir,crst and the participants lmra arguments are not persuasive.as discussed earlier,central states did not expel crst based upon crst use of independent contractors,but instead expelled crst for maintaining an actuarially adverse employee group by failing to hire new employees and shifting work to independent contractors when employees departed.thus,central states expulsion of crst was not based upon an improper or unlawful reason,and did not constitute a violation of lmra.
crst and the participants argument regarding mppaa is equally unpersuasive.in cent.hardware,at,we held central states had authority under the trust agreement to expel an employer when the employer bargaining unit decreased.further crst and the participants brief concedes central states has authority to expel an employer under article iii of the trust agreement,and crst and the participants cite no provision of erisa or mppaa which explicitly constrains central states trust agreement authority.given our holding in cent.hardware,and crst and the participants concession,crst and the participants can not now argue the mppaa withdrawal provisions limit central states expulsion authority.the expulsion of crst did not contradict federal labor law.see cent,at.stating congress did not enumerate every power of pension fund trustees in erisa,but instead outlined trustees powers based upon the trustees common law fiduciary duties and the general premise that trustees have all such powers as are necessary or appropriate for the carrying out of the purposes of the trust internal marks and citations omitted.
violation of eighth circuit precedent 
crst and the participants also argue central states expulsion violated our opinion in cent.states,se.and sw.areas pension fund crst,cir.crst and the participants contend crst,adjudicated the contractual authority of central states under erisa and limited the authority to situations involving employees and plan participants.crst and the participants argument creates a legal question which we review de novo.see sheehan guardian life ins,cir.
in crst,at,we addressed whether crst is required to make available to central states for audit purposes the employment and earnings records of all crst employees including employees who may not be covered by a collective bargaining agreement requiring contributions to the funds on their behalf.to address the issue,we analyzed central states audit authority under the contractual documents and erisa.id.at.we held central states audit authority was limited to information of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement because the audit provision was limited to employees,the definition of employees only encompassed employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement,and erisa limited central states audit right to its contractual authority id.at.
crst,did not limit central states contractual expulsion authority to only situations involving employees.first,crst,involved a provision expressly limited to covered employees.crst and the participants cite the following statement for support of their argument fiduciary obligations mandated by erisa are owed only to participants and beneficiaries who may become eligible to receive a benefit from an employee benefit plan and not n employees id.at.this statement,however,did not limit c
