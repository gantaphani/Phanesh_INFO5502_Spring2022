abraham wilkins worked in the construction industry over the course of four decades,and claims that because some of his employers underreported his earnings to his pension fund,he has not received all the retirement benefits to which that work entitled him.wilkins argues,among other things,that it is the obligation of his pension fund,mason tenders district council pension fund,and its board of trustees collectively,the fund,to ensure,through audits or other means,that his employers submitted accurate records of his earnings.further,he argues that the fund policy of requiring claimants to prove their entitlement to additional benefits when employers underreport the policy shifts its duty to him in violation of the fund fiduciary duty under the employee retirement income and security act erisa of,et.he also contends that the fund failure to publish this policy in its summary plan description spd violates erisa.
we do not agree with wilkins that the fund violated its fiduciary duties when it failed to audit his employers during the years in question.we also find that erisa does not prevent the fund from requiring wilkins to produce some proof that he performed work for which he did not receive credit before it awards him additional benefits.we do agree with wilkins,however,that if the fund intends plan participants to shoulder the burden of producing such proof,erisa requires that notice to this effect be given to plan participants in the fund spd.the fund did not do so here,and we remand for a determination of whether wilkins was prejudiced by this omission,and if he was,for a determination of the amount of benefits he is due.
structure of the fund and wilkins employment history 
the fund,which is administered by the mason tenders district council the district council,a labor organization,provides retirement benefits for members of mason tenders locals.participants pensions are funded through contributions by their employers.see a.these employers,more than in number,are required by their collective bargaining agreements cbas with the district council to contribute to the fund based on their employees covered employment that is,based on work performed by the employees under an employer contract with the union.the fund own records of union members earnings in covered employment are derived principally from remittance reports submitted,along with contributions,by the employers.
as required by erisa,the terms of the pension program are governed by a written plan.see a.under the terms of plan,the fund pays benefits to its participants on the basis of the number of pension credits their covered employment qualifies them for.for work performed prior to,one credit is earned for each of gross wages of covered employment during a calendar year,and for work performed in and after,one credit is earned for every hours of covered employment in a calendar year.the fund does not count fractional credits that is,on the scale,a worker receives one credit for earnings from to,and two credits for earnings from through.
abraham wilkins worked in the construction industry from the until the and belonged to a mason tenders local,construction general building laborers local,during that time.over the years,he worked for fourteen employers,including seven who had cbas with the district council.between them,these seven employers made some contributions to the fund on wilkins behalf for eleven years,and.wilkins was a member of at least three other unions,some of which had their own cbas with some of these seven employers.
as the supreme court noted in central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund central transport,d,when a pension fund relies on employer to determine employers liability to the fund,employers have an incentive to underreport.funds can police the reporting practices of contributing employers through random audits,see id.at,and the fund does this,see wilkins mason tenders dist.council,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.still,random audits do not guarantee accurate reporting.in wilkins case,as the table below illustrates,there are significant variances between the earnings some of these seven employers reported to the fund and the earnings they reported to the social security administration ssa.
not all of the shortfall between the third and fourth columns necessarily represents underreporting on the part of wilkins employers,however.employers were only obligated to report wilkins earnings for covered is,for work performed in his capacity as a member of the mason tenders.and,as mentioned above,wilkins was a member of three unions besides the mason tenders local during the relevant period.the record shows that at least two of these concrete and alicer had cbas with other unions to which wilkins belonged.as a result,some or all of the discrepancy between earnings reported to the fund and to the ssa by these employers and any others with ties to wilkins other unions could represent work that wilkins performed for other unions.
procedural background 
wilkins filed an application for pension benefits in.in,the fund paid him a lump sum benefit of,which was based on pension credits earned in,and.although the fund had records of covered employment for other years,the earnings in those years were insufficient to qualify for pension credits 
in,wilkins met with the fund director,john virga,and claimed additional benefits based on work not reflected in the fund records,but reflected in his ssa statement of earnings.virga denied wilkins claim in a letter dated june,on the ground that the fund could not determine whether those extra earnings represented covered employment.at that time,when participants sought benefits based on work not reported by employers,it was the practice of the fund to require them to submit pay stubs to show that the additional work was performed at the union hourly rate,unless the fund had conducted a random payroll audit of the employer during the relevant period,and the audit records supported the benefits claim.this policy on crediting hours of employment in delinquent employer contribution situations pay stub policy was set down in writing,but it was not incorporated into the plan document wilkins submitted no pay stubs,nor employment records of any sort besides the ssa earnings statement.as he subsequently explained in an affirmation,the employment records he once possessed had been lost over the years because i had moved and because of a fire which destroyed my records.since the fund had conducted no audits of wilkins employers for the years in question and wilkins had not satisfied the pay stub policy,his claim was denied.
wilkins appealed this denial to the fund.virga responded in a letter dated january,which reiterated the need for evidence that wilkins earnings during the period at issue were for covered employment under the fund.while this letter mentioned pay stubs specifically,it also invited wilkins counsel to submit any other information including the requested evidence to the trustees in connection with wilkins appeal in response,wilkins attorney wrote that we have no further evidence that we are able to submit other than an affidavit from wilkins that he worked in covered employment for the periods in question.the fund declined to accept the proffered affidavit,and issued its final denial of benefits in a letter dated october.
wilkins then brought suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson.he sought redress for a wrongful denial of benefits under erisa a b,a b,as well as equitable relief under erisa a,a.in doing so,wilkins claimed additional benefits based on the covered employment that he asserted that he performed,even though such work was not reflected in the fund records.and he argued that the fund pay stub policy was arbitrary and capricious.he further alleged that the fund violated its fiduciary duties,see a b,in several respects a by improperly shifting its burden of keeping accurate records to him,b by failing to audit employers reporting of covered employment,c by failing to maintain the records of audits it did conduct,and d by failing to warn or advise participants that they could be called upon to produce evidence proving covered employment.following discovery,the parties for summary judgment.
the district court granted summary judgment in the fund favor in a memorandum and order issued april.reviewing wilkins denial of benefits under an arbitrary and capricious standard,the district court concluded that the fund original pay stub policy was arbitrary and capricious.however,the court took notice of a subsequent change in the fund practice,so that while the fund still adhered to its policy of requiring claimants to show additional covered employment,it dropped its insistence that they produce pay stubs.the court held that it was not arbitrary and capricious for the fund to require claimants to prove their entitlement to benefits based on earnings not reported.although the pay stub policy was formally dropped only after wilkins claim had been denied,the court found that the fund had,in fact,afforded wilkins the opportunity to submit any information he may have had that showed covered employment.because wilkins admitted to having no additional information,the court reasoned that he was not entitled to relief on this claim.wilkins,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court also denied wilkins breach of fiduciary duty claims.in the court view,erisa fiduciary duties do not prohibit a fund from requiring participants to bear the burden of showing additional employment when they claim benefits beyond those shown in the funds records,and while funds are permitted to audit employers payrolls,see cent.states,at,they are not required to audit every employer.wilkins,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court also concluded that the record did not support wilkins claim that the fund lost audit records pertaining to his employers.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
the court found wilkins claim that the fund had a duty to provide notice of its policy to be a closer question.the court pointed out that erisa and its regulations do require all funds to publish an spd that identifies,inter alia,circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial of any benefits that a participant or beneficiary might otherwise reasonably expect the plan to provide.l.while the fund argument that it was in compliance with the spd requirement rested on a narrow interpretation of the regulations,the court concluded that such an interpretation was nonetheless permissible under the deferential standard of review the court believed to be applicable.wilkins,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.moreover,assuming arguendo that the fund failure to give notice constituted a breach of duty,the court held that wilkins still could not claim additional benefits,as fiduciary duty violations entitle claimants only to equitable relief under erisa a,a,which,under life annuity insurance knudson,d,excludes money damages.wilkins,at,dist.lexis,at.
applicable causes of action 
erisa creates six different causes of action,only two of which are relevant here.first,erisa a b permits a plan participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.this is the workhorse of erisa remedy law,the provision under which routine benefit denial and other erisa claims proceed.john langbein,what erisa means by equitable the supreme court trail of error in russell,mertens,and,colum.
second,erisa a authorizes suits by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan a.section a has been characterized as a provision which normally is invoked only when relief is not available under a b.varity howe,d see also id.stating that a act s as a safety net,offering appropriate equitable relief for injuries caused by violations that does not elsewhere adequately remedy.but see devlin empire blue cross blue shield,cir varity did not eliminate a private cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty when another potential remedy is available instead,the district court remedy is limited to such equitable relief as is considered appropriate.the provision authorizes solely equitable relief,and under the supreme court decision in,supra,this means that money awards are available in suits brought under a only in very limited circumstances.gerosa savasta,cir see also,at.those rare cases in which a court of equity would decree specific performance of a contract to transfer funds were suits that,unlike the present case,sought to prevent future losses that either were incalculable or would be greater than the sum awarded.
we now turn to wilkins claims on appeal 
fiduciary duty violations 
erisa a b imposes a duty on fiduciaries which include plan administrators to discharge their duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiarity with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.wilkins alleges,in the alternative,that the fund violated its fiduciary duties by failing to audit his employers,and by failing to maintain adequate records of audits it conducted.both of these allegations are variations on his general refrain that the fund improperly shifted its burden of keeping earnings records to plan participants.
we reject each of his claims relating to the fund audit practices.wilkins asserts that the trustees had an obligation to audit his employers,both to confirm his hours of covered employment and to confirm that he was properly included in the bargaining unit under erisa,trustees have a fiduciary duty to act to ensure that a plan receives all funds to which it is entitled,so that those funds can be used on behalf of participants and beneficiaries.diduck kaszycki sons contractors,cir quoting cent.states,at.but i n performing this duty,trustees have a range of options,and t here is no duty to take any particular course of action if another approach seems preferable.diduck,at.in central states,the supreme court held that,in discharging their duty,trustees are permitted to conduct random audits of employers payroll records.see at.see also jaspan glover bottled gas,cir.wilkins cites no authority for the proposition that trustees are required to audit employers continually as they would need to do to guarantee the accuracy of employers remittance reports of course,if trustees took no effective action to ensure that the fund received the contributions it was due,such a failure might well constitute a dereliction of fiduciary duty in violation of the standard of erisa a b.but the record suggests,and wilkins does not contest,that it was the fund practice to conduct random audits of employers.see wilkins,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.as a result,the fact that the fund did not happen to audit wilkins employers during the years in question does not,without more,establish a breach of fiduciary duty.see moore provident life accident ins,cir under central states,the trustee of the employee benefit plan had the privilege,not the duty,to audit a member employer record.the trustee failure to audit the employer records,absent an express duty to do it,is not a violation of erisa.
as to wilkins claim that the fund failure to keep its audit records of his employers violated a fiduciary duty,the factual predicate of this the fund at one time possessed such audit no support in the record.wilkins surmises that the fund must have lost or destroyed audit reports.he does this apparently on the basis of an exchange of letters between his lawyer and the fund lawyer.wilkins attorney asked whether the absence of audit records on file for one of wilkins employees indicated that the firm was not audited,or that the records no longer existed.letter from robert bach to roberta chevlowe may.an attorney for the fund responded that t he definitive answer to your question is unknown by the fund current personnel.letter from roberta karen chevlowe to robert bach june.but this exchange is not enough to create a question of fact as to the existence and destruction of such records.
even taking all factual inferences in wilkins favor for the purpose of summary judgment,his fiduciary duty claim can not proceed on the basis of sheer speculation that audit records might have been destroyed.see mcclellan smith,cir the nonmoving party can not defeat summary judgment by a factual argument based on conjecture or surmise.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we deny this claim,and we do so without deciding the scope,if any,of a trustee responsibility to preserve audit records.
fund failure to give notice of its policy 
in keeping with erisa purpose of ensuring adequate disclosure with respect to pension and welfare plans,see a,all plans are required to publish a summary of participants rights and obligations under the plan,see.among other things,an spd must set out the circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial or loss of benefits.b.the regulations further provide that 
for both pension and welfare benefit plans,the spd must include a statement clearly identifying circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial,loss,forfeiture,suspension,offset,reduction,or recovery,by exercise of subrogation or reimbursement rights of any benefits that a participant or beneficiary might otherwise reasonably expect the plan to provide on the basis of the description of benefits required by the regulations.
l.see also j providing that the spd for an employee pension plan shall include a statement describing any other conditions which must be met before a participant will be eligible to receive benefits.
wilkins claims that it was a violation of erisa and its regulations for the fund not to give notice of the policy in the spd.in his complaint,wilkins styled this as a breach of the fiduciary duties owed under erisa a b.but in his briefs,wilkins argues more more the failure to give such notice violated erisa statutory and regulatory requirements for spds.
the district court rejected wilkins claim on two grounds.first,the court considered the fund contention that,because the policy was not a plan term,but merely a statement as to how the pension fund administers claims for benefits,disclosure of the policy was not required.wilkins,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.though finding this argument to rest on a narrow interpretation of the regulations,the district court concluded that the failure to publish the policy was not a fiduciary breach when viewed under the deferential standard of review.id.second,the district court found that,even assuming a breach existed,wilkins was not entitled to the money damages he sought,as suits under a are only for equitable relief,and under,claims for money damages for breach of fiduciary duty are unavailable for an individual plaintiff.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
we disagree with both of these rationales for denying relief.with respect to the first,it is true that,where a plan gives discretionary authority to the administrator,benefit denials are reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.see pagan nynex pension plan,cir.but wilkins spd claim does not ask us to review either the fund exercise of discretion or its interpretation of the plan.rather,we are called on to judge the fund compliance with the applicable statute and regulations.to do this,we must construe erisa requirement that circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial or loss of benefits be published in the spd.b.in other words,the question before us is simply one of statutory interpretation.and,in such matters,we owe the plan administrators no deference.the interpretation of erisa,a federal statute,is a question of law subject to de novo review.long flying tiger line.fixed pension plan for pilots,cir,quoted in burke kodak ret.income plan,cir.
to be sure,the second circuit has never squarely spoken to what standard of review applies in evaluating an spd compliance with erisa,and indeed,we have expressly reserved judgment on the question.see burke,at see also frommert conkright,cir.challenges to spds,in fact,involve different sorts of questions,some of which may call for deferential review while others do not.thus,the issue of an spd compliance may turn on the interpretation of ambiguous language in an spd.see,layaou xerox,cir considering whether the spd warning that the amount you receive may also be reduced if you had previously left the company and received a distribution at that time gave adequate notice of the defendant phantom account offsetting.and in such situations,there might be sound reasons for courts to defer to plan administrators interpretations of the spds.
but we need not,and hence do not,take any position on such spd interpretations.for,in the case before us,no provision of the spd even arguably gives notice of the policy,and hence,no deference to the fund position is appropriate accordingly,we hold that where,as here,a claim turns on whether erisa requires that a practice not mentioned in the spd be included in the spd,our review of the spd compliance with erisa is de novo.see also rhorer raytheon eng rs contractors,cir treating spd compliance with erisa as a legal question to be reviewed de novo.
before we proceed to an interpretation of the statute and regulations to see if the spd complied with them,we must,however,review the district court conclusion that,regardless of compliance,no relief under erisa is available to wilkins for this claim.for,if the court is correct,the question of compliance would not in this case be properly the subject of a judicial holding.
the district court starting premise is correct suits may be brought under a only for those categories of relief that were typically available in equity,mertens hewitt,d,and classic compensatory damages are never included within these categories,gerosa,at.see also,at.we believe,however,that wilkins claim may be understood not as a claim for equitable relief under a,but as a claim to recover plan benefits under a b.accordingly,the limitations on the forms of relief available under a do not apply to his claim.
as noted above,a b empowers a plan participant to sue,inter alia,to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.here,the plan states that,depending on the year,participants will be awarded one pension credit for every hours or worth of covered employment.the plan also states that they will receive monthly benefits equal to the total number of pension credits earned multiplied by a certain dollar amount.wilkins alleges that he did not receive pension credits for all the covered employment he performed,and hence,that he did not receive the full measure of benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.had the spd put him on notice that his benefits might be denied if he failed to preserve and present records of covered employment,it is alleged that he would have been in a position to produce the necessary records and claim his benefits.thus,the fund wrongful failure to inform him of circumstances which may result in disqualification,ineligibility,or denial or loss of benefits led to his not receiving benefits due him under the terms of the plan.see,wilkins aff,opening br.at.in other words,wilkins challenge to the spd asserts the elements of a a b claim.
at oral argument,counsel for the fund countered that,where a denial of benefits claim rests on the assertion of a a b fiduciary duty violation,a is the only avenue of relief available.the fund counsel suggested that strom goldman,sachs,cir,is on point.but the situation in strom was quite different from that presented in this case.the defendant plan administrator in strom had failed to process jonathan strom supplemental life insurance policy in a timely manner,so that when strom died,he did not have the level of coverage he had applied for.strom widow sued,inter alia,under a b for the benefits she would have received had the policy been in effect.id.at.the second circuit rejected this claim
