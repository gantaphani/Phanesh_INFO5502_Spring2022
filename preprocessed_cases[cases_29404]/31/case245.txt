john hancock mutual life insurance company hancock appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york chin,awarding to harris trust and savings bank and the bank of new york harris million,including attorneys fees and interest,the court having found that hancock violated the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,by breaching in various ways its fiduciary duties of loyalty and avoidance of.
in,hancock and sperry rand corporation sperry,one of harris predecessors as trustee entered into group annunity contract the contract,which established a retirement plan for the benefit of sperry employees the plan.as originally conceived,the contract was a deferred annuities form of contract whereby sperry purchased from hancock deferred annuities to be paid to sperry employees upon retirement.the premiums paid by sperry for the annuities became part of hancock general account,and hancock issued the guaranteed annuities at purchase rates fixed by the contract.by a amendment,the contract was modified to make it a retrospective intermediate participation guarantee form of contract.this meant that the premiums paid in by sperry were credited to a pension administrative fund,which is an account maintained for sperry on hancock books.as had been the case prior to the amendment,the premiums paid went into hancock general account,from which hancock made investments on behalf of many different clients,and from which every year it allocated investment income and expenses to the plan.the parties agreed that hancock would hold in reserve of the liabilities of the guaranteed annuities portion of the plan the amount in excess of that reserve is referred to as free funds.the amendment also provided a mechanism whereby sperry could withdraw,or roll over,free funds through a transfer of free funds.exercise of this provision would trigger the reversion of the contract to a deferred annuity contract as it was prior to the amendment.
due to the high interest rates of the late and early,the value of the plan increased significantly,and sperry sought to remove free funds without suffering the paper losses that would have resulted if sperry withdrew free funds in accordance with the terms of the contract.on three occasions,hancock permitted sperry to roll over free funds in a manner that would not result in these paper losses but,citing cash flow problems,hancock refused sperry fourth request.
in the early,sperry also requested at various points that hancock alter the method by which it valued the liabilities for the guaranteed portion of the plan assets because the interest rate assumptions provided by the contract caused the plan liabilities to be significantly overstated.hancock refused this request as well.
frustrated but unwilling to terminate the contract,sperry sued hancock in,alleging breach of contract,unjust enrichment,professional malpractice,and breach of fiduciary duty and other violations of erisa.following years of appeals,a bench trial eventually took place in the southern district of new york and was concluded on november.the district court found that hancock had breached its fiduciary duties under erisa and awarded sperry million in damages,attorneys fees,and interest.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and vacate in part and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual history 
the factual background of this litigation,which is now in its nineteenth year,is set forth in the numerous opinions issued prior to the present appeal.the most detailed factual summaries are contained in the decision of the district court from which this appeal was taken,harris trust sav.bank john hancock mut.life ins,d judgment opinion,and the decision by this court when the case was last before us,harris trust sav.bank john hancock mut.life ins,cir second circuit,aff sub nom.john hancock mut.life ins.harris trust sav.bank,d supreme court.familiarity with those decisions is assumed and only the facts necessary to the disposition of this appeal are recounted here.
a.the contract 
the contract to which sperry and hancock were parties,entered into in,was a deferred annuities form of contract under which sperry purchased from hancock deferred annuities to be paid to sperry employees upon retirement.second circuit,at.in,the contract was amended to provide that the money paid in by sperry was credited to the plan,which was part of hancock general account.id.from this account,hancock made investments on behalf of many different clients,and every year it allocated investment income and expenses to the plan.id.
in addition to what was effectively an investment management service,hancock provided several other benefits under the contract.first,hancock guaranteed that sperry beneficiaries would receive upon retirement a certain fixed annuity regardless of the performance of the plan.id.the contract thus preserved its essential feature.
second,hancock provided sperry access,with certain restrictions,to the free funds generated by its payments into the general account.the free funds were calculated as follows.every year hancock calculated its forecasted liabilities of the fund lof.id.under the contract,the plan had to be maintained at a minimum operating level mol,which was of the lof.id.free funds constituted any amount in the plan in excess of the mol 
at all times under the contract,sperry had the option of ordering a return of free funds,at which point the contract would revert to a deferred annuity contract,the way it was before.in accordance with state law,hancock had to account for the plan,the lof,and the free funds using the book value of assets.however,the contract provided that free funds be returned only at market value,which would require a calculation.in an environment of rising interest rates,the adjustment generally would have reduced the value assigned to the funds released,as the high interest rates would have caused the market value of bonds and some other assets in hancock general account to fall below their book value.judgment opinion,d at.
a contractual benefit for sperry created by the amendments was a provision allowing sperry to designate additional employees,beyond those whose annuities hancock had originally guaranteed,to receive benefits from the plan.second circuit,at.so long as the plan amount was sufficient to cover the corresponding increase in the lof and thus the mol,hancock would add these employees to the guaranteed beneficiaries list.id.however,in,the parties amended the contract to provide that,while sperry could continue to designate new employees to receive benefits from the free funds,these benefits would no longer be guaranteed in case of a reversion to a deferred annuity contract.id.at.in addition,hancock reserved the right to stop accepting such new employees upon notice,an option it exercised in.id.sperry could always buy new guaranteed benefits,although it never did so.
at several points hancock consented to a benefit not specified in the contract by allowing sperry to withdraw free funds at their book value,without applying the adjustment.these rollovers occurred in,and.judgment opinion,d at.however,sperry fourth request for a rollover,in,was rejected by hancock.id.
prior to sperry had been requesting that hancock consider changing the way it valued the lof because higher interest rates had caused the liabilities to be greatly overstated.id.at.internal memoranda demonstrate that hancock recognized that the lof was overstated.nonetheless,hancock declined to alter the method for calculating the lof,stating that its policy was to value annuities according to the method initially established by contract.id.at.
in december,hancock presented to sperry possible changes to the contract,including a revised method for calculating the lof that would take account of the higher interest rates.id.at.the parties subsequently discussed additional revaluation proposals,which were ultimately rejected by sperry.therefore,no changes were made to the contract regarding the interest rate assumptions used for calculating the lof.
as compensation for administration of the plan,hancock received under the contract an annual risk charge equal to of the net interest earned by the plan.id.at.
hancock investment and allocation decisions 
fixed and frozen assets 
from at least as early as,hancock invested assets of the plan in its own home office properties and charged itself rent,thereby generating investment income.id.at.hancock invested a greater proportion of its assets in home office properties than most other comparable insurance companies.id.at.the rates of return were consistently lower in many years than the return on other investments made by hancock for its customers,due,in part,to the fact that hancock was charging itself rent on its properties.also,two of the buildings in question had low occupancy rates but high operating expenses.id.
hancock allocated the investment income for these fixed and frozen assets in a manner that was advantageous to its group insurance line of business and disadvantageous to the group pension line,which includes the plan.hancock did not allocate any portion of its investments in fixed and frozen assets to the portion of the general account for which hancock bore the investment risk.id.hancock group pension actuary and others at hancock repeatedly questioned the manner in which hancock was allocating fixed and frozen income to the group pension line.nonetheless,hancock did not significantly alter the way in which it allocated its investments in fixed and frozen assets.id.at.
hancock also invested in its own subsidiaries,which similarly yielded low rates of return.these investments were allocated in the same manner as the investments in other fixed and frozen assets.id.
the cost of borrowing 
during certain years hancock borrowed money and allocated the cost of that borrowing to different lines of business,including the group pension line,which included the plan.id.the group pension line of business,however,was always profitable and the cash flow associated with the plan was always positive.hancock nonetheless allocated borrowing costs to the plan.id.at.
indirect expenses 
hancock also allocated to the plan a portion of the litigation costs of the instant case and a portion of the expenses incurred in lobbying congress to amend erisa to relieve hancock and other insurers of the fiduciary duties that the courts in this case have held erisa imposes on them.id.at.
segmentation 
in,hancock divided its general account into subaccounts that had their own investment policies.id.one of these subaccounts was the participating segment,which was applicable to the plan,and another was the segment.for the investment year,hancock allocated higher yielding investments to its business than it allocated to participating contracts.id.thus,hancock benefitted from this allocation,to the detriment of the participating segment,which included the plan.
ii.procedural history 
sperry first pleaded its claims against hancock in a complaint dated july.in its ruling on the parties motions for partial summary judgment dated september,the district court patterson,dismissed sperry claims under erisa,holding that the plan qualified as a guaranteed benefit policy and was therefore exempt from erisa fiduciary responsibilities.harris trust sav.bank john hancock mut.life ins.on august,the district court patterson,granted hancock motion for summary judgment on the contract and common law claims.harris trust sav.bank john hancock mut.life ins.the district court final judgment,entered on august,dismissed in its entirety sperry complaint as amended.
sperry appealed that judgment to this court.we agreed with the district court that the guaranteed portion of the plan was exempt from erisa fiduciary duties,but reversed the court determination that hancock had no fiduciary duty with regard to the free funds,which constitute the portion of the plan.second circuit,at.sperry then successfully petitioned the supreme court for a writ of certiorari,and that court affirmed our ruling,holding that erisa guaranteed benefit policy exclusion did not apply to the free funds.supreme court,at.
following a bench trial,the district court chin,determined that hancock had violated erisa by breaching its fiduciary duties of loyalty and avoidance of when it refused sperry request to roll over free funds refused to revalue the lof collected the risk charge for administration of the plan and made investment and allocation decisions that placed its own interests ahead of the interests of the plan and plan participants and beneficiaries.judgment opinion,d at.
in the damages phase of the trial,the district court held that sperry was entitled to the following in damages for hancock failure to release the free funds,and in prejudgment interest on that amount in damages with respect to the allocation and excess risk charge claims,and in prejudgment interest on that amount for attorneys fees and costs,and in prejudgment interest on that amount and for costs for expert witnesses.harris trust sav.bank john hancock mut.life ins,d.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,aramony united way replacement benefit plan,cir,and its conclusions of law de novo,connors.life ins,cir.further,we review the district court decision to award attorneys fees for abuse of discretion,lauder first unum life ins,cir and its calculation of those damages as a matter of law,de novo,id.
i.the policy and relevant provisions of erisa 
erisa was enacted in order to protect employee pension and retirement plans.see,sess,reprinted in,the primary purpose of the bill is the protection of individual pension rights.one of the ways erisa accomplishes this goal is by setting forth certain general fiduciary duties applicable to the management of such plans.varity howe,d.in relevant part,erisa provides that a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent that he or she exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of the plan,or has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of the plan.the fiduciary duties at issue in this case are the duty of loyalty and the duty to avoid.
under erisa,the duty of loyalty is expressed as follows 
a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and 
a for the exclusive purpose of 
i providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries 
a a i.the prohibition against provides that a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not deal with the assets of the plan in his own interest or for his own account.b.the district court found that hancock breaches of its fiduciary duties implicated both the duty of loyalty and the duty to avoid.judgment opinion,d at.
ii.hancock arguments on appeal 
hancock raises six arguments on appeal that it had no fiduciary duty to grant sperry request for a rollover of free funds that it had no fiduciary duty to revalue the lof that it did not breach a fiduciary duty by collecting the risk charge as provided for in the contract that it did not breach fiduciary duties with respect to investment and allocation decisions that the district court calculation of damages resulting from hancock refusal to permit the rollover of free funds was erroneous and that the district court awarded attorneys fees without making the necessary findings required under erisa.we address these arguments seriatim.
hancock refusal to allow sperry to withdraw free funds 
hancock first argues that the fact that it has certain fiduciary duties as to the free funds does not mean that it had a fiduciary obligation to agree to an transfer of them.we agree.
it is law of the case that hancock stood in a fiduciary relationship to sperry with respect to the free funds.in affirming our decision so concluding,the supreme court squarely held that erisa fiduciary obligations bind hancock in its management of the free funds.supreme court,at.thus,it is incontrovertible that hancock was required to exercise its managerial discretion with respect to the free funds in accordance with erisa fiduciary duty provisions.the primary question presented on this appeal is whether hancock general fiduciary duty includes an obligation to release free funds to sperry in a manner different from that specified in the contract.we conclude that neither the language nor the policy of erisa support the imposition of a duty that would require hancock to agree to sperry request for an rollover.indeed,we find that the establishment and administration of employee retirement plans would be undermined by the district court determination.
erisa does not expressly address whether a fiduciary under the statute has an obligation to agree to a request by a plan trustee or settlor that contradicts specific provisions of the plan governing documents.erisa instead merely states that a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent that he or she exercises discretion over the management of the plan.we find that this language and case law interpreting erisa fiduciary standards generally lead to the conclusion that hancock was not acting in a fiduciary capacity when it refused sperry request for an rollover of free funds.
the district court reached the opposite conclusion,reasoning as follows 
hancock refused to return plan assets to the trust when the trust sought to use the rollover procedure in to withdraw accumulated free funds.the trust felt it could get a better return by investing the excess funds elsewhere,but hancock refused to return the plan assets because of its cash flow problems.instead,hancock exercised its discretion to terminate the rollover procedures that had enabled the trust to withdraw a total of million prior to.clearly,hancock put its own interests and cash flow needs ahead of the interests of the plan and its beneficiaries.by doing so,hancock violated its obligations under erisa.
judgment opinion,d at.the district court conclusion is flawed in three respects.
first,the district court is implicitly defining erisa use of the word discretion to include any decision a plan administrator could conceivably make.in other words,the court found hancock refusal to consent,because it could have consented,to be a discretionary act.we disagree with this interpretation.here,hancock did not contractually or otherwise retain discretion over whether or on what terms to permit a rollover of free funds instead,the opposite is true hancock surrendered that discretion when it agreed to the provision in the amended contract that provided for a specific rollover mechanism.of course,hancock could choose to waive the contractual requirement,just as could any party to any contract,but that can not mean that hancock had an obligation to do so.were we to accept the district court conclusion,there would be no limit to the scope of a fiduciary duties under erisa because a plan administrator would be in breach of his duties whenever he rejects a request by a plan trustee that is contrary to the parties terms for operation of the plan.we can not countenance such a broad reading of the scope of erisa fiduciary duties.
as this court has observed,a person may be an erisa fiduciary with respect to certain matters but not others,for he has that status only to the extent that he has or exercises the described authority or responsibility.krear nineteen named trustees,cir see also siskind sperry ret.program,cir o nly when fulfilling certain defined functions,including the exercise of discretionary authority or control over plan management or administration,does a person become a fiduciary under erisa.we do not believe that discretionary authority can be read to include any concession a plan administrator could gratuitously make to a plan trustee.we conclude instead that t he management or disposition language in erisa refers to the common transactions in dealing with a pool of assets selecting investments,exchanging one instrument or asset for another,and so on.johnson,cir.thus,we find that hancock refusal to permit sperry request for an rollover of free funds was not an exercise of discretionary authority over the plan and therefore did not implicate its fiduciary duties under erisa 
the second problem with the district court holding is its characterization of hancock refusal to permit the rollover as a terminat ion of the rollover procedures.judgment opinion,d at.hancock gratuitous acquiescence to sperry three prior requests for an rollover can not be construed as having established a rollover procedure.in point of fact,the only rollover procedure in place was the one agreed to contractually by the parties,which sperry sought to avoid by its requests.therefore,hancock refusal to permit a fourth rollover could not have been the termination of a procedure it was instead merely adherence to the terms of the contract,entered into freely by both parties.
third,hancock stated reason for refusing sperry fourth request for an own cash flow not constitute,as found by the district court,a breach of its fiduciary duty of loyalty.again,we reject such a broad interpretation of erisa fiduciary duties.a plan administrator must be permitted to consider its own legitimate business interests when deciding whether to gratuitously grant a request by a plan trustee,particularly when the request diverges from the terms agreed to by the parties.erisa fiduciary duty provisions can not be interpreted as requiring plan administrators to agree to any and all requests made by a plan trustee because the economy has moved in a direction that,at a given moment,makes adherence to contract provisions less attractive.
the essential difficulty of this case,unresolved explicitly by erisa,is the relationship between provisions contained within a retirement plan governing documents and the fiduciary obligations imposed on plan administrators by the statute.one statutory provision touches on this question erisa provides that a fiduciary shall discharge his duties in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the fiduciary duty provisions of erisa.a d see also cent.states cent,d t rust documents must generally be construed in light of erisa policies.we find nothing in the contract that is inconsistent with erisa fiduciary duty obligations.as the seventh circuit has explained,
i f a specific term not a grant of power to change terms is bargained for at arm length,adherence to that term is not a breach of fiduciary duty.no discretion is exercised when an insurer merely adheres to a specific contract term.when a contract,however,grants an insurer discretionary authority,even though the contract itself is the product of an arm length bargain,the insurer may be a fiduciary.
ed miniat,globe life ins.group,cir.
we agree that where parties negotiate the terms of a contract governing a retirement plan,the adherence to those terms by a plan administrator can not constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties,barring a grant of discretionary authority to the fiduciary.here,the contract did not grant to hancock the discretionary authority to permit or refuse withdrawal of the free funds whenever requested by sperry.in fact,by specifically providing the sole means for withdrawal of free funds in accordance with the formula,the contract stripped hancock of any discretionary authority it might otherwise have had in this respect.hancock could not,for instance,refuse to permit sperry to withdraw free funds in accordance with the contractual provision.similarly,hancock could not insist on book value or some other means of valuation for such withdrawal.neither can sperry.
sperry and hancock agreed at arm length to the formula under which sperry could withdraw free funds.the exercise of that provision became unattractive to sperry through no fault of hancock the free funds became more valuable simply as a result of outside market forces.we conclude,in accord with the seventh circuit,that the scope of an insurer fiduciary duty is defined by the contract entered into at arm length unless that contract vests in the insurer discretionary authority.
it is important to understand the practical consequences of a ruling affirming the district court conclusion on this issue.to adopt a rule by which erisa fiduciaries have a duty to agree to requests that are contrary to the provisions of plan documents would render meaningless the negotiation of the terms of the agreement between the parties and would likely destroy the market for erisa contracts.plan trustees,such as sperry,would have no reciprocal obligation to grant requests of plan administrators,such as hancock,when the economic climate moved in a way that disadvantaged the latter.fiduciaries therefore would be unwilling to enter into contracts for retirement plans governed by erisa because of the potential economic losses they would face.public policy would not be served by the definition of fiduciary duties articulated by the district court.
for all these reasons,we find that hancock refusal to permit sperry to roll over free funds under a formula different from that called for in the contract did not constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under erisa.
hancock refusal to revalue plan liabilities 
hancock next argues that its refusal to revalue the plan liabilities did not constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties because the manner in which the lof was calculated is specified in the contract and it had no fiduciary duty to renegotiate that provision the lof was the contractual reserve for the guaranteed portion of the plan funds and thus exempt from erisa fiduciary duty obligations and computation of the lof does not involve any management or disposition of plan assets and is therefore not within the scope of its fiduciary duties.we agree with hancock in all respects.the amendment required that the plan be maintained at of the lof.the lof for cancelled annuities was calculated using interest rate assumptions of or,depending on when the benefits were first guaranteed,and using the standard annuity and group annuity mortality tables.judgment opinion,d at.because interest rates had drastically increased since,these assumed rates of return had the effect of significantly overstating the plan liabilities.sperry requested that hancock change its method for calculating the lof and hancock refused.id.at.the district court found that hancock refusal to revalue the lof constituted a breach of its fiduciary duties under erisa.id.at.we disagree.
just as hancock had no fiduciary duty to permit sperry to withdraw free funds in an manner,it likewise had no fiduciary duty to revalue the lof merely because such revaluation would benefit sperry.for the same reasons discussed in part.supra,hancock did not breach its fiduciary duties by adhering to the terms of the contract rather than gratuitously granting sperry request.
second,the lof is the contractual reserve for the pension benefit obligations guaranteed by hancock in other words,the lof provision specifies the precise amount that hancock is required to pay to beneficiaries regardless of the performance of the plan.the district court ruling ignores this important legal distinction.as discussed at length in the previous opinions in this case,erisa expressly exempts from the fiduciary obligations it imposes the management of guaranteed funds.see,second circuit,at.for this independent reason,hancock could not have breached a fiduciary duty to sperry in refusing to revalue the lof,because that calculation pertained to the guaranteed portion of the plan and therefore no such duty ever arose.
third,hancock refusal to revalue the lof did not trigger erisa fiduciary obligations because computation of the lof does not implicate the management or disposition of a pool of assets,at.as discussed above,rather than exercising any discretionary authority over the plan,hancock merely chose to adhere to contractual terms that are not inconsistent with erisa fiduciary duty obligations.because hancock had no fiduciary duty to agree to sperry request to revalue the lof,hancock could not be in breach of that duty.
we therefore conclude that hancock refusal to revalue the lof did not constitute a breach of erisa fiduciary obligations.
hancock collection of the risk charge 
hancock next argues that its collection of a risk charge on the net investment income allocated to the plan did not breach its fiduciary duties.we again agree with hancock.
the district court found that hancock collection of its compensation under the contract was a breach of its fiduciary duties,stating that hancock did not actually face any risk with respect to the free funds during this time period because it was sufficiently protected by other provisions of the contract so that it was not at material risk.therefore,the excess risk charges collected by hancock during this time period constituted overcompensation.judgment opinion,d at citation to the record omitted.we disagree with this determination.
the risk charge was hancock direct compensation under the contract.surely,hancock was entitled to charge sperry a fee for its administration of the plan.as with all the provisions of the contract,the parties negotiated at arm length the terms of hancock compensation and agreed on a fee of of the net investment income.again,the changed economic climate may have rendered hancock compensation more lucrative than what the parties expected at the time of contracting.nonetheless,there is nothing inherently inconsistent with the contract compensation provision and erisa fiduciary duty obligations.as we have held,a person is not an erisa fiduciary with respect to the terms of the agreement for his compensation.krear,at.
thus,we reverse the district court ruling that hancock breached its fiduciary duties by collecting the risk charge.
hancock investment and allocation decisions 
hancock argues that the district court erred in holding that hancock investment and allocation decisions breached its fiduciary duties.we reject the argument in part and leave the balance of the argument for further development.
as an initial matter,it is worth noting that the district court determinations in this area are fundamentally different in one important respect from its conclusions regarding the rollover request,the revaluation of the lof,and the risk charge.each of these latter conclusions addressed aspects of the relationship between the parties specified by the contract,and thus were outside the scope of hancock fiduciary duties.by contrast,the contract did not specify how hancock would invest sperry funds in its general account,nor how it would allocate the returns on its investments and its expenses among its various client accounts such as the plan.we believe that such transactions represent the quintessential discretionary management decisions that erisa seeks to protect.thus,hancock had a fiduciary duty to sperry with respect to its investment and allocation decisions 
fixed and frozen assets 
the district court concluded that hancock violated its fiduciary duties as a result of its investment decisions in fixed and frozen assets,which consistently performed poorly.judgment opinion,d at.hancock argues that the mere happenstance of an investment allocation that resulted in reduced income can not suffice to establish a breach of fiduciary duty and that those investments were expected to bear fruit only in the long term.hancock argument can not withstand scrutiny.
the district court findings with regard to hancock investments in fixed and frozen assets,none of which are contested by hancock,clearly demonstrate violations of both hancock duty to avoid and its duty of loyalty.the court found that hancock charged itself rental rates on its home office properties.this breached hancock fiduciary duty to avoid because hancock deal t with the assets of the p lan in its own interest.b.
moreover,hancock chose not to allocate any of these investments to the portion of the general account for which it bore the investment risk.instead,hancock allocated those investment decisions to the participating group pension contracts,including the plan,for which the policyholders bore the investment risk.id.at.as a result,the fixed and frozen asset investments significantly drove down the rate of return for the plan.the court found that the allocation decisions were driven largely by a desi
