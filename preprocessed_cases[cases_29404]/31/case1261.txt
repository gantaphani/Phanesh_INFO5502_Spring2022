limits of jurisdiction sandlin and peacock 
in sandlin corporate interiors,cir,this court relied on cook beecher,to hold that when postjudgment proceedings seek to hold nonparties liable for a judgment on a theory that requires proof on facts and theories significantly different from those underlying the judgment,an independent basis for federal jurisdiction must exist.sandlin,at.we then applied that principle to deny the existence of federal jurisdiction over various efforts including the assertion of an claim.id.at.
shortly thereafter,the supreme court reaffirmed cook in an erisa case,holding that a plaintiff who had obtained a judgment against a corporate employer could not enforce the judgment in a second suit asserting a theory against a shareholder without an independent basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.peacock thomas,d.the circuits had followed conflicting approaches to the question of jurisdiction in actions,and the court specifically cited sandlin as an example of the approach it upheld.peacock,at.see generally futura dev.of,estado libre asociado de,cir discussing peacock and sandlin in connection with subject matter jurisdiction over claim asserted in action.
courts have recognized a number of analytical distinctions that clarify and delimit peacock reach.if an claim is asserted in conjunction with the underlying federal cause of action,the latter may provide the basis for ancillary jurisdiction over the claim,obviating peacock concerns it is only when an claim is asserted in a separate proceeding that peacock requires an independent basis for federal jurisdiction bd.of,sheet metal workers,pension fund elite erectors,cir citing cases limiting peacock to successive litigation ortolf silver bar mines,cir.peacock also is not implicated in actions to reach and collect assets of the judgment debtor held by a third party it is only when the plaintiff seeks to hold the third party personally liable on the judgment that an independent jurisdictional basis is required.epperson entm t express,cir citing cases holding peacock inapplicable to cases involving fraudulent conveyances.and,of course,in any action otherwise governed by peacock there may in fact be an independent basis for federal jurisdiction.see,trust,first flight,cir relying on diversity as independent jurisdictional basis for purposes of peacock.
plaintiffs do not,however,invoke any of these and circumscribed points here.instead,they urge us to follow a categorical exception to peacock adopted by the seventh circuit in the elite erectors case that,in our view,is both generally and specifically inconsistent with this court position in sandlin.
this categorical exception derives from a narrower and more nuanced analysis set out in central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund central transport,cir.central states drew a distinction between claims that posit an alter ego direct concurrent liability for an erisa violation where the defendant,often a parent corporation,exercised common control over fund obligations at the time of the violation,so that it is held liable for its own part in the initial erisa violation and claims that posit a retroactive or vicarious liability where the defendant is traced to or associated with an employer in such a way that it is held to account for the employer violation.see id.at.the former reflects a specific claim for relief under erisa asserted directly against the alter ego,which does not implicate peacock concerns while the latter reflects an attempt to use ancillary jurisdiction to impose an obligation to pay an existing federal debt on a person not already liable for that judgment,which is precisely what peacock holds must have its own jurisdictional basis independent of the federal character of the underlying erisa judgment.id.quoting peacock,at.
the central states analysis is consistent with peacock,which as the seventh circuit noted involved a claim falling squarely on the vicarious side of its liability distinction.id.it is also reconcilable with our sandlin decision.sandlin rejection of alter jurisdiction was tempered by the qualification that we were not attempting to decide all future cases,when the contentions may be more intertwined with the merits of an underlying federal claim.at.that qualification could easily be read to encompass the direct liability situation discussed in central states,where the allegations inherently link the defendant to the underlying erisa violation 
plaintiffs urge us to go much further than that,however.they would have us follow the seventh circuit later expansion of central states in the elite erectors case,which glossed over central states functional distinction between direct liability based on common control and generic vicarious liability,bluntly presumed that all claims involve direct liability,and categorically limited peacock to claims.elite erectors,at.this extends central states well beyond its rationale if all claims involve direct liability,even when they assert only that a successor must answer for the predecessor past violations,then the distinctive feature of direct liability underpinning central states it turns on the alter ego direct participation in the underlying been lost.
more concretely,the move from central states to elite erectors put the seventh circuit squarely at odds with this circuit holding in sandlin.it is also inconsistent with the application of peacock in a number of other circuits,which have addressed the jurisdictional viability of efforts based on claims without any suggestion that they should be treated differently than claims.see,trust,at epperson,at futura dev.of,at.indeed,elite erectors appears to conflict with peacock itself,insofar as the supreme court indicated that its holding,though specifically addressed to a claim,was broad enough to address the conflicting practices of several circuits,including ours in sandlin,that had involved claims.see peacock,at.citing,as examples of circuit conflict court was resolving,sandlin,which had rejected jurisdiction over claim,and blackburn truck lines,francis,cir,which had affirmed jurisdiction over claim see also futura dev.of,at noting peacock discussion of other relevant circuit and supreme court case law confirms that its holding is as broad as dictated by its logic.
in sum,the jurisdictional principles set out in sandlin and confirmed in peacock govern here.no separate federal jurisdictional basis is needed when erisa liability is asserted directly against a second entity based upon that second entity direct role in the erisa violation.this principle applies regardless of whether erisa liability is asserted upon the basis of an or theory.on the other hand,if erisa liability is asserted derivatively against a second entity that did not directly participate in the erisa for example,where successor liability is a separate basis for federal jurisdiction must be established.in short,the determinative factor is not whether erisa liability is asserted against the second company based upon an or theory rather,the determinative factor is whether erisa liability is asserted against the second company directly based on the actions of the second company or whether liability is asserted only derivatively or vicariously against
