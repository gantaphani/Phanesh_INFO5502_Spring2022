b.the plan 
cb richard ellis provides ltd benefits to its employees under an employee benefit plan governed by erisa.from january,until december,cb richard ellis funded the plan by purchasing insurance from unum,which served as the insurer and administrator of the plan.on january,metlife replaced unum as the insurer and administrator of the plan.at that time,metlife issued a new insurance policy,which specified that it held discretionary authority to determine a participant eligibility for benefits.the two insurers coverage provisions differed,particularly in their definitions of disability.
unum policy 
the unum long term disability policy provided coverage for disability when,in unum determination 
you are limited from performing the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to your sickness or injury and 
you have a or more loss in your indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury and 
during the elimination period,you are unable to perform any of the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation.
a beneficiary must be continuously disabled for an elimination period of days before he becomes eligible for benefits from unum.coverage extends to the date that the policy or plan is cancelled,but may end earlier if other eligibility criteria are not met.unum insuring agreement includes payable claims that occur while the employee is covered under the policy or plan.unum acts as the claims administrator,and has discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to interpret the terms and provisions of the policy.
metlife policy 
on january,metlife replaced unum as the insurer and administrator of the plan.metlife issued a new policy,comprised of a certificate of insurance,or master plan document,as well as a summary plan description.metlife policy defines the term disability differently in three places once in the certificate of insurance,and twice in the summary plan description.the certificate of insurance defines disabled or disability as 
due to sickness or as a direct result of accidental injury 
you are receiving appropriate care and treatment and complying with the requirements of such treatment and 
you are unable to earn 
during the elimination period and the next months of sickness or accidental injury,more than of your predisability earnings at your own occupation from any employer in your local economy and 
after such period,more than of your predisability earnings from any employer in your local economy at any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably qualified taking into account your training,education and experience.
metlife summary plan sets forth two additional definitions of disability.first,the summary plan plan benefits description specifies that a participant is considered disabled when determined to be unable to perform your regular job functions due to sickness,or as a direct result of accidental injury the employee sic is receiving appropriate care and treatment and complying with the requirements of such treatment.the summary plan definitions section,however,defines disability as a condition in which a person is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of regular occupation due to illness or injury.
metlife certificate of insurance includes a clause specifying rules for when insurance takes effect if you were insured under the prior plan on the day before the replacement date,which states 
if you are actively at work on the day before the replacement date,you will become insured for disability income insurance under this certificate on the replacement date.
if you are not actively at work on the day before the replacement date,you will become insured for disability income insurance under this certificate on the date you return to active work.
metlife policy,however,also includes two differing definitions of actively at work.the certificate of insurance defines actively at work or active work to mean you are performing all of the usual and customary duties of your job on a basis.the summary plan defines actively at work or active work to mean being on the job as required of an employee or independent contractor of cb richard ellis.
mitchell claims for ltd benefits with metlife 
on april,mitchell applied for ltd benefits by completing and submitting a disability claim request form with metlife.in section claim information,the request form includes three boxes to be completed concerning the onset of disability.the first box asks for the date of first treatment for this condition mitchell supplied.the second box seeks date last worked must answer mitchell answered still working.the third box asks for date disability began mitchell responded.on april,metlife denied mitchell claim on the ground that he was ineligible for benefits because he did not meet the definition of disability or disabled under the certificate of insurance definition because he was capable of performing his work as vp of sales,which is classified as sedentary.it based this conclusion on the attending physician statement,which indicated that mitchell received treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee and that mitchell was working now.the denial was also explicitly based on mitchell statement on the claim form that he was still working.the letter also advised mitchell of his right to appeal this adverse determination.mitchell then availed himself of metlife administrative review process as outlined in the april,letter.in december,he filed an appeal and submitted additional medical records,supporting letters from examining physicians,and colleagues at cb richard ellis.
on january,metlife upheld its original decision to deny ltd benefits to mitchell,this time finding that he did not meet its summary plan definition of disability.under this definition,a plan participant must be unable to perform the material and substantial duties of regular occupation.metlife further stated that an independent physician review of the medical documentation did not support a finding that mitchell condition was severe enough to prevent him from performing his own occupation,and concluded that mitchell did not meet the summary plan definition of disability.during the initial claim and the administrative review processes,metlife never specified as a reason for denial that it was not the provider of ltd benefits at the claimed onset of mitchell disability in october.
