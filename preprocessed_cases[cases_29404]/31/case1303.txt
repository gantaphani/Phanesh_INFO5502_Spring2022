the plaintiff donya leigh anderson appeals from the district court order granting final summary judgment to the defendant,unum provident corporation unum in this diversity action for breach of contract,fraud,suppression,and bad faith because unum denied anderson claim for long term disability benefits.the district court held that unum long term disability plan was governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,and,therefore,that anderson state law claims were wholly preempted by erisa.after thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties briefs and oral presentations we agree and,accordingly,affirm.
the relevant facts and procedural history are straightforward.since until at least the filing of her lawsuit against unum on june,anderson was employed by shaw industries,shaw.in,shaw first contracted with unum to provide a long term disability plan the unum plan to its hourly employees.in march,shaw renewed this contract with unum.shaw,the largest carpet manufacturer in the world,conducts its business nationwide and the unum plan is available to its hourly employees throughout the nation.anderson participated in the unum plan at all relevant times.
upon commencing employment at shaw,every employee receives the employee information and benefits portfolio the benefits portfolio,which identifies all employee benefits provided by shaw,including the optional long term disability plan.the cover of the benefits portfolio features a corporate logo the shaw emblem which features the words shaw industries.benefits you and a caption below stating corporate employee benefits department.the benefits portfolio does not refer to unum by name,but the unum plan is the sole long term disability plan offered by shaw.
as the benefits portfolio explains,only hourly employees who have worked for at least days are eligible to purchase the unum plan.during the waiting period,employees are covered by the short term disability plan,which shaw provides at no cost to its employees.the benefits portfolio includes a comprehensive description of this short term disability plan,which explains in part that no benefits shall be payable under this plan if the disability entitles the participant to any benefits under the shaw optional long term disability plan.
every year,shaw sends letters to its employees and posts notices in the workplace reminding the employees of the open enrollment period for its benefit plans,notably including the unum plan.if employees do not enroll in the unum plan when they first become eligible,they must wait until the next open enrollment period.to enroll,employees complete a form that bears the shaw emblem and is titled optional long term disability plan.there is no unum corporate logo on the form,but a sentence in the middle of the page,in regular font,informs the applicant that t his is an insured plan by.the form notes that the eligibility period is the period covered by shaw short term disability.by signing the document,the employee instructs shaw to deduct the insurance premiums from the employee payroll.employees file the form at the human resources office of the shaw facility where they work,and the form is then forwarded to the shaw corporate office.
payroll deduction is the only method available to pay the unum plan premiums.after an employee enrolls,shaw enters the payroll deduction into its payroll system and sends a monthly remittance to unum of all premiums withheld from the employees paychecks,along with a total number of employees enrolled.employees pay premiums to the unum plan according to their age bracket and shaw monitors increases in premium amounts as employees reach certain ages.when the unum plan first was used by shaw employees,employees paid a flat rate,but in,on unum recommendation,shaw made the decision to use an rate.shaw does not decide claims or review denials of claims,but the shaw emblem is found at the top of the claim forms and shaw human resources offices maintain supplies of the claim forms.moreover,when an employee files a claim,shaw must fill out the employer portion of the claim form and,because enrollment forms are not forwarded to unum and unum does not maintain a list of all enrolled employees,shaw must confirm the employee coverage.shaw then is responsible for submitting the completed claim form to unum.indeed,shaw employees direct any questions about the unum plan to the human resources office at the shaw facility where they work.the human resources staff explains the available benefits and answers any questions about the unum plan.
moreover,all shaw hourly employees who enroll in the unum plan are provided with an information booklet describing the nature of the long term disability plan.the cover sheet of the booklet the unum plan booklet is emblazoned with the shaw emblem and the title,hourly long term disability plan.the unum plan booklet is created by unum,but before distribution to employees,the benefits manager at shaw corporate headquarters in dalton,georgia,anita thornton,reviews a draft to ensure its features are understandable to shaw employees.
at the time anderson enrolled in the unum plan,the unum plan booklet included a section entitled erisa summary plan description the spd.this spd names shaw as the plan administrator and gives its address and telephone as the plan administrator contact information.the spd also identifies shaw as the agent for legal service of process on the plan.furthermore,the spd explains that the insured was entitled to certain rights and protections under employee retirement income security act of erisa and outlines those rights.
the summary plan description also delineates shaw rights and responsibilities under the plan.it observes shaw may request changes to the policy in whole or in part,and,subject to unum approval,the change may be made so long as it is in writing and endorsed on or attached to the erisa plan and shaw may cancel the policy or a plan under the policy by written notice to unum at least days prior to the cancellation date.according to the spd,unum can cancel the policy or a plan under the policy if there is less than participation of eligible employees shaw fails to provide reasonably required information,including employee eligibility and coverage information fewer than employees are insured under the plan the premium is not paid in accordance with the policy provisions shaw does not promptly report to unum the names of the employees who are added or deleted from the group shaw fails to pay any portion of the premium within the grace period or shaw otherwise fails to perform any of its obligations related to the policy.if unum modifies the policy in a way that was unacceptable to shaw,shaw can cancel the policy.
the actual policy between shaw and unum,which shaw does not provide to employees,contains the same basic information as the unum plan booklet and attaches the same spd outlining shaw and unum rights and responsibilities.the cover sheet to the actual policy also states the policyholder should read this policy carefully and contact unum promptly with any questions.this policy is delivered in and is governed to the extent applicable by the employee retirement income security act of erisa and any amendments.the certificate of coverage restates this provision in precisely the same terms.despite this specific language,shaw official position is that erisa does not apply to the unum plan.some time after anderson initiated this litigation,and in response to an employee inquiry about erisa rights under the plan,shaw asked unum to remove the erisa language from the documents 
in march,anderson became pregnant.previously she had been diagnosed with cervical dysplasia,which required the removal of a portion of her cervix.the surgery left her at risk for complications during pregnancy.on june,anderson submitted a claim to unum,contending that her physical condition during pregnancy qualified her for long term disability benefits.on june,unum denied anderson request for disability benefits.it determined that she was not disabled according to the terms of the policy.anderson repeatedly asked unum for reconsideration and submitted additional information in support of her claim,but unum refused to change its decision to deny her long term disability benefits.
on june,anderson filed this case in the circuit court of crenshaw county,alabama,asserting claims against unum for breach of contract,fraud,suppression,and bad faith because unum had denied her long term disability benefits.soon thereafter,unum removed the case to the middle district of alabama based both on diversity and federal question jurisdiction.a,b.in august,unum moved to dismiss and strike anderson state law claims and her demand for a jury trial on the grounds that her state law claims were completely by erisa.the district court converted unum motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and,after further discovery and briefing by the parties,entered a lengthy order on november,granting summary judgment to unum.
the district court determined that shaw activities did not fit into the safe harbor exclusion of certain insurance policies from erisa jurisdiction.the department of labor safe harbor regulation,j,exempts certain plans from erisa regulation.however,to qualify for the safe harbor,an insurance program may not,in part,be endorsed by the employer,whose sole function must only be to permit the insurer to publicize the program to employees or members,to collect premiums through payroll deductions or dues checkoffs and to remit them to the insurer.j.the district court concluded that shaw actions rose to the level of endorsement,because shaw singled out the unum plan as the sole plan it offers to its hourly employees,played a role in selecting the premium rates,restricted employee eligibility,displayed its corporate logo on the policy documents which it provided to shaw employees,was named in the policy documents as the plan administrator,and provided a summary plan description to its employees that specifically referred to erisa.anderson,civ.at.november,order granting motion to dismiss and motion to strike.the district court also found that the unum plan otherwise qualified as an employee welfare benefit plan subject to erisa.
on march,anderson moved for reconsideration.after reviewing additional pleadings on the issue of whether the unum plan was established or maintained by shaw,the district court denied the motion.again,it concluded that the facts which take the policy out of the safe harbor protection also necessitate a finding that shaw established the policy.anderson,civ.at.july,order denying motion for reconsideration.on july,the district court entered final judgment.this appeal followed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.madray publix supermarkets,cir.a motion for summary judgment should be granted when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this assessment,we must view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.stewart happy herman cheshire bridge,cir.
on appeal,anderson argues that the district court erred by holding that the unum plan was a long term disability plan established or maintained by an employer and hence was governed by erisa.because we find that shaw clearly established and maintained an employee welfare benefits plan,we affirm.
erisa governs employee welfare benefit plan s,which the statute defines in the following broad terms 
any plan,fund,or program which was established or maintained by an employer to the extent that such plan,fund,or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries,through the purchase of insurance or otherwise,a benefits in the event of disability.
emphasis added.by definition,then,a welfare plan requires a plan,fund,or program established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,for the purpose of providing benefits to participants or their beneficiaries.donovan dillingham,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the central question in this case then is whether the third requirement has been satisfied the parties do not dispute that the unum plan was established in order to provide disability benefits to shaw employees and that the unum plan otherwise meets the threshold requirements to be an erisa plan.however,erisa does not apply unless the employer itself established or maintained the plan.id.holding that erisa applies only if an employer or employee organization is the person that establishes or maintains the plan,fund,or program.
our inquiry thus necessarily focuses on the employer and its involvement with the administration of the plan,hansen continental ins,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted,not the conduct of any other erisa entity.butero royal maccabees life ins,cir.t he established or maintained requirement is designed to ensure that the plan is part of an employment relationship w e determine whether the plan is part of an employment relationship by looking at the degree of participation by the employer in the establishment or maintenance of the plan.gaylor john hancock mut.life ins,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
moreover,our determination of whether erisa governs the unum plan does not turn on whether shaw intended the plan to be governed by erisa,but rather on whether shaw intended to establish or maintain a plan to provide benefits to its employees as part of the employment relationship.if the unum plan satisfies the statutory definition of an employee welfare benefit plan,then erisa applies regardless of the intent of the plan administrators and fiduciaries.meredith time ins,cir we are not here concerned with whether the entity that established and maintained the plan intended erisa to govern the mewa.for our guide we note that erisa protection and coverage turns on whether the plan satisfies the statutory definition.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original peckham gem state mut.of utah,cir if a plan meets the five criteria outlined in donovan it is governed by erisa whether or not the parties wish to be subject to erisa.see also donovan,at.
our starting point for interpreting the statutory definition of an employee welfare benefit plan is the language of the statute itself.consolidated bank,hialeah,dep t of treasury,cir quoting consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d.w e read the statute using the normal meanings of its words.courts must assume that congress intended the ordinary meaning of the words it used id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.moreover,absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary,that language is generally dispositive.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.under,shaw may invoke erisa jurisdiction by either establishing or maintaining an employee welfare benefits plan,so we must define each term separately.of course,the two definitions overlap,so several of shaw actions may fall into both categories.
t o determine the common usage or ordinary meaning of a term,courts often turn to dictionary definitions for guidance.united states mcnab,cir alteration in original internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the ordinary meaning of the word establish is to settle,make,or fix firmly or simply to make or form.see,webster third new international dictionary defining establish as to make firm or stable or to bring into existence,create,make,start,originate,found,or build black law dictionary ed defining establish as.to settle,make,or fix firmly or.to make or form to bring about or into existence.in the context of an employee welfare benefits plan,we have said that a plan is established when there has been some degree of implementation by the employer going beyond a mere intent to confer a benefit.butero,at.n o single act in itself necessarily constitutes the establishment of the plan,fund,or program donovan,at.rather,we examine all the surrounding facts and circumstanc
