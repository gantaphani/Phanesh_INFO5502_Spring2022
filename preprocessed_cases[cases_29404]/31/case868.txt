plaintiff sharon swarsensky bilow,an attorney proceeding pro se,filed this lawsuit against her former employer,the law firm of much shelist freed denenberg ament rubenstein,much shelist,alleging violations of the employee retirement income and security act erisa,title vii of the civil rights act of title vii and several state laws.bilow has two principal complaints first,that much shelist owes her money for wrongfully denied employee benefits,and second,that it violated the law when it fired her either because it discriminated on the basis of her sex or because it was impermissibly retaliating against her for certain protected complaints.we agree with the district court that bilow failed to establish a genuine issue with regard to any material fact,and we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for much shelist.
health insurance program 
bilow began working as a litigation associate at much shelist in.three years later,she became the first woman to be promoted to income partner at the firm.at that time,the firm provided health insurance for its employees and their dependents.but in,the firm stopped paying the insurance premiums for the dependents of employees and started deducting the premium amounts from the partners paychecks.in order to make up the difference,the firm increased or partners salaries in an amount equal to the premiums for the dependent coverage.at the time of the change,bilow was affected,because she had purchased health insurance coverage for her husband and children.as it did for all others in her situation,the firm began to deduct the premiums from bilow paycheck while increasing her salary in an equal amount.
in,while bilow was on maternity leave,the firm announced that it would no longer provide a to partners whose spouses employers provided free dependent health insurance.for these partners,the would be phased out over the next two years.according to bilow,she was never notified of the change,but her was phased out over the next two years and was completely eliminated by june.at the same time,the firm continued to deduct the dependent insurance premiums from her paycheck.
in march,four years after the was completely phased out,bilow noticed that the compensation listed on her w form was less than her salary.bilow immediately relayed this problem to steven schwartz,a member of the firm management and accounting committees.schwartz responded that the firm did not pay for health insurance for those partners whose spouses received dependent health insurance from their own employers.according to bilow,she told schwartz that her spouse did not receive health insurance from his employer schwartz promised to investigate the situation and report back to bilow.
bilow waited about six weeks for the problem to be remedied or for someone to discuss the matter with her.when nothing happened,she sent a memo on april,to the firm management committee requesting a response and an accounting 
it has been approximately six weeks since the firm has acknowledged that my salary has never been grossed up for the medical insurance deducted from my salary.given the criminal liability attached to this failure to pay,which dates back to and continues to the present,i do not understand the firm nonchalance.no one has even discussed the status of the matter with me.
on may,the management committee responded to bilow with a memo explaining that the had been phased out over the time period between and.in,her was and thereafter she received no extra pay to compensate for her dependent care coverage.the firm admitted that it had only assumed that bilow husband,a doctor,had dependent coverage through his employer.the memo concluded please advise for the period to date whether or not your spouse had dependent coverage at his place of employment.
that same day,bilow met with michael shelist,the head of the management committee,and told him that she had never been notified of the change in policy and that no one had ever asked her if her husband employer provided health insurance for their family.bilow told shelist that,in fact,her husband did not receive dependent health insurance coverage from his employer.shelist demanded that bilow confirm this in writing and provide him with information about any other health insurance covering bilow and her family.although bilow complained that shelist had no right to make such a demand,bilow delivered the requested memo to shelist on may.
staffing of the brouwer case 
meanwhile,bilow primary responsibility since had been a large class action lawsuit filed in indianapolis that was expected to earn a dollar contingent fee for the firm.the case,brouwer rochwarger,required the class to prove a complex rico conspiracy among several accounting firms,lawyers,and brokerage firms.christopher stuart,an associate at the firm,had been assisting bilow with the litigation.
by the end of,bilow had billed almost hours and stuart had billed over hours to the brouwer case.in total,the firm had invested approximately million of attorney time in the case but had recovered only about in fees after settling with some of the defendants.as the may trial date approached,the firm management committee became concerned about the likelihood of recovering even a portion of its expenses.the committee scheduled a meeting with michael freed,the head of the firm litigation department,to discuss the possibility of taking stuart off the case.freed told the committee that he believed bilow,along with local indianapolis counsel,hugh baker,could adequately try the case alone.freed based his opinion on several factors most of the named defendants had settled or had been dismissed the potential recovery against one of the defendants was minimal and did not warrant any more attorney time he respected baker experience as a seasoned trial lawyer and he had confidence in bilow ability as a litigator.on february,in a memo to bilow,the committee announced that,when the trial began,she and baker would litigate the case by themselves in indianapolis,although stuart and others would be available in chicago to provide assistance.
on march,bilow met with shelist and voiced her concerns about trying the brouwer case with only baker help.bilow believed that the case involved complex legal issues and she did not believe baker to be up to the job.bilow also informed shelist that she would not be able to spend each night of the anticipated trial in indianapolis because her husband worked nights and she did not have alternate child care arrangements.bilow suggested that she could commute daily to indianapolis,and although the flight would not arrive in time for the morning session of trial,the brouwer judge would not object to her being late every day.shelist refused to permit her proposed commuting arrangement,and he also refused to assign anyone else to help her litigate the case.
bilow and the firm came to an impasse on the matter her position was that shelist was asking her to do the impossible,and that,even if the firm were to fire her,she could not stay in indianapolis during the trial.she believed that the firm was responsible for arranging child care for its lawyers the firm disagreed.the may trial date was ultimately continued,but shelist reported the events of the meeting to the management committee,which shared shelist view that bilow was being insubordinate.the committee instructed shelist to prepare a memo recording the events of the meeting and the circumstances of the conflict,which he did on april,almost two months after the meeting.april,also happened to be the day after bilow wrote the letter to the firm threatening criminal liability if it failed to compensate her for the past amounts.
partner survey 
immediately after the march meeting in which bilow expressed her unhappiness with the brouwer staffing decision,the firm conducted a survey of its partners.bilow completed the survey and gave it to shelist on march.in response to a request to list her three most significant concerns about the firm,bilow first complained about her compensation and then stated her opinion that there is a ruling class at the firm and a ruled class and all the women in the firm are in the ruled class.
termination 
in may,during the firm fiscal review,the management committee decided to lay off one attorney from its litigation department and one from its corporate department.the committee chose a male from its corporate department and chose bilow from the litigation department,based mainly on its belief that it could not rely on bilow to try the brouwer case,and that without brouwer,there was not enough work to keep her busy.freed told the committee that bilow absence would not hamper the brouwer proceedings and that he personally did not wish to work with bilow again because he found working with her to be extremely frustrating due to her obstinate nature and frequent disregard of his counsel.
on june,two months after bilow completed the survey and only four days after her most recent meeting with shelist regarding the problems,shelist informed bilow that her employment was going to be terminated,effective june,because she was unwilling to try the brouwer case as instructed by the firm and because there was insufficient work otherwise for a senior trial lawyer in the hourly litigation department.
on june,shelist gave bilow a letter entitled terms of separation.in the letter,the firm acknowledged that it owed bilow in past compensation for its inaccurate of her.in order to receive the past due as well as sixteen weeks severance pay,however,it insisted that bilow release the firm and all of its shareholders from any claims arising out of her employment or termination.
after weeks of negotiation,bilow refused to sign the release and on august,the firm gave her a check for an amount equal to the past due minus the severance pay she had received since june.on august,stuart settled the brouwer case against the remaining defendants.
on november,bilow filed discrimination charges with the eeoc claiming that the firm eliminated her as a result of sex discrimination,that she was terminated as retaliation for complaining about the loss of the,that the firm required her to try the brouwer class alone as a result of sex discrimination,and that she was terminated in retaliation for objecting to the staffing decision.the eeoc issued a right to sue letter on january.
in the meantime,on november,bilow brought her original complaint alleging violations of erisa,title vii,and state law.this page,paragraph complaint was dismissed without prejudice on the district court own initiative on february.the judge expressed the view that the complaint was way overpled and encouraged bilow to sit back and think about pleading counts.bilow ignored this advice,however,and filed her first amended complaint on march,which had the same counts,but was even more massive,weighing in at pages,paragraphs,and exhibits.again,the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice for failure to comply with fed.civil.bilow effort at a second amended complaint was again longer,with counts,pages,paragraphs,and attached exhibits.
counts i and ii of the second amended complaint allege that the firm violated erisa by not providing bilow with a summary plan description of the program,failing to notify her of a material change in her benefits,withholding benefits to which she was entitled under the plan,and firing her in retaliation for complaints about conduct that she believed to be in violation of erisa.the rest of the federal claims arose under title vii count vii alleged that the firm discriminated against her on the basis of sex in assuming that,because she is a woman,her husband employer provided family health insurance.count viii alleged that the firm discriminated against her on the basis of sex in requiring her to try the brouwer case alone.count ix alleged retaliation for her complaints regarding the discriminatory administration of the program and count x alleged retaliation for the comments she made in the partner survey.bilow also brought several claims for salary and bonus payments under state statutory and common law.
the firm filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the plan was not an erisa plan.it argued that the title vii counts were either untimely or failed to state a claim.finally,it asked the court to exercise its discretion to dismiss the state law claims.after more procedural skirmishing,the court allowed bilow to go forward to the summary judgment stage on her claim of sex discrimination related to the staffing of brouwer and her claim of retaliation for her complaint in the partner survey.it dismissed all the other federal claims.bilow later added three more state law theories related to the.the firm filed a motion for summary judgment on the remainder of the federal claims on january,which the court granted on may.it found that bilow had not shown that the firm treated males more favorably in the staffing of cases,nor did she have evidence that could establish a causal connection between her complaints in the survey and her discharge.the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.on may,the district court denied bilow rule e motion to alter or amend the summary judgment ruling.
on june,bilow filed a notice of appeal from all of the district court orders.the firm filed a on june,challenging the district court refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.on july,the court granted judgment in favor of the firm for in costs on august,bilow filed a notice of appeal from this judgment for costs.
issues on the pleadings 
we consider first the group of claims the court dismissed for failure to state a claim.these are the erisa claims and the title vii claim concerning the.we review these de novo,accepting all allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.hentosh herman finch university of health chicago medical school,cir.
erisa claims 
bilow alleged that the firm violated erisa in several ways connected to the program and that she was discharged for complaining about those violations.the district court dismissed these claims on the ground that the policy was not an erisa plan.this was because the were paid from the firm general assets as part of its compensation plan.although bilow tried to challenge this finding for the first time in her reply brief,she conceded at oral argument that she had waived this challenge.
based on this first finding,the district court also dismissed the claim that the firm retaliated against bilow for exercising her rights under erisa.the court ruled that the existence of an plan was a prerequisite to an erisa retaliation claim.this second finding is properly before us on appeal.
section of erisa makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan.bilow argues that even if the program was not an erisa plan,should still apply as long as she made a reasonable,claim that the program was covered by erisa and that an erisa violation had occurred.in making this argument,bilow asks us to borrow from title vii provision,which has been interpreted to prohibit retaliation against an employee who makes a reasonable claim that wrongful discrimination has occurred,even if the claim ends up being meritless.see sweeney west,cir.for purposes of argument,we will assume that she did have a claim that the program was governed by erisa and that an erisa violation had occurred.
under some circumstances,courts do borrow aspects of title vii law to use in interpreting erisa.see,fairchild forma scientific,cir utilizing mcdonnell douglas in the erisa context.nonetheless,this must be done with caution,as there are significant differences between erisa and title vii,and there are even differences between the provisions of the two statutes.the most important of these is the fact that,unlike a title vii retaliation plaintiff,an erisa retaliation plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer had the specific intent to violate the statute and to interfere with an employee erisa rights.see lindemann mobil oil,cir.with such a requirement,it is logical to infer that an erisa pla
