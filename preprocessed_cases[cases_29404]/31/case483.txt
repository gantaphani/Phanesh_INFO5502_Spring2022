richard lafleur sued louisiana health service and indemnity company blue cross under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a b,for recovery of wrongfully denied health insurance benefits.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of blue cross.because blue cross failed to substantially comply with erisa procedural requirements,the judgment of the district court is vacated,and the case is remanded for entry of an order remanding the case to the plan administrator for a full and fair review regarding the denial of benefits.we express no opinion on whether blue cross abused its discretion in denying benefits because its substantial compliance with erisa procedural regulations is a threshold issue in this case.
factual and procedural background 
lafleur received health insurance benefits through his employer,the family clinic.lafleur group health insurance policy the plan,which was issued by blue cross,is an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of erisa.see.
on may,lafleur underwent a cardiovascular bypass operation.during surgery,he suffered an anoxic event and never regained consciousness.on august,blue cross agreed to pay the cost of lafleur care at eunice manor nursing home eunice manor pursuant to the plan alternative benefits provision.alternative benefits are b enefits for services not routinely covered under the benefit plan but which may be provided by agreement through case management.in turn,case management permits for payment of alternative benefits at blue cross discretion,and such benefits are provided in lieu of the benefits to which members are entitled under the benefit plan.according to the plan,the provision of alternative benefits should not be construed as a waiver of blue cross right to enforce the plan in accordance with its express terms,and alternative benefits can be terminated if the patient is no longer covered under the terms of the plan.the august letter stated that r eimbursement for skilled nursing care ordered by tate,lafleur treating physician,has been approved per a special agreement under the individual case management program.on august,lafleur was transferred from an acute care hospital to eunice manor.
the issue on appeal revolves around whether lafleur care at eunice manor qualifies as skilled nursing care,which is covered,or custodial care,which is not.in its motion for summary judgment,blue cross stated that t he alternative benefits arrangement that had been entered with eunice manor allowed it to be paid by blue cross as though it was a snf skilled nursing facility rather than a nursing home during the time that skilled nursing services were required.a snf is defined by the plan as a facility other than a nursing home that provides inpatient medical care,treatment and skilled nursing care as defined by medicare,supervision by at least one physician or registered nurse,hour nursing services by registered nurses or licensed practical nurses,and utilization review plans for all patients.article iv a of the plan states that inpatient bed,board and general nursing service are covered i n a skilled nursing facility or unit or while receiving skilled nursing services in a hospital for the maximum number of days per benefit period shown in the schedule of benefits.
blue cross initially agreed to cover costs of per day for bed rental,sitter service,supplies,nursing care,room,and board.on december,blue cross decreased this amount to per day.on march,blue cross case management department wrote to eunice manor indicating that it would reduce payments to per day as alternative care for all inclusive room and board expenses.both the december letter and the march letter described the per diem payments as r eimbursement for skilled nursing.
on may,blue cross william weldon,after consulting with blue cross dwight brower and an unidentified board certified urologist,determined that the nursing home services provided to lafleur constituted custodial care,and that,pursuant to the plan,blue cross would no longer approve reimbursement.weldon and brower did not consult with either of lafleur treating physicians,tate or heinen.in his deposition,brower testified that he contacted the urologist via telephone to inquire whether continuous bladder irrigation cbi was a skilled nursing service and whether there were alternatives to that procedure.because cbi is not a common procedure,brower and weldon opted to get some specialty input over that service and get more information regarding it.brower described his consultation with the urologist as entirely an informal telephonic conversation done anonymously relative to this patient to determine whether cbi was standard procedure done by urologists for recurrent infections in someone with a chronic and dwelling foley catheter.the may denial letter did not elaborate on the specific reason for the denial beyond the following contractual exclusion for custodial care per medical director.weldon made the following entry in the administrative record the day before the denial 
deny further days.reimbursement has continued to this point due to the continued cbi.review with a board certified urologist indicates that this is neither necessary nor appropriate and that the same purpose could be accomplished with a condom catheter or,if an indwelling catheter is necessary,low dose of fluoroquinolones cipro.denial is based on contractual exclusion for custodial care 
under the plan,excluded custodial care refers to treatment or services that could be rendered safely and reasonably by a person not medically skilled,or that are designed mainly to help the patient with daily living activities.on may,in preparation for administrative appeal,lafleur requested from blue cross the complete administrative record and the names of all persons blue cross consulted whether the consultant opinion was relied upon or not.
procedural background 
lafleur administratively appealed blue cross determination twice the level i appeal and the level ii appeal.brower conducted the level i appeal,and an appeals committee conducted the level ii appeal.as part of the level i appeal,brower made the following entry in the administrative record on june,will uphold the denial of continued skilled nursing unit coverage as the patient care is now primarily custodial and therefore excluded by this policy.care can be provided in a regular nursing home bed.lafleur received the level i denial letter on july.the july letter,which was drafted by an attorney in blue cross legal affairs department,provided a more detailed explanation of the reason for denial than the may letter 
our records indicate that in december,pursuant to a special agreement under the individual case management program,we approved reimbursement of skilled nursing care at eunice manor nursing home for richard lafleur for services ordered by tate.
as is customary,our case management department continuously monitored the services being rendered to lafleur to ensure that the care being received was eligible for reimbursement under the contract and in accordance with the case management agreement.eventually,the medical information we received indicated that the care being rendered to lafleur was custodial in nature,and that skilled nursing care was not needed.for this reason,we advised the hospital and patient on may,that subsequent days would not be covered if hospitalization continued beyond that date as lafleur contract does not provide benefits for custodial care.
at his deposition,brower testified that he did not consult with any other health care professional in conducting the level i appeal.
on september,as part of the level ii appeal,lafleur submitted a letter from his treating physician,tate,which stated that lafleur condition is very fragile and his long term survival is dependent on good skilled nursing rather than custodial care.tate stated that lafleur needed skilled nursing to monitor his vital signs,fluid intake,diabetes,nourishment status,skin care,trache care,foley care,peg tube care,and to observe for pulmonary infiltrates and mucus plugs that could result in severe hypoxia in affirming the denial based on the custodial care exclusion,the level ii appeals committee consulted with brower and found that the clinical issues are the tracheotomy and tube feeding.patient is stable so the extent of the care does have to be skilled nursing.emphasis in original.apparently,the level ii appeals committee only consulted with brower before making its final determination,and brower did not produce any written report that was responsive to the concerns raised by tate.by letter dated october,the level ii appeals committee cited the custodial care exclusion and denied lafleur claim.
on june,lafleur,having exhausted the blue cross administrative review procedure,filed suit in district court alleging that blue cross appeal proceedings did not adhere to mandatory erisa procedures,and blue cross interpretation of the plan as to lafleur constituted an abuse of discretion.during the pendency of the district court proceedings,lafleur died in november.the parties filed for summary judgment,and on december,the district judge granted blue cross motion and denied lafleur motion.the district court did not address lafleur argument that blue cross failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements of erisa.lafleur timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
summary judgment standard 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment in erisa cases de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.wade dev.lp short term disability plan,cir.a grant of summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in evaluating the existence of a genuine issue of material fact,we review the evidence and inferences drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the party.wade,at.
procedural violations 
substantial compliance 
lafleur alleges that blue cross violated several erisa procedural requirements when processing his administrative appeal.these procedures are set forth in of erisa and in the department of labor regulations promulgated pursuant to that section.schadler anthem life ins,cir.in the fifth circuit,we evaluate lafleur procedural claims as follows 
challenges to erisa procedures are evaluated under the substantial compliance standard.lacy fulbright jaworski,cir.this means that the technical noncompliance with erisa procedures will be excused so long as the purpose of section has been fulfilled.robinson aetna life,cir.the purpose of section is to afford the beneficiary an explanation of the denial of benefits that is adequate to ensure meaningful review of that denial.schneider sentry long term disability,cir.the substantial compliance test also considers all communications between an administrator and plan participant to determine whether the information provided was sufficient under the circumstances.moore lafayette life ins,cir.all communications may include oral communications.white aetna life ins,citing heller fortis benefits ins.
in interpreting full and fair review,we have looked favorably upon decisions that require knowing what evidence the relied upon,having an opportunity to address the accuracy and reliability of the evidence,and having the consider the evidence presented by both parties prior to reaching and rendering his decision.sweatman commercial union ins,cir quoting sage automation.pension plan trust,cir.substantial compliance requires meaningful dialogue between the beneficiary and administrator.see wade,at.
erisa regulations provide insight into what constitutes full and fair review.applicable regulations dictate that procedures will not be deemed to provide a claimant with a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of a claim and adverse benefit determination unless several procedural requirements are met,four of which are relevant to this appeal review must not afford deference to the initial adverse benefit determination and may not be conducted by the same person who made the initial determination when an adverse benefit determination is based in whole or in part on a medical judgment,the appeal must include consultation with a health care professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment the claims procedure must p rovide for the identification of medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the plan in connection with a claimant adverse benefit determination,without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the benefit determination and the healthcare professional consulted in an appeal may not be the same individual who was consulted in connection with the original determination 
we find that blue cross did not substantially comply with the procedural requirements of erisa because it raised new grounds for denial in the federal courts that were not raised at the administrative level it did not identify the board certified urologist,despite lafleur request for this information it relied on the same urologist opinion in the initial denial and in the administrative appeals to the extent it did not rely on the urologist opinion in the administrative appeals,it relied on brower opinion even though he did not possess appropriate training and experience in the field of urology and it effectively gave deference to the initial denial.
at the administrative level,blue cross consistently maintained that lafleur care changed from skilled nursing to custodial during his extended stay at eunice manor,and by may,skilled nursing care was not needed.central to this conclusion was the opinion of the board certified urologist,who opined that there were alternatives to the cbi procedure.however,for the first time in the district court and on appeal,blue cross argued that continued payment of alternative benefits was an act of charity that could be suspended at any time because lafleur was never entitled to those benefits in the first place in other words,rather than changing from skilled nursing to custodial,lafleur care was always custodial blue cross also argued that the denial was justified based on a different phrase within the custodial care exclusion treatment for a condition in a patient who is not expected to improve or recover.according to blue cross,lafleur condition had consistently deteriorated rather than improved between august and may,making recovery highly improbable.these alternative reasons for denial may or may not be legitimate,but the fact remains that these were not the reasons for denial given at the administrative level to ensure the full and fair review contemplated by erisa,the specific reason or reasons for denial must be clearly identified at the administrative level in order to give the parties an opportunity for meaningful dialogue.see robinson,at.although these various reasons for denial are all generally based on the custodial care exclusion,the lack of specificity in the denial letters did not give lafleur the fair notice contemplated by the erisa regulations.see g i see also mccartha city,cir d efendants were not in substantial compliance with the requirements of because mccartha was never timely informed that the failure to provide current medical opinions as to her disability would be one of the bases for the termination of her benefits.emphasis added.
blue cross failed to comply with h iv when it did not identify the board certified urologist whose advice was obtained on behalf of the plan in connection with lafleur adverse benefit determination.notably,lafleur specifically requested this information in his may letter to blue cross.the urologist opinion that there were alternatives to the cbi procedure appears to be the primary,if not exclusive,basis for denial of benefits in both the initial determination and the level i appeal.
because the adverse benefit determination was based on the medical judgment that lafleur care was custodial,blue cross was required to consult with a health care professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment when deciding the administrative appeal h iii.brower and weldon were not urologists,and the only expert consulted with experience in that field was the unidentified board certified urologist that brower contacted before the initial denial.under h iii,blue cross could not rely on the same urologist opinion in the initial determination and in the administrative appeals.to the extent that the level i appeal and the level ii appeal only relied on the opinion of brower,he did not have the appropriate training and experience to render an opinion regarding the cbi procedure.see id.finally,although brower arguably only conducted the level i appeal,his presence as the primary consultant in both the initial denial and the level ii appeal effectively gave deference to the initial adverse benefit determination in violation of h ii.brower did not consult any other doctor during the level i appeal,and the level ii appeals committee appears to have relied exclusively on brower analysis and medical assessment while the same doctor can participate in rather than conduct both administrative appeals exclusive reliance on the opinion of the same doctor in both appeals runs afoul of h ii.we hold that blue cross procedural violations constituted more than technical noncompliance and prejudiced lafleur.see robinson,at.
because we rarely find that an administrator failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements of erisa,we have not fully identified the scope of available remedies.we have previously stated the following regarding remedies even were we to decide that an administrator failed to substantially comply with erisa and its accompanying regulations,f ailure to fulfill procedural requirements generally does not give rise to a substantive damage remedy.wade,at quoting hines.mut.life ins,cir.substantive damages would be permitted only when the violations are continuous and amount to substantive harm.hines,at citing blau del monte,cir,abrogated on other grounds by dytrt mountain states,cir.substantive damages would include a retroactive reinstatement of benefits.mckenzie.of,cir,abrogated other grounds by abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc.although we recited the blau standard in hines,we have not elaborated on it or applied it.based on the particular facts of this case,we believe that remand,rather than substantive damages,is the appropriate remedy.
remand to the plan administrator for full and fair review is usually the appropriate remedy when the administrator fails to substantially comply with the procedural requirements of erisa.see krauss oxford health plans,cir gagliano reliance standard life ins,cir chuck hewlett packard,cir caldwell life ins.of,cir syed hercules,cir alito,vanderklok provident life accident ins,cir wolfe penney,cir,overruled on other grounds by casey uddeholm,cir.this position is consistent with the default rule of other circuits and our pronouncement in wade that procedural violations of erisa generally do not give rise to a substantive damages remedy.when the procedural violations are,remand is typically preferred over a substantive remedy to which the claimant might not otherwise be entitled under the terms of the plan.see gagliano,at see also firestone tire rubber bruch,d erisa was enacted to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans and to protect contractually defined benefits.emphasis added citation omitted.
rather than remand,lafleur argues that we should grant summary judgment in favor of him and award benefits.this exception to the remand rule applies where the record establishes that the plan administrator denial of the claim was an abuse of discretion as a matter of law.gagliano,at.our opinion in robinson aetna life insurance falls within this category.see,cir t here is no genuine issue of material fact here.we have concluded both that aetna failed to substantially comply with erisa procedures and that aetna abused its discretion by terminating robinson benefits.emphasis added.a remand for further action is unnecessary only if the evidence clearly shows that the administrator actions were arbitrary and capricious,or the case is so clear cut that it would be unreasonable for the plan administrator to deny the application for benefits on any ground.caldwell,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.if the administrative record reflects,at minimum,a colorable claim for upholding the denial of benefits,remand is usually the appropriate remedy.see gagliano,at.the court must make this determination on a basis.see robinson,at.based on the administrative record before us,we do not believe that lafleur is entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
modifying the standard of review 
when the erisa plan vests the fiduciary with discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits under the plan or to interpret the plan provisions,our standard of review is abuse of discretion.ellis liberty life assurance of boston,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the administrator factual determinations are also reviewed for abuse of discretion.wade,at.lafleur argues that we should modify this deferential standard of review based on the administrator failure to substantially comply with the procedural requirements of erisa.although we have never definitively rejected the availability of this remedy,we have previously refused to apply it.id.at wade has cited no direct authority by the supreme court or the fifth circuit dictating a change in the standard of review based upon procedural irregularities alone,and we see no reason to impose one.
the ninth circuit,sitting en banc,has held that flagrant procedural violations can alter the standard of review from abuse of discretion to de novo.when an administrator engages in wholesale and flagrant violations of the procedural requirements of erisa,and thus acts in utter disregard of the underlying purpose of the plan as well,the court will review de novo the administrator decision to deny benefits,even if the abuse of discretion standard would apply otherwise abatie,at.all other procedural irregularities should be weighed in deciding whether an administrator decision was an abuse of discretion.id.at.a more serious procedural irregularity may weigh more heavily.id.when the administrator has failed to follow the procedural requirements of erisa,the district court may take additional evidence when irregularities have prevented full development of the administrative record.id.at.
although blue cross failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements of erisa,these violations were not flagrant,so the de novo standard of review discussed in abatie is not implicated in this case.because the issue is not before us,we express no opinion on whether flagrant procedural violations of erisa can alter the standard of review.instead,we face the more ordinary situation in which a plan administrator has exercised discretion but,in doing so,has made procedural errors.id.at.based on the facts of this case,we find that remand to the administrator is warranted,rather than remand to the district court for consideration of evidence outside the administrative record 
striking evidence or retroactively reinstating benefits 
as an alternative to modifying the standard of review,lafleur urges us to strike the urologist opinion or retroactively reinstate his benefits in order to remedy the administrator procedural violations.the availability of these two remedies is supported by persuasive precedent.in bard boston shipping association,the first circuit addressed a situation where the procedural irregularities were serious,had a connection to the substantive decision reached,and call ed into question the integrity of the decision itself,cir.after observing that the administrator procedural violations had the effect of sandbagging the plaintiff,the first circuit struck the evidence supporting the denial and awarded benefits to the plaintiff based on the remaining evidence.id.at.the first circuit recognized that i n other circumstances,it might be an appropriate remedy to remand to a plan administrator for reconsideration,see id.at,but declined to do so based on the rather egregious facts of the case.see id.at.in cases where the administrator terminated benefits t
