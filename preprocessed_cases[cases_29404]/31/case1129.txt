acting pro se,ronnie simon simon brought a claim under the employee retirement income security act of,et.erisa against hartford life and hartford life and accident hereinafter referred to collectively as hartford alleging a single cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty under a.the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice.in its dismissal,the court found that a pro se plaintiff,under a,as authorized by a,may not pursue claims in a representative capacity on behalf of an erisa plan.the court concluded that these sections of erisa,as well as relevant binding authority,mandate that the party seeking to bring forth claims under section a must be represented by counsel and may not proceed with such claims as a pro se litigant.the court declined to grant simon leave to amend his complaint on the grounds that no set of facts exist which would enable plaintiff to proceed with his claim in his pro se capacity.we agree that,while simon may assert a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,he may not prosecute his claims on behalf of the plan pro se.accordingly,we affirm.
effective january,hartford issued group policy numbers to nptest,llc nptest,as well as the plan sponsor and plan administer of the group long term disability plan for employees and the group life and supplemental life plan for employees of nptest.simon was employed by nptest as an information system senior manager and was a participant in the plans,both funded through the group insurance policies issued by hartford.
simon filed this complaint on may.in it,he alleges that hartford uses claims management policies,procedures and practices,including failure to maintain proper reserves and improper fund transfers between its general and erisa special accounts that put its own interests ahead of the plans interests.he seeks equitable relief ordering hartford to stop using those practices,or to stop serving as claims fiduciaries for erisa plans that are funded by insurance policies that it issued and ordering hartford to make good to the erisa plan any losses resulting from its breach of fiduciary duty.
subsequently,hartford filed a motion to dismiss simon complaint under.b on the ground that simon had to be represented by licensed counsel to proceed with a claim under a.the district court agreed with hartford that a plaintiff acting pro se may not proceed with a claim under a and a,and dismissed the action without prejudice to refiling should simon obtain counsel.
simon filed a motion for additional fact findings under.b and reconsideration under.e and b on the theory that he is the plan only beneficiary.the district court denied the motion on august,concluding that,even assuming simon is the plan only beneficiary,the plan remains an entity apart from the person of the plaintiff.therefore,acting pro se,simon is not entitled to bring a suit on the plan behalf.simon timely appealed.
thus,the issue before us is whether a pro se litigant may proceed with a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty brought under a.

iii.discussion 
the causes of action on which civil litigants may proceed without counsel are limited by statute.more specifically,provides that in federal court,parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as,by the rules of such courts,respectively,are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein.significant is the language contained in the statute that limits the authorization of civil litigants to plead and conduct their own cases personally.id.emphasis added.
section a authorizes an erisa plan participant as well as the secretary of labor,a beneficiary,or a fiduciary to bring a civil action for violations of a.this case requires us to decide whether an erisa plan participant,proceeding pro se,may bring an action for breach of fiduciary duty under a.
the general rule establishing the right of an individual to represent oneself in all federal courts of the united states is contained in.section is intended to provide individuals with equal access to the courts by permitting individuals to represent themselves.
it is well established that the privilege to represent oneself pro se provided by is personal to the litigant and does not extend to other parties or entities.see mcshane united states,cir citation omitted.consequently,in an action brought by a pro se litigant,the real party in interest must be the person who by substantive law has the right to be enforced.pope equity trust united states,cir.it is clear under.mut.life ins.russell that simon is not the real party in interest as he brought claims under a on behalf of the plan itself,d.simon concedes that the party whose interests he is alleged to be representing is his employer benefit plan.as such,simon is representing a person or entity other than himself,which he may not do.because simon is not the actual beneficial owner of the claims being asserted,he can not be viewed as a party conducting his own case personally within the meaning of section.pope,at.

simon argues that the district court comparison of the current case to other representative cases is flawed because he has not filed a putative class action,does not seek to enforce rights belonging to a corporation,did not sue on behalf of a trust,and is not a qui tam relator.he also points out that the plan itself can not be a party.however,the supreme court concluded in russell that a plaintiff filing a claim under a is doing so in a representative capacity and not in an individual capacity.at.
