the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.the notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to fed.a.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
the undisputed facts establish that johnston was a professional pilot employed by western pathology consultants,western pathology.in,western pathology decided to update its long term disability policy for its professional and supervisory employees and contacted richard mead,an insurance agent for paul revere,who had provided insurance services to western pathology for over years.
the updated plan was designed to provide own occupation coverage to assure income during an employee earning lifetime if the employee became disabled from performing his or her professional occupation.it was determined that benefits for plan participants would be provided through individual policies purchased by the employee and issued by paul revere eligible employees of western pathology met with mead,who explained plan benefits and completed the necessary enrollment forms provided by paul revere.employees were given the choice of paying the premiums themselves or having western pathology make their payments.to facilitate payment,western pathology was billed for monthly premiums,would pay the premiums in a lump sum,and then add the amount of each employee individual premium to the employee form at the end of the tax year.also,mead delivered policy forms to western pathology.
prior to issuing a policy for johnston,paul revere issued twelve policies for employees of western pathology,all of which included own occupation coverage.in,johnston met with mead who explained the plan benefits and own occupation coverage.mead also completed for johnson a paul revere disability policy application,which johnston signed.this application stated that a cceptance by the proposed of any policy issued on this application will ratify any changes listed under corrections and amendments for home office use only.paul revere then generated a computer model showing premium benefit amounts for johnson,with monthly premiums including own occupation coverage,billed at a month.
after the policy was issued,mead received a message from a paul revere representative stating that the policy was issued as submitted.however,on the policy as issued,a handwritten note in the comments portion of the application stated delete own occ.mead did not read the policy before delivering it to western pathology,nor did he communicate to johnston that there was a change in the policy.mead did,however,inform both johnston and western pathology that the policy was issued as applied for.in,johnston became disabled and submitted a claim to paul revere,which claim was honored,although own occupation coverage was denied.at this time he first learned that the policy application had been changed to delete own occupation coverage 
procedural history 
johnston initially filed a claim in nebraska state court seeking declaratory relief and alleging that paul revere wrongfully altered his application for disability insurance in violation of.this statute prohibits the alteration of a written application for any policy for sickness insurance without the written consent of the applicant in june,paul revere filed an answer with affirmative defenses,including the assertion that the matter was governed by erisa,and,in may,the matter was removed to federal district court based on diversity jurisdiction.discovery closed in march,and a order was entered in april.
in may,the district court ruled that the matter was preempted by erisa,and ordered johnston either to his case or risk dismissal.see johnston paul revere life insurance company.may,memorandum and order the district found that because the state statute relates to western pathology benefit plan,erisa operates to preempt johnston state law claim and that the state law claim was not precluded from preemption by the savings clause of erisa,b a.see,slip op.at.johnston filed an amended complaint alleging violations of erisa,and,despite the prior ruling of the district court,renewed his state law claim.subsequently,in july,johnston filed a motion to strike the order and to discovery.in august,paul revere filed a motion to dismiss,and,on august,a magistrate judge issued an order striking the order,but reserving a ruling on the motion to discovery until after the court ruled on the motion to dismiss.by order dated march,the district court reaffirmed the prior preemption ruling,and on march,the magistrate judge denied johnston request to discovery.
paul revere filed an answer to the amended complaint,and johnston filed a third amended complaint,alleging a breach of fiduciary duty under erisa,and discrimination under erisa,and again renewing the state law claim.on august,the district court granted paul revere motion to dismiss as to johnston state law and erisa discrimination claims,but denied the motion as to the erisa breach of fiduciary duty claim see johnston paul revere life insurance company,memorandum and order 
on august,johnston renewed his motion to discovery.this latter motion was denied,and the matter was set for a conference,during which the magistrate judge struck four of johnston witnesses because their names had not been disclosed during discovery and also struck two of johnston exhibits.johnston sought review of this ruling to the district court.in november,paul revere filed a motion for summary judgment on johnston only remaining claim,a breach of fiduciary duty under erisa,which motion the district court granted.see johnston paul revere life insurance company,memorandum and order.the district court held that neither the language of the application or the policy required paul revere to notify johnston directly that it declined to provide own occupation coverage and that paul revere did not have a past policy of communicating directly with applicants about decisions denying requested coverage.the court further rejected johnston position that paul revere handled virtually every aspect of plan administration and,therefore,became a de facto plan administrator.the court concluded that paul revere and mead performed traditional roles of insurer and agent and that neither exercised the degree of discretion that would make them erisa fiduciaries.see,slip op.at.the district court also denied johnston appeal of the order striking experts and exhibits.see id.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,johnston first argues that the district court erred in dismissing his state law claim as preempted by erisa.we review the district court decision on erisa preemption de novo because it is a question of federal law involving statutory interpretation.wilson zoellner,cir wilson.erisa seeks to comprehensively regulate certain employee welfare benefits and pension plans and to protect the interests of participants in these plans by establishing standards of conduct,responsibility,and obligations for fiduciaries,and contains a preemption clause.see wilson,at kuhl lincoln national health plan of kansas city,cir.erisa preemption provision states e xcept as provided in subsection b of this section,the provisions of this subchapter shall supercede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section a of this title and not exempt under section b.erisa a,a.
however,not all state law claims that somehow affect a plan as defined by erisa are preempted.see discussion below regarding the definition of an erisa plan pursuant to.erisa includes a savings clause,which exempts from erisa preemption coverage certain categories of state law that regulate insurance.this savings clause states e xcept as provided in subparagraph b,nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.erisa b a,b a.
erisa plan 
as a preliminary matter,we must determine if the disability insurance policy at issue was a plan within the meaning of erisa because the existence of a plan is a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of erisa.see bannister sorenson,cir bannister harris arkansas book,cir harris.erisa defines a plan as an employee welfare benefit plan.erisa further defines an employee welfare benefit plan,in pertinent part,as any plan,fund,or program established or maintained by an employer for the purpose of providing benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment.in determining whether a plan pursuant to a writing or not is a reality a court must determine whether from the surrounding circumstances a reasonable person could ascertain the intended benefits,beneficiaries,source of financing,and procedures for receiving benefits.harris,at,citing donovan dillingham,cir.n o single action in itself necessarily constitutes the establishment of the plan.id.at.however,an erisa plan must embody a set of administrative practices.fort halifax packing coyne,d.
upon review of the undisputed facts in this matter,we hold that a reasonable person could conclude that western pathology did establish a plan within the meaning of erisa that offered disability benefits to its employees.also,a reasonable person could further ascertain the intended benefits,beneficiaries,the source of financing,and procedures for receiving benefits of the disability plan at issue.because western pathology engaged in the ongoing administration of the plan by assisting in the application process,by maintaining the policy forms,by processing paperwork in conjunction with mead,and by facilitating the payment of premiums,the plan embodied a set of administrative practices.we,therefore,hold,in agreement with the district court,that a reasonable person could conclude that western pathology did establish a plan that offered benefits to its employees,as evidenced by the offering of retirement and disability insurance policies to employees and by the administrative processing required of western pathology to provide such benefits.memorandum and order of may,slip op.at.we,therefore,hold that the disability policy at issue was part of a plan within the meaning of erisa.
erisa preemption 
we next consider whether johnston state law claim is preempted by erisa.johnston state claim is preempted if the nebraska statute upon which johnston relies relate s to an employee benefit plan within the meaning of erisa a,a.in california division of labor standards enforcement dillingham construction,d dillingham,the supreme court stated that it has long acknowledged that the scope of the erisa preemption provision is deliberately expansive.a state law may relate to an employee benefit plan and,therefore,be preempted,even if the state law was not designed to affect benefit plans and its effect on such plans is incidental.see mcclendon,d.in dillingham,at,the supreme court devised a test to determine if a state law relates to an employee benefit plan covered by erisa.pursuant to this inquiry,a state law relates to a covered employee benefit plan for purposes of a if the state law has a connection with or reference to such a plan.id.citations omitted.the court directed courts to look both to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive,as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans.id.at.
this court has held that a variety of tests are helpful when determining the effect of state law on an erisa plan.see bannister,at,citing arkansas blue cross blue shield mary,cir arkansas blue cross.factors which are instructive in this regard include 
whether the state law negates a plan provision the effect on primary erisa entities and impact on plan structure the impact on plan administration the economic impact on the plan whether preemption is consistent with other provisions of erisa and whether the state law at issue is an exercise of traditional state power.
citing arkansas blue cross,at.
we hold that johnston claim against paul revere arose from the administration of an erisa plan,including the application for and subsequent issuance of a disability policy.thus,pursuant to the analysis in bannister,the state law has an impact on plan administration.we further find,in agreement with the district court,that johnston state law claim has a connection with and relates to an employee benefit plan and that,therefore,erisa operates to preempt his state claim unless the erisa savings clause is applicable.see memorandum and order of may,slip op.at.
erisa savings clause 
we must now determine whether johnston claim pursuant to.escapes preemption under the erisa savings clause,b a because it regulates insurance.in metropolitan life insurance massachusetts,d metropolitan life,the supreme court provided a framework for determining whether a statute regulates insurance and explained that a state law regulates insurance if it falls within the reference to the business of insurance in the act,et,which gave states the authority to regulate the business of insurance.as more recently stated in unum life ins.ward,d unum,the court first applies a view of the matter and then considers three factors to determine whether the regulation fits within the business of insurance as that phrase is used in the act,including first,whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder risk second,whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured and third,whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry,citing metropolitan life,at.
we first conclude that the nebraska statute at issue does not clearly regulate insurance as a matter of common sense.as the district court noted,and we agree,unum holds that all three factors are considerations to be weighed but none is necessarily determinative in itself.id.at.citations omitted.in further agreement with the district court,we hold that the nebraska statute does not meet the first factor because it did not have the effect of transferring or spreading the policy holder risk,but instead solely regulates the actual written application for the insurance policy.memorandum and order of may,slip op.at.see memorandum and order of,slip op.at.as explained further by the district court,the nebraska statute does not spread risk,as would,for example,a state law mandating coverage for a specific disease.memorandum and order of may,slip op.at.
considering the second and third factors,we further hold,in agreement with the district court,that the nebraska statute does not dictate terms that must be included in an insurance policy,nor does it add anything substantive to the relationship or alter the bargain between them.instead,the statute merely prohibits conduct that predates formation of the relationship.memorandum and order of,slip op.at.the nebraska statute merely establishes a prohibition governing the application procedure and does not govern or dictate the actual content of insurance policies because none of the factors are met,we hold,in agreement with the analysis of the district court,that johnston claim is not saved from erisa preemption pursuant to b a.we,therefore,conclude that the district court correctly dismissed johnston state cl
