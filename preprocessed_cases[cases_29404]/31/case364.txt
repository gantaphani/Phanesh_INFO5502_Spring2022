opinion of the court 
anthony miller,formerly an executive for the rite aid corporation rite aid,appeals the district court decision,after a trial,that miller lacked standing to bring a claim against rite aid pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.because miller was never laid off,the district court found that miller is not,and never was,eligible to receive the severance benefits he sought through his civil suit and is no longer employed by rite aid and therefore has no prospect of becoming eligible to receive those severance benefits.accordingly,the district court concluded that miller was not a participant authorized to bring a civil action pursuant to a of erisa.we agree,in substance,with the district court,but will remand the matter to the district court to enter an order consistent with miller lack of standing.
in september of,the rite aid corporation began experiencing financial difficulties.as a result,rite aid began to lay off employees at its corporate headquarters.in the reshuffling of personnel which accompanied these lay offs,miller,then a senior executive at rite aid,became the corporate director of store planning and began reporting directly to mark white,rite aid of store development.later that fall,a new management team decided to further restructure rite aid operations.thus,in march of,white,then miller boss and friend,submitted to rite aid senior management a proposal to restructure his department.as part of the restructuring,the plan included a list of additional employees that white proposed to lay off.the plan provided that laid off employees would receive a severance package.that initial plan did not include miller.
later that march,miller discussed with white the possibility of being added to the list of employees whose severances white would be proposing to management.miller had begun negotiations to join a company in arizona called globalnet,an internet which was developing certain software products.pursuant to miller request,white added miller to the list of employees proposed to be severed.senior rite aid management gave final approval to white restructuring plan in late may of.as part of that plan,white had complete discretion as to the timing and order of the lay off of each individual whose severance was approved by senior rite aid management.
on june,miller and globalnet orally agreed to employment terms,later entering into a written agreement at the end of that month.on june,white told miller that management had agreed to include miller in the restructuring plan and informed coworkers that miller would be leaving.white did not,however,provide miller with any official severance date.white did begin to otherwise implement the restructuring plan,and some,but not all,of the employees listed in the plan were,in fact,laid off that first week in june.
the next day,june,larry haller,the director of retail facilities,who reported directly to miller,tendered his written resignation effective june.although white and miller expected this resignation eventually,it occurred earlier than both anticipated.thus,in response to the that haller resignation caused white in miller area,white had to suspend plans to sever miller.when white explained to miller what had happened,miller volunteered to stay on at rite aid to manage rite aid facilities department during the restructuring period.white did not provide miller with any affirmative date or estimate as to when he might be severed.nonetheless,miller contacted his new prospective employer,globalnet,and arranged to start with that company on july.
from june,through july,miller and white exchanged regarding miller departure and his entitlement to severance.on june,in response to an from miller,white told miller that he would receive his severance package when he was laid off.however,because of staffing shortages,white explained that he could neither afford to lay miller off at that time nor commit to an affirmative date as to when he could let miller go.white wrote,as soon as i can let you go,i will.and you will get a handsome package to take with you assuming you stay around long enough to get it of course 
on june,miller asserted to white in an that his final date is july and my months of severance needs to start from there.on july,white responded to miller that he could not guarantee miller a specific severance date,nor would he agree to a severance date just because miller had unilaterally accepted another job.white wrote 
the idea that being laid off and getting a severance package is somehow a right that you have is preposterous.i have been telling you all along that your employment is still active and that i do know when that situation will change.if you choose to take your family somewhere other than harrisburg,it is your choice.if you leave on july,it will be because you resigned not because you were being laid off.you will leave without a severance package.
on august,miller,still working for rite aid,sent white an asking,will i get a package if i stay until the end of august whether there is a replacement or not white responded that rite aid only gives severance packages when an employee is laid off.in miller case,white stated that it was not only unnecessary to lay him off,it was virtually impossible given the staffing shortages in the department.
finally,on august,miller resigned from rite aid,effective immediately.the district court found that a t the time miller resigned,he was aware that his severance benefits would not vest until his employment at rite aid was severed.the district court found that rite aid never severed miller employment,further noting that t here are employees listed on the severance list approved in may that continue to be employed by rite aid.
on september,miller filed a complaint against rite aid in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.miller asserted claims to the severance benefits he contends rite aid promised him based on state law breach of contract and wrongful denial of benefits pursuant to erisa a b,a b.in seeking summary judgment,rite aid admitted that its severance plan was a welfare benefit plan subject to the provisions of erisa.therefore,rite aid contended that erisa would preempt miller contract claim.nonetheless,rite aid also argued that because miller was not an erisa participant,he had no standing to bring an erisa claim.in opposition to summary judgment,miller contended that he was an erisa participant,and therefore had standing to bring that claim however,miller agreed that his state law claim was preempted.on that basis,the district court granted summary judgment to rite aid on the state law contract claim,but held the erisa claim over for trial.
after a trial on the merits of the erisa claim,the district court concluded that miller was not a participant,as defined by therefore,miller lacks standing to bring an erisa action for unpaid benefits under the severance plan.the district court issued an order of judgment in favor of rite aid.miller subsequently filed a notice of appeal with respect to the final order entered in favor of the defendant on may,but,notwithstanding the district court judgment against him on the erisa claim,did not appeal the earlier grant of summary judgment on his state law contract claim.

in granting judgment for rite aid,the district court concluded that miller lacked standing to bring an erisa claim because he did not meet the definition of an erisa participant,as defined by.at oral argument,the parties conceded that this case presents no issue of traditional article iii standing,const.art.iii,cases and controversies,a contention with which we agree.however,the question of standing involves both constitutional limitations on jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.bennett spear,d quoting warth seldin,d.these judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction are founded in concern about the proper and properly limited role of the courts in democratic society but unlike their constitutional counterparts,they can be modified or abrogated by congress.id.at quotations and citations omitted the first inquiry,then,is whether congress expressly negated the prudential standing doctrine in passing the statute at issue.in determining whether congress intended to abrogate the background presumption that prudential standing doctrine applies,we consider the statutory text,its structure,and its legislative history.conte,quaker,cir see also procter gamble amway,cir citing bennett,at.
far from abrogating the prudential standing doctrine,in past decisions,we have stated that erisa a,a,restricts civil actions against a plan administrator to actions brought by a participant or beneficiary.the requirement that the plaintiff be a plan participant is both a standing and subject matter jurisdictional requirement.saporito combustion engineering,cir emphasis added,vacated by combustion engineering,saporito,d remanded for further consideration in light of firestone tire and rubber company bruch,d.see also becker mack trucks,cir addressing standing before turn ing to the merits of their claims shawley bethlehem steel,cir because we hold that plaintiffs have no standing to sue under erisa,we do not address the merits of plaintiffs discrimination claim under.thus,we have construed the language of a to provide standing for a civil action only to a participant or beneficiary.a.in that sense,the zone of interest inquiry in the prudential standing analysis for a claims is inextricably tied to the question of whether a plaintiff can meet the definitions of either a participant or beneficiary.see also christopher mobil oil,cir the standing question and the merits of an employee claim are unavoidably intertwined to some degree vartanian monsanto,cir in determining who is a participant,for purposes of standing,the definition found in must be read in the context of traditional concepts of standing the ultimate question is whether the plaintiff is within the zone of interests erisa was intended to protect.emphasis original original bracketing deleted.
miller does not dispute this premise.however,miller contends that because he was a participant,he necessarily is a participant and,therefore,has standing to pursue his claim.the statutory language of erisa does not support miller argument.
the term participant means any employee or former employee of an employer who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.miller argues that he was a participant in the rite aid severance plan because he was on the list of employees to be laid off his severance benefit had been approved by those with authority to design the plan the plan administrator white had been instructed to implement the plan white began to implement the plan and miller lay off was announced.however,miller argument entirely misses a critical point the district court found that miller had to be laid off to become eligible for severance under rite aid plan.miller was never laid off.
miller may be correct that for a fleeting period of time he met erisa definition of participant however,the district court found that he did not meet that definition after he voluntarily left rite aid before the vesting of his benefits once miller severance was approved by management,but before he quit,miller technically might have been an employee of an employer who may become eligible to receive a benefit,specifically severance.emphasis added however,miller never actually became eligible the district court found that the plan required him to be severed by the company to be eligible.instead,miller resigned.once miller resigned,he then became and remains to this day a former employee of an employer who neither is or may become eligible to receive a benefit.see emphasis added.miller is not presently eligible for benefits.the district court found that rite aid only provides severance benefits to those who are laid off.miller also has no prospect of becoming eligible he no longer works for rite aid,and does not allege that rite aid may hire him back.what miller is now is a former employee of an employer who might have become eligible to receive a benefit.but does not define a former employee who might have become eligible for benefits as a participant under erisa.see id.
this reading of the definition of participant is consistent with both the leading supreme court decision and our own precedent in this area.
in our view,the term participant is naturally read to mean either employees in,or reasonably expected to be in,currently covered employment,or former employees who have a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment or have a colorable claim to vested benefits a former employee who has neither a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment nor a colorable claim to vested benefits,however,simply does not fit within the phrase may become eligible.
firestone tire rubber bruch,d emphasis added citations omitted.thus,in shawley bethlehem steel,cir,we stated that whether former employees are participants depends on whether they have either a colorable claim to vested benefits in the plan or a reasonable expectation of returning to employment at the company.id.at emphasis added.where the benefits of those former employees had not vested prior to their leaving the company,and the employees had no recall rights to be rehired,we held that those plaintiffs were not participants and affirmed the district court dismissal of the erisa claim for lack of standing.id.at.similarly,the district court found that miller severance benefits never vested.
reading firestone tire rubber,shawley and other cases interpreting the definition of participant to require only a colorable claim to vested benefits,miller asserts that his claim was colorable,thus,he was a participant with standing to bring his claim.miller misapprehends both firestone tire rubber and the doctrine of standing.we grant to miller that his claim was not frivolous.in fact,his claim was obviously substantial enough to require the district judge to conduct a trial so as to resolve certain issues.yet,therein lies the flaw in miller argument.
the question of whether a plaintiff is a participant,and thereby has standing to bring a a claim,is most often addressed after the filing of motions to dismiss or for summary judgment.see,firestone tire rubber,at.becker,at shawley,at saporito,at sallee rexnord,cir molnar wibbelt,cir.however,the written terms of the rite aid severance policy at issue left ambiguous the requirements for an employee to vest in and become eligible for severance.conflicting parol evidence at summary judgment evidently required a trial to settle that question.nonetheless,just because a plaintiff is permitted to proceed to trial on an erisa claim does not compel the conclusion that he has standing.standing is not a mere pleading requirement,but rather an indispensable part of the plaintiff case,each element of which must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements a nd at the final stage,those facts if controverted must be supported adequately by the evidence adduced at trial.id.quoting gladstone,realtors village of bellwood,d.
