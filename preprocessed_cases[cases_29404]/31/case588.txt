plaintiffs,a class of former trw automotive employees,allege that trw violated the employee retirement and income security act by closing the plant where they worked to interfere with the vesting of their retirement benefits.the district court disagreed,and granted the company motion for summary judgment.we affirm.
trw,an indirect subsidiary of trw automotive holdings corporation,owned and operated the van dyke plant where plaintiffs worked.van dyke,a square foot facility,was part of trw north american braking and suspension group workers there manufactured front suspension components for various car makers.its employees,represented by the united auto workers,were covered by a collective bargaining agreement between trw and the uaw,and a defined pension plan.under the pension plan,employees who retired with thirty or more years of benefit service were entitled to retirement benefits they earned benefit service for each year that they worked over hours,though if they only needed hours to get a year credit.employees who retired with years of service and were or older were entitled to an early benefit.
trw claims that,as of,it faced overcapacity problems which hampered profits.in response,it organized a group to research the costs and benefits of shutting down some of its north american plants.that group identified the van dyke plant as a prime candidate for closure.but,before making that leap,trw considered a few alternatives.most significantly,it considered placing at van dyke work for daimlerchrysler,though this was only assembly work and not the manufacturing kind typical of van dyke.ultimately,however,the company decided that van dyke was in fact not the right place,and the daimlerchrysler work wound up the record is unclear precisely how at a plant located on mancini drive owned by the company,a separate subsidiary of trw holdings.the mancini plant employees are not represented by a union and they do not have a pension plan.so van dyke days became numbered.
shortly before trw shut van dyke down,however,the company discussed with the uaw the possibility of preferentially hiring van dyke employees to the mancini plant and bridging the benefits of van dyke employees who were close to vesting.trw also offered a severance to employees who opted out of their available retiree benefits.but the two sides failed to reach an agreement and trw closed van dyke in january.at that time,three employees missed the retirement mark by less than one year of benefit service all three had been in,and four others missed the mark by less than two years.
plaintiffs,a certified class of former van dyke employees,sued,alleging that trw violated erisa by failing to recall employees following a layoff,refusing to transfer employees to the mancini drive facility,and improperly discharging employees to interfere with their attainment of retirement eligibility.the district court granted summary judgment to trw on all counts,and also later dismissed plaintiffs motion for relief from the judgment on the basis of new evidence.plaintiffs appeal.
summary judgment is only appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact,and,in giving the claim fresh review,this court must draw all justifiable inferences in the party favor.see.c matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
plaintiffs contend that the district court improperly granted trw summary judgment because the company violated erisa when it laid them off in connection with closing the van dyke plant.erisa makes it unlawful for any person to discharge,fine,suspend,expel,discipline,or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under an employee benefit plan.this section was designed to prevent employers from discharging or harassing employees to preclude them from obtaining vested pension rights.west butler,cir.of course,not only is this illegal,it is also bad business because providing benefits is discretionary and so part of total,firing older employees to reduce pension costs both creates animosity between employer and employee and makes employees compensation less certain,and thus employees will demand higher wages to offset this heightened risk of being fired inopportunely as a result,employers will have to pay employees higher wages to attract and keep them.see maria hylton,insecure retirement income,wrongful plan administration and other employee benefits erisa at age thirty,buff.but some employers are foolish,and thus congress enacted to provide a remedy.plaintiffs assert that trw discharge d them to interfer e with their attainment of full retirement benefits in violation of.
so the primary question here is whether the plaintiffs proffered enough evidence of this improper motive to get to a jury.but first we must dismiss two errant contentions trw asserts that erisa interference claims in the plant sale or closing context are never actionable and plaintiffs assert that trw violated by failing to recall or transfer them following their discharge.neither is correct.
trw overreaches in stating that employees may never challenge discharges that result from a decision.while e mployers or other plan sponsors are generally free under erisa to adopt,modify or terminate pension benefit plans,coomer bethesda hosp,cir,this discretion does not permit them to discharge employees or alter their plan rights to circumvent the provision of promised benefits.rail emples.ass atchison,topeka santa fe,d internal quotations omitted.
of course,the circuit has pointed out that congress use of the term discharge in comes in the context of other individually focused terms like fine,suspend,expel,and discipline.andes ford motor.trw latches onto this to say that broad or claims are never actionable.but,as the other routinely recognized,the term discharge,by definition,is not so limited and thus covers employees fired or,either individually or as a group,and thus the statutory language gives any discharged employee a right to sue,whether via or individually.see,gavalik cont l can,cir.indeed,the andes court explicitly pointed out the possibility that some employer might unscrupulously sell or close a plant to shake off employees on the cusp of establishing benefit eligibility.at.
plaintiffs similarly overreach in claiming that trw was legally required to recall many of them back to or to transfer them to the mancini plant.as stated above,includes a list of prohibited actions,including improperly discharg ing,fin ing,expel ling,and discriminat ing.but nowhere is transferring or recalling listed.neither have plaintiffs identified caselaw giving effect to such a claim.this is not surprising the sine qua non of a claim is the presence of some adverse action done to interfere with an employee rights,and had plaintiffs not been,whether or not there was a transfer would have been irrelevant because plaintiffs would still have been accruing benefits similarly,recall would have been irrelevant if there was no discharge or it was lawful,because employees would have no more right to be hired than someone who had never worked for trw.in other words,the whole game is whether trw unlawfully discharged plaintiffs.
also,trw decision to recall some employees and not others was not discriminatory because those decisions were seniority based,and at least two employees accrued enough pension credits to retire with benefits after being recalled.finally,the employees collective bargaining agreement provided that benefits accrued only at the van dyke plant,so plaintiffs also lacked plan rights to be recalled.see mcgath north shore,cir.
a final detour before the main event plaintiffs,in support of their theory that gives them a right to be recalled or transferred,try to import two doctrines into erisa law the corporate doctrine,see yolton el paso.pipeline,cir,and the labor law doctrine,see nlrb fullerton transfer storage,cir.the idea seems to be that the plaintiffs view the mancini plant as the successor or of the defunct van dyke plant.but,setting aside the nuanced analysis required to explain if and how these doctrines would apply to two plants
