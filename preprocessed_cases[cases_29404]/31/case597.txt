in this case,diane zirnhelt argues that the district court erred in upholding the company denial of benefits,denying her motion to amend her complaint to add an claim,dismissing her claim and awarding her just based on the company failure to provide her with pension plan documents in a timely manner.for its part,the company argues in its cross appeal that the district court should not have imposed any monetary penalty.we affirm.
born in march,diane zirnhelt worked for michigan consolidated gas from june,when she was,to august,when she was.
in,when she was,zirnhelt asked the company about her eligibility for pension benefits based on her earlier employment.in response,the company sent zirnhelt a copy of the retirement plan in effect as of the date her employment terminated and told her that,i n accordance with the plan document,zirnhelt would have had to work until april,to have any benefits because the plan required years of service,excluding those rendered before reaching the age of the majority.ja.because zirnhelt did not meet the plan requirement,the company explained,she was not eligible for benefits.
in february,zirnhelt filed a complaint under erisa against the company,the plan and the plan administrator in federal court,seeking a declaration that she is entitled to benefits under the plan and damages for the plan administrator failure to provide her with requested plan documents in a timely manner.in accordance with a stipulated order,zirnhelt exhausted her administrative remedies without success,and the company provided zirnhelt with the requested plan documents.in november,zirnhelt sought permission to amend her complaint to add an claim,but the court denied the motion,concluding that the amendment was futile because the estoppel claim would not survive a motion to dismiss.ja.in july,she filed a second complaint,which added a claim and which the court consolidated with the first complaint.
the court rejected zirnhelt benefits claim and dismissed her claim.at the same time,the court awarded zirnhelt based on the plan administrator failure to provide her with several plan documents in a timely manner.both sides appealed.
zirnhelt claims that the district court erred in upholding the company decision to deny her claim for pension benefits.in doing so,she concedes that our task like the district court task is to determine whether the benefits committee decision was arbitrary and capricious.see crosby rohm haas,cir.
the language of the plan supports the committee decision.article of the plan says 
a participant who ceases to be a participant upon termination of his employment for any reason other than death or retirement shall have the following rights 
a if such participant shall have completed ten years of service at the date of such termination of employment,he shall be entitled to receive certain benefits.
b if such participant shall not have completed ten years of service at the date of such termination of employment,he shall not be entitled to receive any annuity or any other distribution or payment under the plan unless he is a contributing participant 
ja.zirnhelt does not contend that she was a contributing participant.that leaves the question whether she had ten years of service at the date of her termination of employment.to answer that question,we look to article,which defines years of service as 
the sum of 
a an employee years of prior service,
b each period,beginning after december,on an employee anniversary date,during which the employee shall have completed or more hours of employment with one or more participating employers,associate companies and predecessor companies,and 
c a proportional year of service for any period of less than months between december,and an employee first anniversary date thereafter,such proportional year of service to be determined under uniform rules adopted by the committee in accordance with regulations,
but excluding any years of service completed before an employee attains age.
because zirnhelt did not turn until march,she needed ten years of service from that date forward to qualify for pension benefits under the plan.unfortunately for zirnhelt,she worked just eight years and five months beyond that august that she did not have ten years of service at the date of her termination.because the benefits committee followed the language of the plan in denying zirnhelt claim for benefits,its decision necessarily was not arbitrary and capricious.see mcdonald.life ins,cir.
that is all well and good,zirnhelt responds,so long as the committee relied on the right version of the plan.but that is not the case,she claims the company gave her a different copy of the plan,one that defined years of service as 
the sum of 
a an employee years of prior service,
b each period,beginning after december,on an employee anniversary date,during which the employee shall have completed or more hours of employment with one or more participating employers,associate companies and predecessor companies,and 
c a proportional year of service for any period of less than months between december,and an employee first anniversary date thereafter,such proportional year of service to be determined under uniform rules adopted by the committee in accordance with regulations,but excluding any years of service completed before an employee attains age.
ja emphasis added.unlike the company version of the plan,zirnhelt copy of the plan places the clause within subsection c and,according to zirnhelt,confines the limitation to that clause.
the committee did not exceed its discretion in rejecting this argument and in relying on the company version of the plan.no one within the company could verify zirnhelt version of the plan,and indeed,according to the committee,zirnhelt version appeared to have been altered by someone outside the company.as the committee explained,martha klyce,the individual in the company benefits department who allegedly provided zirnhelt with the copy in question,stated in her affidavit that the copy of the retirement plan that she provided zirnhelt attorney is not the one attached to zirnhelt complaint and that she did not recognize zirnhelt version as a document that has ever been used in the administration of the retirement plan.ja.
but even if we were to credit zirnhelt version of the plan,that would not help her.the only difference between the competing versions of the plan is the placement of the clause,not its wording.zirnhelt claims that the placement of the clause directly at the end of subsection c,as opposed to on the next line of the page,means that it must apply only to that clause.while that is one possibility,it is not the only possibility.and the problem with zirnhelt possibility is that it makes no identifiable sense.subsection c permits employees to obtain credit for proportional years of service and gives the committee authority to create uniform rules for computing them.why that subsection,and that subsection alone,would limit eligibility to full years of service earned after age is never explained.nor can we think of any tenable reason why the clause would apply only to this subsection,as opposed to all three of them.nor for that matter could least as evidenced by her appellate briefs and by her inability to give an explanation for this proposed construction of the plan at oral argument.nor does erisa provide any basis for drawing such a distinction.in,erisa provided that a plan,i n computing the period of service under the plan for purposes of determining the nonforfeitable percentage of benefits to which a participant is entitled,may disregard years of service before age,yet never said anything about applying such a restriction just to the calculation of proportional years of service.b a,amended by,stat.amending b a by striking out and inserting in lieu thereof.
in challenging a benefits committee interpretation of pension plan language,a claimant does not gain traction simply by proposing another the plan.to be worthy of credence and to show material ambiguity in the language of a plan,the competing interpretation must be a plausible zirnhelt proposed interpretation is not.see mcdonald,at
