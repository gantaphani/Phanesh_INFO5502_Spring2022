karen strom sued her former law firm,siegel fenchel peddy,sfp,under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,claiming entitlement to benefits under pension plans administered by the firm.strom now appeals from the september,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york orenstein,partially granting motion for summary judgment on those claims.we vacate and remand that judgment because the plan administrators failed to offer any interpretation of the plans terms to which the district court might have accorded deference in granting summary judgment to sfp,and because the district court erroneously held that strom had waived her claim under one of the plans by failing to exhaust her administrative remedies,of which remedies she was never informed by sfp.
background 
except where noted,the parties do not dispute the facts in this case.
strom started her career as a secretary at a predecessor firm to sfp in.she began attending law school in,but continued to work at sfp.after passing the new york bar exam in,she joined the firm as an attorney.she was promoted to the position of partner at sfp,effective january,and was again promoted,this time to the position of partner,effective january.although sfp was technically a professional corporation,the title of partner was given to those,like strom,who were senior attorneys in the office.at the time of strom elevation to partner status in,the three individual defendants in this siegel,saul fenchel and tracie shareholders,and two other schroder and andrew partners as well as officers of the firm.nothing in the record explains the significance of the officer title within the corporate structure of example,how it was assigned or what the officers roles and responsibilities were.
strom decided to leave sfp in to form a new firm with fellow sfp alumnus michael schroder.she then claimed entitlement to benefits under,inter alia,two of sfp pension plans the sfp profit sharing plan profit plan and the sfp cash balance pension plan cash plan collectively,the plans.the plans made pension benefits available to all employees,but reserved an increased contribution for a defined subset of employees this subset changed repeatedly over the duration of strom employment at sfp as a result of several amendments to the plans.each amendment excluded a different group of employees from the increased contribution an amendment purportedly effective january,excluded all salaried associates another purportedly effective january,excluded all sharing attorneys and a third amendment purportedly effective january,excluded all attorneys with or less profit share.notably,sfp claims that strom was a member of each of the three excluded groups of employees and candidly admits that the firm amended the language of the plans expressly to maintain the existing rate of benefit accrual for strom and to allocate the increased contribution only to the officers and shareholders.
with respect to the amendment,strom insists that she could not have been excluded as a salaried associate because she was a partner entitled to full,that she was entitled to the increased contribution benefits that siegel,fenchel,peddy,schroder and cangemi all received.strom claims,inter alia,that the and amendments were invalid as applied to her because they were passed by the firm leadership without notice to her,and after her benefits had accrued under the plans unamended provisions,in contravention of various erisa provisions.by contrast,the defendants argue that because sfp was a professional corporation and distinguished only between shareholders and,the title partner did not affect strom status under the plans.they claim that strom eligibility for benefits is governed exclusively by the terms of the plans,and that she was excluded from the increased contribution by each successive plan amendment,all of which were passed in compliance with the relevant erisa provisions.
strom lawsuit 
in,strom requested certain documents from sfp relating to its profit plan and cash plan.in an august,letter,sfp informed strom that it was in the process of computing her benefits under the profit plan and that,a s you know,you are not a participant in the cash plan as you were neither a shareholder,nor an officer of siegel fenchel peddy,the letter did not indicate which provisions of the cash plan were being interpreted,or why the fact that strom was not a shareholder or officer of sfp rendered her ineligible for any benefits under the terms of the cash plan or its operative amendments.
on august,strom and schroder filed an erisa action in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york mishler,against sfp,as well as siegel and peddy.in that is not before us in the present claimed entitlement to benefits under both the profit plan and the cash plan.the district court did not reach the merits,however,but rather dismissed strom complaint on december,for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.the district court also rejected strom argument that sfp had denied her effective access to the administrative remedies provided under the relevant plans,but nonetheless granted strom the opportunity to file requests for review of her profit plan and cash plan claims on or before december.
by letters dated january,january,and april,strom submitted to sfp a claim for benefits under both the profit plan and the cash plan.even though these letters came after the december,deadline set by the district court,sfp considered the claims on the merits.
ii.the administrative proceedings 
in response to the requests for cash plan benefits contained in strom letters,sfp sent her a letter on april,summarily reiterating its position that strom was ineligible for any cash plan benefits as she was not a partner or shareholder.like the august,letter,this letters did not purport to interpret a particular provision of the cash plan,nor did it provide further clarification as to why strom was ineligible to claim benefits.
strom january letters to sfp also contained requests for documentation relating to the profit plan and the cash plan.in its april,letter to strom,sfp indicated that it had already provided her with the documents relating to the profit plan on january.with respect to her request for documents relating to the cash plan,sfp informed strom that she was not entitled to the information requested in her letter,because,as sfp had explained to her previously,she was neither a shareholder n or an officer of siegel fenchel peddy,however,sfp again did not explain why strom ineligibility for benefits under the cash plan precluded her even from receiving documents relating to that plan,from which she or her counsel could determine her eligibility for cash plan benefits.two days later,on april,strom responded to this letter.based on a copy of a plan she had obtained from michael schroder her new law partner and a former sfp attorney,strom explained why she believed she was a participant in the cash plan and therefore eligible for benefits thereunder.in response to this letter,on june,sfp wrote to strom and again summarily explained that she was not eligible to receive plan documents or benefits,a s she was not a partner or shareholder.
further,sfp april,letter to strom conceded that she was entitled to benefits under the profit plan,but denied the amount of benefits strom requested.the letter purported to explain how sfp had reached its lower benefits calculation,but it did not explain why sfp was using the precise figures that it did that is,sfp did not offer,expressly or implicitly,an interpretation of the profit plan terms.the april,letter also set a deadline of june,for strom to request an administrative hearing to review the decision.strom exercised that right and requested a hearing by letter dated june.the hearing was conducted on january,before siegel,fenchel and peddy,who serve as the plan administrators,and the focus was on strom claim to benefits under the profit plan.
two days after that hearing,on january,strom made a formal request for a hearing with respect to her cash plan claim.she claims that she waited until this date to do so because she only learned that she was required to make a formal request for such a hearing at the january,hearing on her profit plan claim.while it is unclear what in particular spurred strom formal request,strom appears to argue that because sfp persistently denied her status as a participant in the cash plan and refused to apprise her of any of her rights thereunder,she was uncertain whether sfp would even have entertained a formal request for a hearing under that plan.strom claims that it was only at the january hearing that she learned that one of sfp defenses against her cash plan claims was that she had not made a request for a hearing to review them.
on march,sfp issued a decision after hearing the decision,memorializing the january,hearing.the decision explained that the january,hearing was meant to review strom profit plan claim,and that strom claim reduced itself to two aspects that the benefits to which she was entitled were not properly calculated in respect to certain plan years and that she was entitled to greater contributions on the grounds that she was a partner in a number of the plan years.the decision then proceeded to explain why it could not conclusively resolve her claims 
the hearing consisted essentially of a colloquy among strom,her counsel and the presiding hearing officer.apart from the question of the mathematical computations,the question was,and still is,on what basis does strom claim that she is entitled to additional contributions in the siegel fenchel peddy profit plan 
strom counsel indicated that the basis for strom claim for additional contribution in the profit plan was that she was a partner.
however,there is no definition of the term partner in the profit plan assuming that the term partner would,in some way,qualify strom for additional contribution,it was requested of strom her counsel that documentation be provided to establish i the position of partner ii the significance of that position inside the spf firm and iii the significance as it relates to the plan.
no documentation was provided other than an announcement stating that strom was a partner and a letter referring to strom as partner.this appeared to be the sum total of strom evidence in support of her position as a partner.however,no information,documentation or any evidence was proffered to establish the significance of this term.it was unclear whether strom position was that partner was equivalent to owner of the firm or was equivalent to some position which would be recognized by the pension plan as qualifying her for additional contribution.indeed,upon being questioned as to the absence of any substantial documentation to establish any of these propositions,strom counsel indicated that the material was deliberately withheld since strom was involved in other litigation against the sfp firm 
in any event,no explanation was offered by strom or her counsel as to exactly how strom qualified for additional contribution under the plan terms or the significance of the term partner as it relates to this plan.whatever the position of the claimant,it certainly was not made evident at the hearing,nor was any information provided at the hearing in fact,it was indicated that it had been deliberately withheld.
the decision made clear that it was only tentatively denying strom profit plan claim 
as noted,the exhaustion of administrative remedies is an absolute prerequisite.by the same token,the administrative remedy must be pursued in good faith by the claimant.appearing at a hearing without making a reasonable effort to present the evidence in support of the position is not proper use of the administrative remedy,nor does it constitute an exhaustion of the administrative remedy 
under the circumstances,since the administrators,at the hearing,were denied a submission by claimant of all the relevant factors to make a full and genuine evaluation of her claim,it would be impossible and inappropriate for the administrators to reach a final determination on strom claim.rather,the hearing should be adjourned to a date for strom and her representative to provide the necessary information in support of her claim so that the administrators can render a determination.if strom,having presented all the evidence in support of her position,is dissatisfied with the determination,she can then properly seek her remedy in court.
the decision turned briefly to the cash plan claim,and noted that a letter rejecting strom cash plan claim had been sent on june,that the denial in that letter was plain,leaving no doubt that claimant counsel,an expert in erisa law,had she disagreed with the conclusion,should have exercised her right to a hearing and that strom raised no questions about the cash plan prior to december.the decision concluded that,while the cash plan itself requires that a claimant request a hearing within sixty days of an adverse decision,strom did not make any such request following the june,letter.moreover,the decision noted that,in any event,judge mishler had ordered strom to exercise her right to administrative review before december,and it is beyond dispute that no such request was made prior to that date.thus,the decision concluded,since n o request for a hearing had been made either under the plan period or the period set by the district court,strom has intentionally waived her administrative remedy to review the denial under the cash plan.
another hearing on strom profit plan claim was held on may,but no decision was issued after those proceedings.
iii.the present lawsuit 
on march,strom filed the complaint that forms the basis for this appeal.in this complaint,strom sought a declaration of her rights under four of sfp pension plans including the cash plan and the profit plan,as well as an award of additional benefits under each.she also added a separate claim asserting breach of fiduciary duty by the plans administrators,in their answer to strom complaint,asserted ten affirmative defenses,including that strom claims may be barred,in whole or in part,by the doctrine of laches,waiver estoppel,or by the applicable statute of limitations.
by consent of the parties,the case was referred to united states magistrate judge james orenstein.see c.both sides moved for summary judgment,and after reviewing the parties submissions,the district court held,inter alia,that strom claim that she was a partner and therefore entitled to an increased contribution was foreclosed by an administrative decision that was neither arbitrary nor capricious and that strom has waived her claim under the cash plan because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies 
as the district court noted,strom raised a standard of review argument against the march,decision,which had denied her claim that,as a partner of the firm,she was entitled to the same benefits as siegel,fenchel,peddy,schroder and cangemi.specifically,strom argued that the district court must interpret the relevant plan terms salaried associate and sharing attorney de novo,on the grounds that the administrators 
interpreted the plans under a flagrant and inherent conflict of interest,refused even to accept strom participant status in of the plans until after strom commenced the instant litigation,offered varying and conflicting plan interpretations designed solely to deprive strom of her rightful benefits,and did not apply the interpretation it now urges on the other partners,schroder and cangemi,of sfp.
the district court rejected strom argument that a de novo standard of review applied.the court first explained that parties had conceded that the profit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,firestone tire rubber bruch,d,and that,accordingly,the administrators decision was subject to review for abuse of discretion.regarding strom claim that the administrators reviewed her claims under a conflict of interest,the district court observed that such a conflict did not alter the standard of review,but rather that the conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.id.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the district court further noted that strom reliance on defelice american international life assurance company of new york,cir,was misplaced,because defelice involved a plan in which the plan administrators were not given discretion to interpret ambiguous terms in the plan language see id.at.
thus,the district court reviewed the march,decision to determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious.on the question of whether the decision passed this standard,the district court said only the following 
under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,i must defer to the administrators decision to interpret the terms salaried associate and sharing attorney to mean attorneys who were neither shareholders nor officers of sfp because that interpretation was not without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.
as to strom cash plan claim,the district court explained that were arguing,inter alia,that the denial of strom cash plan claim occurred no later than august,when strom received the first letter stating that she was not a participant in the cash plan as she was neither a shareholder nor an officer of siegel fenchel peddy,and that strom waived her cash plan claim because,following the august,denial,strom failed to seek review either before the plan deadline or even before the later deadline of december,specified in judge mishler order dismissing strom first erisa action.
the district court then asserted that strom failed to offer any meaningful response to contentions,and that her entire response to defendants argument is contained in a footnote in her opposition brief,which stated 
while strom attempted to appeal in and under both the profit plan and the cash plan,defendants absolutely refused to provide necessary cash plan documents.defendants also refused to provide certain requested profit plan documents and did not grant or deny strom profit plan appeal.while defendants initially moved to dismiss strom claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,that motion has been withdrawn.
given this,the district court noted that i t thus appears that strom concedes that she did not request an administrative hearing before the deadlines that the defendants cite,and that implicit concession is consistent with the record.nonetheless,the district court decided it would be prudent to investigate her claim more thoroughly.in so doing,the district court found that it did not need to determine whether the appropriate deadline for strom to request a hearing was judge mishler december,deadline or sixty days following the august,letter.this was because sfp also sent a letter to strom on june,which again denied her cash plan claim.and,three days later,strom lawyer responded to sfp with a letter formally requesting a hearing on the denial of her claim for benefits from the profit plan,but said nothing about a hearing on her claim under the cash plan.it was not until january,days after the hearing regarding the profit strom finally requested a hearing for her cash plan claim.and this date,the district court concluded,was well past the deadline,even assuming that the june,letter commenced the time period.
the district court then acknowledged and,in turn,rejected strom argument that the written denial of her claim for cash plan benefits set forth in the letter of june,was not sufficient under the terms of the plan to provide her with notice of her right of review,or the procedures governing such an appeal.observing that the june,letter contained all of the required information,including the deadline for appeal,though it pertains to the profit plan,the district court reasoned that strom was implicitly provided with sufficient information concerning the requirements governing administrative review under the cash plan.thus,the district court found that it was difficult to believe this technicality the letter inclusion of information concerning the profit plan,but not the cash plan prevented strom from requesting a hearing to review the administrators denial of her rights under the cash plan.
because the district court concluded that strom had waived her cash plan claim,it did not consider alternative argument that the administrators denial of benefits under the cash plan must be sustained under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.
discussion 
on appeal,strom argues that the district court erred in holding that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applied to the plan administrators decision denying strom claim for enhanced benefits under the profit plan,and that the plan administrators decision rejecting strom profit plan claim was neither arbitrary nor capricious and that strom waived her cash plan claim.
i.the profit plan claim 
strom raises two arguments why the district court should have applied a de novo standard of review to her claim under the profit plan.first,relying on this court decision in nichols prudential insurance,cir,she contends that the plan administrators never issued a final decision on its review of her profit plan claim,and therefore that this claim should be deemed denied by operation of law.see id.at strongly suggest ing that a plan administrator failure to comply with certain plan regulations renders the claimant administrative remedies exhausted by operation of law and consequently permits the claimant to seek review in the federal courts without further delay.a claim deemed denied by operation of law,strom claims,must be reviewed by the court de novo because the claim denial does not represent any exercise of discretion by plan administrators.id.at.second,she contends that the plan administrators operated under a conflict of interest necessitating de novo review by the district court.
we hold that the district court erred,and should have reviewed the administrators decision de novo.the district court stated that it was compelled to defer to the administrators decision to interpret the terms salaried associate and sharing associate to mean attorneys who were neither shareholders nor officers of sfp,but the district court could not defer to an interpretation that the decision never in fact made or explained.the plan administrators specifically reserved decision on strom claims,observing that in light of her alleged refusal to cooperate during the hearing,it would be impossible and inappropriate for the administrators to reach a final determination on strom claim.we express no opinion concerning sfp claim that strom refused to cooperate,but rather observe that the text of the decision itself makes clear that no actual decision was made.
in nichols,after prudential failed to timely issue a final decision on nichols appeal from a denial of benefits,she went directly to federal court and sued her insurer under erisa.we held that her claim was deemed denied by prudential inaction and that her administrative remedies were exhausted by operation of law.id.at.based on the supreme court decision in firestone tire rubber,we observed that we may give deferential review only to actual exercises of discretion,and that a deemed denied claim is not denied by any exercise of discretion,but by operation of law.id.at.we instructed the district court to review the plan administrator decision de novo because prudential inaction le ft the court without any decision or application of expertise to which to defer.id.in the instant case,the plan administrators explicitly refused to decide strom claim,and such a can not be deemed an exercise of discretion to which the district court might have deferred 
because a interpretation can not be a reasonable one,the district court erred in deferring to the profit plan administrators decision.nor could the district court properly rely on the letters that sfp sent to strom.none of those letters offers an interpretation of the profit plan language.though sfp letters about the cash plan did state that strom was not eligible for any cash plan benefits because she was neither a shareholder nor an its june,letter further asserted that strom was not a partner,see those statements did not offer any explanation of why
