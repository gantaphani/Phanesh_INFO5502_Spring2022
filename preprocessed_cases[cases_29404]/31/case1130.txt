cara burke appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to pitney bowes.disability plan on burke claims arising from the plan employee benefits committee termination of her disability benefits.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the supreme court recent decision in metropolitan life insurance glenn,d.
backgrounda.facts 
burke was hired by pitney bowes management services pitney as a sales employee in december and qualified for coverage under pitney disability plan the plan.the plan is subject to the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.et.the plan employee benefits committee the committee is responsible for the plan general administration while pitney disability and benefits department is delegated the responsibilities.the committee is the final regarding benefits eligibility.
benefits paid out by the plan come from the plan trust,which is funded in part by pitney and in part by employee contributions.the committee has the authority to determine the amounts of the employer and employee contributions to the trust,but it is unclear from the record what portion of the trust is funded by the employees,as opposed to by pitney.the trust fund is a voluntary employees beneficiary association veba trust therefore,the money paid into the trust can not revert back to pitney.
in june,burke was injured in a car accident,which caused her back and neck injuries,and caused her to miss five days of work.one month later,burke was injured again in a car accident,this time not.the second accident aggravated the injuries from the earlier accident,and burke was subsequently diagnosed with multilevel lumbar degenerative disc disease,spinal stenosis,and lumbar radidulopathy burke went on disability leave on october,and has not since returned to work.
burke asserts that she requested a claim form to apply for long term disability ltd benefits under the plan in march the plan,however,contests that burke requested a claim form at that time,and responds that she did not actually request a ltd claim form until september.on september,the plan responded to burke request by asserting that burke was not eligible for benefits under section j of the plan because her disability was excluded as a injury on may,the plan provided burke counsel with the requested ltd claim form,stating 
the plan conditions the payment of long term disability ltd benefits on the employee having first completed of short term disability std.as further mentioned,we have no record of burke filing a claim with pitney bowes for std benefits notwithstanding that burke failed to file an std claim with pitney bowes and that the deadline for filing such claim has long since expired,we will allow burke to file a claim for ltd benefits.
burke submitted her ltd claim in june.burke ltd claim was denied by the plan,which determined that burke injuries were excluded from coverage as a injury.burke filed a lawsuit in the northern district of california under erisa on may,and on september,burke and the plan reached a settlement in which the plan agreed to pay burke ltd benefits.the settlement agreement provided that burke would receive 
monthly disability benefits pursuant to the terms,process and procedures of the plan,as long as she continues to meet the plan definition of total disability and otherwise remains eligible under the plan.this provision is in no way meant to alter or modify the terms,process or procedures set forth in the plan for receiving benefits under the plan.burke eligibility for future benefits will be solely governed by the terms,process and procedures of the plan and erisa.accordingly,this agreement does not guarantee burke any future disability benefits except as determined by the plan administrator under the terms,process,and procedure of the plan and erisa.
in september,the plan,broder,requested that barry perform an independent medical examination ime of burke to determine whether she met the plan definition of totally disabled.section a defines a participant as being totally disabled or having a total disability as 
participant is unable a i to perform the material duties of his or her own occupation for a maximum period of twelve months after the qualifying period,and ii that thereafter the participant is unable,because of injury or illness,to engage in any gainful occupation or profession for which he is,or could become,reasonably suited by education,experience or training provided,however,that the amount of earnings that the participant would receive from engaging in such occupation or profession would be less than sixty percent of the participant annual or annualized earnings immediately prior to the event giving rise to the total disability.
barry examined burke on october.his report stated 
my impression is that burke has an objectively normal physical and neurologic examination,but she demonstrates a very high level of impairment.at this point,it appears that her described pattern of subjective symptoms are unsupported by any abnormal objective physical or neurologic findings given burke objectively normal evaluation,i feel she can return to light work at the current time,with no lifting,pushing or pulling over pounds,and no repeated bending.
on november,the plan notified burke that it was terminating her benefits because it determined that she was not totally disabled for any occupation as defined in section a of the plan.
on january,burke appealed the plan decision and requested that the plan produce all documents or other writings which were submitted,considered,or generated in the course of making the decision to terminate burke benefits,without regard to whether such document,record,or other information was relied upon in making the benefit determination.
on february,the plan produced some of the documents requested in burke january,letter,but added that 
all correspondence,memoranda,notes or other materials in burke disability claim file relating to the decision to terminate benefits on november,have been enclosed with this correspondence.however,i have not included documents submitted,considered or generated in connection with the october decision to deny disability benefits resulting in the settlement agreement,dated september.burke or your office submitted the majority of such documents,and i assume you retained copies.nonetheless,copies will be sent upon request.
on march,the plan wrote to burke counsel,first stating 
t here are no additional materials or information necessary for burke to perfect her claim.we have all materials necessary for the employee benefits committee to review burke appeal of the termination of ltd benefits.that said,the committee would consider any additional information not previously provided in support of burke position that she is totally disabled as defined in the plan.
the plan also wrote,again,that the plan did not provide burke with the documents related to the decision to deny burke benefits because the plan assumed burke had retained copies,but noted that the plan would send burke copies if she so requested.the plan added that it was enclosing the documents provided by broder to barry in connection with the latter october ime,and that the majority of those documents are already part of burke file submitted by burke prior to the september,settlement agreement.
on may,burke counsel provided the plan counsel with copies of medical reports prepared by zwerin and a functional capacity evaluation fce prepared by lok chan,an occupational therapist.zwerin determined that burke was incapable of returning to work because of an i nability to engage in employment at any level due to being bed bound for up to a week at a time,days a week regularly secondary to sciatica and back pain and an i nability to engage in work at a desk without standing or walking or lying down every minutes for minutes.zwerin also stated 
barry preposterous conclusions aside,burke has objective findings on mri and discography which are entirely compatible with her clinical presentation.her imaging studies demonstrate findings which also conform to her complaints.burke pain drawing today shows none of the histrionics which barry apparently used as the basis for his conclusions aside from barry,no physician has suggested that she is lying,hysterical or engaging in symptom magnification.given that he saw her on but one occasion and at least other physicians have seen her on multiple occasions with observations reinforced by an entire team of phd,and other professionals without anyone ever concluding that her presentation was other than legitimate,the conclusions of barry are clearly devoid of legitimacy.
similarly,chan stated 
burke is unable to tolerate prolonged static sitting or standing positions.she requires frequent changes and shifting of positions to remain comfortable.based on the results of this fce,burke currently is unable to return to any type of gainful employment.she does not meet any of the physical demand characteristics of work as defined by the department of labor.
after reviewing chan fce,zwerin reported i had believed burke was incapable of returning to the workforce.this evaluation is certainly in accord with my findings on clinical examination.thus i would conclude that the fce findings are in concert with my own opinions on this matter.
the plan counsel acknowledged receipt of those reports on may,and requested an independent fce to corroborate the evidence.an independent fce by physiometrics,was conducted on june,in burke home,and concluded that burke 
demonstrated a effort.the effort was less than consistent however,the individual true functional capacity is likely to be close to the actual abilities demonstrated during the fce burke lifted to the sedentary level for waist to overhead lifting.burke did not,however,participate in the floor to waist lifting.as such,we are unable to document her overall work level classification as defined by the department of labor in the dictionary of occupational titles.this does not suggest,however,that burke does not have a work level classification.rather,we are simply unable to establish one at this time based on the results of the fce.further,according to the published research,most sedentary level jobs simply require a tolerance for sitting and hand use,both of which burke demonstrated there was no job analysis available for burke.if a job analysis is available,the results of this fce can be used to determine safe return to work levels and to set rehabilitation goals.at a minimum,burke can at least work at the levels identified within this report.
on july,the plan notified burke of its request that barry review the fce report and perform an orthopedic spinal evaluation of burke on august,noting that it intended to present burke appeal to the committee in september,provided that it received barry report by that time.burke counsel responded by stating that burke would not submit to another examination by barry,calling the requested examination unreasonable and unnecessary because barry had already expressed his opinion of burke condition.
on july,the plan informed burke counsel that refusing to attend the evaluation provides procedural grounds for benefits termination pursuant to section d of the plan.burke counsel again stated that the requested evaluation was unreasonable.
although barry did not personally examine burke a second time,he reviewed the fce conducted by physiometrics,the report from zwerin,and a report from wolfe from may,and concluded 
i stand by my report of october,in which i felt burke had a described pattern of subjective symptoms,which were,on the whole,unsupported by abnormal objective physical or neurologic findings certainly,there has been no testing to suggest that burke has objective residuals from what apparently were motor vehicle accidents in june and july,six years ago.
on september,the committee met to consider burke appeal,and determined that 
burke refusal to attend a second ime with barry was a violation of the ltd plan section d giving rise to a procedural ground for denial of benefits.the members found the ime request to be reasonable given the new medical reports and fce submitted by burke in support of her appeal,the dated nature of the prior ime,and the fact that the disability department had arranged transportation for burke to and from the ime,which was a reasonable distance from burke home.the committee further agreed that burke initial and current claim were not submitted within the ltd plan time limitations under section a,which provided another basis for the denial of the appeal.in addition to finding procedural grounds for the denial of ltd benefits,the committee felt denial was appropriate based on burke physical condition.the members were not persuaded by the evidence submitted by burke regarding her inability to work.the committee found barry ime to be more credible than the opinion of zwerin.the members were moved by the fact that burke physician,gypson,reported that she could perform activities of daily living with some limitations based on the various medical reports and other materials in the file,including the reports of barry and gypson,the committee found burke capable of performing light work,as defined by the department of labor.finally,the committee felt burke did not provide evidence sufficient to establish that her injuries were not subject to the ltd plan exclusion of disabilities caused by a injury.upon return to the workforce,the members found burke capable of earning at least per year of earnings in a sedentary,job given her education college degree in political science and work experience.
procedural history 
burke commenced this action on october.in it,she challenges the committee decision under erisa a b and.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.burke sought to admit certain documents that were part of her claim,to which the plan objected on the ground that they were not part of the administrative record.the district court granted the plan motion for summary judgment and denied burke motion,sustaining the plan evidentiary objection 
first,the district court held that the disputed evidence was not part of the administrative record because there was no evidence in the record that the documents at issue were before the committee at the time of its decision,and plaintiff never submitted the documents at issue for her current claim.as a result,it did not consider the evidence at issue.
second,the district court concluded that the committee did not act arbitrarily in relying on barry evaluation in finding that burke was not totally disabled.the district court also concluded that the committee decision had a reasonable factual basis,and given the highly deferential standard of review in this case,it concluded that the committee decision that plaintiff was not totally incapacitated and could enter the workforce has a reasonable factual basis and was within its discretionary authority.the district court further concluded,however,that the committee determination with respect to the level of earnings that plaintiff would be able to procure is an abuse of discretion as it appears to be based on mere conjecture rather than on a reasonable factfinding process,because it considered no vocational evidence.
finally,the district court granted the plan motion for summary judgment because of burke refusal to attend the scheduled,second ime,holding that the refusal provided an independent basis for the denial.the district court declined to consider the other procedural grounds for termination of benefits found by the committee.
burke filed a timely notice of appeal.
standard of review 
the supreme court has held that a denial of benefits is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d firestone tire.when a plan unambiguously gives the plan administrator discretion to determine eligibility or construe the plan terms,a deferential abuse of discretion standard is applicable.see abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc.the plan here unambiguously grants the committee the discretion to construe the plan terms.as a result,an abuse of discretion standard is appropriate.
as noted,the plan is administered by the committee and funded by the trust,which,in turn,is funded by contributions from pitney and pitney employees.the district court considered whether,based on this structure,the plan operated under a conflict of interest.relying on atwood newmont gold,cir,the district court held that there was no conflict of interest because burke failed to produce evidence that the fiduciary caused a breach of the administrator fiduciary obligations.quoting atwood,at.
subsequent to the district court decision,however,this circuit,sitting en banc,overruled atwood and created a new framework for applying the abuse of discretion standard,which was,of course,not applied by the district court.see abatie,at overruling atwood,and holding that a structural conflict of interest exists when an administrator acts as both the funding source and administrator of the plan that must be taken into account as a factor in determining whether an abuse of discretion occurred.
even more recently,the supreme court set forth a framework,similar to the one provided in abatie,in considering whether the dual role of administering and funding an erisa plan creates a conflict of interest,and if so,how that conflict should be considered in evaluating whether a plan administrator has abused its discretion.metropolitan life ins.glenn,d metlife.the court noted that i n determining the appropriate standard of review,a court should be guided by principles of trust law and that i f a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.id.at emphases in the original citing firestone tire,at.
the court further stated 
the answer is clear that there is a conflict of interest where it is the employer that both funds the plan and evaluates the claims.in such a circumstance,every dollar provided in benefits is a dollar spent by the employer and every dollar saved is a dollar in the employer pocket.the employer fiduciary interest may counsel in favor of granting a borderline claim while its immediate financial interest counsels to the contrary.thus,the employer has an interest conflicting with that of the beneficiaries,the type of conflict that judges must take into account when they review the discretionary acts of a trustee of a trust.
id.at quoting bruch firestone tire rubber,cir bruch restatement,comment d.the erisa ltd plan at issue in metlife,however,was an insurer administrated and funded plan.id.at.the court stated that the structural conflict is less clear where the plan administrator is not the employer itself but rather a professional insurance company,but nonetheless concluded that a conflict does exist in those circumstances.id.at.
having concluded that a conflict of interest existed where an insurer both funded and administered an erisa ltd plan,the court then discussed how that conflict should be considered in evaluating the insurer exercise of its discretion.the court noted that the abuse of discretion standard of review still applied despite the structural conflict of interest.id.the reviewing court,however,must 
take account of the conflict when determining whether the trustee,substantively or procedurally,has abused his discretion c onflicts are but one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account t he word factor implies,namely,that when judges review the lawfulness of benefit denials,they will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one in such instances,any one factor will act as a tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced,the degree of closeness necessary depending upon the tiebreaking factor inherent or importance.the conflict of interest at issue here,for example,should prove more important perhaps of great importance where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision,including,but not limited to,cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.it should prove less important perhaps to the vanishing point where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy,for example,by walling off claims administrators from those interested in firm finances,or by imposing management checks that penalize inaccurate decisionmaking irrespective of whom the inaccuracy benefits.

discussiona.consideration of the plan in light of metlife 
because the district court applied the now overruled atwood framework for evaluating structural conflicts of interest,and did not consider the plan in light of metlife and abatie,we must remand this case for further proceedings.in remanding,we note that the plan at issue here is unlike the plan at issue in metlife for a number of reasons that may be significant to the district court analysis.
first,and most significantly,the plan structural conflict is mitigated by the fact that benefits paid by pitney plan are paid out of the plan trust they are not paid directly by pitney,so that there is no direct financial impact on pitney resulting from the distribution of benefits there is some support for the proposition that there is no conflict of interest when plan benefits are paid out of a trust.see,post hartford ins,cir stating that when the employer both funds and administers the plan,but pays benefits out of a fully funded and segregated erisa trust fund rather than its operating budget,no structural conflict of interest is created gilley monsanto,cir stating that no conflict of interest exists where benefits are paid from a trust that is funded through periodic contributions so that the provider incurs no immediate expense as a result of paying benefits vitale latrobe area,cir holding that a heightened version of abuse of discretion standard was not applicable because plan benefits were paid out of a separate trust fund de nobel vitro,cir holding that there was no conflict of interest from an plan where plan funds were held in a trust because there is no direct and immediate expense to the employer from the payout of benefits.
in light of metlife,however,we disagree with those cases and hold that even when a plan benefits are paid out of a trust,a structural conflict of interest exists that must be considered as a factor in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion.we reach this conclusion because,even though benefits are not paid directly by pitney,pitney obviously still has a financial incentive to keep claims experience under the plan as low as less the trust pays out as benefits,the less pitney will ultimately need to contribute to the trust to maintain its solvency.thus,although the impact may be less direct,there is nonetheless a close relationship between benefits paid by the trust and the money pitney must provide from its general assets to fund the trust.
in discussing plans administered and funded directly by employers,the supreme court stated that every dollar provided in benefits is a dollar spent by the employer and every dollar saved is a dollar in the employer pocket.the employer fiduciary interest may counsel in favor of granting a borderline claim while its immediate financial interest counsels to the contrary.metlife.at quoting bruch,at.similarly,even when benefits are paid out of a trust,instead of directly by an employer,the employer has a financial incentive to deny claims because every dollar not paid in benefits is a dollar that will not need to be contributed to fund the trust.although this impact is indirect,and therefore a less significant conflict compared to plans with benefits paid directly by employers,a structural conflict of interest does exist.thus,the structural conflict of interest must be considered as a factor in evaluating whether the plan abused its discretion in terminating burke benefits.see abatie,at recognizing that structural conflicts of interest come in a variety of forms that should be weighed a
