meridian automotive systems and meridian automotive operations collectively meridian challenge the district court preliminary injunction restraining meridian from terminating the medical benefits of retirees of an plant in centralia,illinois,as well as the benefits of their spouses collectively retirees.because no one disputes the potential for serious irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction and because we agree that the retirees have established a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim,we affirm.
plaintiffs are a class of former employees of the centralia plant who retired from the plant after august.three different companies owned the centralia plant during the relevant periods of this dispute rockwell international corporation until august,cambridge industries from august to may,and meridian from may to the present.during this time,several agreements between the plant owners and the employees union purported to govern the health benefits for employees and retirees.
the supplemental agreement.in,rockwell and the international union united automobile,aerospace,and agricultural implement workers of america uaw entered into a supplemental agreement covering insurance benefits from july,to july.ja.the supplemental agreement stated 
the company shall contribute the full premium or subscription charge for health care coverages continued in accordance with article iii,section,for i a retired employee including any eligible dependents provided such retired employee is eligible for benefits under article ii of the company employees pension plan.
the health care coverages an employee has under this article at the time of retirement shall be continued thereafter provided that suitable arrangements for continuation can be made with the carrier s.
ja.the supplemental agreement similarly tied retirees spouses medical benefits to pension benefits.
the collective bargaining agreements.on behalf of its centralia chapter,the uaw signed three collective bargaining agreements with the companies,the first with rockwell from to,the second with cambridge from to,the third with cambridge from to.in each principal agreement,a section entitled pension plans,insurance programs stated the parties have provided for a pension plan and insurance programs by supplemental agreements signed by the parties simultaneously with the execution of this agreement,which are attached as the benefits proposal.ja.each main agreement came with an employee benefits proposal.the first employee benefits proposal was contained in a separate and simultaneously signed document,and the second and third proposals were contained within the principal agreements themselves.the employee benefits proposals were not complete plans in and of themselves but instead listed changes to plans already in existence at the time the new agreements were reached.
the craft letters.on september,and september,on the eves of the and agreements,cambridge and the uaw came to agreement s regarding pension integration and updating benefit plans.ja,bracketed language in version only.referred to by the parties as the craft letters,ja,these agreements provid ed direction and guidance to their respective employees and representatives involved in the development,implementation and documentation of employee pension and benefit plans.ja.both craft letters stated 
cambridge will amend if necessary and administer the pension plan,health care plan and all other employee benefit plans covering employees and retired former employees of cambridge to reflect iii application of rockwell master supplemental agreements as previously agreed between rockwell and the uaw reflected in past practice of rockwell with respect to centralia hourly employees,and iv all provisions of exhibit b to the national agreement between rockwell and the uaw,entitled supplemental agreement on health and insurance programs applicable to centralia hourly employees,unless and until the uaw and cambridge have agreed or hereafter agree to a different program,provision,or practice.
the summary plan descriptions.the companies distributed two relevant summary plan descriptions spds,one distributed by rockwell and dated october,the other distributed by cambridge and dated august.one section of each spd was entitled termination of coverage,cobra continuation,and conversion privilege,ja,and contained the following pertinent information.the spd listed several specific retirement benefits in this section under the heading of retirement.ja.and under the same heading,the spd said see the benefits for retirees section for details on benefits that continue during retirement.ja.under the heading miscellaneous termination of coverage provisions,each spd stated that a ll coverages described in this booklet will automatically end upon discontinuance of the bargaining agreement.ja.
in a separate section entitled benefits for retirees,each spd contained a heading addressing medical plan benefits,which explained that will continue to provide medical,prescription drug and hearing aid coverage to all employees who retire as determined by the employer,under the normal retirement,early retirement or disability provisions of the retirement plan for hourly rated employees of the centralia,il plant pension plan.ja.under the heading termination of coverage provisions,both spds said that i f the group benefits plan were discontinued,all coverages would then cancel.ja.
in a section entitled compliance with the employee retirement income security act of,the spd stated that t he group benefits plan is in compliance with the supplemental agreement benefits program between rockwell international and the international union,uaw and its local for hourly employees at centralia,illinois.ja.in the same section,the spd stated that t he group benefits plan is in compliance with the agreement between cambridge industries,and the international union,uaw and its centralia illinois,local.ja.in a separate heading of this section captioned plan continuance,both spds stated 
the plan may be amended at any time and in any manner by.while intends to continue the plan indefinitely,it reserves the right to terminate all or part of the plan at any time,and cancel all or part of the coverages and benefits under the plan.any such action would be taken only after careful consideration and subject to the provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
on may,cambridge sought bankruptcy protection under chapter and simultaneously sold the plant to meridian.meridian assumed cambridge duties under the collective bargaining agreement.meridian shut down the plant in july,but initially continued to honor the agreement.on september,however,meridian notified members of the plaintiff class of retirees and spouses that their medical benefits would terminate effective november,some two months after the last collective bargaining agreement expiration date.
on november,the retirees brought a complaint against meridian under of the labor management relations act,seeking damages and injunctive relief for breaches of the collective bargaining agreements,and under a b of the employee retirement income security act erisa,seeking to recover and to clarify their eligibility for benefits due under an employee welfare benefits plan.apparently without formal discovery,the parties filed briefs on the motion for preliminary injunction.after a hearing on january,the district court granted the retirees motion for a preliminary injunction on february,and ordered meridian to continue the benefits.the court concluded that the supplemental agreement paralleled the language of the collective bargaining agreement at issue in golden,cir,which held that equating eligibility for retiree health benefits with eligibility for a pension established a likelihood of success that the health benefits vested upon retirement,at.w hen this factor is combined with the certain irreparable harm that may be suffered by individual retirees during the pendency of this litigation,the district court reasoned,an injunction must issue.op.at.
courts consider four factors when deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction the claimant likelihood of success on the merits the risk of irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction the possibility of substantial harm to others and the public interest.see,golden,at gonzales bd.of med.exam rs,cir.meridian contests only the district court finding that the retirees established a likelihood of success on the merits.a decision receives review,which requires reversal only if the district court incorrectly applied the law or relied on clearly erroneous findings of fact.golden,at.
the parties agree that uaw local,cir,sets the analytical stage for resolving this dispute.under,parties to a collective bargaining agreement may contract for benefits that continue beyond the life of the agreement.id.at.basic principles of contract interpretation determine whether benefits survive the expiration of an agreement,which among other things means that courts should look to the explicit language of the collective bargaining agreement for clear manifestations of intent,should view each contract provision as part of the integrated whole and should construe terms so as to render none nugatory and avoid illusory promises.id.at.when ambiguities exist regarding these considerations,the court may examine extrinsic evidence of the parties intent.id.at see also uaw local bvr liquidating,cir.while recognized an inference that status benefits,including retiree benefits,continue as long as the status is maintained,it also noted that such benefits are not necessarily interminable and no federal labor policy establishes a presumption of vesting.id.at.
two cases help to illustrate how these principles have been applied in the context of retiree health benefits.in golden,we enjoined an employer from terminating retiree benefits because the agreement tied retiree medical benefits to vested pension benefits,which suggested that the parties meant to vest health benefits upon retirement as well,and because language in the spd and the conduct of the employer indicated that the health benefits vested upon retirement.at.in maurer joy technologies,cir,we held that the union was precluded from arguing that retirement benefits had vested because it failed to file a grievance when the employer distributed an spd containing an explicit reservation of rights allowing the employer to terminate coverage.id.at.
in applying these cases here,we can dispose of one point quickly.the language of the supplemental agreement is virtually identical to the agreement at issue in golden,in which this court held that benefits vested upon retirement.at.because the supplemental agreement ties eligibility for benefits to eligibility for a pension,in other words,there is little room for debate that the retirees health benefits vested upon retirement under least,that is,if we also conclude that the collective bargaining agreements incorporated the supplemental agreement.to that difficult question we now turn.
no one could confuse the agreements at issue with models of clear draftsmanship.and while the ambiguities in them permit argument until one is blue in the face,bidlack wheelabrator,cir,the district court correctly least at this stage of the the collective bargaining agreements incorporated the supplemental agreement.as an initial matter,the language of all three primary agreements supports this conclusion.the parties,all three agreements state,have provided for a pension plan and insurance programs by supplemental agreements signed by the parties simultaneously with the execution of this agreement,which are attached as the benefits proposal.ja.each attached employee benefits proposal in turn contains a list of adjustments that are incomplete and indeed incoherent without reference to an existing plan.meridian has failed to identify any other the supplemental provides the foundational coverage agreement upon which the employee benefits proposal builds.and based on our independent review of this record,we have been unable to identify any other agreement that suitably applies.
the craft september and september agreements that the district court found to be incorporated into the and collective support this conclusion.both letters refer to,and enforce,supplemental agreements between and the uaw,then refer to exhibit b of an agreement between rockwell and the uaw entitled supplemental agreement on health and insurance programs.ja.the beginning of the supplemental agreement between rockwell and the uaw reads 
supplemental agreement insurance program.
ja.this exhibit b supplemental agreement contains the golden language tying eligibility for health benefits to pension vesting and is the primary agreement upon which the retirees premise their claim.
the and spds further support this conclusion.see maurer,at describing spds as in addition to the collective bargaining agreement,but enforcing spd provisions after they were sufficiently distributed golden,stating that spds are extrinsic evidence of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.each spd states that will continue to provide medical,prescription drug and hearing aid coverage to all employees who retire as determined by the employer,under the normal retirement,early retirement or disability provisions of the retirement plan for hourly rated employees of the centralia,il plant pension plan.ja.in addition,the spd states the group benefits plan is in compliance with the supplemental agreement benefits program between rockwell international and the international union,uaw and its local for hourly employees at centralia,illinois,ja,which appears to incorporate the supplemental agreement upon which the retirees rely.true,the corresponding language in the spd refers only to the agreement between cambridge and the union.but that is not inconsistent with the continued incorporation of the supplemental agreement.the company distributed the first spd at the outset of the principal agreement,which as the district court found incorporated the supplemental agreement.by the time the company issued the spd,the agreement between the plant owner and employees already included the supplemental agreement,apparently giving the company no reason to mention the agreement by name.
in addition to these documents,other extrinsic evidence supports the district court ruling.see,bvr liquidating,at finding agreement ambiguous and examining extrinsic evidence including affidavits of negotiators.when wanda arnold,for example,retired from the plant on a disability pension in september,which was after meridian had announced the plant closing,a meridian personnel official told her she would have full benefits,except for vision,for life,ja.retiree marvin dannaman said that the personnel office told him and his wife that the one thing that would never be taken away from us was our medical insurance.ja.retiree lullabelle mccoy declared i specifically recall a personnel official telling me that my medical insurance was for life,because it was the primary reason that i took the job with rockwell.ja.three additional retirees made the same assertion regarding the personnel office characterization of retiree benefits.and charles webb,assistant director of uaw rockwell department,declared that t he supplemental agreement was understood to be incorporated into the agreement with certain specified modifications.ja.my understanding,he continued,was that the supplemental agreement provided for lifetime medical coverage for retirees and their spouses,which could not be taken away in the future by the employer.i believe that negotiators for rockwell had the same understanding of that agreement.id.
in response to all of this,meridian argues that maurer and other language in the,language in the spds suggesting that meridian had a right to terminate this case.in maurer,the union did not file a grievance against a widely distributed spd that contained a clause allowing the employer to terminate retiree benefits at any time.at.when the employer terminated retiree benefits two years after distributing the spd,we held that the union was precluded from arguing that the plaintiffs retirement benefits had vested.id.at.
noting that the retirees union never objected to the and
