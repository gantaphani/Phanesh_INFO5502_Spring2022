herman green brought this action pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,seeking to recover accrued interest on his disability benefits,which were delayed but eventually paid under his pension plan.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of,the trustees of the plan,the pension trust,and the plan itself.green now appeals that decision,arguing that the district court acted improperly in granting summary judgment on all of green claims.upon review,we conclude that green attempt to allege a cause of action for interest under erisa a b,a b,is clearly precluded by our decision in flint abb,cir and because green has not presented evidence that the appellees violated erisa or breached the terms of the pension plan in processing his disability claim,he is not entitled to interest pursuant to erisa a,a.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
the facts of green case are undisputed.green was employed as a coal miner with jim waters resources,in tuscaloosa,alabama.as an employee,green was offered employee benefits through the united mine workers of america pension trust the trust,an employee benefit trust included with a number of other trusts in the united mine workers of america health and retirement funds.the trust is administered by appellees holland,hudson,schaab,and hyler collectively,the trustees.the benefits that the trust provides to employees are set forth at length in the united mine workers of america pension plan of the plan,which is subject to erisa.
the plan provides a monthly disability benefit for employees who become totally disabled as a result of a mine accident.the plan states,in pertinent part,that a participant with a specified number of years of service who becomes totally disabled as a result of a mine accident shall be eligible for a pension while so disabled,exh.a at.the plan further provides a definition of totally disabled 
a participant shall be considered to be totally disabled only if by reason of such accident such participant is subsequently determined to be eligible for social security disability insurance ssdi benefits under title ii of the social security act or its successor.
id.thus,in order to be eligible for a disability pension benefit under the plan,a claimant must establish that he was involved in a mine accident that he has been awarded ssdi benefits,thus conclusively establishing that he has a disability and that the mine accident proximately caused,or was substantially responsible for,the disability.see,mccoy holland,cir construing the requirements needed to attain disability benefits under the plan.the plan provides that t he trustees shall have full and final determination as to all issues concerning eligibility for benefits,exh.a at.
the other relevant plan provision pertains to the timing of the monthly pension or otherwise.the plan states that t he first payment on any pension shall be made as soon as possible after an application for pension has been received,exh.a at.the plan also states that the first benefit payment shall be made for the month following the month in which the participant retires and becomes eligible for a pension in accordance with article ii the eligibility section of the plan id 
green filed an accident report with his employer in may of,indicating that he had been injured on the job on march,while operating a terex pan,a piece of heavy equipment.the accident report suggested that green suffered back strain as a result of the incident.green,however,did not seek disability benefits at that time.
over three years later,in october,green applied for ssdi benefits from the social security administration,claiming a disability due to a back strain from an injury.his ssdi application was denied in,and green sought reconsideration of that denial.meanwhile,while the appeal of his ssdi application was pending,in green applied for a disability pension with the trustees,pursuant to the terms of the plan.he maintained that his injury had occurred on march,and described the injurious event as a continuous bouncing up and down that had caused him back pain.in february,the trustees contacted green and inquired whether he had received an ssdi award.green advised that he was still awaiting a decision on his ssdi benefits.on july,the trustees denied his claim for disability benefits,based on the fact that he had not yet established that he was eligible for ssdi benefits,which is a prerequisite for total disability benefits under the plan.subsequent to the trustees denial,the separate denial of green ssdi benefits was upheld on appeal by an administrative law judge alj.
in november,however,the appeals council of the social security administration vacated the alj decision on the ssdi benefits and remanded green case,ordering that additional medical evidence,including psychiatric evidence,be obtained and considered.after a different alj reviewed green medical records,he concluded that green suffered from chronic back pain from an injury that had occurred in.accordingly,on may,the alj found that green was disabled as of the time green began to complain of pain,and,eventually,ceased working due to degenerative disc disease of the lumbar and cervical spine,hiatial hernia,duodenal ulcer,and adjustment disorder with depression.therefore,on may,the alj awarded green ssdi benefits.
a year later,on may,the trustees received a copy of green ssdi award,and thus green file was reopened.upon further review,however,the trustees again denied green application for a disability pension,based this time on their conclusion that the evidence concerning the alleged march,incident was too indefinite to meet the plan definition of a mine accident.
in their assessment of green claim,the trustees first observed that the accident report only stated that green had suffered back strain while operating a terex pan,but that the records failed to reflect a definite injurious event that caused his disability.the trustees also noted that green did not seek medical treatment for the putative injury until may of,three months after the alleged incident,and that he had continued to operate heavy equipment at that time.in addition,the trustees observed that green medical records reflected intermittent complaints of back pain every six months or so,without any additional trauma.in light of this evidence,the trustees determined that green hiatial hernia and duodenal ulcers bore no causal relationship to the alleged mine accident that his degenerative disc disease was a progressive condition rather than an injurious event and that his cervical problems were likely brought about by a separate automobile accident and were not.
after explaining the basis for the trustees denial,green requested,and was granted,an extension of time to submit additional evidence concerning his mine accident.upon a second review,however,the trustees again denied green claim in april,based on their conclusion that his alleged injury was too indefinite,both in terms of when the claimed injury occurred and what the event was.
thereafter,litigation ensued.green sued the trustees in state court in,alleging the wrongful denial of his disability pension benefit.in february,the trustees advised green that if he would agree to dismiss his action,they would permit him to submit additional medical evidence and would agree to his claim for total disability pension benefits.consequently,the case was dismissed,and green submitted additional evidence to the trustees in july,concerning the nature of his injury,including his testimony that the injury on march,had been caused instantly from hitting a bump while he was driving mining equipment.additional evidence was submitted in march,and a hearing was held on green application on march.
in april,after the record in its entirety,including green newly submitted evidence,the trustees concluded that green incident did indeed meet the definition of a mine accident under the plan.specifically,the trustees concluded that the new evidence established that green had been injured by a definite,injurious event.they found credible a written statement from green,indicating that green had complained aloud of back pain after his equipment had hit a pothole.the trustees also observed that green new evidence suggested that the equipment he had been driving was repaired around the time he was injured,thereby suggesting that its shock absorbers may have been in a damaged or defective condition when the machine hit the pothole.
after conclusively determining that the incident was a bona fide mine accident for purposes of the plan,the trustees conducted an additional investigation to determine if the accident had contributed substantially to green disability,which commenced in late.after that investigation,the trustees notified green in november of,that his application for a disability pension benefit had been approved.the effective date of the pension was january,and the trustees remitted a check to green for all monthly pension payments from the effective date of january,up through december.green was also advised by the trustees that he would henceforth receive future monthly disability payments at the start of each month.
after receiving his lump sum payment reflecting eight years worth of pension benefits,green inquired as to whether he was entitled to interest on the amount that the trustees had paid retroactively.the trustees advised that green was not entitled to interest on the retroactive payment,because there was no provision in the plan allowing for such interest.
after receiving the trustees response,in june,green brought the present action,pursuant to erisa a,a,in the northern district of alabama,naming as defendants the trustees,the trust,and the erisa plan hereinafter,collectively,the trustees.green complaint sought interest on the benefits that had been retroactively paid out of the trust.his action was brought on behalf of himself and all persons similarly situated who had received retroactive benefit payments under the plan but had not received any interest on those payments.after a period of discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.
in a and thorough opinion,the district court granted summary judgment for the trustees on all of green claims.the district court found that green could not recover interest under erisa a b,a b,because our holding in flint precluded a claimant from bringing an independent claim for interest under erisa a b unless the plan,by its own terms,provided for interest.the district court also found that green could not recover interest by construing it as other equitable relief pursuant to erisa a,a,since the trustees conduct did not amount to either a violation of erisa or a breach of the plan terms.because there were no disputed issues of material fact and green erisa claims failed as a matter of law,the district court granted summary judgment to the trustees.in doing so,the court concluded that green motion for class certification was moot.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,green contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the trustees.in the context of an erisa action we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard that controlled the district court determination.williams bellsouth,cir.under that standard,summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
green argument on appeal is essentially.first,he contends that he is entitled to bring a cause of action for interest on his delayed pension payment under erisa a b,a b,since interest is an implied benefit under the terms of the plan.second,and as an alternative theory,green argues that he is entitled to sue to recover interest on his benefit payment pursuant to erisa a,a,since interest falls within the rubric of other appropriate equitable relief.we address each of these contentions in turn.
green claim for interest under erisa a b 
section a b of erisa,a b,permits a participant or beneficiary of a pension plan to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.green contends that the accrued interest on his delayed benefits constitutes a separate benefit due to him under the terms of his plan,see,and that therefore he should be permitted to recover interest under erisa a b.the trustees counter that the plan documents do not expressly provide for a payment of interest,and that a b,by its language,only permits a claimant to obtain benefits that are provided under the terms of the plan.id.emphasis added.although green concedes that the plan makes no explicit mention of accrued interest in its description of the plan benefits,he argues that we should construe interest as an implied term of the plan.see,dobson hartford fin.servs.group,cir finding that a pension plan implicitly calls for interest on disability payments,and concluding that,because interest is an implied benefit under the plan,a claimant may seek to recover interest pursuant to erisa a b.
we are reluctant,however,to imply benefits into the terms of an employer pension plan where such benefits are not expressly designated.moreover,as the trustees properly point out,our decision in flint,at,in which we held that a claimant could not bring an independent action to recover interest under a b where the pension plan did not expressly provide for interest,clearly precludes green from bringing the present action.
in flint,a claimant who was awarded retroactive disability benefits from his a lump sum brought an action in federal court pursuant to erisa a,seeking to recover interest on the retroactive benefits.id.at.as in this case,in flint the pension plan documents were silent regarding the payment of accrued interest on delayed benefits nevertheless,the claimant argued that,as a default rule,interest should normally be recoverable,even if the plan documents did not expressly address the issue.id.at.we rejected this contention,concluding that,where an plan failed to expressly provide for accrued interest as a plan benefit,erisa a b would not permit a claimant to bring a cause of action to recover such interest.id.at our approach in flint was congruent with the earlier decision of the seventh circuit in clair harris trust savings bank,in which that court rejected a claimant independent action for accrued interest on delayed benefits under erisa a b.see,cir i nterest is not a benefit specified anywhere in the plan,and only benefits specified in the plan can be recovered in a suit under a b.posner.
flint is binding precedent in this circuit and it is plainly controlling in green case.as in flint,green seeks to bring a action for accrued interest on benefits that were delayed but eventually paid out in a retroactive,lump sum payment,despite the fact that the pension plan at issue fails to provide for interest as a benefit.because a cause of action under a b is limited to those claimants seeking to recover benefits due to them under the terms of the plan,and because flint makes clear that an independent cause of action for interest will not lie under a b when the pension plan fails to provide for such interest as a benefit,the district court acted properly in concluding that green a b claim failed as a matter of law.
green claim for interest under erisa a 
green alternative approach to pursuing interest on his retroactive disability benefits is erisa a,a.that subsection provides for a cause of action 
by a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress violations of erisa or ii to enforce any provisions of erisa or the terms of the plan.
id.thus,under the plain language of a,the relief sought must be equitable in nature,and the claim for relief must be predicated on either a violation of erisa or the enforcement of a plan provision or an erisa provision.
green contends that his cause of action for interest on his delayed benefits constitutes other appropriate equitable relief and that therefore it is permissible under erisa a.he also argues that he has successfully established violations of both erisa and the plan,such that his action should be permitted to go forward.the district court found that,even assuming that green action for interest could be said to fall under the rubric equitable relief,green had not identified a violation of either erisa or the plan.thus,the court properly concluded that green claim failed as a matter of law,regardless of whether the interest green sought constituted appropriate equitable relief.a.green now appeals that decision.
we first address green contention that his action for interest on his delayed disability benefit is a claim for other appropriate equitable relief within the meaning of a.the supreme court defined the scope of relief that is available under a in knudson and sereboff.knudson involved an action by an insurance company against an injured driver who was protected by an employee benefit plan.knudson,at.at.after the injured driver recovered tort damages from a third party tortfeasor,the plan insurer sued the plan participant,seeking reimbursement for monies that it had paid out to her for her medical expenses pursuant to the plan.id.the insurer action was brought under erisa a the insurer argued that the plan participant failure to reimburse it constituted a violation of the plan terms,and that its claim was equitable in nature,in that it involved both an injunction and a claim for restitution.id.at.at.
the supreme court disagreed,and affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant,based on its conclusion that the insurer action was not equitable in nature,as it was essentially a claim to compel the defendant to pay a sum of is,a traditional suit at law for damages.id.at.at.the knudson court also rejected the insurer attempt to characterize the erisa reimbursement action as one of equitable restitution.id.at.at.the court drew a distinction between legal restitution a judgment imposing merely personal liability upon a defendant to pay a sum of money and equitable action in which the plaintiff seeks to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant possession through the imposition of a constructive trust or an equitable lien.id.at.at quotations omitted.knudson made clear that the latter type of action could be alleged under a,as it was truly equitable,but that the former type of action could not.applying that rule to the facts of knudson,the court concluded that the sought funds that were no longer in the defendant possession,but had instead been placed into a special needs trust,id.at.at,and that therefore its action was closer to a claim at essence,seeking to impos e merely personal liability upon a defendant to pay a sum of money such that it was not permissible under a.id.at.at.
in sereboff,the supreme court clarified the scope of knudson by permitting a plaintiff to sue under a to enforce a reimbursement provision in a benefit plan on a theory of equitable restitution.like knudson,sereboff involved a claim by a plan administrator to obtain reimbursement for medical expenses that had been paid out to the plan beneficiary by a third party tortfeasor.however,in sereboff,the court emphasized that the funds had been specifically identified via the third party recovery provision of the plan itself that the funds were still in the defendant possession and that it was undisputed that the plaintiff was entitled to them under the plan terms.at.the court thus observed that the restitution action at issue involved a constructive trust or equitable lien on a specifically identified fund,and that therefore it was distinguishable from the type of claim lodged in knudson.sereboff reiterated the rule that a suit to recover a specific,identifiable asset in the possession of a defendant would constitute a valid equitable restitution claim,and that therefore such a claim would be permissible under erisa a.id.
undoubtedly mindful of these two decisions construing a,green frames his present action for interest on his retroactive disability payment as being in the nature of equitable restitution and disgorgement of profits.at.as such,he argues that his claim for accrued interest is in the nature of other appropriate equitable relief.we need not decide that question,however because it is clear that green has failed to present evidence of either an erisa violation or a plan violation on the part of the trustees,which is a prerequisite to pursuing an action for equitable relief under the plain language of a 
breach of the plan terms 
first,there is no evidence of any violation of the terms of the plan on the part of the trustees.green alleges that the trustees breached the plan terms because they failed to pay him disability benefits when he was eligible for them.he argues that he became eligible for the benefits at the moment he was totally is,in that,under the plan terms,he was entitled to monthly disability payments from that time forward.he contends that the failure to pay out benefits immediately after the month he became eligible constitutes a breach of the plan,such that his a action is proper.
we disagree.as the trustees have pointed out,under erisa own provisions they are prohibited from paying benefits to a claimant who has not demonstrated an entitlement to such benefits.that is,the trustees payment of benefits hinges on their subsequent determination that a benefits claimant is eligible,irrespective of green interpretation as to when he was actually eligible.here,the trustees diligently and in good faith undertook to determine green eligibility for disability benefits,and,upon determining that he was eligible,paid benefits retroactively to january,as required by the plan.green allegation of a plan violation is unavailing.
indeed,according to the plan express terms,only an employee who is totally disabled as a result of a mine accident is eligible for a pension,and such an employee will be considered to be totally disabled only if by reason of such accident such participant is subsequently determined to be eligible for social security disability insurance ssdi benefits,exh.a at emphasis added.moreover,after this preliminary threshold is met,the claimant must also establish is,that the mine accident proximately caused,or was substantially responsible for,the resulting disability.see,mccoy,at.the plan own terms make clear that a person is not eligible for disability benefits unless they are totally disabled,and,moreover,that a person is not totally disabled under the plan unless and until they have been determined to be eligible for ssdi benefits and have established the requisite causal connection between the accident and the disability.the plan further states,in pertinent part,that a claimant is entitled to a monthly payment in the month following the month in which the participant becomes eligible for a pension in accordance with the eligibility provisions of the plan,exh.a at.
in light of the plan language,green award of ssdi benefits in eight years after his accident would have been the instigating factor in assessing whether he was totally disabled and thus eligible for a pension under the plan.that would not have ended the inquiry,however,for,under the plan own terms,the trustees would also have had to assess the issue of is,whether green was totally disabled as a result of a mine accident,see id.at process which,based on the evidence,they undertook carefully and thoroughly.when the trustees paid out benefits,they paid them retroactively to january,which was the month following the month in which green had first become eligible december.see id.at.we find that the trustees acted in accordance with the terms of the plan in assessing green disability claim.because there is no evidence that they violated the plan green can not justify his claim for equitable relief under erisa a on this basis.
alleged breach of erisa 
nor has green presented any evidence that the trustees breached erisa in delaying his disability benefit,in processing his benefit,or in paying his claim without accrued interest.green argues that the payment of his disability award without any interest constituted a decrease or a forfeiture of an accrued benefit via a plan amendment,in violation of erisa g,g.that provision,known as the rule,is intended to prevent employers from pulling the rug
