this appeal requires us to interpret three different provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa the requirement in a that all assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust by one or more trustees,sometimes called the hold in trust requirement the prohibition against fiduciary under and the summary annual report requirement under.b a 
this case arises out of a disability benefits dispute between david barboza,a retired firefighter for the city of tracy,california,and the california association of professional firefighters capf,the manager of an employee welfare benefit plan.barboza initially filed an action against capf and other in march,alleging that capf had withheld certain disability benefits to which barboza was entitled while that related action was ongoing,barboza initiated a second lawsuit the action on appeal here in october against capf,california administration insurance services,caisi,and individual members of the board of directors for both capf and caisi collectively,the defendants.this time,barboza alleged that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties under erisa in a number of different ways.barboza and the defendants filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court order on these cross motions is now before us on appeal.
an explanation of capf,caisi,and the underlying employee welfare benefits plan is necessary to understand barboza erisa claims.
according to its corporate bylaws,capf is a mutual benefit corporation.it was incorporated at the behest of v arious unions and other profit and mutual benefit associations for the purpose of providing disability benefits to participating employee members and their beneficiaries from the various fire departments around california.capf accomplishes this goal through its management of a disability plan plan,established by a document entitled the capf long term disability plan the plan instrument.
the parties do not dispute that the plan is an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa,see a,which receives its funding exclusively from plan participants and pays all benefits solely from plan assets.under the terms of the plan instrument,all funds,property,and additional assets held by the plan are maintained exclusively in the name of capf for the benefit of the participants.capf manages the assets of the plan through its board of directors,and supervises the payment of benefits to plan members made pursuant to the terms of the plan instrument.the plan instrument provides that the plan will be administered on a basis by a qualified third party administrator pursuant to an administrative services agreement that is consistent with the terms of the plan instrument and is approved by capf board of directors.pursuant to this provision,the plan employs the california administration insurance services,caisi to act as the plan administrator under capf supervision.
the plan functions as follows.first,each participant makes a monthly contribution to the plan in an amount established by the board of directors of capf.these contributions are deposited into a wells fargo bank checking account,for which officers of caisi are the signatories.when a plan participant suffers total disability from an injury,sickness,or pregnancy,the participant submits evidence of this disability to caisi,which then determines whether the participant is eligible to receive benefits under the criteria provided by the plan instrument.if the participant is eligible,caisi issues a check drawn on the wells fargo account for the appropriate amount.
in addition to paying benefits to eligible participants,caisi also pays plan expenses from the wells fargo account,including its own administrative service fees.caisi gives capf quarterly financial statements itemizing the plan fees and expenses.
barboza alleges that the defendants violated erisa through numerous breaches of their fiduciary duties in their management and administration of the plan.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motion on barboza claims that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to hold plan assets in trust,and by allowing caisi to pay its own fees from the wells fargo account.the district court granted barboza summary judgment motion on his claim that defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to distribute a summary annual report to plan participants.the parties subsequently brought this appeal and corresponding cross appeal.
we have jurisdiction under.we review a district court decision on cross motions for summary judgment de novo.see guatay christian fellowship cnty.of san diego,cir.we must determine,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine disputes of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.
we first consider barboza claim that the defendants violated erisa requirement.erisa requires that,subject to exceptions not relevant here,all assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust by one or more trustees.a.such trustee or trustees shall be either named in the trust instrument or in the plan instrument or appointed by a person who is a named fiduciary.id.the trustee or trustees shall have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of the plan.id.the applicable regulations echo the statute,stating that with an exception not applicable here,all assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust by one or more trustees pursuant to a written trust instrument.a a.neither erisa nor the regulations define the terms trust,trustee,or trust instrument.
in the absence of any statutory or regulatory definition of these terms,we apply the familiar maxim that a statutory term is generally presumed to have its meaning,evans united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.this maxim has particular force in the erisa context,because the supreme court has held that congress invoked the common law of trusts to define the general scope of fiduciary duties when it drafted the statute.varity howe,d quoting cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund cent,d.our analysis therefore both starts and ends with the ordinary meaning of the terms trust and trustee,as provided by the common law of trusts.see united states lazarenko,cir.
the common law of trusts has its roots in medieval england and the ancestor of the trust,the land conveyance device termed the use.see amy hess,george bogert george bogert,the law of trusts trustees ed hereinafter hess et,trusts trustees.the use was first employed to give gifts of property to religious friars whose vows prohibited them from owning property themselves,but by the beginning of the fifteenth century,it was the leading means of land conveyance.see also william mcgovern,sheldon kurtz david english,wills,trusts estates ed hereinafter mcgovern et,wills,trusts estates.in its simplest form,the use was a legal relationship by which one party,called the feoffee to uses,agreed to accept and hold legal title to property on behalf and for the use of the beneficiary party,called the cestui que use.see hess et,trusts trustees mcgovern et.al,wills,trusts estates at.although king henry viii attempted to abolish this practice through the passage of the statute of uses in,the statute left unaffected a number of uses,including a use by which the feoffee to uses the modern day trustee took on active administrative duties when it agreed to hold the property on behalf of the cestui que use the modern day beneficiary.hess et,trusts trustees.the uses that survived the statute of uses became known as trusts and were legally enforceable in courts of equity in england and,later,in the united states.id.see also davis united states,d holding that the statutory phrase for the use of suggested a trust relationship because f rom the dawn of english common law through the present,the word use has been employed to refer to various forms of trust arrangements.
as this legal relationship became more pervasive in both england and its american colonies and later the united states in the eightee
