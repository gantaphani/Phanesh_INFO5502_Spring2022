dale ogden appeals the district court grant of the summary judgment motion of cooperative benefit administrators,cba,enforcing terms of an disability plan against her and dismissing her counterclaim for benefits.ogden also appeals the district court denial of her motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to join her daughters as indispensable parties,as well as the court denial of her motion for partial summary judgment.for the following reasons,we reverse the district court denial of ogden motion to dismiss,albeit not on jurisdictional grounds we render a judgment of dismissal,but for failure to state a claim in federal common law and we affirm the district court dismissal of ogden counterclaim for benefits.
facts and proceedings 
the national rural electric cooperative association nreca is a trade association for more than rural electric cooperatives throughout the united states.cba is the claims adjudicator for nreca group benefits program,a benefits plan sponsored by nreca for its member cooperatives.this program consists of five welfare benefits plans,including a disability benefits plan the plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa as claims adjudicator for the program,cba is also an erisa fiduciary as defined by a ogden is a former employee of cajun electric power cooperative,one of nreca member cooperatives,and was a participant in the plan at all relevant times.after sustaining related injuries that rendered her totally disabled,ogden filed a claim in april seeking disability benefits under the plan.within three weeks,cba approved her request and began paying ogden the full amount of her benefits under the plan.
the plan documents contain a benefit offset provision that allows cba,as plan fiduciary,to estimate the amount of benefits a participant is eligible to receive from sources outside the plan and to offset the combined amount of these outside benefits from the amount that the participant is entitled to receive under the plan.benefits from outside sources that were subject to offset included any payments from other sources whether the payment is made to,or on behalf of,the participant,the participant spouse or any dependent of the participant.as there is often a substantial delay between the time that a participant becomes eligible for outside benefits and the time that such benefits are actually paid to the participant,the plan also gives cba the option of advancing to a participant the full amount of his plan benefits,without offset,conditioned on the participant agreeing to reimburse the plan the amount of the advances attributable to eventual receipts of outside benefits.to reinforce a participant reimbursement obligation,the plan requires him to sign a reimbursement agreement agreement,the terms of which are stated in the plan documents,obligating the participant both to cooperate with cba in pursuing benefits from outside sources and to reimburse the plan the amount of the advances within days following receipt of any benefits from outside sources.the agreement specifies that,if the participant fails to repay the plan within thirty days for amounts previously advanced,the participant is liable to the plan for the full amount of the advances,plus interest and any costs or attorney fees incurred by cba in enforcing the agreement.if a participant refuses to reimburse the plan in accordance with the provisions of the agreement,cba is authorized by the plan to reduce setoff reimbursements owed to it by the participant against future monthly benefits as they become due.
in june,cba learned that ogden and her two dependent daughters had become eligible to receive social security disability benefits,which,as we have noted,are among the types of outside benefits that are subject to the plan offset provisions consequently,cba informed ogden that it would begin offsetting the estimated amount of her and her daughters anticipated social security disability benefits against her monthly benefits under the plan,unless she agreed to provide cba with a copy of her social security application and sign a reimbursement agreement as required by the plan.ogden opted to sign the agreement and continue to receive the full amount of her benefits without offset.in the agreement,ogden promised 
t o repay cba the amounts advanced to her in accordance with the offset provisions of the ltd plan and this reimbursement agreement within days of her receipt of the proceeds of any benefits,awards,or payments recovered from social security the repayment will not exceed the amount of the benefits,awards,or payments recovered from social security,except that it shall include interests,costs,and attorney fees as provided in this ra.
in october,cba informed ogden that she had become eligible to receive her retirement pension and that her total monthly benefits under the plan would be offset by,the full amount of her monthly pension payments.thus,her total monthly benefits from the plan were reduced from to,starting with her november payment.
initially,the social security administration ssa denied ogden claim.cba subsequently offered to hire allsup,to pursue the claim on ogden behalf.ogden accepted this offer,and cba paid all expenses related to allsup,representation.the ssa finally approved ogden claim for disability benefits in october,more than two years after she had submitted her application.shortly thereafter,the ssa issued ogden a notice of award,stating that she was entitled to monthly social security disability benefits of,starting the following month,plus a payment of for retroactive disability payments for the period april through october.the ssa also informed ogden that her two daughters,both of whom had attained majority after ogden application was filed and were thus no longer her dependents,would each receive payments totaling for the same period.
the present controversy arose when,after receiving her social security award,ogden refused to reimburse the plan to cover advances that she owed under the terms of the plan and the agreement.although cba began suspending ogden benefits in december through the exercise of its setoff rights,it continued to seek reimbursement from ogden from her award.in april,after several attempts to obtain reimbursement failed,cba filed suit in district court for in benefit overpayments.because ogden daughters had not,at that time,received their social security awards,cba based its demand on the amount of ogden award and the estimated amount of her daughters anticipated awards,plus interest at eight percent,interest,and attorney fees and costs.
in july,the ssa paid ogden two major daughters lump sums of and,respectively.cba subsequently amended its complaint to state a demand for,an amount that reflected both the sums it had recouped from ogden since december as a result of its suspension of her plan benefits under the setoff provision and the sums her daughters had actually received.cba premised subject matter jurisdiction on two separate grounds erisa a which authorizes a plan fiduciary to bring a civil action for equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan,and the federal common law of unjust enrichment as applied to erisa.
ogden answered the complaint and counterclaimed for back benefits allegedly owed to her from may to date,plus attorney fees and costs.she then filed a motion to dismiss cba complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that cba had failed to state a statutory claim for equitable relief under a and that federal common law could not be invoked to provide cba with a remedy.that motion also included an alternative rule b motion to dismiss cba complaint for failure to join her daughters as indispensable parties under rule 
while these motions were still pending,ogden filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the merits of cba claims,asserting,inter alia,that she could not be held liable under the terms of the agreement for the social security awards received by her daughters,as they were no longer her dependents when they received those awards.specifically,ogden requested that the district court dismiss cba reimbursement action on the merits,declare that cba erred in offsetting her plan benefits by the amount of her retirement pension,and declare that cba had accepted her alleged offer to pay the amount she owed to the plan through setoff of her plan benefits.cba then filed a for summary judgment on the merits of its claims and on ogden counterclaim for benefits.
in january,after both sides had filed their dispositive motions,the supreme court issued its decision in life annuity insurance knudson,which further defined the scope of a equitable relief provision subsequently,the parties filed supplemental memoranda addressing knudson impact on cba reimbursement claim.
in march,the district court heard oral argument on ogden motions to dismiss and for partial summary judgment,as well as on cba for summary judgment.during the course of the proceedings,cba conceded that it had failed to state a viable claim for equitable relief under a,after which the district court dismissed that claim.the court ruled,however,that the dismissal of cba statutory claim did not preclude the exercise of federal question jurisdiction under,theorizing that cba had a right to assert a federal common law claim grounded in unjust enrichment 
the district court then denied ogden rule b motion,reasoning that,unlike their mother,ogden daughters were not contractually bound by the agreement to repay the amounts advanced to ogden by the plan and thus were not indispensable parties to the suit.finally,the district court denied ogden motion for partial summary judgment and granted cba for summary judgment,concluding that ogden had failed to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding cba unjust enrichment claim and that her counterclaim was barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
the district court entered judgment against ogden for,plus attorney fees,costs,and interest at the rate of eight percent per annum,compounded annually,from the date on which ogden and her daughters had received their social security disability benefits.it is from this judgment that ogden timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo both a denial of a motion to dismiss and a grant of a motion for summary judgment 
cba federal common law claim 
as noted,cba complaint alleged two alternative bases for jurisdiction a statutory claim for equitable relief under a,and a federal common law claim of unjust enrichment.as cba conceded that it could not maintain its claim for equitable relief under a,we need not address it except to note that,in seeking to impose personal liability on ogden to enforce her contractual reimbursement obligation under the ltd plan and the reimbursement agreement,cba was requesting precisely the kind of legal remedy that the supreme court has held to be beyond a jurisdictional grant 
as the district court correctly ruled,however,cba failure to state a statutory cause of action under erisa does not bar federal subject matter jurisdiction over its unjust enrichment claim under federal common law.indeed,the supreme court has made clear that federal question jurisdiction may exist over claims arising under federal common law nevertheless,simply because federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over cba action to determine the existence of a federal common law remedy of unjust enrichment on cba behalf does not mean that cba has successfully stated a federal common law cause of action for unjust enrichment in cases such as this,for which congress has empowered the judiciary to create federal common law pursuant to federal legislation,the ability of a plaintiff to state a federal common law cause of action depends on the existence of a gap in the text of that legislation that allows for the creation of the federal common law remedy sought by the plaintiff 
our holding in frank bear stearns to the effect that federal question jurisdiction did not exist because the plaintiff complaint did not state a claim under federal common law is not to the contrary in the instant case,our power to create federal common law is premised on congressional authorization to fill interstitial gaps in the text of federal legislation,here,erisa.accordingly,we have jurisdiction over the action to construe that legislation to determine the existence of a federal common law cause of action on cba behalf.by contrast,the issue in frank was whether the plaintiff state law claims implicated federal common law issues because their resolution required interpretation of a federal contract thus,in frank we did not have congressional authorization to make substantive rules pursuant to a federal statute,and we could exercise federal question jurisdiction over the action only if we found that the action fell within the narrow class of cases where federal rules are necessary to protect uniquely federal interests.as the action did not fall within that narrow class of cases,we concluded that federal common law did not exist in the case,and thus there was no basis for federal question jurisdiction 
more to the point of today inquiry,we have held that federal common law may be applied to fill minor gaps in erisa text,as long as the federal common law rule created is compatible with erisa policies.in so holding,however,we cautioned that the power of the judiciary to develop federal common law pursuant to erisa does not give carte blanche power to rewrite the legislation to satisfy our proclivities.thus,federal courts do not have authority under erisa to create federal common law when that statute specifically and clearly addresses the issue before th e court.this is so because,in such instances,the legislative scheme does not contain a gap that requires filling by application of federal common law.thus,a court general opinion as to what remedies might further erisa underlying policies will not be sufficient to overcome the words of its text regarding the specific issue under consideration.
although we have not previously recognized a federal common law right of unjust enrichment or restitution in the context of an erisa fiduciary efforts to obtain reimbursement of funds paid to a participant,cba argues that such a right comports with erisa goal of enforcement of plan terms and is necessary to provide cba with relief in the absence of equivalent statutory or state law remedies ogden counters that the supreme court,in both mertens hewitt associates and knudson,interpreted a appropriate equitable relief language to proscribe precisely the type of monetary legal cba requests.as such,argues ogden,the district court did not have authority to grant cba a federal common law right that would,in effect,allow it to circumvent the plain language of erisa text,to do indirectly that which under erisa it can not do directly.
as our discussion indicates,cba entitlement to a federal common law remedy is dependent on our determining that a gap exists in erisa text regarding cba right,as a plan fiduciary,to bring an action for a money judgment enforcing a participant contractual reimbursement obligation.as we shall show,erisa civil enforcement provision specifically and clearly addresses this issue,thereby eschewing any possibility that a gap exists in the statutory text that would permit us to employ federal common law to create the remedy that cba seeks.
to reach that determination,we need only examine the text of a in light of the supreme court decisions in mertens and knudson.section a arms plan fiduciaries with a cause of action to obtain appropriate equitable relief to redress any act in violation of erisa or the terms of the plan or to enforce erisa provisions or the terms of the plan in mertens,the supreme court interpreted a appropriate equitable relief language to include only those categories of relief that were typically available in equity,reasoning that a contrary,one that would allow a plaintiff to bring an action for monetary damages,the classic form of legal relief,would limit the relief not at all and render the modifier equitable superfluous.although the mertens plaintiffs did not,as cba does here,ask the court to recognize a federal common law cause of action in unjust enrichment,the court,in rejecting their proposed construction of a,did admonish the plaintiffs that t he authority of courts to develop a federal common law under erisa is not the authority to revise the text of the statute.
in knudson,the supreme court revisited the boundaries of equitable relief under a and again carefully emphasized that congress use of the word equitable was not inadvertent,but rather was a deliberate act on its part to limit a a plaintiff remedies to those that were traditionally considered equitable in nature for an action to lie in equity,the court stated,an erisa plaintiff must seek not to impose personal liability on the defendant,but to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant possession.the knudson court was singularly unimpressed by the erisa plan concerns that limiting a actions to include only those remedies typically available in equity would deprive the plan of any remedy and create a result contrary to a primary purpose of erisa,namely,the enforcement of the terms of a plan.to this end,the court noted that,e ven assuming that petitioners are correct about the of previously available actions or the lack of other means to obtain relief,vague notions of a statute basic purpose are nonetheless inadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding the specific issue under consideration.
looking at erisa civil enforcement provision as a whole,the court in knudson observed 
in the very same section of erisa as a,congress authorized a participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,without reference to whether the relief sought is legal or equitable.but congress did not extend the same authorization to fiduciaries.rather,a,by its terms,only allows for equitable relief.we will not attempt to adjust the carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme embodied in the text that congress has adopted 
as the plan clearly sought to impose personal liability on the beneficiary to enforce her contractual reimbursement obligation under the plan,the court held that the plan action was legal in nature and outside the scope of equitable relief permitted by a 
in the wake of mertens and knudson,we have twice interpreted a in the context of a plan suit for reimbursement from a beneficiary.in bauhaus,copeland,we reversed the district court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over the plan claim,noting that the funds sought by the plan were not within the participant possession and control more recently,in bombardier aerospace employee welfare benefits plan ferrer,poirot and wansbrough,we affirmed the district court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the participant had constructive possession over the funds sought by the plan in each case,we stressed that,for a plan fiduciary action to fall within a jurisdictional grant,it must seek recovery of specifically identifiable funds,that belong in good conscience to the plan,and that are within the possession and control of the 
as mertens and knudson demonstrate,congress,in drafting a b to allow only equitable relief,specifically contemplated the possibility of extending to plan fiduciaries a right to sue a participant for money damages and chose instead to limit fiduciaries remedies to those typically available in equity.as erisa text specifically and clearly addresses the issue whether cba,as a plan fiduciary,has a right to pursue a claim for legal relief against ogden,there is no gap in erisa on this question and thus no basis for granting cba a federal common law remedy.we therefore can not sanction the district court decision to grant cba a federal common law right to pursue its claim for money damages against ogden.
cba nevertheless argues that knudson statement that there may have been other means for petitioners to obtain the essentially legal relief that they seek can be construed as either an endorsement of a federal common law remedy or at least an intimation that its holding did not foreclose the possibility that a federal common law remedy might exist we are unpersuaded.aside from obviously being dicta,this statement was made only to highlight the court point,discussed above,that the availability vel non of other remedies to the plan was irrelevant to the court decision to deny the plan claim for legal relief because that type of relief was expressly proscribed by erisa text thus,we do not read this statement as an invitation to the lower courts to grant plan fiduciaries a federal common law right to pursue claims for legal remedies against participants.
we are equally unconvinced by cba suggestion that mertens and knudson are somehow inapposite because the plaintiffs in those cases did not seek a federal common law remedy.to reach the decision we make today,we need only determine that erisa text specifically and clearly addresses the question whether cba,as a plan fiduciary,has a right to pursue a claim for legal relief against ogden.mertens and knudson explain in great detail that congress not only considered this precise question in enacting a,but answered it in the negative.far from being inapposite,then,these opinions are directly controlling of our decision not to extend to cba a federal common law right to pursue its reimbursement claim against ogden.
we also reject cba attempt to analogize its case to our precedent in jamail carpenters district council of houston pension welfare trusts decided prior to mertens and knudson,jamail recognized the existence of an employer federal common law right to recover contribution overpayments mistakenly made to its erisa plan noting that erisa provides a private right of action for fiduciaries,participants,and beneficiaries,but not for employers,we reasoned in jamail that a gap existed in erisa text regarding an employer rights to recover overpayment of contributions from the plan to which such overpayments had been made thus,we held that recognition of a federal common law right of restitution for an employer a plan was appropriate,as erisa text did not address the issue,and such a right would further erisa underlying purposes by encouraging small employers to sponsor benefit plans for their employees 
although cba styles its reimbursement action as one for overpayment of benefits,jamail is clearly distinguishable,based on the obvious difference between an employer qua employer and a traditional erisa party,plans,fiduciaries,participants,and beneficiaries.in jamail,we were faced with an actual gap in erisa text which makes no mention of employers.we could not,therefore,point to precise language in erisa text demonstrating that,either expressly or implicitly,congress had proscribed the kind of relief that the employer plaintiff sought.as erisa text did not specifically and clearly address whether an employer had a right to recoup mistakenly paid contributions from the plan,and as creation of such a remedy was compatible with the policies of erisa,the jamail panel did not have to rewrite erisa to grant the employer a federal common law right of restitution against the plan.jamail thus has no bearing on our refusal today to create a federal common law right of unjust enrichment that would allow a plan fiduciary to assert an action for legal relief against a participant,both parties being members of categories expressly identified in.
we acknowledge that,in holding as we do,we may appear to be at variance with the fourth circuit decision in provident life accident insurance company waller in waller,the fourth circuit recognized the existence of a federal common law right of restitution on the part of a plan fiduciary to recover benefits from a beneficiary the facts of that case are as follows the plan administrator sought reimbursement of benefits paid to the beneficiary after settlement funds from a third party tortfeasor were received on behalf of the beneficiary the plan administrator did not,however,allege jurisdiction under a,but rather under a b,which provides a civil action only to participants and beneficiaries to recover benefits owed from a plan noting that a b does not authorize the converse,suits by plan administrator
