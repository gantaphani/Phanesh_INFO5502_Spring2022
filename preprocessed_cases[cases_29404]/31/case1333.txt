the factual history of this contract dispute is cumbersome but essential to a proper understanding of the issues raised on appeal.in,dick corporation,a construction company,became the general contractor on two construction projects in florida.the company decided to subcontract the craftwork involved in the florida projects.its chosen subcontractors,like all of the subcontractors submitting bids on the two projects,did not employ members of the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers bac.in the past,however,the company had used its own employees to perform the type of work it subcontracted on the two projects.its employees were members of local bricklayer unions,including bac local of northern new england,with which the company had a cba.under the cba,it paid employee benefit contributions into the fund,thereby entitling its employees to benefits under the fund.see second decl.of david stupar,exs,reprinted in joint appendix ja at.
in december the company signed an independent agreement ia with the local bac affiliates in eastern massachusetts,agreeing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the effective collective bargaining agreement and any successor agreements.independent agreement between dick and dist.council of.bricklayers allied craftsmen local unions,reprinted in ja at.the cba referenced in the ia was executed in august cba similarly,in september,dick corporation signed another independent agreement ia,this time with the local bac affiliate in western massachusetts.see independent agreement between dick corporation and bricklayers allied craftworkers local,reprinted in ja at.the ia bound the company to a cba executed in cba and any successor cba.eventually,the cba referenced in the ia was succeeded by an august cba august cba with the local bac affiliate in eastern massachusetts,while the cba tied to the ia was succeeded by a september cba september cba 
both successor august cba and the september a traveling contractor clause,which requires that a signatory employer with any work covered by the cba to be performed outside of the geographic area of the cba and within the geographic area covered by an agreement with another affiliate of the bac abide by the full terms and conditions of the agreement in effect in the job site area.ja,see also ja,art.pursuant to both clauses,the ipf sued the company for failure to make employee contributions consistent with the terms of a florida cba between the local bac in the area of dick corporation florida projects and the local employers of bac members in that area.see flynn dick,d.the fund claimed that the traveling contractor clauses bound dick corporation to the florida cba and,accordingly,the fund charged the company with violating the florida cba subcontracting clause,which prohibits signatory employers from using subcontractors for work performed within the area covered by the florida cba.see pls.mot.for summ.at.dick corporation,the fund asserted,was barred from evading this contribution obligation through the use of subcontractors.id.
following discovery,the district court granted the company motion for summary judgment.see dick,d at the district court found that the plain language of the september cba traveling contractor clause unambiguously bound dick corporation to any florida cba between local bac affiliates and local employers of bac members that was in existence in the at the the company projects.id.at.the district court then concluded that there was no valid cba in existence in florida obligating dick corporation to pay employee benefits into the fund under a traveling contractor clause.id.at.first,the court determined that the document the fund submitted as the applicable florida cba did not constitute an enforceable agreement because it lacked provisions covering wages and contract duration.id.at.instead,the court said,the document constituted only a standard form or draft agreement,completed and made enforceable only with the addition of an addendum detailing benefit payments and contractual ratification by real parties.id.by design,therefore,the florida cba was not an agreement in effect namely,a legally binding agreement,but merely provide d a framework for one.id.
in addition,the district court found that the lmra precluded the contributions the fund sought.see id.at.first,the skeletal nature of the agreement submitted by the fund failed to provide the detailed basis required for lawful contributions from an employer to a trust fund under section c b of the lmra.see id.at c b.the district court also held that the contributions sought by the ipf were not for the sole and exclusive benefit of dick corporation employees because the company florida projects were performed entirely by the subcontractors ineligible employees and no dick corporation employee was eligible to benefit from any contributions based on the work of subcontractors on the florida projects.dick,d at.given the ipf failure to establish that the requested contributions were for the sole and exclusive benefit of the company employees,the district court found the contributions prohibited by the lmra.id.at c a 
the ipf moved for reconsideration,challenging the district court conclusion that there was no valid cba in effect in florida and,in any event,not one that provided a detailed basis for fund contributions at the time of the company florida projects.see pls.mot.for recons.the district court ultimately agreed with the ipf that it had misconstrued affidavits submitted by the florida bac and that the the rate tables from cba appendices the fund submitted with in fact contained the required detailed basis for fund contributions along with evidence of an enforceable florida cba.see mem.order on mot.for,reprinted in ja at.the district court vacate d its grant of summary judgment to dick corporation to the extent it was based on the absence of either an enforceable cba or a detailed basis for benefit contributions under the lmra.see id.at.it nonetheless again granted summary judgment to the company because the requested contributions were not for the sole and exclusive benefit of dick corporation employees as required by the lmra.see id.at.the ipf now appeals.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,see ass of home builders norton,applying the same standards as the district court and drawing all inferences from the evidence in favor of the,see shekoyan sibley int l.we may affirm only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see mylan,thompson.we review the district court ruling on a motion for reconsideration pursuant to rule e for abuse of discretion.see messina krakower.we interpret collective bargaining agreements under federal law,see,walsh schlecht,d interpreting cba subcontractor clause under federal law principles,and a question concerning the proper interpretation of the plain language of a contract is a question of law subject to our de novo review,see smith,bucklin,sonntag.
the fund claim to benefit contributions is based on section of erisa,which provides 
every employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall,to the extent not inconsistent with law,make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan or such agreement.
emphasis added.this provision solves the problem created if an employer defaults on its obligation to fund a multiemployer pension plan,thereby forcing other participating employers to make larger contributions in order to cover the default.see flynn tile.under section,an employee benefit plan is analogous to a holder in due course.see benson brower moving storage,cir because benefit plans must be able to rely on the contribution promises of employers congress placed employee benefit plans in a position analogous to a holder in due course.indeed,defenses available to an employer attempting to avoid contributing to a benefit plan are ordinarily limited to claims that the agreement allegedly obligating the employer to pay benefits is either invalid or does not apply to the employer.see devito hempstead china shop,cir.
an agreement obligating an employer to contribute to a pension fund is not valid to the extent that such contribution is inconsistent with law.see.for example,s ection of the lmra generally forbids an employer from contributing money to a labor organization.post.newspaper guild,local,citing a.the general prohibition is subject to nine limited exceptions,see c,and,i f any one of these exceptions applies,the general prohibition of does not operate.post,at.
effect of florida cba 
in general,an employer obligation to make benefit contributions under section of erisa arises from a collective bargaining agreement in the geographic area in which the employer work is performed.dick corporation signed no cba in florida,where the two relevant construction projects were to be undertaken.the company instead signed two independent,by their operation,two massachusetts.see ja,dick,d at.both successor cbas contain a traveling contractor clause,which,as noted earlier,requires that a signatory employer with any work covered by the cba to be performed outside of the geographic area of the cba and within the geographic area covered by an agreement with another affiliate of the bac abide by the full terms and conditions of the agreement in effect in the job site area.ja.
the fund reads the traveling contractor clause in the august cba to require the company to contribute to the fund in accordance with the florida cba.see appellants reply br.at the clause provides 
when the employer has any work specified in this agreement to be performed outside of the geographic area covered by this agreement and within the geographic area covered by an agreement with another affiliate of the bac,the employer agrees to abide by the full terms and conditions of the agreement in effect in the job site area.
ja emphasis added.two different district courts have given conflicting interpretations to the unambiguous meaning of identical traveling contractor clauses.compare flynn beeler barney assocs.masonry contractors,wl,at,clause unambiguously bound employer to the terms of the jobsite jurisdiction bac collective bargaining agreement,even though the employer never signed the agreement with that bac affiliate,with trs.of the bricklayers allied craftworkers,local charles driscoll masonry restoration,d,holding that,on its face,clause bound employer only to cba employer in fact signed 
we believe the clause is ambiguous.indeed,as the sixth circuit noted in construing a virtually identical clause,the first sentence of the bac traveling contractor clause is susceptible to more than one interpretation because the phrase within the area covered by an agreement with another affiliate of the bac could refer to an agreement between the employer and the bac affiliate,or it could refer to an agreement between any employer and the bac affiliate.trs.of the local ins.fund ohio ceiling partition,cir,emphasis added.given the ambiguity,we may consider the intent of the parties to interpret the meaning of the august cba traveling contractor clause.see,united states ins.of.
unlike the statements of the union president in driscoll a narrow interpretation of the those of the company president in ohio a similar narrow understanding of the clause,see ohio ceiling.at is little extrinsic evidence of intent here.a massachusetts bac official submitted an affidavit regarding the reason the bac inserts traveling contractor clauses into all collective bargaining agreements.see decl.of ronald marvin at,reprinted in ja at.his statement reflects a broad understanding of the clause,binding signatory employers to the cbas of local bac if the employer does not sign the local order to prevent employers from operating in foreign jurisdictions.id.at.
moreover,it would make little sense to interpret the clause as only applying when the employer works in a jurisdiction where that same employer has signed a separate cba with another bac affiliate because,if the employer was signatory to an agreement in the jobsite area,there would be no need for a traveling contractors clause.beeler,wl at emphasis in original.indeed,a narrowly construed traveling contractor clause would simply reimpose the employer already existing contractual obligation.such an interpretation would render the traveling contractor clause meaningless and,absent evidence of such intent,parties ought not be presumed to have included in their agreement a meaningless provision.martinsville nylon employees council nlrb.as a consequence,and absent evidence of any contrary intent,we believe the august cba traveling contractor clause binds dick corporation to a cba in force at a foreign jobsite even if the company is not a signatory thereto 
effect of section of lmra 
the florida cba at issue requires an employer to contribute pension and retirement benefit payments into the fund for union work performed within the territorial jurisdiction of the cba.ja.while the lmra prohibits employer contributions to a labor organization,section provides an exception with respect to the payment of any money in satisfaction of a judgment of any court or a decision or award of an arbitrator.c.the ipf asserts that the benefit contributions dick corporation owes pursuant to the florida cba are lawful under this exception because the company breached the cba by hiring subcontractors on its florida projects.see appellants br.at pls.mot.for summ.at.the florida cba provides 
the employer agrees that neither he nor any of his subcontractors on the jobsite,will contract or subcontract work coming under the trade or territorial jurisdiction of the bac,to be done at the site of construction except to a person,firm or corporation bound to this agreement.
pls.mot.for summ.at.dick corporation admitted that it employed subcontractors on its florida projects.see decl.of raymond crothers at ja as a result of the company breach,the fund claims,it is to the section c the benefit contributions the company would have been required to pay absent the breach.see appellants br.at.
in washington post newspaper guild,local,we upheld an arbitrator award against a lmra challenge,finding section c exempted the award from section a general prohibition.see id.at.the arbitrator found that the washington post breached a collective bargaining agreement by failing to pay union dues from the salaries of the columnists as not covered by the ordered the newspaper to reimburse the union fund for the dues not paid on account of the breach.see id.at.on appeal,we concluded that the arbitrator order came within the section c exception.see id.at.
dick corporation,however,argues that washington post and section c of the lmra are inapplicable because the ipf has no underlying court judgment or arbitration award establishing the company breach of the florida cba,see appellee br.at,relying on jackson purchase rural coop.ass local union,int l of workers,cir.in that case,the court refused to enforce the arbitration award because the only alleged contractual breach upon which the arbitrator an otherwise illegal provision in the collective bargaining agreement.see id.at,illegal union dues provision.the problem in jackson purchase was not the lack of an underlying judgment instead,there was no breach of a valid,legally enforceable contractual provision.indeed,washington post distinguished jackson purchase on this ground,recognizing that t he opinion says nothing about an arbitrator power to award a union the dues it lost as a consequence of the employer breach of a valid collective bargaining agreement.washington post,at.
section c requires no more than vigorous and genuine litigation and the court or arbitrator determination of the merits of the alleged contractual breach.id.at the post will pay this money on the order of the arbitrator,after vigorous and genuine litigation.from a practical standpoint,dick corporation claim that an underlying judgment is necessary to invoke section c would be cumbersome and duplicative,requiring two separate sets of litigation an initial determination of breach and a second enforcement proceeding.instead,once the court finds a valid contractual provision breached,the satisfaction of a judgment language of section c is met and the same court may award damages for the violation.see trs.of int l of teamsters local sick welfare fund marangi,d,if defendants are found to have breached the cba,plaintiffs would be entitled to an award of damages because section c specifically excludes the application of a citing washington post,at.here,the ipf alleges,and the company concedes,that dick corporation breached the florida cba by hiring subcontractors.see pls.mot.for summ.at decl.of raymond crothers at ja.the fund is entitled to damages resulting from the breach in the form of benefit contributions in a sum equal to that which they would have received if the agreement between the defendant and the union had been fully performed by all parties trs.of the teamsters constr.workers local,health welfare trust fund for hawg n action,cir see also chicago painters decorators pension,health welfare,and deferred sav.plan trust funds karr,cir breaching employer required to pay the amount that employer would have been required to contribute to the trust funds if it had complied with the collective bargaining agreements 
effect of arbitration clause of florida cba 
next,dick corporation argues that the ipf may not bring suit without first complying with the compulsory arbitration provision contained in the florida cba.see appellee br.at.as the supreme court has recognized,however,the presumption of arbitrability is not a proper rule of construction in determining whether arbitration agreements between the union and the employer apply to disputes between trustees and employers.schneider moving storage robbins,d.thus,in the absence of an unambiguous expression by the parties to the contrary,pension funds are not required to exhaust collective bargaining agreement arbitration procedures prior to filing an action for collection of delinquent contributions to the pension fund.flynn interior finishes,d.
as both beneficiaries of the florida cba trust fund provisions and trustees of an fund,the ipf is entitled to file suit for delinquent contributions free from the cba arbitration requirements.see,schneider,at.finding compulsory arbitration inapplicable where beneficiaries invoking cba provisions are trustees of funds robbins lynch,cir a pension or welfare trust is a beneficiary of the collective bargaining agreement.to the extent that dick corporation relies on interior finishes to argue that the fund is barred from filing suit absent exhaustion because the trustees are standing in the shoes of the union,appellee br.at quoting interior finishes,d at,the company misapprehends the holding.the defendant employer in interior finishes did not challenge the fund ability to seek,on its own behalf,unpaid contributions to the fund without exhausting arbitral remedies.interior finishes,d at emphasis in original.indeed,given the supreme court holding in schneider,that argument could not have prevailed.see id.at quoting schneider,at.instead,in interior finishes the defendant employer challenged the fund ability to bring suit on behalf of the bac without first arbitrating such claims.id.at.because union claims are not protected under schneider,see at,the district court in interior finishes dismissed the claims made on behalf of the bac for failure to exhaust arbitral remedies,d at,but allowed the suit to continue with regard to the claims made on behalf of the fund itself,see id.at.
in this case,the fund brought suit on its own behalf to collect unpaid contributions,see appellants br.at,and the district court properly rejected dick corporation exhaustion defense,see dick,d at.on the other hand,to the extent the ipf sued to recover union dues,those claims are outside schneider holding and must be dismissed.
existence of enforceable florida cba 
finally,dick corporation challenges the district court determination that there is a genuine issue of material summary an enforceable florida cba existed at the time of its florida construction projects.the company asserts that the district court erred in relying on proffered evidence related to the florida cba in light of the fund alleged discovery violations.see appellee br.at.indeed,when the company requested a copy of the florida cba,including the cba specific wage and contribution rates,during discovery,see ja,the fund produced only a standard florida cba form with blanks not filled in,ja,and dick corporation claims that the fund failed to provide the specific information needed to establish the existence of an enforceable cba until the company moved for summary judgment,see appellee br.at.because of the fund failure to produce,the company argues,the district court should have excluded any rate information under federal rule of civil procedure c instead the district court erroneously relied on the evidence and thus,dick corporation asserts,erroneously found an enforceable florida cba.absent an enforceable contract,the company continues,the fund contribution arguments fail for lack of an obligation.see appellee br.at 
in response,the fund claims that it provided the substantial justification for necessary to avoid rule c.see appellants reply br.at pls.to def.reply br.in supp.of mot.for summ.first,the fund argues that it did supply the requested wage and contribution rates during discovery,thereby providing the information needed to establish an enforceable cba.see appellants reply br.at decl.of seth richardson,reprinted in ja at.second,the fund showed that some of the requested information was within the control of a florida bac official.see decl.of robert blanco at,reprinted in ja at describing florida bac official providing florida cba to fund.finally,before the district court,the fund explained that the only reason why the documents at issue were not gathered and produced earlier was because dick corporation chose to wait until its summary judgment motion to argue for the very first time that the florida cba was illegal and unenforceable because it did not contain the governing rates.pls.to def.reply br.in supp.of summ.at emphasis in original.
in general,the district court enjoys wide discretion in managing discovery,and,accordingly,w e review the district court discovery ruling s for abuse of discretion only.see diamond ventures,llc barreto.this deference extends to the district court imposition of discovery sanctions.see jankins tdc mgmt,see also.c in addition to or in lieu of exclusion of evidence,the court,on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard,may impose other appropriate sanctions.here,the district court used the challenged evidence to revise its summary judgment order in response to the fund rule e reconsideration motion.see ja.we also review a district court decision to alter or amend a judgment under rule e for abuse of discretion.see messina,at.
both dick corporation and the fund presented arguments to the district court regarding discovery sanctions.nevertheless,the dist
