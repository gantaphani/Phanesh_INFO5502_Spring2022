we consider whether an erisa plan administrator properly terminated benefits because of its beneficiary failure to produce evidence of her disability.
graciela saffon has long suffered from degeneration of her cervical spine,a condition confirmed by repeated mri scans and.after a car crash aggravated her condition in december,saffon quit her desk job at wells fargo bank and applied for disability benefits from defendant,the wells fargo.long term disability plan.the metropolitan life insurance company metlife,which served both as the plan insurer and as its claims administrator,promptly began to pay her disability benefits.saffon eventually applied for disability benefits,which metlife granted.after paying benefits for a year,metlife informed saffon that she no longer m et the definition of disability and terminated her benefits.saffon then unsuccessfully availed herself of metlife administrative appeals process.
saffon sued the plan under a,seeking payment of withheld benefits,attorney fees and a declaration that she is disabled.after a bench trial on the administrative record,the district court concluded that the plan had abused its discretion and denied saffon any relief.
standard of review 
we review benefits denials de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits if the plan does grant such discretionary authority,we review the administrator decision for abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.
here,the plan summary plan description states 
in carrying out their respective responsibilities under the plan,the plan administrator and other plan fiduciaries shall have discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan and to determine eligibility for and entitlement to plan benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan.
saffon argues that we must review metlife decision de novo because it is unclear whether the summary plan description discretionary clause refers to metlife.kearney standard ins,cir en banc we defer only if the grant of discretionary authority is unambiguous.saffon sees an ambiguity in the fact that the summary plan description does refer to metlife by name instead,it grants discretionary authority to the plan administrator wells fargo and other plan fiduciaries.but it perfectly clear that metlife is included in this grant of discretionary authority because it is one of the other plan fiduciaries mentioned there.
a fiduciary is an entity with any discretionary authority in the administration of an erisa plan.a.see aetna health davila,d when administering employee benefit plans,hmos must make discretionary decisions regarding eligibility for plan benefits,and,in this regard,must be treated as plan fiduciaries.metlife certificate of insurance provides that metlife in its discretion has authority to interpret the terms,conditions,and provisions of the entire contract.the summary plan description explains that the plan is administered by metlife.to qualify for ltd benefits,beneficiaries must r eceive approval for ltd benefits by metlife.those benefits will begin one month after metlife determines you are disabled,and will end on t he date metlife determines that you are no longer disabled.
these provisions leave no doubt that metlife is an entity with discretionary authority to administer the plan.metlife is therefore one of the other plan fiduciaries to which the summary plan description grants discretionary authority to determine eligibility for plan benefits.while the path to this conclusion is somewhat tortuous,it is also perfectly clear.see wilson arlington prudential ins.of,cir complexity is not the same thing as ambiguity.the plan unambiguously confers discretionary authority on metlife to administer benefits claims.
saffon also argues that we must disregard the discretionary authority granted to metlife because the california insurance commissioner has revoked the certificate of insurance in saffon policy,and any related summary plan descriptions.at least other states have done the same the national association of insurance commissioners encourages the remaining to follow suit.see henry quillen,state prohibition of discretionary clauses in benefit plans,pension planning compliance,summer,at.
this nationwide vote of no confidence seems to have been precipitated by the cupidity of one particular insurer,unumprovident,which boosted its profits by repeatedly denying benefits claims it knew to be valid.unumprovident internal memos revealed that the company senior officers relied on erisa deferential standard of review to avoid detection and liability.see john langbein,trust law as regulatory law the scandal and judicial review of benefit denials under erisa,nw,describing unumprovident behavior.it is an open question whether the states efforts are preempted by erisa,a,or as is more likely they are saved from preemption because they regulate insurance,id.b a.see quillen,supra,at arguing against preemption.the parties have briefed the preemption question in depth,and we do not consider it.
even if federal law permitted states to nullify an erisa plan grant of discretionary authority,california law does authorize the commissioner to do so retroactively.cal.ins.code f.assuming that the commissioner may prohibit insurance companies from using this discretionary clause in future insurance contracts,he can not rewrite existing contracts so as to change the rights and duties thereunder.peterson am.life health ins,cir a n otherwise valid insurance policy is a binding contract and governs the obligations of the parties until the commissioner revokes his approval.
that the plan grants metlife discretionary authority is only the first step in determining the standard by which we review its denial of benefits.while we nominally review for abuse of discretion,the degree of deference we accord to a claims administrator decision can vary significantly.in bruch,the supreme court instructed us to weigh a fiduciary conflict of interest as a facto r in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.at.quoting restatement second of trusts cmt.d.metlife labors under such a conflict of interest it both decides who gets benefits and pays for them,so it has a direct financial incentive to deny claims.see langbein,supra,at the danger pervades the world that a plan decisionmaker will take advantage of its license under bruch to line its own pockets by denying meritorious claims.
the district court did take metlife conflict of interest into account,apparently because saffon did produce material,probative evidence of the conflict.atwood newmont gold,cir.atwood was the law in our circuit at the time the district court reached its decision but it has since been overruled.abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc.in abatie,we explained that a reviewing court must always consider the inherent conflict that exists when a plan administrator both administers the plan and funds it.id.at.we weigh such a conflict more or less heavily depending on what other evidence is available.id.at.
we view the conflict with a low level of skepticism if there no evidence of malice,of,or of a parsimonious history.id.but we may weigh the conflict more heavily if there evidence that the administrator has given inconsistent reasons for denial,has failed adequately to investigate a claim or ask the plaintiff for necessary evidence,or has repeatedly denied benefits to deserving participants by interpreting plan terms incorrectly.id.
in explaining what it means to weigh a conflict of interest,abatie conscious ly rejected the sliding scale approach adopted by other circuits 
w eighing a conflict of interest as a factor in abuse of discretion review requires a balance a district court,when faced with all the facts and circumstances,must decide in each case how much or how little to credit the plan administrator reason for denying insurance coverage.an egregious conflict may weigh more heavily that is,may cause the court to find an abuse of discretion more readily than a minor,technical conflict might.
id.at.abatie went on to offer additional guidance 
c ourts are familiar with the process of weighing a conflict of interest.for example,in a bench trial the court must decide how much weight to give to a witness testimony in the face of some evidence of bias.what the district court is doing in an erisa benefits denial case is making something akin to a credibility determination about the insurance company or plan administrator reason for denying coverage under a particular plan and a particular set of medical and other records.we believe that district courts are well equipped to consider the particulars of a conflict of interest,along with all the other facts and circumstances,to determine whether an abuse of discretion has occurred.
as we read abatie,when reviewing a discretionary denial of benefits by a plan administrator who is subject to a conflict of interest,we must determine the extent to which the conflict influenced the administrator decision and discount to that extent the deference we accord the administrator decision.in so doing,we seek to overcome the serious danger of conflicted plan decisionmaking illustrated by the unumprovident scandal.langbein,supra,at.
because the district court did not have the benefit of abatie teachings,it applied the wrong legal standard in reviewing metlife determination that saffon is not disabled.we therefore accord the district court ruling no deference and examine the record afresh through abatie lens.
after metlife granted saffon disability benefits,it commissioned john thomas to review her medical records.thomas found that saffon had provided evidence to corroborate her claim that the pain prevented her from working saffon file,he wrote,lacks detailed,objective,functional findings or testing which would completely preclude an effort by saffon to return to work.metlife forwarded thomas report to david kudrow,saffon neurologist.kudrow responded to thomas report in a detailed letter that discussed saffon reported symptoms,his unsuccessful attempts to alleviate them and the evidence of saffon condition objective evidence of cervical pathology is noted in previous cervical spine mri which shows multilevel degenerative disease.saffon herself also wrote explaining that her condition has not changed,it has been the same for over a year now,my headaches and neck pain are moderately severe hours a day.
metlife added saffon and kudrow letters to saffon file and sent it back to thomas for a second review,whereupon thomas again concluded that saffon file lacks clear,sequential,detailed,objective clinical information which would completely preclude saffon from an attempt at return to work.metlife faxed this pronouncement to kudrow and gave him a deadline if you disagree with the findings of thomas second review,please respond by fax within ten days with supporting documentation.if we do not hear from you,we will presume you are in agreement with the findings of the review.metlife did not send saffon a copy of this query.kudrow did not reply before the expiration of metlife deadline,nor,of course,did saffon.
metlife then terminated saffon benefits,explaining its decision as follows 
the medical information provided no longer provides evidence of disability that would prevent you from performing your job or occupation.you no longer meet the definition of disability therefore your claim has been withdrawn 
the letter advised saffon that she could appeal the decision by providing 
medical evidence from the doctor s treating you for a condition that indicates you are under the appropriate care and treatment and objective medical information to support your inability to perform the duties of your occupation.
saffon appealed and,in an apparent effort to provide objective medical information,she included her most recent mri,which showed that her cervical spine was not significantly changed since the mri taken right after the car crash.she also included another letter from kudrow,her treating neurologist,who confirmed that saffon had tried a variety of pain treatments without sustainable benefit and that she was still unable to tolerate sustained sitting.
metlife referred saffon appeal to robert menotti,who,like thomas,neither examined nor interviewed her.after reading metlife file,menotti concluded that t here simply is not enough objective medical findings and office notes that have continued to flow into this file,that convince this reviewer that the claimant headache and chronic pain syndrome has been enough to preclude her from working.
metlife thereupon denied saffon appeal 
medical information furnished reflects diagnoses including chronic headaches,chronic pain syndrome,cervical spondylosis,cervical strain and sprain.the determination of disability is not based on the presence of diagnoses,but is based on functional ability supported by clinical evidence that would substantiate symptoms consistent with those reported by the patient and medical providers.in this determination of disability,we must take into consideration current restrictions and limitations that are supported by clinical evidence that substantiates an inability to perform the duties of your job for your own or any employer in accordance with the wells fargo disability plan.
it is not clear what kudrow used as a basis for his diagnosis of your reported limitations as we not been furnished with a functional capacity evaluation that would objectively measure and document your current level of functional ability.
the mri of april,documents degenerative changes in your cervical spine,but indicates this is unchanged from the prior january,mri.no progression in degeneration is documented.prescribed medications of bextra and celexa do not appear to represent an excessive amount of medication that would result in decreased concentration levels.the frequency of pain clinic visits were noted to not be excessive to the degree that would render you unable to perform sedentary functions consistent with your own occupation.
ten years ago,in booton lockheed medical benefit plan,cir,we interpreted the erisa regulations as calling for a meaningful dialogue between claims administrator and beneficiary.in resolving saffon claim for benefits,metlife was required to give her a description of any additional material or information that was necessary for her to perfect the claim,and to do so in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant.g.
metlife can not be faulted for taking our instructions in booton too seriously.its communications with saffon and her doctors are hardly a model of clarity they certainly do not explain in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant what saffon must do to perfect her claim.for example,thomas statement that saffon file lacks clear,sequential,detailed,objective clinical information which would completely preclude saffon from an attempt at return to work is little more than a long series of unconnected adjectives.how an absence of information could preclude saffon from returning to work,what function the word sequential plays in this litany,or why kudrow report and attached mri did not amount to objective clinical information or was not clear is left to the imagination.
metlife termination letter to saffon is equally uninformative.it notes merely that t he medical information provided no longer provides evidence of disability that would prevent you from performing your job or occupation,but does not explain why that is the case,and certainly does not engage kudrow contrary assertion.the termination letter does suggest saffon can appeal by providing objective medical information to support her inability to perform the duties of her occupation,but does not explain why the information saffon has already provided is insufficient for that purpose.
both saffon and kudrow then provided additional information about saffon course of treatment,including evidence that saffon pain was not relieved by a variety of pain treatments.this proved unsatisfactory to menotti who reviewed saffon administrative appeal he remained unconvinced that the claimant headache and chronic pain syndrome has been enough to preclude her from working.menotti does not explain why he is unconvinced,nor what saffon or kudrow
