defendant sun life appeals the district court decision that sun life denial of disability benefits to plaintiff sherry delisle was arbitrary and capricious.we agree with the district court that sun life determination did not result from a deliberate and principled reasoning process.accordingly,we affirm.
sidney krandall sons,a retail jeweler,employed sherry delisle as director of operations from january until april.while at krandall,delisle participated in its disability plan,which was funded by a group policy of long term disability insurance issued by sun life.under the policy,disability occurred when 
d uring the elimination period and the next months,the employee,because of injury or sickness,is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his own occupation.after total or partial disability benefits combined have been paid for months,the employee will continue to be totally disabled if he is unable to perform with reasonable continuity any gainful occupation for which he is or becomes reasonably qualified for by education,training or experience.

on april,krandall fired delisle because,as it reported to sun life,she she was not doing her job.the record does not reveal whether delisle not doing her job was related to injury or sickness.delisle filed for state unemployment benefits,stating in her application that she was fired due to lack of work.she worked at another job for about two weeks,but was fired,because,as she reported to cushing,she held her ground about how may hours she would work.in december,about eight months after she was fired from krandall,delisle filed a claim for disability benefits with sun life.she supported her claim with her medical records and five attending physician statements,all finding her disabled from performing her own occupation as of april last day of work at krandall.
in,the social security administration determined that delisle was disabled and eligible for social security disability insurance payments effective april.despite this,sun life denied delisle claim and upheld its decision on appeal,finding that she was not covered under its policy because she was not actively at work when her disability arose.delisle challenged this in district court under section a b of erisa.a b.the district court decided that sun life denial was arbitrary and capricious and set aside its decision,ordering it to determine whether delisle was disabled on the day krandall fired.
on remand from the district court,sun life considered delisle medical evidence which included opinions from ho,cushing,and rudy,all of whom had treated her in the months before her firing.she also gave sun life opinions about her condition from noomie,a doctor of chiropractics,kerkar,a medical doctor specializing in pain management,and branca,a neuropsychologist.those providers diagnosed her as suffering from neck and low back injuries,including degenerative disc disease,radiculopathy a condition resulting from nerve damage,closed head injury,chronic pain syndrome,post traumatic syndrome,major depressive disorder,and a class mental impairment,characterized by significant loss of psychological,physiological,personal,and social adjustments.

this court considers several factors in reviewing a plan administrator decision,including the existence of a conflict of interest,the plan administrator consideration of the social security administration determination,and the quality and quantity of medical evidence and opinions.id.here,we also review sun life reliance on evidence to deny benefits.
conflict of interest 
the supreme court recently held that a conflict of interest exists for erisa purposes where the plan administrator evaluates and pays benefits claims,even when,as here,the administrator is an insurance company and not the beneficiary employer.glenn.at.we give more weight to the conflict where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision id.at.a conflict may affect a benefits decision in several ways.for example,although the treating physician rule does not apply in erisa cases,the supreme court has acknowledged that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an incentive to make a finding of not disabled in order to save their employers money and preserve their own consulting arrangements.black decker disability plan nord,d.and our own court has observed that when a plan administrator both decides claims and pays benefits,it has a clear incentive to contract with consultants who are inclined to find that a claimant is not entitled to benefits.kalish liberty life assurance,cir.
