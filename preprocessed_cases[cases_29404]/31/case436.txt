effective july,the plan was amended so as to substitute as the employer and the plan administrator the amendment stated that the sources of contributions funding benefits under the plan were enterprises,and its employees.beginning on or about the same date,it is not disputed that did not provide kanawha with sufficient funds to pay in a timely manner all outstanding claims alleged to be due under the terms of the plan.between july,and december,failed to pay for a total of in medical plan claims invoiced by kanawha.of this amount,the employees in this case experienced unpaid medical and dental claims in the amount of 
on november,terminated the plan effective november.in deposition testimony,lowell comptroller who was also an officer of how the plan became insolvent 
then in july,we had,about the same time that the bank told us that they were going to continue to fund us and we ran out of money for payroll,we had a week that hit that was about seventy four thousand,seventy five thousand dollars in medical plan claims.so that kind of threw everything out of kilter right there.it was just one big one we had,i think,three employees or spouses or something had like heart attacks and strokes all within one short period of time and all the bills hit at once and at that time kanawha did not want us to pay partial.they wanted the whole thing or nothing and that we did have seventy four thousand dollars at all.i mean,the company did not have it,the bank was not advancing,and that when everything really fell apart on the health plan that was july.
line,line.templeton went on to testify that had been forced to choose between funding the plan or the company payroll from until the plan was terminated in november.in this regard,he testified as follows 
q.at that point in,at that point that there was seventy four thousand in medical claims due and you did have seventy four thousand,at that point you prioritizing debts.who made the decision not to divert money in to pay those health claims but to divert to pay other things whose decision was that 
i guess it would have been cliff theisen ultimately.i not sure that a conscious decision was made to do that.like i said,at that time kanawha only wanted the whole payment.they did not want to go in it and pull out,you know,we pay you half of it this week,half of it next week,and you release half the checks and half the checks.they did want to do that.so it came down to paying payroll or paying the health claims.
the financial condition of saco lowell and in the first half of was generally known to be poor.employees were also aware that the companies financial problems persisted as the year progressed.during the second half of,saco lowell management met with employees at least once to inform them,in general terms,of the plan financial problems.at this meeting,and in other informal conversations with individual employees,theisen assured the workers that we doing everything we could to pay the outstanding claims,lines.nonetheless,the record reveals no instance in which the employees were ever specifically informed that the plan administrator and employer had all but ceased to transfer its required contributions to kanawha.
in november,the month in which the plan was terminated,theisen told the employees at a meeting that we did have the money to pay them,that everybody was on temporary layoff for the next week and that we would call them and let them know when checks would be ready and everything,lines.with regard to payment of claims under the plan,templeton stated that he recalled questions about the health care which cliff said that we were doing everything we could do to get paid,lines.
on november,kanawha advised the employees that it had processed claims incurred by the employees or their dependents in good faith,and had repeatedly requested funding for these claims from,but that its requests have gone unanswered.therefore,kanawha advised the employees,we are notifying you of enterprises.group health benefits plan failure to provide funds to allow us to release payment of these claims.
when notice was given to the employees on november,of termination of the plan,the employees were only told that any and all charges incurred after the effective date november,for services provided or other costs or expenses incurred after the effective date,will not be covered by the plan.no mention was made of the status of costs or expenses incurred prior to the effective date nor the status of the monetary contributions required of the employer and plan administrator under the plan document.
in the proceedings below,theisen,templeton,pomian,and saco lowell moved for summary judgment arguing,inter alia,that they were not fiduciaries,but if they were,they did not breach any fiduciary duties.the district court,without deciding whether the defendants were fiduciaries acted at some time in a fiduciary capacity,concluded that there was no breach of any fiduciary duty.the district court rejected the argument of the employees that there was a duty to fund the plan so as to pay claims of participants and beneficiaries,and agreed with the defendants that funding the plan is a business,not fiduciary,function.as such,the district court concluded that any failure to fund the plan is not a breach of fiduciary duty in this case.id.
responding to an argument of the employees that the plan assets had been in a general business account rather than being held in trust,and that such conduct was a breach of fiduciary duty,the district court concluded that 
t o the extent such is a breach of fiduciary duty,the court finds that the plaintiffs were not injured because the amount paid out in claims by the plan far exceeds the total amount of employee contributions.in fact,employer contributions of nine hundred thousand dollars were made to the plan in excess of the employee contributions.
the district court rejected an argument by the employees that theisen,templeton,pomian,and saco lowell had breached a fiduciary duty by failing to provide complete and accurate information to the plan beneficiaries regarding the financial status of the plan.the district court noted that in griggs dupont de nemours,cir,this court had addressed the issue of an affirmative duty to provide information to a beneficiary.however,the district court found that that case is easily distinguishable from the facts before the court.finally,the district court addressed the argument by the employees that imposed such a duty,and found this argument without merit.id.no explanation was given by the district court for either of these last two conclusions.from the final judgment entered against them on january,the employees appeale
