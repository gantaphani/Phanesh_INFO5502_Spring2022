background 
popowski parrott 
parrott,an employee of united distributors,was injured in an accident in may.the united distributors plan paid in medical expenses on her behalf in connection with the accident.at.prior to the united distributors plan making any payment,however,parrott signed a reimbursement agreement stating that she understood that the plan 
has a claim or lien against,and the first right to receive reimbursement from the participant for,any recovery,settlement,or judgment obtained by participant from or against any party at fault in the accident at issue or from any other source for the amount paid by the plan as medical claims.
exh.b at this agreement echoed the plan own subrogation and reimbursement provision,which stated that 
in any event,the plan has a lien on any amount recovered by the covered person whether or not designated as payment for medical expenses.this lien shall remain in effect until the plan is repaid in full.
the covered person must repay to the plan the benefits paid on his or her behalf out of the recovery made from the third party or insurer.
exhs.a,g at.the plan further explains that t hese rights provide the plan with a priority over any funds paid by a third party to a covered person relative to the injury or sickness,including a priority over any claim for or dental charges,attorney fees,or other costs and expenses.id.
in october,parrott obtained a settlement through her attorney for a total of,exh.at.of the portion paid under her uninsured motorist policy,went to her attorney,was placed in a structured annuity to her benefit,and the remainder,was paid directly to parrott and deposited into a joint checking account that she held with her husband.id.of the paid by the tortfeasor insurer,some went to cover medical expenses,some to cover attorney fees and costs,and the remaining went into the parrotts account.id.
after discovering that parrott had received this settlement,popowski and the commerce group attempted to collect under the policy reimbursement provision and reinforcing reimbursement agreement.when they were unable to do so,they filed this suit along with a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to protect the settlement proceeds.popowski and the commerce group also filed a motion to have parrott husband joined as a party defendant because of his interest in the bank account in which the recovery funds had been deposited.in response,parrott filed motions to dismiss,first alleging failure to state a claim,then alleging lack of subject matter jurisdiction.faced with a split among the circuits regarding the scope of equitable relief under erisa,the district court,following the lead of the sixth and ninth circuits in interpreting life annuity insurance knudson,d,concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over appellants claims because popowski and the commerce group actually sought legal rather than equitable restitution in that they based their claim on the breach of a contract obligation to reimburse the plan rather than on a property right in a specifically identifiable fund.at.therefore,the court granted the motion to dismiss and,accordingly,denied all other requested relief.
bcbs carillo 
in june,josue carillo and vicente carillo were involved in an accident.the mohawk plan paid medical benefits of on behalf of josue and of on behalf of vicente.at.the mohawk plan contains a subrogation and reimbursement provision,which provides in relevant part 
if,however,the covered person receives a settlement,judgment,or other payment relating to the accidental injury or illness from another person,firm,corporation,organization or business entity paid by,or on behalf of,the person or entity who allegedly caused the injury or illness,the covered person agrees to reimburse the plan in full,and in first priority,for any medical expenses paid by the plan relating to the injury or illness.
bcbs letter,exh.b at 
bcbs has alleged that the carillos received a settlement of in connection with the june accident and that they have refused to reimburse the mohawk plan for the medical expenses it paid on their behalf.at.in february,bcbs brought suit pursuant to a,seeking enforcement of the subrogation and reimbursement provision through equitable relief,including but not limited to,restitution,imposition of a constructive trust,and equitable lien.at.bcbs also sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction preventing the carillos from dissipating the settlement funds.the court granted a temporary restraining order but deferred ruling on the preliminary injunction pending further briefing by the parties.prior to any ruling,the carillos filed a motion to dismiss asserting that the district court lacked jurisdiction because bcbs allegations fail ed to state a claim for equitable relief under a.at bcbs responded with a motion for summary judgment.the court addressed all three motions in one order.
also adopting the reasoning of the sixth and ninth circuits,the court concluded that bcbs claim regardless of whether it is styled as a claim for a constructive trust,for equitable restitution,or for an equitable lien,simply seeks to enforce a provision of a plan document that would require defendants to pay money.id.at.it further concluded that s uch a claim is not equitable in nature,and is not appropriate equitable relief for purposes of a.id.at.alternatively,the court stated that,even under the alternative interpretation of knudson adopted by a majority of circuits at the time because bcbs had failed to seek recovery of specified,identifiable funds,but instead sought recovery of funds that have been comingled into various checking accounts and spent,in part,to purchase a truck relief under a was unavailable.id.at.accordingly,the court granted the motion to dismiss.on the basis of the reasoning underlying the dismissal,the court also denied the motions for preliminary injunction and summary judgment.
on appeal,popowski,the commerce group,and bcbs now argue that the district courts,in relying upon the reasoning of the sixth circuit in qualchoice rowland,cir and the ninth circuit in westaff usa arce,cir,improperly interpreted knudson after the district court decisions and the appellate briefing in the cases now before us had occurred,the supreme court issued its opinion in sereboff and addressed the circuit split as to the scope of equitable relief available under erisa.we now review these cases in light of that decision.
