this is an appeal from a district court order granting final summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff,william shaw,in this erisa action against the defendant,connecticut general life insurance company connecticut general,seeking disability benefits under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.after thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties briefs,we conclude that while the district court correctly employed a de novo standard to review the plan administrator denial of benefits,it erred by granting final summary judgment to shaw.because there are genuine issues of material fact concerning whether shaw was totally disabled at the time he stopped working for his employer,united technologies corporation utc,we reverse the district court order of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the relevant facts and procedural history are straightforward.shaw,now retired,was employed as a purchasing manager in utc automotive division from until april.in march,shaw filed a claim for disability benefits and,in april,sought disability benefits and waiver of life insurance premium under utc two disability insurance plans.connecticut general was the claims administrator for both plans,although it insured only the plan.the plan was.
the utc choice disability benefits summary plan description defines disability as the inability to perform the essential duties of your regular job because of illness,injury or pregnancy,and disability as the inability,due to illness or injury,to work at any job for which you are qualified by training,education or experience.the group disability contract defines total disability or totally disabled in these terms an employee will be considered totally disabled if the employee is totally and continuously disabled so that the employee is completely prevented from engaging in any gainful occupation or employment for which the employee is,or becomes,reasonably qualified by training,education,or experience emphasis in original.
shaw was granted benefits in april,but was denied benefits and waiver of life insurance premium benefits by connecticut general,both initially in june,and on reconsideration in december and january.the information gathered during the investigation of shaw benefits claim was used by the plan administrator in denying shaw benefits claim.
shaw disability benefits application claimed that as of april,he suffered from a disability which he described as stress caused by company investigation which brought on diabetes.shaw application was accompanied by a report from his psychologist,trisha wilmoth,which said in pertinent part shaw has suffered with diabetes as a chronic condition which becomes unstable under stress.he was seen for a total of sessions from october through march and was diagnosed as depressed shaw condition is not helped by his employment which not only does not reward competency,but also lacks decisive leadership in a hostile environment.wilmoth also included a letter opining that shaw estimated return to work date is unknown at present due to the hostile workplace environment that exacerbated his condition emphasis added.
on november,connecticut general contacted wilmoth office to request copies of wilmoth office notes and additional information addressing why shaw could not return to work,or whether he could return to his job if he reported to another supervisor or manager.soon thereafter,wilmoth sent copies of her office notes and a covering letter,which explained his condition in these terms shaw is still on medication for depression and takes insulin orally and by injection which he monitors twice daily.he is stable only under conditions.if you were to put him back in similar conditions,he would most likely have a similar reaction that began the cycle.this is the reason why his return to work date remains unknown.wilmoth declined to elaborate when connecticut general sought clarification of shaw treatment plan.
thereafter,connecticut general referred the matter to its staff nurse,diana morgan,nurse morgan,for review.after examining shaw medical information,nurse morgan reported on december,that shaw had been treated by wilmoth since,but that t here wa s no indication what changed in shaw condition that he could no longer do his job,except that the company was sold and he appears to have decided to retire.she also wrote that the m edical information on file does not support wilmoth opinion of shaw disabling condition,and that the records show that shaw has been traveling quite a bit since he stopped working and engaging in social situations that do not reflect someone as depressed.
connecticut general then asked john billinsky,a psychiatrist and physician advisor,to conduct a peer review of shaw medical records and a interview with wilmoth.after the interview,billinsky reported on february,that wilmoth was vague and impressionistic in her responses to specific questions,and that she was unclear of the original circumstances of his work stress.on the one hand she perceives his mental and physical condition as being so brittle that he can not work,yet does not indicate any reservation about his traveling from florida to massachusetts to care for his ill mother.he also reported that wilmoth was uncertain whether shaw was also seeing a psychiatrist.billinsky pointed out that wilmoth diagnosis of depression corresponded to a diagnosis of dysthymic disorder,a chronic depressive disorder of mild to moderate severity that in and of itself does not generally result in significant functional impairment.he further opined that a n assertion by wilmoth that shaw is disabled on account of either diabetes or hypertension would be beyond the scope of her professional license.
connecticut general then obtained the office notes of durai,shaw treating physician.shaw attorney also sent to connecticut general a letter from durai,dated march,which stated in pertinent part 
shaw has been my patient for the past ten years.his medical problems include stress,hypertension and diabetes.shaw underwent major back surgery approximately two and a half years ago which kept him homebound for an extended period of time.his medical problems are aggravated by job stress.
it is my medical opinion that returning shaw to the work environment would be detrimental to his well being and not medically prudent.
on april,connecticut general approved payment of full benefits covering weeks,the maximum benefits period under the plan.the benefits covered the period beginning september,date following the end of shaw salary ending weeks later on march.
shaw then filed his claim for disability benefits and waiver of life insurance premium benefits,and connecticut general referred shaw claim to nurse morgan for a second review.she examined the medical records from durai and wrote that they document poor control of shaw diabetes and low blood count,but that her original recommendation still stood that t he medical information on file does not support shaw disabling condition.
connecticut general then referred the entire file,including shaw medical records and billinsky report,for still another medical review,to a second physician advisor,michael fitzpatrick.on june,fitzpatrick informed connecticut general that d iabetes and hypertension are chronic conditions and shaw is likely to have had these disorders f or some time although he apparently was able to work for many years w ithout a suggestion that work stress was adversely affecting his physical status.he further opined that t here is certainly no indication that shaw would be unable to work in another environment if he found his current work situation to be stressful.fitzpatrick also observed that shaw diabetes and hypertension had not previously prevented him from working,nor were there any criteria listed in wilmoth reports to support any finding that a psychiatric impairment would bar him from working.simply put,fitzpatrick findings mirrored the conclusions of billinsky and nurse morgan that shaw was not totally disabled.
on june,connecticut general formally denied shaw claim for disability benefits and waiver of life insurance premium benefits,concluding that the medical information provided does not support a psychiatric or physical condition s to be severe enough to support total disability from any occupation as defined under the long term disability and waiver of premium contracts.connecticut general invited shaw to submit additional information for its review.
thereafter,shaw attorney sought reconsideration,and on december,sent connecticut general additional information including a letter from the attorney observing that shaw had been found totally disabled by the social security administration durai complete medical file the medical records of nucci,who performed shaw back surgery in february and a psychiatric evaluation,dated november,from howard goldman,who conducted an evaluation of shaw at shaw request in order to support his claim 
connecticut general twice reaffirmed its denial by letters dated december,and january,concluding that the medical information submitted by shaw did not support a finding that he was totally disabled or unable to otherwise perform any occupation for which he was qualified.the december letter specifically observed that the new medical information submitted by shaw attorney was not sufficient to change the previous decision in part because m ost of th e information submitted was prior to the date shaw ceased working and it does not provide sufficient information to support his inability to work at the time he ceased working.it also said that a lthough goldman and nucci expressed an opinion that shaw was unable to work as of april,they provided no medical records showing they even treated shaw at that time.
on may,shaw sued connecticut general in the circuit court of the twelfth judicial circuit in sarasota county,florida,claiming that he was improperly denied disability benefits and waiver of life insurance premium benefits in violation of florida statute,which governs the timely payment of insurance claims.connecticut general removed the case to the united states district court for the middle district of florida,asserting that shaw state law claims were completely preempted by erisa.shaw then amended his complaint to assert erisa claims for plan benefits,breach of fiduciary and attorney fees.
the district court denied connecticut general motion to dismiss,and later both parties for summary judgment.the district court granted shaw motion and denied connecticut general.first,the district court found that the underlying insurance policy was the only erisa plan document and since that document did not grant discretion to the claims administrator,it applied a de novo standard of review to connecticut general decision to deny shaw disability benefits.the district court applied the de novo standard to both plan interpretations and factual rulings of the plan administration as well,citing firestone tire and rubber bruch,d.the district court then examined whether the claims administrator decision was wrong and unreasonable and determined that it was,explaining its ruling in these terms 
shaw had presented written opinions of total disability from three doctors and one psychologist,plus a finding of disability by social security.connecticut general had no direct medical evidence to refute these opinions.hence,the court finds its denial of benefits was wrong.
furthermore,it was unreasonable for connecticut general to reject out of hand shaw submitted medical opinions from doctors who had examined him and accept as true the concerns raised by those who had only reviewed the medical records.
the district court added that when a decision is both wrong and unreasonable,it also does not withstand the heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review,and that,had the court applied the arbitrary and capricious standard,it would have come to the same conclusion.ultimately,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of shaw and awarded him disability benefits.this appeal followed.
connecticut general argues on appeal that the district court erred by finding that the summary plan description was not a plan document to which the court could look for a grant of discretion failing to give deference to findings of fact by the plan administrator failing to uphold the decision to deny shaw disability benefits and violating connecticut general due process rights by granting summary judgment in favor of shaw under the de novo standard of review,without allowing connecticut general to present evidence not found in the administrative record or to shaw witnesses.
we review a summary judgment ruling de novo,view ing the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.burton city of belle glade,cir.a motion for summary judgment should be granted when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
erisa does not provide the standard to review decisions of a plan administrator or fiduciary.marecek bellsouth,cir citing firestone,at.at.instead,the united states supreme court established in firestone three distinct standards for reviewing administrators plan interpretations de novo where the plan does not grant the administrator discretion arbitrary and capricious where the plan grants the administrator discretion and heightened arbitrary and capricious where there is a conflict of interest.hca health servs.of,employers health ins,cir quoting buckley metro.life,cir.in order to determine the appropriate standard of review,a court is required to examine all of the plan documents.cagle bruner,cir emphasis added.if the court finds that the documents grant the claims administrator discretion,then at a minimum,the court applies arbitrary and capricious review and possibly heightened arbitrary and capricious review.hca health,at.
in this case,connecticut general suggests that there are two documents relating to the plan in the record the connecticut general group disability contract the underlying policy and the summary plan description the spd.the parties do not dispute that the underlying policy contains no express grant of discretion to the administrator and that absent any express grant,under controlling precedent,we apply a de novo standard of review to a claims administrator benefits decision.see,guy southeastern iron workers welfare fund,cir erisa actions must be reviewed de novo unless the plan expressly gives the administrator discretionary authority to make eligibility determinations or to construe the plan terms.emphasis added.
connecticut general points out that the spd in this case clearly gives the claims administrator broad discretion over plan interpretation.indeed,the spd expressly provides that connecticut general has the right to determine eligibility for benefits and to interpret the terms and provisions of the plan,and its decision is conclusive and binding,which is language that would ordinarily justify the deferential standard.see buce allianz life ins,cir affirming the district court application of heightened arbitrary and capricious review where the insurance policy summary plan description provided that t he insurance company has the exclusive right to interpret the provisions of the plan,so its decision is conclusive and binding citation omitted.however,under the very terms of the underlying policy,the modification contained within the spd is invalid.
to begin with,the underlying policy explicitly states no change in this contract will be valid unless approved by the insurance company and evidenced by endorsement on this contract or by amendments to this contract signed by the employer and by the insurance company,acting through its president,vice president,secretary or assistant secretary.this amendment procedure satisfies the requirements of the erisa statute and its regulations.see schoonejongen,d.see also b,a,and b.having created a particular procedure,it seems evident to us that the parties to the agreement must follow that procedure in order
