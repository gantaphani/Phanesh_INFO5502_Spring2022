until,petitioner cigna corporation pension plan provided a retiring employee with an annuity based on preretirement salary and length of service.its new plan replaced that annuity with a cash balance based on a defined annual contribution from cigna,increased by compound interest.the new plan translated benefits under the old plan into an opening amount in the cash balance account.respondents,on behalf of beneficiaries of the cigna pension plan also a petitioner,challenged the new plan adoption,claiming,as relevant here,that cigna notice of the changes was improper,particularly because the new plan in certain respects provided them with less generous benefits.the district court found that cigna disclosures violated its obligations under a,b,and h of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.in determining relief,it found that cigna notice defects had caused the employees likely harm.it then reformed the new plan and ordered cigna to pay benefits accordingly,finding its authority in erisa a b,which authorizes a plan participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action to recover benefits due under the terms of his plan.the second circuit affirmed.
although a b did not give the district court authority to reform cigna plan,relief is authorized by a,which allows a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary to obtain other appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of erisa or the plan terms.
a the court ordered relief in two steps.step it ordered the terms of the plan reformed.step it ordered cigna to enforce the plan as reformed.step orders recovery of the benefits provided by the terms of the reformed plan and is thus consistent with a b.however,that provision which speaks of enforc ing the plan terms,not changing them does not suggest that it authorizes a court to alter those terms here,where the change,akin to reforming a contract,seems less like the simple enforcement of a contract as written and more like an equitable remedy.nor can the court accept the solicitor general alternative rationale that the district court enforced the summary plan descriptions and that they are plan terms.that reading can not be squared with erisa a,which obliges plan administrators to furnish summary plan descriptions,but does not suggest that information about the plan provided by those disclosures is itself part of the plan.nothing in a b suggests the contrary.the solicitor general reading also can not be squared with the statute division of authority between a plan sponsor who,like a trust settlor,creates the plan basic terms and conditions,executes a written instrument containing those terms and conditions,and provides in that instrument a procedure for making amendments and the plan administrator a fiduciary who manages the plan,follows its terms in doing so,and provides participants with the summary plan descriptions.erisa carefully distinguishes these roles,and there is no reason to believe that the statute intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly in the summaries,even when,as here,the administrator is also the plan sponsor.finally,it is difficult to reconcile an interpretation that would make a summary language legally binding with the basic summary plan description objective of clear,simple communication.
b this court has interpreted a phrase appropriate equitable relief as referring to those categories of relief that,before the merger of law and equity,were typically available in equity.sereboff mid atlantic medical services.this case concerning a beneficiary suit against a plan fiduciary whom erisa typically treats as a trustee about the terms of a plan which erisa typically treats as a trust is the kind of lawsuit that,before the merger,could have been brought only in an equity court,where the remedies available were traditionally considered equitable remedies.the district court injunctions obviously fall within this category.the other relief it ordered closely resembles three forms of traditional equitable relief.first,what the court did here may be regarded as the reformation of the plan terms,in order to remedy false or misleading information cigna provided.the power to reform contracts is a traditional power of an equity court and is used to prevent fraud.second,the part of the remedy holding cigna to its promise that the new plan would not take from its employees previously accrued benefits resembles estoppel,also a traditional equitable remedy.third,the injunctions require the plan administrator to pay already retired beneficiaries money owed them under the plan as reformed.equity courts possessed the power to provide monetary compensation for a loss resulting from a trustee breach of duty,or to prevent the trustee unjust enrichment.that surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust committed by a fiduciary encompassing any violation of duty imposed on that fiduciary.
because a authorizes appropriate equitable relief for violations of erisa,the relevant standard of harm will depend on the equitable theory by which the district court provides relief.that court is to conduct the analysis in the first instance,but there are several equitable principles that it might apply on remand.neither erisa relevant substantive provisions nor a sets a particular standard for determining harm.and equity law provides no general principle that detrimental reliance must be proved before a remedy is decreed.to the extent any such requirement arises,it is because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes that requirement.thus,when a court exercises authority under a to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel,a showing of detrimental reliance must be made.however,equity courts did not insist on a detrimental reliance showing where they ordered reformation where a fraudulent suppression,omission,or insertion materially affected the substance of a contract.nor did they require a detrimental reliance showing when they ordered surcharge.they simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made whole following a trustee breach of trust.this flexible approach belies a strict detrimental reliance requirement.to be sure,a fiduciary can be surcharged under a only upon a showing of actual harm,and such harm may consist of detrimental reliance.but it might also come from the loss of a right protected by erisa or its antecedents.it is not difficult to imagine how the failure to provide proper summary information here,in violation of erisa,injured employees even if they did not themselves act in reliance on the summaries.thus,to obtain relief by surcharge for violations of a and b,a plan participant or beneficiary must show that the violation caused injury,but need show only actual harm and causation,not detrimental reliance.

cigna corporation,et,petitioners janice amara,et,individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
in,petitioner cigna corporation changed the nature of its basic pension plan for employees.previously,the plan provided a retiring employee with a defined benefit in the form of an annuity calculated on the basis of his preretirement salary and length of service.the new plan provided most retiring employees with a lump sum cash balance calculated on the basis of a defined annual contribution from cigna as increased by compound interest.because many employees had already earned at least some benefits,the new plan translated benefits into an opening amount in the employee cash balance account.
respondents,acting on behalf of approximately beneficiaries of the cigna pension plan which is also a petitioner here,challenged cigna adoption of the new plan.they claimed in part that cigna had failed to give them proper notice of changes to their benefits,particularly because the new plan in certain respects provided them with less generous benefits.see employee retirement income security act of erisa a,b,h,stat,as amended,a,b,h.
the district court agreed that the disclosures made by cigna violated its obligations under erisa.in determining relief,the court found that cigna notice failures had caused the employees likely harm.the court then reformed the new plan and ordered cigna to pay benefits accordingly.it found legal authority for doing so in erisa a b,a b authorizing a plan participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan 
we agreed to decide whether the district court applied the correct legal standard,namely,a likely harm standard,in determining that cigna notice violations caused its employees sufficient injury to warrant legal relief.to reach that question,we must first consider a more general matter whether the erisa section just mentioned erisa provision,a b authorizes entry of the relief the district court provided.we conclude that it does not authorize this relief.nonetheless,we find that a different erisa provision,to which the district court also referred,authorizes forms of relief similar to those that the court entered.a,a.
section a authorizes appropriate equitable relief for violations of erisa.accordingly,the relevant standard of harm will depend upon the equitable theory by which the district court provides relief.we leave it to the district court to conduct that analysis in the first instance,but we identify equitable principles that the court might apply on remand.
because our decision rests in important part upon the circumstances present here,we shall describe those circumstances in some detail.we still simplify in doing so.but the interested reader can find a more thorough description in two district court opinions,which set forth that court findings reached after a lengthy trial.see supp.supp.
under cigna retirement plan,an employee with at least five years service would receive an annuity annually paying an amount that depended upon the employee salary and length of service.depending on when the employee had joined cigna,the annuity would equal either percent of the employee average salary over his final three years with cigna,multiplied by the number of years worked up to or percent of the employee average salary over his final five years with cigna,multiplied by the number of years worked up to.calculated either way,the annuity would approach percent of a longtime employee final salary.a longtime employee,earning,say,per year,could receive a retirement annuity paying the employee about per year until his death.the plan offered many employees at least one other benefit they could retire early,at age,and receive an annuity.
in november,cigna sent its employees a newsletter announcing that it intended to put in place a new pension plan.the new plan would substitute an account balance plan for cigna system.app.emphasis deleted.the newsletter added that the old plan would end on december,that cigna would introduce and describe the new plan sometime during,and that the new plan would apply retroactively to january.
eleven months later cigna filled in the details.its new plan created an individual retirement account for each employee.the account consisted of a bookkeeping entry backed by a trust.each year cigna would contribute to the employee individual account an amount equal to between percent and percent of the employee salary,depending upon age,length of service,and certain other factors.the account balance would earn compound interest at a rate equal to the return on treasury bills plus percent but no less than percent and no greater than percent.upon retirement the employee would receive the amount then in his or her individual account in the form of either a lump sum or whatever annuity the lump sum then would buy.as promised,cigna would open the accounts and begin to make contributions as of january.
but what about the retirement benefits that employees had already earned prior to january,cigna promised to make an initial contribution to the individual account equal to the value of that employee already earned benefits.and the new plan set forth a method for calculating that initial contribution.the method consisted of calculating the amount as of the employee future retirement date of the annuity to which the employee salary and length of service already,as of december,entitled him and then discounting that sum to its present,january,value.
an example will help imagine an employee born on january,who joined cigna in january on his birthday,and who during the five years preceding the plan changeover earned an average salary of per year.as of january,the old plan would have entitled that employee to an annuity equal to times years then worked times percent,or per year when he retired in at age.the price of an annuity paying per year until death depends upon interest rates and mortality assumptions at that time.if we assume the annuity would pay percent until the holder death and we use the mortality assumptions used by the plan,see app.incorporating the mortality table prescribed by rul,cum.bull,then the price of such an annuity would be about.and cigna should initially deposit in this individual account on january,an amount that will grow to become,years later,in,when the individual retires.if we assume a percent average interest rate,then that amount presently,as of january,equals about.and with one further adjustment that we shall describe infra,at that is the amount,more or less,that the new plan transition rules would have required cigna initially to deposit.then cigna would make further annual deposits,and all the deposited amounts would earn compound interest.when the employee retired,he would receive the resulting lump sum.
the new plan also provided employees a guarantee an employee would receive upon retirement either the amount to which he or she had become entitled as of january,or the amount then in his or her individual account,whichever was greater.thus,the employee in our example would receive in no less than an annuity paying per year for life.
the district court found that cigna initial descriptions of its new plan were significantly incomplete and misled its employees.in november,for example,cigna sent the employees a newsletter that said the new plan would significantly enhance its retirement program,would produce an overall improvement in retirement benefits,and would provide the same benefit security with steadier benefit growth.app.cigna also told its employees that they would see the growth in their total retirement benefits from cigna every year,at,that its initial deposit represent ed the full value of the benefit they earned for service before,record exh,and that o ne advantage the company will not get from the retirement program changes is cost savings.app.
in fact,the new plan saved the company million annually though cigna later said it devoted the savings to other employee benefits.its initial deposit did not represen t the full value of the benefit that employees had earned for service before.and the plan made a significant number of employees worse off in at least the following specific ways 
first,the initial deposit calculation ignored the fact that the old plan offered many cigna employees the right to retire early beginning at age with only somewhat reduced benefits.this right was valuable.for example,as of january,respondent janice amara had earned vested retirement benefits of per month,but cigna initial deposit in her individual retirement account ignoring this benefit would have allowed her at age to buy an annuity benefit of only per month.
second,as we previously indicated but did not explain,supra at,the new plan adjusted cigna initial deposit downward to account for the fact that,unlike the old plan lifetime annuity,an employee survivors would receive the new plan benefits namely,the amount in the employee individual account even if the employee died before retiring.the downward adjustment consisted of multiplying the deposit by the probability that the employee would live until retirement a percent probability in the example of our,supra,at.and that meant that cigna initial deposit in our example the amount that was supposed to grow to by would be less than,not the number we computed.the employee,of course,would receive a benefit in return namely,a form of life insurance.but at least some employees might have preferred the retirement benefit and consequently could reasonably have thought it important to know that the new plan traded away of their benefits for a life insurance policy that they might not have wanted.
third,the new plan shifted the risk of a fall in interest rates from cigna to its employees.under the old plan,cigna had to buy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specified sum irrespective of whether falling interest rates made it more expensive for cigna to pay for that annuity.and falling interest rates also meant that any sum cigna set aside to buy that annuity would grow more slowly over time,thereby requiring cigna to set aside more money to make any specific sum available at retirement.under the new plan cigna did not have to buy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specific sum.the employee would simply receive whatever sum his account contained.and falling interest rates meant that the account lump sum would earn less money each year after the employee retired.annuities,for example,would become more expensive any fixed purchase price paying for less annual income.at the same time falling interest meant that the individual account would grow more slowly over time,leaving the employee with less money at retirement.
of course,interest rates might rise instead of fall,leaving cigna employees better off under the new plan.but the latter advantage does not cancel out the former disadvantage,for most individuals are risk averse.and that means that most of cigna employees would have preferred that cigna,rather than they,bear these risks.
the amounts likely involved are significant.if,in our example,interest rates between and averaged percent rather than the percent we assumed,and if in annuities paid percent rather than the percent we assumed,then cigna would have had to make an initial deposit of not to assure that employee the annual annuity payment to which he had already become entitled.indeed,that that cigna would have contributed leaving aside the problem would have provided enough money to buy in an annuity that assured the employee an annual payment of only about rather than.
we recognize that the employee in our example like others might have continued to work for cigna after january,and he would thereby eventually have earned a pension that,by the time of his retirement,was worth far more than.but that is so because cigna made an additional contribution for each year worked after january.if interest rates fell as they did,it would take the employee several additional years of work simply to catch up under the new plan to where he had already been under the old plan as of january,a phenomenon known in pension jargon as wear away,see supp,at referring to respondents requiring to years to catch up.
the district court found that cigna told its employees nothing about any of these features of the new plan which individually and together made clear that cigna descriptions of the plan were incomplete and inaccurate.the district court also found that cigna intentionally misled its employees.a focus group and many employees asked cigna,for example,to d isclose details about the plan,to provide individual comparisons,or to show a n actual projection for retirement.at.but cigna did not do so.instead in the words of one internal document,it focus ed on not providing employees before and after samples of the pension plan changes.at.
the district court concluded,as a matter of law,that cigna representations and omissions about the plan,made between november when it announced the plan and december when it put the plan into effect violated 
a erisa h,implemented by reg.d,cfr d,which as it existed at the relevant time forbade an amendment of a pension plan that would provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator also sent a written notice that provided either the text of the amendment or summarized its likely effects,h ed.amended reg.d,fed.reg.and 
b erisa a and b,which require a plan administrator to provide beneficiaries with summary plan descriptions and with summaries of material modifications,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,that are sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan,a,b ed.and supp.iii.
the district court then turned to the remedy.first,the court agreed with cigna that only employees whom cigna disclosure failures had harmed could obtain relief.but it did not require each individual member of the relevant cigna employee class to show individual injury.rather,it found that the evidence presented had raised a presumption of likely harm suffered by the members of the relevant employee class,and that cigna,though free to offer contrary evidence in respect to some or all of those employees,had failed to rebut that presumption.it concluded that this unrebutted showing was sufficient to warrant relief.
second,the court noted that h had been interpreted by the second circuit to permit the invalidation of plan amendments not preceded by a proper notice,prior to the amendment that made this power explicit.supp,at citing frommert conkright,see h ed.entitling participants to benefits without regard to the amendment in case of an egregious failure but the court also thought that granting this relief here would harm,not help,the injured employees.that is because the notice failures all concerned the new plan that took effect in december.the court thought that the notices in respect to the freezing of benefits,effective december,were valid.to strike the new plan while leaving in effect the frozen old plan would not help cigna employees.
the court considered treating the november notice as a sham or treating that notice and the later notices as part and parcel of a single set of related events.but it pointed out that respondents ha d argued none of these things.supp,at.and it said that the court would not make these arguments now on respondents behalf.ibid.
third,the court reformed the terms of the new plan guarantee.it erased the portion that assured participants who retired the greater of a that which they had already earned as of december,under the old plan,in our example or b that which they would earn via cigna annual deposits under the new plan,including cigna initial deposit.and it substituted a provision that would guarantee each employee a that which they had already earned,as of december,under the old plan plus b that which they would earn via cigna annual deposits under the new plan,excluding cigna initial deposit.in our example,the district court remedy would no longer force our employee to choose upon retirement either an annuity or his new plan benefits including both cigna annual deposits and cigna initial deposit.it would give him an annuity plus his new plan benefits with cigna annual deposits but without cigna initial deposit.
fourth,the court order ed and enjoin ed the cigna plan to reform its records to reflect that all class members now receive the just described a b benefits,and that it pay appropriate benefits to those class members who had already retired,at.
fifth,the court held that erisa a b provided the legal authority to enter this relief.that provision states that a civil action may be brought by a plan participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.a b.the court wrote that its orders in effect awarded benefits under the terms of the plan as reformed.supp,at.
at the same time the court considered whether erisa a also provided legal authority to enter this relief.that provision states that a civil action may be brought 
by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.a emphasis added.
the district court decided not to answer this question because it had just decided that the same relief was available under a b,regardless,varity howe,and the supreme court has issued several opinions that have severely curtailed the kinds of relief that are available under a,supp,at citing sereboff mid atlantic medical services,life annuity ins.knudson,and mertens hewitt associates.
the parties the district court judgment.the court of appeals for the second circuit issued a brief summary order,rejecting all their claims,and affirming the judgment of the district court for substantially the reasons stated in the district court and scholarly opinions.fed.appx.the parties filed for writs of certiorari in this court.we granted the request in cigna petition to consider whether a showing of likely harm is sufficient to entitle plan participants to recover benefits based on faulty disclosures.
cigna in the merits briefing raises a preliminary question.brief for petitioners.it argues first and foremost that the statutory provision upon which the district court rested its orders,namely,the provision for recovery of plan benefits,a b,does not in fact authorize the district court to enter the kind of relief it entered here.and for that reason,cigna argues,whether the district court did or did not use a proper standard for determining harm is beside the point.we believe that this preliminary question is closely enough related to the question presented that we shall consider it at the outset.
the district court ordered relief in two steps.step it ordered the terms of the plan reformed so that they provided an a plus b,rather than a greater of a or b guarantee.step it ordered the plan administrator which it found to be cigna to enforce the plan as reformed.one can fairly describe step as consistent with a b,for that provision grants a participant the right to bring a civil action to recover benefits due under the terms of his plan.a b.and step orders recovery of the benefits provided by the terms of the plan as reformed.
but what about step where does a b grant a court the power to change the terms of the plan as they previously existed the statutory language speaks of enforc ing the terms of the plan,not of changing them.a l b emphasis added.the provision allows a court to look outside the plan written language in deciding what those terms are,what the language means.see unum life ins.of america ward,permitting the insurance terms of an plan to be interpreted in light of state insurance rules.but we have found nothing suggesting that the provision authorizes a court to alter those terms,at least not in present circumstances,where that change,akin to the reform of a contract,seems less like the simple enforcement of a contract as written and more like an equitable remedy.see infra,at.
nor can we accept the solicitor general alternative rationale seeking to justify the use of this provision.the solicitor general says that the district court did enforce the plan terms as written,adding that the plan includes the disclosures that constituted the summary plan descriptions.in other words,in the view of the solicitor general,the terms of the summaries are terms of the plan.
even if the district court had viewed the summaries as plan terms which it did not,see supra,at,however,we can not agree that the terms of statutorily required plan summaries or summaries of plan modifications necessarily may be enforced under a b as the terms of the plan itself.for one thing,it is difficult to square the solicitor general reading of the statute with erisa a,the provision that obliges plan administrators to furnish summary plan descriptions.the syntax of that provision,requiring that participants and beneficiaries be advised of their rights and obligations under the plan,suggests that the information about the plan provided by those disclosures is not itself part of the plan.see a.nothing in a b or,as far as we can tell,anywhere else suggests the contrary.
nor do we find it easy to square the solicitor general reading with the statute division of authority between a plan sponsor and the plan administrator.the plan sponsor,the employer,like a trust settlor,creates the basic terms and conditions of the plan,executes a written instrument containing those terms and conditions,and provides in that instrument a procedure for making amendments.the plan administrator,a fiduciary,manages the plan,follows its terms in doing so,and provides participants with the summary documents that describe the plan and modifications in readily understandable form.a,a,a,a,ed.and supp.iii.here,the district court found that the same entity,cigna,filled both roles.see supp,at.but that is not always the case.regardless,we have found that erisa carefully distinguishes these roles.see,varity,at.and we have no reason to believe that the statute intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly by including them in the summary plan descriptions.see schoonejongen.
finally,we find it difficult to reconcile the solicitor general interpretation with the basic summary plan description objective clear,simple communication.see a,a,a,a ed.to make the language of a plan summary legally binding could well lead plan administrators to sacrifice simplicity and comprehensibility in order to describe plan terms in the language of lawyers.consider the difference between a will and the summary of a will or between a property deed and its summary.consider,too,the length of part i of this opinion,and then consider how much longer part i would have to be if we had to include all the qualifications and nuances that a plan drafter might have found important and feared to omit lest they lose all legal significance.the district court opinions take up pages of the federal supplement.none of this is to say that plan administrators can avoid providing complete and accurate summaries of plan terms in the manner required by erisa and its implementing regulations.but we fear that the solicitor general rule might bring about complexity that would defeat the fundamental purpose of the summaries.
for these reasons taken together we conclude that the summary documents,important as they are,provide communication with beneficiaries about the plan,but that their statements do not themselves constitute the terms of the plan for purposes of a b.we also conclude that the district court could not find authority in that section to reform cigna plan as written.
if a b does not authorize entry of the relief here at issue,what about nearby a that provision allows a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary to obtain other appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of here relevant parts of erisa or the terms of the plan.a emphasis added.the district court strongly implied,but did not directly hold,that it would base its relief upon this subsection were it not for the fact that the preceding plan benefits due provision,a b,provided sufficient authority and certain cases from this court that narrowed the application of the term appropriate equitable relief,see,mertens.our holding in part,supra,removes the district court first obstacle.and given the likelihood that,on remand,the district court will turn to and rely upon this alternative subsection,we consider the court second concern.we find that concern misplaced.
we have interpreted the term appropriate equitable relief in a as referring to those categories of relief that,traditionally speaking,prior to the merger of law and equity were typically available in equity.sereboff,at quoting mertens,at.in mertens,we applied this principle to a claim seeking money damages brought by a beneficiary against a private firm that provided a trustee with actuarial services.we found that the plaintiff sought nothing other than compensatory damages against a nonfiduciary,at,emphasis deleted.and we held that such a claim,traditionally speaking,was legal,not equitable,in nature,at.
in,we considered a claim brought by a fiduciary against a beneficiary seeking monetary reimbursement for medical outlays that the plan had previously made on the beneficiary behalf.we noted that the fiduciary sought to obtain a lien attaching to or a constructive trust imposed upon money that the beneficiary had received from the defendant.but we noted that the money in question was not the particular money that the tort defendant had paid.and,traditionally speaking,relief that sought a lien or a constructive trust was legal relief,not equitable relief,unless the funds in question were particular funds or property in the defendant possession.at emphasis added.
the case before us concerns a suit by a beneficiary against a plan fiduciary whom erisa typically treats as a trustee about the terms of a plan which erisa typically treats as a trust.see larue dewolff,boberg associates,varity,at.it is the kind of lawsuit that,before the merger of law and equity,respondents could have brought only in a court of equity,not a court of law.scott,fratcher,ascher,trusts,ed.hereinafter scott ascher trusts are,and always have been,the bailiwick of the courts of equity duvall craig,wheat,a trustee was only suable in equity 
with the exception of the relief now provided by a b,restatement second of trusts hereinafter second restatement scott ascher,the remedies available to those courts of equity were traditionally considered equitable remedies,see second restatement adams,doctrine of equity a commentary on the law as administered by the court of chancery am.ed.hereinafter adams scott ascher.
the district court affirmative and negative injunctions obviously fall within this category.mertens,supra,at identifying injunctions,mandamus,and restitution as equitable relief.and other relief ordered by the district court resembles forms of traditional equitable relief.that is because equity chancellors developed a host of other distinctively equitable remedies remedies that were fitted to the nature of the primary right they were intended to protect.symons,pomeroy equity jurisprudence,ed.hereinafter pomeroy.see generally story,commentaries on equity jurisprudence ed.hereinafter story.indeed,a maxim of equity states that e quity suffers not a right to be without a remedy.francis,maxims of equity am.ed.and the relief entered here,insofar as it does not consist of injunctive relief,closely resembles three other traditional equitable remedies.
first,what the district court did here may be regarded as the reformation of the terms of the plan,in order to remedy the false or misleading information cigna provided.the power to reform contracts as contrasted with the power to enforce contracts as written is a traditional power of an equity court,not a court of law,and was used to prevent fraud.see baltzer raleigh augusta,i t is well settled that equity would reform the contract,and enforce it,as reformed,if the mistake or fraud were shown hearne marine ins,wall,the reformation of written contracts for fraud or mistake is an ordinary head of equity jurisdiction bradford union bank of,how,eaton,handbook of equity jurisprudence,hereinafter eaton courts of common law could only void or enforce,but not reform,a contract pomeroy,at reformation chiefly occasioned by fraud or mistake,which were themselves concerns of equity courts story see also pomeroy,at equity often considered a preparatory step that establishes the real contract 
second,the district court remedy essentially held cigna to what it had promised,namely,that the new plan would not take from its employees benefits they had already accrued.this aspect of the remedy resembles estoppel,a traditional equitable remedy.see,merwin,principles of equity and equity pleading merwin ed.pomeroy.equitable estoppel operates to place the person entitled to its benefit in the same position he would have been in had the representations been true.eaton,at.and,as justice story long ago pointed out,equitable estoppel forms a very essential element in fair dealing,and rebuke of all fraudulent misrepresentation,which it is the boast of courts of equity constantly to promote.story,at.
third,the district court injunctions require the plan administrator to pay to already retired beneficiaries money owed them under the plan as reformed.but the fact that this relief takes the form of a money payment does not remove it from the category of traditionally equitable relief.equity courts possessed the power to provide relief in the form of monetary compensation for a loss resulting from a trustee breach of duty,or to prevent the trustee unjust enrichment.restatement third of trusts,and comment a tent.draft,hereinafter third restatement eaton,at.indeed,prior to the merger of law and equity this kind of monetary remedy against a trustee,sometimes called a surcharge,was exclusively equitable.princess lida of thurn and taxis thompson,third restatement,and comment a bogert bogert,trusts and trustees ed.hereinafter bogert scott ascher,at,second restatement see also manhattan bank of memphis walker,the suit is plainly one of equitable cognizance,the bill being filed to charge the defendant,as a trustee,for a breach of trust perry,a treatise on the law of trusts and trustees,ed.attempts to punish trustees for a breach of trust in damages,w ere soon abandoned 
the surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust committed by a fiduciary encompassing any violation of a duty imposed upon that fiduciary.see second restatement adams pomeroy story.thus,insofar as an award of relief is concerned,the fact that the defendant in this case,unlike the defendant in mertens,is analogous to a trustee makes a critical difference.see,at.in sum,contrary to the district court fears,the types of remedies the court entered here fall within the scope of the term appropriate equitable relief in a.
section a invokes the equitable powers of the district court.we can not know with certainty which remedy the district court understood itself to be imposing,nor whether the district court will find it appropriate to exercise its discretion under a to impose that remedy on remand.we need not decide which remedies are appropriate on the facts of this case in order to resolve the parties dispute as to the appropriate legal standard in determining whether members of the relevant employee class were injured.
the relevant substantive provisions of erisa do not set forth any particular standard for determining harm.they simply require the plan administrator to write and to distribute written notices that are sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise plan participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.a see also b,h.nor can we find a definite standard in the erisa provision,a which authorizes the court to enter appropriate equitable relief to redress erisa violations hence any requirement of harm must come from the law of equity.
looking to the law of equity,there is no general principle that detrimental reliance must be proved before a remedy is decreed.to the extent any such requirement arises,it is because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes such a requirement.thus,as cigna points out,when equity courts used the remedy of estoppel,they insisted upon a showing akin to detrimental reliance,that the defendant statement in truth,influenced the conduct of the plaintiff,causing prejudic e.eaton,at see pomeroy.accordingly,when a court exercises its authority under a to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel,a showing of detrimental reliance must be made.
but this showing is not always necessary for other equitable remedies.equity courts,for example,would reform contracts to reflect the mutual understanding of the contracting parties where fraudulent suppression s,omission s,or insertion s,story,at,material ly affect ed the substance of the contract,even if the complaining part y was negligent in not realizing its mistake,as long as its negligence did not fall below a standard of reasonable prudence and violate a legal duty.pomeroy,at,see baltzer,at eaton b.
nor did equity courts insist upon a showing o
