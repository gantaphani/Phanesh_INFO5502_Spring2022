halline overby,an annuitant in a retirement trust fund operated by national association of letter carriers nalc,and his wife paulette overby brought suit in district court seeking a declaration that a purported amendment to the trust plan which would have rendered paulette overby ineligible to receive benefits under the plan as a surviving spouse was not properly adopted and is therefore inoperative.the district court found that the trustees of the plan had not submitted the amendment to the fund actuaries for an evaluation and estimate of its cost,as required by the governing provisions of the plan,and therefore held that the amendment was not properly adopted.nalc appeals,arguing that the district court erred both in its findings of fact and in its conclusions of law upon review,for the reasons more fully set forth below,we hold that the district court committed no reversible error in either its factual determinations or in its conclusions of law.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the national association of letter carriers nalc is a national labor union which sponsors a retirement plan,the national association of letter carriers annuity trust fund atf or plan.the atf is a qualifying plan under the employee retirement income security act of,et.erisa.the plan provides retirement annuities for nalc national officers,national business agents,certain branch officers,headquarters employees,and employees of nalc health plan,though not postal carriers themselves.the president of nalc serves as the plan administrator for the atf,and the board of trustees of nalc has oversight responsibilities for the plan.
appellee halline overby became a letter carrier in.he was elected president of his local union in.halline overby then joined nalc board of trustees in.when he joined the board of trustees,he also became a participant in the atf and has remained so ever since.over his career of working for nalc,he has been a trustee of the atf,a member of the executive council,and the assistant secretary treasurer.halline overby retired from nalc on october,and began receiving his annuity payments on february.in may of,he married paulette overby,his in the district court and before this court.
one provision of the plan provides a benefit to a surviving spouse of a deceased annuitant,calculated at of the benefits of the deceased.when overby experienced serious health difficulties in the late,overby,concerned about her own financial stability,inquired into life insurance and survivorship benefits.nalc accounting office informed her that she would not be eligible to receive surviving spouse benefits because a purported amendment to the plan made in changed the definition of surviving spouse.
the parties agree that prior to the purported amendment,the plan followed a rule,under which the surviving spouse was one to whom the annuitant was married for at least one year immediately preceding the annuitant death,or is the parent of issue by such marriage.overby ass of letter carriers,d.in order to qualify as a surviving spouse under the purported amendment,a claimant must be one to whom the annuitant was married for at least the year immediately preceding and ending on the annuitant annuity commencement date.id.however,the parties dispute whether the plan was effectively amended to replace the rule with the methodology for determining who qualifies as a surviving spouse.
after receiving the bad news,the overbys brought the instant action,seeking a declaration that,inter alia,the alleged amendment to the survivor annuity rule was not adopted in accordance with the plan amendment procedures in article ix,section i,as amended,and is therefore invalid.pls.compl.the district court received evidence on the requirements of the plan and the purported adoption of the surviving spouse amendment.considering the evidence in the light of the requirements of erisa,the court held that the amendment had not been properly adopted,that the amendment was therefore ineffective,and that paulette overby would qualify as a surviving spouse under the plan in its unamended form.overby ass of letter carriers,d.nalc appeals.
ii.analysis 
amendment of the plan 
as the district court held,erisa requires in b that every employee benefit plan provide a procedure for amending such plan,and for identifying the persons who have authority to amend the plan.d at quoting b.the statute is silent as to the level of detail and as to the nature of procedural requirements,but t he provision requires that there be an amendment procedure.schoonejongen,d emphasis in original.the statutory scheme further follows standard trust law principles in dictating only that whatever level of specificity an employer ultimately chooses,in an amendment procedure or elsewhere,it is bound to that level.id.at.therefore,as the district court correctly held,a proposed amendment not done in accordance with a plan amendment procedure is ineffective and does not amend a plan.d at citing,inter alia,at.
as the statute requires,the atf plan includes a formal amendment procedure.that procedure includes the following three requirements 
the trustees must first submit the proposed amendment to the fund actuaries for an evaluation and estimate of its cost 
the trustees must then adopt the proposed amendment and 
nalc executive council must then approve the proposed amendment.
id.at.the district court held that on the evidence before it the trustees had not met the first of those requirements that is,they had not submitted the proposed amendment to the fund actuaries for an evaluation and estimate of its cost.the district court therefore held that the amendment had not been validly adopted,and that the effective definition of surviving spouse would entitle paulette overby to that status should she survive halline while still married to him.
appellants do not challenge the district court ruling as to the nature of the amendment process required under the plan,but challenge its conclusions on two principal bases.first,they contend that the district court did not have sufficient evidence to have reached the finding that the amendment was not submitted to the actuaries,as required by the amendment process.second,they contend that even if the court had sufficient evidence for the finding,it nonetheless erred in its conclusion that this invalidated the amendment.before considering appellants other assignments of error,we will dispose of these two principal arguments in turn.
the sufficiency of the evidence 
we note at the outset that an appellant seeking reversal of a trial court findings of fact in a bench trial faces a daunting task.such findings,whether based on oral or other evidence,must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility.a.we further note that t his standard applies to the inferences drawn from findings of fact as well as to the findings themselves.halberstam welch.cases addressing the question of the sufficiency of evidence to support a trial court findings are similar.we will determine that the evidence is sufficient if a reasonable fact finder could have reached the conclusion adopted by the trial court.anderson city of bessemer city,d if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.appellants have not met this standard.
appellants argue that the district court based its finding that the married at commencement amendment was never submitted for an actuarial cost review on the fact that the review is not explicitly mentioned in either the april,trustee meeting minutes or the contemporaneous notes of nalc outside counsel,jani rachelson.appellants br.it is true that one of the evidentiary bases relied upon by the trial court was the undeniable fact that the submission of the proposed amendment for the actuarial cost review was never mentioned at all in the minutes of the meeting a
