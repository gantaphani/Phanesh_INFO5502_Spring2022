plaintiff celeslie is a former employee of defendant merck merck,who participated in merck long term disability plan for union employees the plan at times relevant,merck,as overall plan administrator,had delegated responsibility for claims administration to defendant unum life insurance company of america unum following an injury and a diagnosis of sarcoidosis and fibromyalgia,applied for and received disability ltd benefits from the defendants in.during a periodic review conducted in,the defendants terminated benefits,finding that she was no longer totally disabled under the terms of the plan.during the course of the plan administrative appeals process,merck requested that undergo an independent medical examination,and designated a pulmonologist,gautam dev,to evaluate her.dev report contradicted treating physicians diagnoses,and on this basis the defendants upheld their denial of continued benefits.then filed this suit under a b,seeking benefits allegedly due her under the terms of the plan.
claim survived summary judgment,and the district court held a.a bench trial on a stipulated documentary record.the court concluded that under pinto reliance standard life insurance,cir,and its progeny,the structural arrangement among merck,the plan,and unum did not warrant a departure from the traditional arbitrary and capricious standard of review over erisa plan fiduciaries discretionary decisions regarding benefits.turning to the merits of claim,the district court found,principally because of dev report,that the defendants denial of benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.
on appeal,we concentrate on the district court first conclusion.we agree with the district court that the record in this case does not support finding a financial conflict of interest which,under pinto s sliding scale approach,would warrant a standard of judicial review less deferential than arbitrary and capricious review,and that delegation by merck to unum of claims administration would ordinarily preclude heightened review.however,there is evidence of procedural bias in merck intervention in the appeals process to request an independent medical exam.this is especially problematic because the record before the defendants prior to dev examination provided reasonably sound as well as unequivocal support for claim for benefits the choice to request a third medical opinion therefore strongly suggests a desire to generate evidence to counter physicians diagnoses.because merck intervention,notwithstanding its delegation of claims administration to a large and experienced carrier,undermines the defendants claim to the deference normally accorded an erisa plan fiduciary with discretionary authority,we conclude that the district court should have applied a moderately heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review.additionally,with respect to the merits,the district court failed to address fibromyalgia diagnosis,an omission which itself alone would require a new trial.for these reasons,we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for a new trial.
factual background and procedural history 
although the district court,which rendered its opinion following a.a bench trial on a stipulated documentary record,gave a lengthy account of the parties factual contentions,it by and large did not make findings of fact as required by rule a.as such,what follows is not so much the district court factual findings as it is our own summary of the record before us.
medical history 
was employed by merck as a cook and attendant.she suffered an injury at work in,and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia,chronic pain syndrome,and sarcoidosis she was granted disability benefits by the defendants in october.in october,she was approved for ltd benefits,but was reminded that periodic requests for medical information would be made in the future to ensure continued eligibility,to determine that she continued to be completely disabled under the plan.around the same time,applied for social security disability benefits.in,an administrative law judge overruled the social security administration ssa initial determination denying her social security benefits,and awarded her social security disability benefits,finding her permanently disabled.
benefits were provided under the terms of the merck.long term disability plan for union employees,an erisa plan.by the plan terms,merck shall pay the cost of the benefits provided under the plan,though the plan gives discretion to the management pension investment committee to choose any funding method,or combination of funding methods which are permissible under erisa.the district court found that no evidence was introduced on how merck actually funded the plan,and the parties do not dispute this on appeal.the plan allocates fiduciary responsibility among a committee of merck board of directors which has certain powers of appointment the merck management pension investment committee which is responsible for the investment and management of plan funds and merck itself,which is the plan administrator.as plan administrator,merck has the power to appoint a claims administrator,who shall determine claims for benefits by participants under the plan.at the time ltd benefits were first granted,thomas jacob associates tlj was merck appointed claims administrator later,appellee unum was the claims administrator.notwithstanding this appointment,the plan confers on merck as plan administrator the powers to construe the plan to decide all questions of eligibility and to request and receive from all participants such information as is necessary for the proper administration of the plan.
termination of ltd benefits 
in may,as part of a periodic review of benefits,unum requested information from her treating physicians,panullo and david williams.panullo was gynecologist.disability is not related to any gynecological condition,so panullo reports are they seem to have been misunderstood by unum,at some points,to indicate that was entirely able to work,when they in fact say only that no gynecological problems prevented from working.we therefore say no more about panullo.
williams notes from january,refer to sarcoidosis and her fibromyalgia.according to his notes,the sarcoidosis had been diagnosed by a bronchoscopy the record does not disclose when the initial fibromyalgia diagnosis was made.williams june,notes state that s arcoidosis is her diagnosis as well as fibromyalgia,and he indicated that she was being medicated for fibromyalgia.in response to an unum questionnaire dated october,williams stated that was disabled to light activity because of shortness of breath and that his prognosis for her to return to gainful employment on a basis or basis was never.
unum informed on december,that it was terminating her benefits.the letter explained that a review of medical documentation,including information from panullo and williams,led unum to conclude that she no longer met the definition of being unable to perform any and every duty of her occupation,as required by the plan.the letter also stated that there is no evidence to support that you are medically incapable to perform the duties of your occupation.the letter further informed that she would have to come forward with objective medical evidence of her disability.
administratively appealed this decision.she provided additional information to unum,including the name of her new treating physician,fred mcqueen.mcqueen repeated the fibromyalgia diagnosis,stated s he can not return to gainful employment,and that he did not feel it in her best interest to be under any stress due to triggering her sarcoid remission.mcqueen concluded permanently totally disabled.suffers with severe anxiety.she can not cope with stress.
upon receiving mcqueen report,unum wrote to stating that merck company has requested an independent medical exam.the defendants designated dev to perform the examination.we rescribe dev report in the margin in sum,dev concluded that a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was incompatible with her clinical presentation,that he disagreed with the sarcoidosis diagnosis.he did not opine on her fibromyalgia diagnosis.based on dev report,unum upheld its decision denying benefits.
proceedings before the district court 
filed this suit,seeking benefits allegedly due her under the terms of the plan under a b,and other relief.merck counterclaimed to recoup,under the terms of the plan,the social security disability benefits had received.the counterclaim was settled,and the district court denied summary judgment on a b claim.the case therefore proceeded to a trial on the merits,which was conducted as a.a bench trial on a stipulated documentary record.canvassing pinto reliance standard life insurance,cir,and its progeny,the district court first concluded that an arbitrary and capricious standard of review applied to its judicial review of the defendants denial of benefits.the court then concluded that their denial of benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.it therefore entered judgment for the defendants.
ii.our standard of review over the district court decision 
in the era,we appear to have had only one case in the same procedural posture as this one,an appeal from a bench trial.in goldstein johnson johnson,cir,we stated without further elaboration or citation that in such an appeal w e have plenary review over a district court conclusions of law,and we review its factual conclusions for clear error.this is,of course,the usual standard of review on appeal from a bench trial.see in re unisys savings plan,cir.determining the proper standard of judicial review under pinto is a question of applying law to fact accordingly,our review is plenary,though we review a district court underlying factual findings only for clear error.because we conclude the district court applied too deferential a standard of judicial review,we do not reach the merits of claim.
iii.standard of judicial review over unum determination of claim 
our principal task is to determine whether the district court applied the appropriate standard of judicial review to the defendants decision to deny ltd benefits to.we begin with a discussion of pinto and our cases following it,and then turn to the proper standard of judicial review in this case.
pinto and its progeny 
we held in pinto that,in reviewing an erisa plan fiduciary discretionary determination regarding benefits,a court must take into account the existence of the structural conflict of interest present when a financially interested entity also makes benefit determinations.specifically,we adopted a sliding scale approach,in which district courts must consider the nature and degree of apparent conflicts with a view to shaping their arbitrary and capricious review of the benefits determinations of discretionary decisionmakers.pinto,at.this sliding scale method intensif ies the degree of scrutiny to match the degree of the conflict.id.at.
pinto offered a nonexclusive list of factors to consider in assessing whether a structural conflict of interest warranting heightened review exists.the approach allows each case to be examined on its facts.id.at.among the factors we identified were the sophistication of the parties,the information accessible to the parties,and the exact financial arrangement between the insurer and the company.id.also relevant is the current status of the fiduciary,whether the decisionmaker is a current employer,former employer,or insurer.our cases have addressed various combinations of these factors.in pinto itself,we concluded that heightened arbitrary and capricious review,id.at,or review on the far end of the arbitrary and capricious range,id.at,was appropriate because pinto insurer both made benefits determinations and funded the benefits,and because of various procedural anomalies that tended to suggest that whenever it was at a crossroads,the insurer defendant chose the decision disfavorable to pinto.id.
turning to pinto s progeny,we first note that in some cases the parties stipulate to the applicable standard of judicial review,or at least do not contest the district court choice of a standard of review.see,mcleod hartford life accident ins,cir orvosh program of group ins.for salaried employees of volkswagen of,cir.other cases,though they cite pinto,are factually too far removed from the facts of this case to provide meaningful guidance.see,goldstein,unfunded executive deferred compensation,or top hat,plan.
while pinto addressed the case of an insurer both making benefits determinations and paying claims,it did not definitively decide whether any form of heightened review applies to employers both making benefits determinations and paying claims.when an employer pays claims out of its general operating situation most likely to introduce a structural conflict because the employer feels an immediate sting from paying a plan is referred to as unfunded or sometimes.this is in contrast to the typical pension plan which is set up to be actuarially grounded,with the company making fixed contributions to the pension fund.pinto,at.
we confronted but were ultimately able to avoid ruling on the issue of whether heightened review applies to employers making benefits determinations and paying claims in skretvedt dupont de nemours,cir.that case concerned among other things an unfunded benefit plan,and noted that a heightened standard of review might be applicable to the board denial of skretvedt claim for the unfunded benefits,because of the potential conflict under pinto.id.at.we reached this question less than a year later,in smathers.employee health welfare plan,cir.in smathers,we concluded that an employer unfunded and benefits plan presented a conflict that,though not extraordinary,did warrant somewhat heightened scrutiny,requiring a more penetrating review of the administrator decisionmaking process than would normally be conducted under the arbitrary and capricious standard.id.at.most recently,we approved a district court holding that the unfunded and benefit plan in stratton dupont de nemours,cir,warranted only a slightly heightened form of arbitrary and capricious review.
as we noted in pinto itself,the financial and administrative relationship between the employer and the benefit plan is not the only relevant consideration.for example,in stratton,we observed that while an employer administering an unfunded plan may have a financial incentive to deny the claims of its employees,it thereby risks the loss of morale and higher wage demands that could result from denials of benefits.at quoting nazay miller,cir see also smathers,at pinto,at.we have recognized the inverse as well when a former employee seeks benefits,this consideration is not present.see smathers,at since smathers was no longer an employee when made its decision to deny his claims,the counterbalancing of its monetary by possible concerns about the impact of its decision on morale and wage demands would thereby be lessened.
indeed,we made the general point about the of incentives by imperfect information flow in pinto itself 
m any claims for benefits are made after individuals have left active employment and are seeking pension or disability benefits.details about the handling of those claims,whether responsible or irresponsible,are unlikely to seep into the collective knowledge of employees.if pinto claim is denied,few at will learn of it,and reliance standard will have little motive to heed the economic advice of the seventh circuit that it is a poor business decision to resist paying meritorious claims for benefits.
at quoting mers marriott int l group accidental death dismemberment plan,cir see also id.at noting the relevance of the current relationship between the fiduciary and beneficiary.in short,our precedents recognize that the situation of an individual claiming benefits from her former employer may,for pinto purposes,be more akin to that of an insured claiming benefits from an insurance company than that of an employee claiming benefits from her current employer.
our precedents establish at least one more cause for heightened review demonstrated procedural irregularity,bias,or unfairness in the review of the claimant application for benefits.the pinto panel decision to apply heightened review turned almost as much on the procedures afforded to pinto as it did on
