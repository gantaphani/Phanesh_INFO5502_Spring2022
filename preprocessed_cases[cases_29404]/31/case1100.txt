background 
muniz was insured under a disability insurance plan issued by cglic as a benefit of his employment with morse diesel international,predecessor of amec construction management.this plan is governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,as amended,et.under the cglic plan,a claimant will continue to receive benefits after months if he is totally disabled,which is defined as unable to perform all the essential duties of any occupation for which he is or may reasonably become qualified.
muniz was diagnosed with hiv in and stopped working on august,due to the effects of his infection.he began receiving total disability benefits under the cglic plan in february.in april,muniz claim came up for periodic review.
as part of the review process,muniz completed forms on which he indicated he had debilitating fatigue,asthma that compounds him from being ambulatory,difficulties with concentration and attention span,and intermittent malaise.muniz also noted he engaged in light household activities and exercise.muniz treating physician,william towner,completed a physical activities assessment,on which he checked boxes indicating that he found muniz could sit,stand,and walk occasionally hours.towner also indicated that muniz ability to work extended shifts or overtime fell into the same occasionally category.
based on a review of these forms and muniz medical records,cglic determined in its vocational assessment that muniz could perform sedentary employment,which qualified him for clerical positions.a cglic nurse case manager also found that the current medical record does not support the severity of symptoms as stated by muniz.
the vocational assessment and the nurse case manager evaluation were shared with towner,and cglic requested that towner provide further medical documentation should he disagree with the analysis.towner informed cglic that he disagreed with its assessment and he noted the number of medications muniz took daily,which left him extremely fatigued and unable to concentrate,as well as muniz persistent contraction of staph aureus infections.towner concluded it was his professional medical opinion that muniz will be unable to work in any field,sedentary or otherwise,in the foreseeable future.he did not provide any documentation of the fatigue or lack of concentration.
cglic requested medical records from towner in support of his opinion,including testing of muniz cognitive status,and after the records were received,cglic found them incomplete and determined that muniz should undergo a functional capacity evaluation fce.
cglic attempted to contact muniz to schedule the fce several times over the course of four months without success.on june,cglic sent muniz a final letter informing him that it was suspending his benefits due to his failure to comply with the fce request,and that his case would be closed effective july,should he not respond by that date.
on july,muniz contacted cglic.he explained he did not receive any cglic communication because he did not use his home phone and he had been in texas caring for his parents.muniz requested that he be allowed to complete the fce at a facility in texas.
cglic located a facility in texas and requested approval from towner,for this facility required a statement of medical stability from the patient doctor before conducting the fce.towner refused to authorize the exam,stating that muniz suffer ed from wasting,fatigue and being unable to participate in any functional evaluation.
cglic then requested towner send updated medical records for muniz.based on the existing file material and the additional records sent by towner,a nurse case manager again found that muniz file was insufficient to provide a severity of symptoms that impact function.cglic closed muniz claim on august,with benefits paid until september.cglic informed muniz that his medical documentation did not contain any current findings or document the severity of his current condition that would prevent him from performing the essential duties of any occupation.
muniz filed an administrative appeal.his file was reevaluated by a new claim examiner and by the cglic medical director.the medical director noted a lack of evidence of testing of functional deficits that would prevent him from performing sedentary duties and concluded that the documentation did not support muniz claim.
muniz again appealed the denial of benefits,alleging procedural errors on behalf of cglic and submitting further records from a february visit with towner.a new claim examiner upheld the decision to terminate muniz claim.muniz then filed this action in district court pursuant to erisa,a b.
the parties agreed that the district court was to review muniz claim under the de novo standard,because the cglic policy did not confer discretion upon cglic.see abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc.after conducting a de novo review,the district court found the administrative record was insufficient for it to determine whether muniz was totally disabled under the terms of the plan at the time his benefits were terminated.the court asked counsel for their positions on appointing an independent expert to evaluate muniz and present an opinion as to his functional capacity,and counsel for muniz noted that the court had the authority to do so,providing the court with a supporting citation to walker american home shield long term disability plan,cir.the district court subsequently ordered the parties to submit a joint list of proposed experts.
muniz and amec disagreed as to the intent of that order,muniz understanding they were to identify hiv experts and amec believing they were to identify functional capacity experts.the parties filed a joint request for clarification,and the court confirmed that the order required designation of a functional capacity evaluator.the parties agreed upon a facility to conduct the evaluation,and on march,muniz was tested and evaluated by physical therapist robert larson.
larson concluded that,on the day of the evaluation,muniz demonstrated the capability to perform at a sustained light to demand level.larson also stated that for tasks such as sitting,standing,bending,and reaching,muniz performed at competitive levels when compared to individuals within the same population demographic.he characterized muniz activity tolerance and endurance as fair to poor his body mechanics,pain behavior correlation,and strength as fair to good and his coordination and pace object control as good.
