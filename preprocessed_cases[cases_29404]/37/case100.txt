this appeal requires us to consider whether sophisticated,represented parties really meant what they wrote in a gaming compact that was duly executed after years of tedious negotiations.like the district court,we hold the parties to their words,and affirm the district court orders in favor of the tohono nation.
in,the tohono nation the nation and the state of arizona executed a gaming compact the compact pursuant to the federal indian gaming regulatory act igra.the compact expressly authorizes class iii on the indian lands of the nation.the compact defines indian lands as lands defined in a and b subject to the provisions of.in turn,of igra provides that although class iii gaming is generally barred on land taken into trust after igra effective date october,that bar does not apply to land taken into trust as part of a settlement of a land claim.b b.additionally,the compact contains an integration clause,which provides that the compact contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to matters covered by this compact and no other statement,agreement,or promise made by any party,officer,or agent of any party shall be valid or binding.
after the compact was approved by the secretary of the interior and became effective in,the nation purchased an unincorporated parcel of land within the outer boundaries of glendale,arizona,pursuant to federal gila bend indian reservation lands replacement act lra.congress enacted the lra in after continuous heavy flooding caused by a dam rendered over acres of the nation reservation lands,which it had used principally for agriculture,economically useless.the lra gave the nation million in settlement funds to purchase replacement reservation lands,provided the nation assign ed to the united states all right,title,and interest of the tribe in nine thousand eight hundred and eighty acres of land within the gila bend indian reservation and execute d a waiver and release of any and all claims of water rights or injuries to land or water rights with respect to the lands of the gila bend indian reservation from time immemorial to the date of the execution by the tribe of such a waiver.in,the nation entered into a written agreement with the united states pursuant to the lra in which the nation waived and released its claims against the united states and assigned the united states all right,title and interest in acres of its destroyed reservation lands in exchange for million.
on july,the united states took a portion of the land,known as parcel,into trust for the nation pursuant to the lra.we recently affirmed the legality of the secretary taking of parcel into trust for the benefit of the nation under the lra.see nation city of glendale,cir.the nation desires to build a casino and conduct class iii gaming on parcel.
the state of arizona,the gila river indian community,and the salt river pima maricopa indian community the plaintiffs brought an action in federal district court in arizona against the nation,seeking to enjoin the nation plan to conduct class iii gaming on parcel.to bring their action,the plaintiffs invoked d a ii of igra,which grants the united states district courts jurisdiction over any cause of action initiated by a state or indian tribe to enjoin a c lass iii gaming activity located on indian lands and conducted in violation of any tribal state compact.d a ii.plaintiffs alleged that class iii gaming on parcel,since it was acquired after igra effective date october,would violate the compact because the lra was not a settlement of a land claim under igra,and because the compact implicitly bars the nation from gaming in the phoenix area.plaintiffs also alleged other claims,including promissory estoppel,fraud in the inducement,and material misrepresentation.
after a year of discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the nation because it concluded that land acquired and taken into trust pursuant to the lra was land taken into trust as part of a settlement of a land claim under igra b b,and thus igra did not bar the nation from gaming on parcel.the court also granted summary judgment in favor of the nation on plaintiffs breach of compact claims,because the compact specifically authorizes class iii gaming on indian lands that qualify for gaming under igra.the court also ruled that the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity barred the plaintiffs claims for promissory estoppel,fraud in the inducement,and material misrepresentation,and thus dismissed these claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.plaintiffs appeal the district court rulings in favor of the nation.

interpretation of igra 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erroneously concluded that land acquired and taken into trust pursuant to the lra qualifies as land taken into trust as part of a settlement of a land claim under b b i of igra.if land acquired and taken into trust pursuant to the lra qualifies as land taken into trust as part of a settlement of a land claim,then it is exempt from igra prohibition of class iii gaming on indian lands acquired and taken into trust after october.b b i.
to determine if land taken into trust pursuant to the lra qualifies as land taken into trust as part of a settlement of a land claim under b b i of igra,we must first discern the meaning of the term land claim.plaintiffs argue that a land claim applies to claims to title or possession of land,not to injuries to land,and base their argument on a department of the interior doi regulation that defines a land claim as follows 
land claim means any claim by a tribe concerning the impairment of title or other real property interest or loss of possession that 
arises under the united states constitution,federal common law,federal statute or treaty 
is in conflict with the right,or title or other real property interest claimed by an individual or entity private,public,or governmental and 
either accrued on or before october,or involves lands held in trust or restricted fee for the tribe prior to october.
we review an agency interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering under the familiar framework set forth in chevron,natural res.def.council,d.ctr.for biological diversity salazar,cir.we must first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,however,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.if a statute is ambiguous,and if the implementing agency construction is reasonable,chevron requires a federal court to accept the agency construction of the statute,even if the agency reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.salazar,at quoting cable telecomm.ass brand x internet,d.
thus,we must first determine whether land claim,as it is used in b b i,is ambiguous.a statute is ambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.alaska wilderness league epa,cir.the starting point is the statutory text.chevron,at.land claim is not defined in igra,and is not used elsewhere in the statute.see definitions section.the statutory context and surrounding language do not produce much clarity either when a statute does not define a term,we generally interpret that term by employing the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the words that congress used.united states gallegos,cir quoting united states iverson,cir.here,the language used has a broad,general meaning.see black law dictionary ed defining claim as t he assertion of an existing right any right to payment or to an equitable remedy,even if contingent or provisional a demand for money,property,or a legal remedy to which one asserts a right.thus,a land claim can be a claim for impairment to title of land,or as a claim for damage to land.but a word or phrase is not ambiguous just because it has a broad general meaning under the generalia verba sunt generaliter canon of statutory construction.see.dep t of corr.yeskey,d as we have said before,the fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by congress does not demonstrate ambiguity.it demonstrates breadth.internal quotation marks omitted.we do not find land claim to be ambiguous as used in b b i.as noted above,claim is a broad and general word,and therefore a claim for impairment to title of land,a claim for dispossession of land,and a claim for damage to land would all be encompassed by it.see scalia garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts without some indication to the contrary,general words are to be accorded their full and fair scope.here,under the ordinary meaning of the words used in the statutory text,the nation plainly had land claims for damage to its reservation lands.
in any case,were we to find the term land claim to be ambiguous,and proceed under chevron to apply the doi definition of the term,then we would find that the nation also had a claim concerning the impairment of title or other real property interest or loss of possession of its reservation land the flooding of the nation reservation due to the federal government construction of the painted rock dam gave rise for a trespass claim severe enough to constitute an unlawful taking without just compensation.arkansas game fish comm united states,d g flooding can constitute a taking of property.the nation had a claim that the continual flooding of its lands due to the painted rock dam exceeded the scope of the government flowage easement,which allowed the government occasionally to overflow,flood,and submerge the nation lands,because the flooding rendered all of the arable land of the reservation acres to be unsuitable for agriculture.the remaining acres of the nation reservation were of little or no economic value due to repeated flooding,silt deposition and salt cedar infestation.this taking by definition constituted a claim for the interference to the nation title to and possession of its land,and the flooding interfered with other real property interest s,such as the nation use of the land.
furthermore,the district court did not err in determining that the lra was a settlement of the nation land claims.congress enacted the lra to facilitate replacement of reservation lands with lands suitable for sustained economic use which is not principally farming the lra required the nation to assign to the federal government all right,title and interest of the tribe in acres of land the government flooded in the gila bend indian reservation,and to execute a waiver and release of any and all claims of water rights or injuries to land or water rights with respect to the lands of the gila bend indian reservation from time immemorial to the date of the execution by the tribe of such a waiver in exchange for million in settlement funds that the nation could use to purchase new tribal lands.
additionally,the lra expressly provides that a ny land which the secretary holds in trust under the act shall be deemed to be a federal indian reservation for all purposes.in sum,we hold that parcel,which the united states is now holding in trust for the benefit of the nation,meets the requirements of b b i of igra.
judicial estoppel and waiver 
plaintiffs argue that the nation is judicially estopped from asserting that it has a right to conduct class iii gaming on parcel under igra because of a position the nation took in a supplemental brief submitted to an arbitrator during an unsuccessful arbitration proceeding relating to negotiations of a gaming compact between the nation and arizona.plaintiffs also claim that the nation waived its right to conduct class iii gaming on parcel under igra because the nation was present when a handout was distributed at a meeting between arizona legislative staff and tribal representatives the handout stated the settlement of a land claim exception to igra prohibition of gaming on tribal lands taken into trust after october,would not affect arizona.we address each argument below,and conclude that the district court correctly rejected both of these arguments.
j udicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion to protect the integrity of the judicial process.new hampshire maine,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we review the district court decision whether to invoke judicial estoppel for an abuse of discretion.see hendricks lewis pllc clinton,cir.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not bar the nation from asserting that it has a right to conduct class iii gaming on parcel.here why.
federal courts consider the following factors described by the supreme court in new hampshire when deciding whether to invoke the doctrine of judicial estoppel 
first,a party later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position.second,courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party earlier position,so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.third,courts ask whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.
id.at quoting new hampshire,at.
prior to executing the gaming compact,the nation and arizona were parties to a nonbinding arbitration proceeding under igra,where the nation and arizona each submitted a last best offer compact to an arbitrator,who was to choose one of the two proposals without amendment.in response to a provision in arizona proposed compact which would have barred class iii gaming on lands acquired in trust after igra effective date,the nation submitted a supplemental brief which explained that arizona provision 
would result in the nation forfeiting the rights provided to tribes in igra to request that in certain circumstances trust land be available for class iii gaming activities.the existing federal law requires the governor concurrence.this is adequate protection to the state and local interests.the state simply seeks an ancillary benefit in this provision.
here,the district court correctly recognized and applied the three new hampshire factors,and thus did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel.in regard to the first new hampshire factor,these sentences in the nation brief are not clearly inconsistent with nation argument in this case that land it acquired in trust under the lra qualifies as a settlement of a land claim pursuant to b b i of igra.the passage quoted above simply does not state that the nation would not ever pursue gaming under b b i of igra in the future.the passage states that acceptance of arizona provision would result in trust land not being available for class iii gaming in undefined certain circumstances.thus,purchase of land after would be one certain circumstance.but acquisition of land as part of a settlement of a land claim w
