this diversity action arises out of a gambling debt amine nehme nehme is claimed to owe las vegas sands,llc the venetian,on an unpaid casino marker in the amount of,plus interest.
a marker is a gambling credit instrument that allows a gambler to receive all or part of the credit line the casino has approved for him,based on the gambler prior credit application with the casino.once the gambler and a casino representative sign the marker,the gambler may exchange the marker for gambling tokens,or chips.if the gambler does not pay the marker when he has finished gambling,the marker is outstanding and the casino may later submit the marker,like a check,to the gambler bank for payment.
on for summary judgment,the district court excluded from evidence two key documents proferred by defendant nehme on the ground they were not properly authenticated by an affidavit made on personal knowledge a letter from one of nehme attorneys that predated nehme unpaid marker by seven months and that requested,on nehme behalf,that the venetian cancel and not renew,under any circumstances,nehme credit line and a postal service return receipt,dated three days after the letter,that recites someone at the venetian may have received nehme attorney letter before nehme signed the marker.the district court then granted summary judgment to the venetian on claims that nehme had failed to pay a negotiable instrument the marker,and had breached a contract a prior credit application agreement and the marker.the district court denied nehme motion for reconsideration,and nehme timely appealed.
we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the above pieces of evidence under an incorrect legal standard and that this error was not harmless.thus,we reverse and remand with instructions that the district court consider such evidence under the correct legal standard.
factual and procedural background 
nehme,a california resident,is a repeat gambler at the venetian,a nevada limited liability company.the venetian operates a licensed las vegas casino.it followed the standard industry procedures when it extended credit to nehme.those procedures are set out by the nevada supreme court in nguyen state,
a gambler applies for casino credit by completing a standard credit application form.once the casino approves the application and grants a line of credit to the gambler,the gambler may receive all or part of the credit line at a gambling table in the form of a marker.the marker is an instrument,usually dated,bearing the name of the gambler,the name and account number of the gambler bank,and the instruction pay to the order of the casino for a specific value in dollars.once the gambler and a casino representative sign the marker,the gambler may then exchange the marker for gambling tokens,or chips.if the gambler does not pay the marker when he has finished gambling,the marker is outstanding and the casino may submit the marker to the gambler bank for payment as if it were a check on the gambler account at the bank.
in this case,nehme applied for a line of credit with the venetian on march,by completing a standard credit application form.in the venetian credit application,nehme set out his name,address,social security number,and employment information.the bottom of the credit application provided,in pertinent part before drawing on my line of credit,if granted,i agree to sign credit instruments in the amount of the draw each draw against my credit line constitutes a separate loan of money i will sign a credit instrument in the amount of the loan.by signing the credit application,nehme agree d to repay all loans and draws against his credit line in accordance with the terms agreed to in his credit file.most important for this appeal,the credit application provided the venetian endorses responsible gaming.we will cancel or reduce your credit line upon your request.
under nehme credit application,the venetian approved a initial credit line for nehme in march,and extended that credit line to in may and then to in july.nehme gambled at the venetian several times in and.on february,a bennett,purporting to be nehme attorney,sent a return receipt letter to the venetian requesting that all credit lines established by nehme or on his behalf immediately be terminated and that no further credit be extended to him under any circumstances.bennett received a postal service return receipt that purports to show someone at the venetian may have signed for the letter on february,over the address shown for the venetian.by august,nehme had repaid all gambling debts he owed to the venetian.
nehme returned to the venetian over labor day weekend in september.nothing in the record demonstrates bennett letter was questioned,rejected or answered by the venetian,or withdrawn by nehme directly or through a representative.neither is there any proof that nehme executed a new credit application.
on labor day,september,nehme signed a casino marker for payable to the venetian nehme exchanged the marker for chips and lost all worth of chips playing blackjack.nehme then left the venetian with the marker outstanding.on january,the venetian presented for payment the marker to bank of america,the bank specified on the marker,but the marker was returned for insufficient funds.the venetian applied a safekeeping deposit to the unpaid marker,such that it now claims nehme owes it in gambling debt,plus interest.
in july,the venetian sued nehme in nevada state court for failure to pay a negotiable instrument,nehme casino marker breach of contract,the venetian credit application agreement and the marker and unjust enrichment.that same month,nehme removed this case to federal court in the district of nevada based on diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.in april,the venetian filed a motion for summary judgment.later that month nehme filed an opposition,to which he attached an unsigned copy of the bennett february,letter.then,in september,nehme filed a for summary judgment,to which he attached,in pertinent part,a signed copy of another bennett letter,a postal service return receipt for the unsigned bennett letter,and excerpts from the deposition testimony of venetian employees 
the district court,sua sponte and without a hearing,excluded the bennett letters,the return receipt for the unsigned bennett letter,and the deposition excerpts on the ground they were not properly authenticated the district court granted summary judgment to nehme on the venetian unjust enrichment claim on the ground this claim is unavailable where a written contract,the credit application agreement exists the district court then granted summary judgment to the venetian on the claims of failure to pay a negotiable instrument and breach of contract,on the ground that no triable issue of fact remained as to the elements of those two claims and that there was no evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to any of nehme affirmative defenses to liability.the district court also refused to consider nehme defense of contract rescission,in part because nehme had not pleaded that defense in his answer.
nehme filed a motion for reconsideration,to which he attached an affidavit from his attorney,bennett,that authenticated the unsigned bennett letter and its postal service return receipt,as well as properly authenticated deposition excerpts regarding the venetian credit line cancellation policy.the district court denied the motion,and nehme timely appealed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment to determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all justifiable inferences in its favor,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.orr bank of,nt sa,cir.where the parties file for summary judgment,the court must consider each party evidence,regardless under which motion the evidence is offered.fair hous.council riverside two,cir.
the district court granted summary judgment to the venetian after it had excluded an unsigned copy of the bennett letter attached as an exhibit to nehme opposition to the venetian motion for summary judgment,as well as a signed copy of the bennett letter,a postal service return receipt for the unsigned bennett letter,and deposition excerpts attached as exhibits to nehme for summary judgment.because the district court excluded the unsigned bennett letter and its return receipt under an incorrect legal standard,and because under the correct legal standard those two items might be received in if so,raise triable issues of material to nehme affirmative defense against the venetian based on an alleged material breach of their credit application agreement,we reverse and remand to the district court to apply the correct legal standard we need not,and do not,decide whether the district court other evidentiary rulings were proper.
we review the district court exclusion of evidence in a summary judgment motion for abuse of discretion.orr,at.under united states hinkson,cir en banc,a district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard to decide an issue.if,however,the district court applies the correct legal standard,there is no abuse of discretion unless the district court findings of fact,and its application of those findings of fact to the correct legal standard,are illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from facts in the record.id.
the district court abused its discretion in excluding the bennett letter and its postal service return receipt because the district court applied an incorrect legal standard to consider those pieces of evidence and,therefore,failed properly to consider whether the bennett letter and its return receipt were authenticated by their distinctive characteristics.
in orr,we made clear that unauthenticated documents can not be considered in a motion for summary judgment.orr,at.the authentication of a document requires evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.id.quoting.a.a document authenticated through personal knowledge must be attached to an affidavit,and the affiant must be a competent witness who wrote the document,signed it,used it,or saw others do so.id.at quoting.b.but the requirement that documents be authenticated through personal knowledge when submitted in a summary judgment motion is limited to situations where exhibits are introduced by being attached to an affidavit of a person whose personal knowledge is essential to establish the document is what it purports to it is authentic.id.at.where documents are otherwise submitted to the court,and where personal knowledge is not relied upon to authenticate the document,the district court must consider alternative means of authentication under federal rules of evidence b orr,at.under rule b,documents could be authenticated by review of their contents if they appear to be sufficiently genuine.orr,at noting that district courts have authenticated letters by the linkage between the dates of postmarks and defendant location on the days the letters were mailed and a diary by reviewing its contents.
here,the district court excluded the bennett letter and its return receipt on the sole ground that those two pieces of evidence must be authenticated by a competent witness with personal knowledge of their authenticity.the bennett letter was attached as an exhibit to nehme opposition to the venetian motion for summary judgment,and the return receipt for that letter was attached as an exhibit to nehme for summary judgment.neither was attached as an exhibit to an affidavit of a person offering his personal knowledge of how the document was prepared as the basis for the court to find the document is authentic.thus,the district court applied an incorrect legal standard because,as set out above,the bennett letter and its return receipt could have been authenticated by review of their contents if they appeared to be sufficiently genuine in this respect,the bennett letter was dated february,written on the letterhead of an attorney who stated he represented nehme,addressed to morcos at the venetian,and printed a reference to the same certified mail number that is on the postal service return receipt the return receipt is date stamped february,three days after the letter date,is also addressed to morcos at the venetian,and purports to be a domestic return receipt for certified mail carrying the same certified mail number as does the bennett letter.these characteristics could be sufficient to support a finding the bennett letter was sent to the venetian on february,and was received by the venetian on february.
the district court,having relied on an incorrect legal standard,did not make a finding whether the bennett letter and its return receipt could be authenticated by their distinctive characteristics under federal rule of evidence b.under hinkson,the district court therefore abused its discretion in failing to apply the correct legal standard.upon remand,application of the correct legal standard may lead to the admission of such items of proferred evidence.
where,as here,the district court abuses its discretion,so to exclude evidence in a summary judgment motion,we must apply a harmless error analysis.orr,at.we will reverse the district court if the district court evidentiary ruling was prejudicial,consideration of improperly excluded evidence would have precluded a grant of summary judgment,or warranted a grant of summary judgment to the other party.see id.at.
here,after erroneously excluding the bennett letter and its return receipt,the district court granted summary judgment to the venetian on two claims against nehme failure to pay a negotiable instrument,nehme unpaid casino marker and breach of contract,the venetian credit application agreement and the marker.the district court did so on the ground that no triable issue of fact remained as to the elements of those two claims,and that there was no evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to any of nehme affirmative defenses to liability.those defenses,set out in nehme for summary judgment,include the credit application agreement nullified the marker under the nevada uniform commercial code ucc the breach of a material term of the credit application agreement discharged nehme duty to pay the marker under nevada common law contract principles and nehme unilaterally rescinded the credit application agreement by virtue of the bennett letter.
nevada substantive law controls in this diversity action.erie tompkins,f ederal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.the credit application agreement and the marker both specify nevada law as the controlling law.the ucc is codified in nevada at nrs et as set out below,the district court exclusion of the bennett letter and its return receipt upon an erroneous basis was not harmless error,because these items of evidence do raise a triable issue of fact as to nehme nullification defense under the ucc,and they raise a triable issue of fact as to nehme defense based on common law contract principles.we need not,and do not,address nehme rescission defense.
the first claim in the venetian complaint against nehme is for failure to pay the marker,which is a negotiable instrument and a check under the nevada ucc.
the venetian has a right to enforce the marker against nehme as a valid debt obligation unless nehme can establish a defense to liability.in nehme opposition to the venetian motion for summary judgment,he conceded that the marker constitutes both a negotiable instrument and a check according to the definition of these terms in nrs.subsection of nrs provides that a n order that meets all of the requirements of subsection,and otherwise falls within the definition of check in subsection is a negotiable instrument and a check.in pertinent part,subsection defines a negotiable instrument as an unconditional order to pay a fixed amount of money if it i s payable on demand or at a definite time and d oes not state any other undertaking by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money.one definition of a check in subsection is a draft payable on demand and drawn on a bank.
here,the marker is a negotiable instrument and a check because it provides a mechanism for payment of from bank of america to the order of the venetian is signed by nehme and is payable on demand because it states no time or date of payment.see nguyen,at.on the face of the marker,the order is unconditional and states no undertakings by nehme other than to pay a specific sum of money.the marker therefore was valid and enforceable as a negotiable instrument under nevada law.see mandalay resort group miller in re miller,cir holding that a casino marker,and the gambling debt the marker represents,are valid and may be enforced by legal process quoting nrs.the venetian presented the marker to bank of america for payment,and the marker was returned for insufficient funds.thus,the venetian has a right to enforce the marker against nehme unless nehme can establish a defense to liability.see nrs cmt.dishonor by any drawee named in the draft entitles the holder to rights of recourse against the drawer.see also nrs n otice of dishonor is no longer relevant to the liability of a drawer.
we now turn to consider whether the the erroneously rejected considered,could make out triable issues of fact as to whether the venetian was indeed a holder in due course,or,to the contrary,a holder with knowledge of personal defenses.
the bennett letter and its return receipt raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the venetian right to enforce the marker against nehme is subject to nehme defense based on common law contract principles and the ucc affirmative defense.
at the outset,the venetian is not a holder in due course,one who takes the instrument for value,in good faith and without notice that it is overdue or has been dishonored or of any defenses or claims to it.id.this is important because h older in due course status operates to insulate the holder from certain defenses to the instrument of any party with whom the holder has not dealt.id.citing nrs.the venetian had dealt with nehme,and was a party to both the credit application and the marker.if the venetian is proved to have knowledge of the purported credit application cancellation,per the bennett letter,the venetian was aware of defenses to the marker.nevada law makes the venetian subject to all defenses of nehme,a party with whom the holder has dealt.id.citing nrs.these defenses comprise those specifically stated in article of the ucc as codified in nevada and those based on common law contract principles.nrs cmt.emphasis added.
nehme contends that the venetian was under a contractual duty to cancel nehme credit line following receipt of the bennett letter.according to nehme,the venetian failure to cancel his credit line,and its decision to extend him of credit under the marker,was a material breach of the credit application agreement and,therefore,discharged his duty to pay the marker under common law contract principles.
under nevada law,a breach of contract may be said to be a material failure of performance of a duty arising under or imposed by agreement.bernard rockhill dev.whether a party has breached a contract and whether the breach is material are questions of fact.hoffman eighth judicial dist.court.it is at common law that a breach or of a promise by one party to a bilateral contract,so material as to justify a refusal of the other party to perform a contractual duty,discharges that duty.restatement first of contracts.nevada courts have long recognized this principle.see,thornton agassiz,payment of the purchase price is excused where respondent breach was material.young sign fohrman,the lessee material breach in failing to pay rent excused further performance by the lessor.citing restatement first of contracts.
here,the credit application agreement was a bilateral contract between nehme and the venetian.nehme promised to repay all loans and draws against his credit line,to sign a credit instrument in the amount of each loan,and to sign credit instruments in the amount of each draw.in return,the only express promise that the venetian made to nehme on the face of the credit application was that,if it granted nehme a line of credit,it would cancel or reduce his credit line upon his request.the venetian made this promise for the purpose of ensuring responsible gaming.there is a triable issue of fact as to whether this credit cancellation promise,as the only express promise that the venetian made to nehme on the face of the credit application agreement,is a material term of the bilateral contract between nehme and the venetian.see powers united servs.auto.ass n,w here materiality must be shown by matters outside the terms of the contract,it is a question of fact.internal quotation marks omitted.
the more difficult question is whether the credit application agreement and the marker were part of the same transaction,such that a material breach of the credit application could serve as a breach of contract defense to the enforcement of not only the credit application agreement,but also the marker.the parties do not offer,nor can we find,any authority that directly resolves this question as a matter of law.in nguyen,however,the nevada supreme court did suggest that,under standard industry procedures in nevada,a casino marker generally goes hand in hand with a prior credit application agreement.at.other courts,applying nevada law,have made the same suggestion.see,in re miller,at debtor acknowledges in the application and markers that he incurred gambling debt in nevada.emphasis added fleeger bell,d,upon approval of this credit application by desert palace,a patron may request the issuance of casino markers.caram,the application and the marker which defendant signed create an enforceable debt under nevada law.emphasis added see also harrah tunica meeks in re armstrong,cir armstrong signed a casino credit application in order to obtain markers from harrah.
we therefore conclude that a casino marker and a credit application agreement may be,but need not be,part of the same transaction.whether a particular casino marker relates to a particular credit application agreement,such that they are part of the same transaction,is necessarily a question of fact.first,and most importantly,the evidence from the credit application own language seems to establish that unless and until nehme signed the credit application,the venetian would not accept his marker and give him chips.thus,there is a triable issue of fact as to whether nehme marker was part of the same transaction as his prior credit application agreement with the venetian.although it may be possible to view nehme marker and the parties credit application agreement as two discrete credit transactions,a reasonable jury could find that the marker was part of the same underlying transaction as the credit application,that nehme received the marker because he drew on a line of credit he had established at the venetian through the prior credit application agreement.notably,the credit application agreement contemplated that nehme would sign future credit instruments,such as the marker.moreover,the marker bears the same account number as appears on the credit application agreement.finally,the marker was for the exact amount of nehme credit limit at the venetian,as nehme had repaid all prior gambling debts before he signed the marker.
the bennett letter and its return receipt therefore raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the venetian was obligated,per the terms of the credit application agreement,to cancel nehme credit in february months before nehme signed the marker for,the full extent of his credit line at the venetian.indeed,the bennett letter clearly instructed the venetian to cancel nehme credit line and to extend him no further credit under any circumstances.see black law dictionary ed defining cancel as to terminate a promise,obligation,or right.thus,if the venetian had received the bennett letter and simply failed to cancel nehme credit line through which markers were issued,the venetian may well have been in material breach of the credit application agreement,such that nehme duty to re
