in march,iowa enacted legislation ending the touchplay lottery game.hawkeye commodity promotions,a licensed touchplay retailer,tried to enjoin the law before it took effect.hawkeye argued that the law violates the contracts,takings,equal protection,and due process clauses of the federal constitution.the district court rejects these claims.see hawkeye commodity promotions,miller,d.hawkeye appeals,reiterating those claims and asserting that the district court should have admitted the deposition testimony of the president of the iowa lottery authority the lottery.this court affirms.
following revenue shortfalls in and,the iowa general assembly authorized the lottery to establish a plan to implement the deployment of vending machines with video monitors.the lottery then added the touchplay game.a touchplay machine is a vending machine that dispenses or prints and dispenses lottery tickets that have been determined to be winning or losing tickets by a predetermined pool drawing machine prior to the dispensing of the tickets.iowa admin.code.with flashing lights and captivating sounds,touchplay machines resemble slot machines.unlike slot machines,which are random,touchplay is not random.tickets are loaded into the machine electronically,and like tickets,the outcome of each game is predetermined.
the lottery never owned any touchplay machines.they were manufactured and distributed to retailers,who purchased or leased them.the lottery contracted for the manufacture of touchplay machines licensed the retailers to put them in businesses set the number of winning tickets and the amount paid out on each machine collected data from the machines and split the revenue with manufacturers and retailers.touchplay began with machines in may,expanding rapidly by april,more than machines operated at businesses across iowa.
hawkeye was incorporated and capitalized solely as an iowa touchplay retailer.on january,hawkeye applied for an mvm monitor vending machines retailer license,which was issued on january.accompanying the license were a letter including a formula door decals for hawkeye machines and,a memo entitled licensing terms and conditions january,summarizing the applicable laws and regulations.hawkeye owns touchplay machines,of which operated at iowa businesses in april.hawkeye invested about million in this venture million to buy the machines,and million in and operational costs.
responding to concerns about the proliferation of gambling,in january governor thomas vilsack ordered a moratorium on new touchplay licenses while a task force studied it.in march the task force recommended restrictions to protect gambling addicts and minors.governor vilsack extended the moratorium to give the iowa legislature time to act on the matter if it so chooses.the general assembly passed legislation banning touchplay,which the governor signed march to be codified at iowa code a.the ban took effect may.
on april,hawkeye sued for declaratory and injunctive relief,invoking the contracts,takings,equal protection,and due process clauses of the united states constitution.an expedited trial occurred april,with testimony by affidavit.hawkeye later moved to the record to add the deposition of edward stanek,president of the lottery.on april,the district court denied the motion and issued a decision.this court reviews the district court factual findings for clear error,and its legal and constitutional conclusions de novo.daggitt united food commercial workers int l union,local,cir.
no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.const.art.i,cl.hawkeye main argument is that sf the bill number of the touchplay law completely destroyed hawkeye contracts with the lottery,and with over iowa businesses.
much of hawkeye discussion addresses its license.hawkeye emphasizes at length that its license could not be terminated without good cause,days notice,and a hearing.iowa admin.code.but hawkeye license has not been terminated hawkeye still has its license.the licensing terms and conditions,which hawkeye agreed to in its application,state if a provision in this document conflicts with an applicable statutory or regulatory provision,the statutory or regulatory provision preempts the conflicting provision in this document.the abolition of touchplay did not trigger the administrative rules governing hawkeye license.
a test determines whether a statute violates the contracts clause.the first question is whether the state law has,in fact,operated as a substantial impairment on contractual relationships.equip.mfrs.inst.janklow,cir.this question has three components whether there is a contractual relationship,whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship,and whether the impairment is substantial.motors romein,d.
the parties appear to assume that the existence of a contract is governed by state law.indeed,the district court looks only to iowa law,finding an unilateral contract of indefinite duration,which either party could cancel at any time.see hawkeye,d at.but whether a contract was made is a federal question for purposes of contract clause analysis.romein,at.citing irving trust day.
in stone mississippi,the supreme court rejected a private company contracts clause challenge to the state cancellation of its lottery charter.
any one,therefore,who accepts a lottery charter does so with the implied understanding that the people,in their sovereign capacity,and through their properly constituted agencies,may resume it at any time when the public good shall require,whether it be paid for or not.all that one can get by such a charter is a suspension of certain governmental rights in his favor,subject to withdrawal at will.he has in legal effect nothing more than a license to enjoy the privilege on the terms named for the specified time,unless it be sooner abrogated by the sovereign power of the state.it is a permit,good as against existing laws,but subject to further legislative and constitutional control or withdrawal.
id.at,otto.in douglas kentucky,the supreme court said flatly,a lottery grant is not,in any sense,a contract within the meaning of the constitution of the united states,but is simply a gratuity and license,which the state,under its police powers,and for the protection of the public morals,may at any time revoke,and forbid the further conduct of the lottery.
this court is bound to decide for ourselves whether a contract was made,what are its terms and conditions,and whether the state has,by later legislation,impaired its obligation.this involves an appraisal of the statutes of the states and the decisions of its highest courts.ex rel.anderson brand.in romein,at,the supreme court adopted the state supreme court holding that workers compensation benefits were not an implied term of a contract.looking to indiana law,the court in brand,at,concluded,the petitioner had a valid contract with the respondent.
stone and douglas are clear a lottery grant or charter is not protected by the contracts clause.hawkeye responds that stone and douglas,while certainly good law,involve an entirely different circumstance.on the contrary,stone and douglas are not distinguishable in both cases,the legislature allowed a private party to operate a lottery,which was later nullified in stone,by the state reconstruction constitution in douglas,by act of the legislature and then by amendment to the state constitution.that fairly describes the history of touchplay in iowa.whatever agreement existed between hawkeye and the lottery is not protected by the contracts clause of the federal constitution.
as to the location contracts,it is undisputed on this court they are contracts within the contracts clause,and are impaired by sf.this court therefore asks whether the impairment of hawkeye its locations and with the lottery assuming the district court is correct that they are protected by the contracts clause is substantial.
substantial impairment depends on the extent to which the parties reasonable contract expectations have been disrupted.reasonable expectations are affected by the regulated nature of an industry in which a party is contracting.in re workers comp.refund,cir citations omitted.in determining the extent of the impairment,we are to determine whether the industry the complaining party has entered has been regulated in the past.energy reserves group.power light,d.
like hawkeye,the public utility in energy reserves was operating in a heavily regulated industry.state authority to regulate natural gas prices is well established.id.at.citations omitted.state authority to regulate gambling is similarly no one would question that the state has the power to regulate gambling in the interest of the public health,safety,and general welfare.messenger servs.ass thone,cir quoting the district court to uphold a nebraska statute prohibiting service fees on betting against federal constitutional challenges.
in this case,the contracts themselves demonstrate hawkeye diminished contract expectations.the location contracts provide

emphasis added.in regard to any agreement with the lottery,the licensing terms and conditions memorandum that hawkeye agreed to in january state at the top of the first page 
the provisions of iowa code chapter,iowa administrative code,and any other applicable statutory or regulatory provisions are herein incorporated by reference.if a provision in this document conflicts with an applicable statutory or regulatory provision,the statutory or regulatory provisions preempts the conflicting provision in this document.
likewise,the contracts in energy reserves expressly recognize the existence of extensive regulation by providing that any contractual terms are subject to relevant present and future state and federal law.id.at.this court holds that,like the plaintiff in energy reserves,hawkeye reasonable expectations have not been impaired.id.sf does not substantially impair any lottery or location contracts.hawkeye contracts clause argument fails on the first prong of janklow.
alternatively,assuming a substantial impairment,the second and third prongs of the contracts clause analysis come into play.the second prong of the test is whether the state has a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation.janklow,at.if,as hawkeye claims,the state offers no significant and legitimate public purpose for abolishing touchplay while continuing all other lottery games,then sf is unconstitutional under the contract clause.the state has the burden to show this purpose.id.at.
the state identifies the need to curb the expansion of gambling as the purpose of sf.gambling is illegal in iowa.iowa code.gambling in iowa is permissible only if authorized by a specific statutory exception.see,iowa code,ban on gambling does not apply to betting regulated by the state racing and gaming commission,or to state lottery games regulated by the iowa lottery authority.existing at the sufferance of the legislature,gambling is a heavily regulated industry in iowa.see iowa code iowa admin.code.the regulation of its expansion and a significant and legitimate public purpose for sf.
the third prong is whether the adjustment of the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties is based upon reasonable conditions and is of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying the legislation adoption.janklow,at alteration in original.this court finds that it is.touchplay began with machines in bars and fraternal clubs in may.within three years,more than machines functioned in nearly iowa business of all sorts,including grocery stores,restaurants,gas stations,truck stops,convenience stores,bowling alleys,and laundromats.as touchplay expanded,the public became concerned about protecting minors and compulsive gamblers.a state police power encompasses controlling gambling,even to the point of abolishing a particular lottery game.see,stone,at,otto the police power extends to all matters affecting the public health or the public morals.neither can it be denied that lotteries are proper subjects for the exercise of this power.citations omitted douglas,at.messenger,at.
iowa abolition of touchplay does not violate the contracts clause.
private property shall not be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.hawkeye considers sf a legislative taking of its property,the touchplay machines,its overall business,the lottery contract,and the location contracts.
first,hawkeye must show property interests protected by the takings clause.see ruckelshaus monsanto,d.see also.state bank united states,bedrock requirement of any successful takings challenge is that the plaintiffs must identify a property interest cognizable under the fifth amendment.the constitution protects rather than creates property interests.phillips.legal,d.this court therefore looks to iowa law to evaluate hawkeye property interests.see bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d the existence of a property interest is determined by reference to existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.
no doubt the machines are property under the takings clause.hawkeye also claims a property interest in its touchplay business,and continued operation of its enterprise.the district court finds and the state does not dispute that hawkeye has some property interest in the business itself.hawkeye,d at citing kimball laundry united states.takings clause protects intangible business assets like trade routes,goodwill,and earning power.
as to the continued operation of the business,hawkeye participation in touchplay required an mvm license.the possession of an mvm license is a privilege personal to that person or entity and is not a legal right.iowa admin.code.as the district court explains,because hawkeye mvm license can not be sold,assigned,or transferred,it lacks the indicia of a property interest.see iowa admin code mvm licenses may not be transferred to any other person or entity.see generally cent.states theatre sar,iowa,iowa when a business is inherently illegal,liquor,tobacco a permit to operate may be granted or refused at the will of the licensing body,is a privilege rather than a property right bracketed text added smith iowa liquor control comm n,iowa upholding the revocation of a liquor license because a license to sell beer,is a privilege granted by the state and is in no sense a property right.alfredo iowa racing gaming comm n,iowa dicta,property rights in a gambling license may exist only when statute expressly identifies the license as a right,as opposed to a privilege.cleveland united states,d state license is not property under the federal mail fraud statute.hawkeye does not have a property right in the continuation of its touchplay business for takings clause purposes.
as to hawkeye argument,the district court holds that because the location contracts allow for termination of the contract due to a change in law or regulation,they do not constitute a property interest for the purposes of the takings clause.hawkeye,d at.the january licensing terms and conditions say,if a provision in this document conflicts with an applicable statutory or regulatory provision,the statutory or regulatory provisions preempts the conflicting provision in this document.contract rights are a form of private property in iowa,but to qualify as a protectable property interest under the takings clause,a contract must establish rights more substantial in nature than a mere unilateral expectation of continued rights or benefits.crippen city of cedar rapids,iowa.hawkeye expectation that its contracts would not be modified or nullified by the state is undermined by its participation in a heavily regulated industry gambling the as may be allowed by law or promulgated regulation language in the location contracts the analogous language in the licensing terms and conditions and,the experience of its owners with south carolina ban.see armstrong collins.hawkeye contracts are not a cognizable property interest under iowa law for takings clause purposes.
