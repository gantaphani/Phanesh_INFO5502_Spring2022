this is a quiet title action between owners of adjoining properties.in,the plaintiff purchased property having no vehicular access to or from any public road.because her property is landlocked,she seeks to establish,without payment of consideration to the defendants,an easement by necessity over an existing private road that crosses the defendants property and connects to a public highway.under california common law,such an easement requires examination of the circumstances of the original conveyance by the common owner that severed what is now the defendants property from what is now the plaintiff landlocked property.in this case,the federal government was that common owner,and it first conveyed the defendants property without expressly reserving a right of access to the plaintiff property,which it retained.the question is whether a right of access nonetheless arose by implication based on the circumstances surrounding that conveyance,including whether or not a strict necessity for access resulted and the inferences reasonably drawn regarding the parties intent.
given the distinctive nature and history of federal land grants and the government power of eminent domain,we hold that extreme caution must be exercised in determining whether an access easement arises by implication when common ownership is traced back to a federal grant made without an express reservation for access.we conclude,based on the stipulated facts presented at trial,that the circumstances here fail to support an easement by necessity.we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
the parties to this matter are plaintiff cheryl murphy,trustee of the murphy children education trust dated june,and defendants roger burch and michele burch,trustees of the rmb revocable family trust dated february.
in their respective capacities as trustees,murphy and the burches are owners of certain adjoining real property in mendocino county.the murphy property consists of four parcels located east of the burch property,which consists of two parcels.the only public road that has ever existed in the vicinity of the murphy and burch properties is california state highway highway,which is located to the south and runs in a generally direction without intersecting either property.the sole means of vehicle access between highway and the murphy property is a private road the access road that extends north from the highway and crosses over the burch property and other privately owned land before entering the four parcels of the murphy property.
as relevant here,murphy filed this action seeking to quiet title to an easement along the portion of the access road located on the burch property.the burches also seek to quiet title and to permanently enjoin use of the access road by murphy and any successors.the parties submitted this matter to a bench trial upon the following agreed statement of facts.
prior to,the federal government owned all of the properties at issue in this case.over the course of time between and,it deeded the parcels now making up the burch property,by patent,to various private owners the federal government conveyed these parcels without expressly reserving an easement over the access road to highway for the benefit of the parcels it retained,including the adjoining parcels to the east.
on december,the federal government conveyed to john bridges,also by patent,the four landlocked parcels now constituting the murphy property.the conveyances to bridges did not include any express grant of an easement over the access road to highway for the benefit of the conveyed property.in,murphy purchased these parcels from bridges successors in interest.
as indicated,the access road provides the only roadway access between the murphy property and highway.consequently,without an easement over the access road across the burch property,the murphy property has no vehicular access to or from any public road.at the bench trial,the parties agreed that murphy has no right to cross the burch property by virtue of a prescriptive easement,but contested whether murphy is entitled to an easement by necessity.the trial court resolved the matter in murphy favor,and entered judgment accordingly.the burches appealed,and the court of appeal reversed.
discussion 
the central issue is whether the federal patent conveyances to murphy predecessors in interest and to the burches predecessors in interest included a an easement by necessity over the burch property for the benefit of the murphy property.
generally,an easement by necessity arises from an implied grant or implied reservation in certain circumstances when a property owner the grantor conveys to another the grantee one out of two or more adjoining parcels of the grantor property.when there is no express provision for access,and the parcel conveyed is either landlocked entirely by the parcels retained by the grantor or landlocked partly by the grantor retained land and partly by the land of others,the grantee may claim an implied grant of a of necessity over the land retained by the grantor.see generally miller starr,cal.real estate ed,miller starr.conversely,when the grantor conveys adjoining property without an express agreement for access to a retained parcel left landlocked,the grantor may seek an implied reservation of a of necessity over the conveyed property for the retained parcel benefit.miller starr,supra.in both situations,the landlocked parcel benefitted by the implied is called the dominant tenement or dominant estate,while the burdened property is referred to as the servient tenement or servient estate.remote grantees in the chain of title may assert the easement long after its creation by the original common grantor,and despite the failure of a prior grantee to exercise the right.lichty sickels d.see kripp curtis cal,an easement by necessity pass es as appurtenant to the estate when sold.
easements by necessity originated in the common law and are the result of the application of the presumption that whenever a party conveys property,he conveys whatever is necessary for the beneficial use of that property and retains whatever is necessary for the beneficial use of land he still possesses.daywalt walker d.the rationale driving this presumption is that the demands of our society prevent any efforts to hold land in perpetual idleness as would result if it were cut off from all access by being completely surrounded by lands privately owned.roemer pappas d.hence,easements by necessity are grounded in the public policy that property should not be rendered unfit for occupancy or successful cultivation because access to the property is lacking.daywalt walker,supra,d at.
in california,the easement arises by implication based on the inferred intent of the parties to the property conveyance,as determined from the terms of the relevant instrument and the circumstances surrounding the transaction.daywalt walker,supra,d at.county of los angeles bartlett d.two circumstances are indispensable to the implication and must be shown a strict necessity for the claimed,as when the claimant property is landlocked and the dominant and servient tenements were under common ownership at the time of the conveyance giving rise to the necessity.reese borghi d.and cases cited see kellogg,supra,th at,d daywalt walker,supra,d at.the implication will not be made,however,where it is shown to be contrary to the parties intentions.daywalt walker,supra,d at.county of los angeles bartlett,supra,d at.
to satisfy the requirement,the party claiming the easement must demonstrate it is strictly necessary for access to the alleged dominant tenement.kripp curtis,supra,cal.at.no easement will be implied where there is another possible means of access,even if that access is shown to be inconvenient,difficult,or costly.see ibid.moreover,such an easement continues only as long as the need for it exists.lichty sickels,supra,d at.see generally d easements and licenses.thus,if adequate alternative access becomes available,the easement terminates because it no longer serves to promote the underlying public policy considerations.see generally bruce ely,the law of easements and licenses in land creation of easements by implication.
to meet the requirement,the party seeking the easement must establish that the lands composing the alleged dominant and servient estates were once under common ownership and that a conveyance by the common owner gave rise to the necessity for a.in the absence of common ownership,an easement by necessity will not be implied based solely on a showing of necessity.daywalt walker,supra,d at,relying on county of los angeles bartlett,supra,d at.
decisions stress the significance of strict necessity and common ownership as circumstances from which the intent of the parties may be inferred.as one case explained,a n implication of the grant of a way of necessity may arise from the transaction,but the necessity does not of itself create a right of way,though it may be evidence of the grantor intention to convey one and raise an implication of a grant.county of los angeles bartlett,supra,d at.another decision similarly concluded t he fact that there is no way to the land sold except over the remaining land of the grantor,or that the remaining land of the grantor is not accessible except over the land granted by him,is only a circumstance resorted to for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties to the grant or reservation of a way united states rindge.as these authorities recognize,the common law doctrine does not exist to ensure a right of access to any and all landlocked property rather,the doctrine is properly applied only when the circumstances establish that an access easement was intended at the time of the common owner conveyance.
when federal or state land patents are at issue,strict necessity and common ownership remain requirements of an easement by necessity.in contrast to private party conveyances,however,conveyances involving a sovereign as the common owner typically do not give rise to implied reservations of easements or other property interests in conveyed land,leo sheep united states,d leo sheep easement by necessity hash united states,fee interest in land underlying abandoned railroad easements state black,way of necessity.courts have come to this result based on various considerations.
first,all patents,particularly those of federal origin,play a significant role in establishing title to property a patent to land,issued by the united states under authority of law,is the highest evidence of title,something upon which the holder can rely for peace and security in his possession.brown northern hills regional railroad authority.mindful of this circumstance,a number of courts express reluctance to interfere with the certainty and predictability of land titles conferred by a sovereign without any express reservation of rights,leo sheep,supra,at.brown northern hills regional railroad authority,supra,at granite beach holdings state of washington,granite beach holdings state black,supra,at united states rindge,supra,at dictum.
second,the federal government owned most all of the land at one time.observing that generations of federal patents have issued with no express reservation of rights,some courts warn that the requirement would be meaningless unless stronger showings are required for implying an easement by necessity in cases tracing back to patents,state black,supra,at see also granite beach holdings,supra,at.
finally,some courts recognize that strict necessity does not exist in the case of the sovereign as in the case of the private landowner,because the sovereign can exercise the power of eminent domain to obtain any and all reasonable,leo sheep,supra,at.state black,supra,at see also moores walsh,supra,th,fn,d assuming an easement by necessity could be found if traced to common ownership by the federal government,any such easement was extinguished when state grantee could exercise its power of eminent domain.
the united states supreme court adverted to at least two of these considerations in leo sheep,supra.in that case,the federal government had made a land grant to a private party without expressly reserving a for public access to a reservoir located on landlocked federal property.the government sought to establish an implied reservation in the land grant,but the high court rejected the claim where a private landowner conveys to another individual a portion of his lands in a certain area and retains the rest,it is presumed at common law that the grantor has reserved an easement to pass over the granted property if such passage is necessary to reach the retained property.these are referred to as easements by necessity.there are two problems with the government reliance on that notion in this case.first of all,whatever right of passage a private landowner might have,it is not at all clear that it would include the right to construct a road for public access to a recreational area.more importantly,the easement is not actually a matter of necessity in this case because the government has the power of eminent domain.leo sheep,supra,at.fns.omitted.
the high court proceeded to explain that the pertinent inquiry was the intent of congress when it granted the land in question pursuant to the union pacific act of leo sheep,supra,at.after observing that the act specifically listed certain reservations to the grant but not one for access,the court declined to find the tenuous relevance of the doctrine of ways of necessity sufficient to overcome the inference prompted by the omission of any reference to the reserved right of access asserted by the government.ibid.as the court explained,i t is possible that congress gave the problem of access little thought but it is at least as likely that the thought which was given focused on negotiation,reciprocity considerations,and the power of eminent domain as the obvious devices for ameliorating disputes,fn.omitted.the high court held,both as a matter of common law doctrine and as a matter of construing congressional intent,that no reserved existed w e are unwilling to imply,with the substantial impact that such implication would have on property rights granted over years ago,in the absence of a stronger case for their implication than the government makes here.id.at.
the foregoing authorities and the considerations they raise are persuasive.therefore,although we need not and do not presently impose a categorical bar to all claims tracing common ownership to the federal government,we hold that the special considerations above must inform the determination whether such an easement arises by implication.this means that,consistent with existing california common law,an easement by necessity may arise by implication based on the inferred intent of the parties to the property conveyance,as determined from the terms of the relevant instrument and the circumstances surrounding the transaction.daywalt walker,supra,d at.county of los angeles bartlett,supra,d at.strict necessity and common ownership remain required showings kellogg,supra,th at,d daywalt walker,supra,d at,but when a claimant traces common ownership back to the federal government and seeks to establish an implied reservation of an access,the intent of congress is paramount and the government power of eminent domain also bears significance.leo sheep,supra,at.given the unique historical and legal nature of land patents,extreme caution must be exercised in determining whether the circumstances surrounding a government land grant are sufficient to overcome the inference prompted by the omission of an express reference to a reserved right of access.see id.at.in such cases,the easement claimant bears the burden of producing evidence on the issues regarding the government intent to reserve an easement and the government lack of power to condemn.
in this matter,the federal government once simultaneously owned all the parcels composing the claimed dominant estate the murphy property and all the parcels of the claimed servient estate the burch property.by,the government granted to private parties the last of the patents pertaining to the burch property,and in it granted to john bridges the patents pertaining to the murphy property.
the parties agree that,without an e
