jeannette tamayo brought this action under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et the equal pay act,et and.the district court dismissed her complaint for failure to state a claim.see.b.tamayo timely appealed.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.
because this case comes to us after the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim,we must take as true the facts alleged in tamayo complaint.killingsworth hsbc bank nevada,cir.
in,in an effort to increase tax and licensing revenue for the state,the illinois legislature enacted the riverboat gambling act,ilcs et.in addition to legalizing riverboat gambling operations within the state,the act established the illinois gaming board igb,a regulatory and licensing board,whose members are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate.ilcs.the igb is charged with regulating,administering and enforcing the riverboat gambling system.id.it operates under the illinois department of revenue idor,an executive agency broadly empowered to oversee the collection of revenue for the state.
jeannette tamayo began her work with the igb in october,when she was hired as its deputy chief counsel.her duties included representing the igb in licensing investigations and enforcement matters and drafting rules for the igb.her salary as deputy chief counsel was per year.
the daily work of the igb is the responsibility of an administrator,who is charged with overseeing the agency operations and maintaining the igb records.the administrator salary is determined by the igb,but it is subject to approval by the director of the idor.on july,the igb appointed sergio acosta,a male,as its administrator.acosta received a salary of per year during his tenure as administrator.in september,acosta resigned,and the igb appointed another man,thomas swoik,to serve as the interim administrator.he also received a salary of.in november of that year,the igb appointed another male administrator,philip parenti,at a salary of.
in january,rod blagojevich became governor of illinois.a few months later,in june,parenti resigned his position as administrator of the igb.soon thereafter,the igb appointed tamayo as its interim administrator.she was the first female ever to hold the position.with this promotion,tamayo was promised a salary of per year,significantly more than she had made in her previous position as deputy chief counsel.
almost immediately upon assuming the position of interim administrator,however,tamayo began having significant disagreements with the governor office and the idor.according to tamayo,governor blagojevich utilized alonzo monk,his chief of staff,and brian hamer,the director of the idor,in an attempt to take control of the operational,budgetary and personnel decisions of the igb.some of their actions allegedly included attempting to force the igb to hire,and to pay out of its own budget,personnel who actually worked for the idor or the governor attempting to assume control of the igb administrative hearings interfering with the established casino bidding process demanding that the igb cease its investigation of certain casinos demanding that it release the confidential financial information of other casinos and interfering with the igb command and control personnel structure.tamayo made it known that she objected to these practices consequently,she became quite unpopular with the governor office and the idor.her complaint alleges that she was warned twice by hamer to cooperate.
tamayo also had significant disputes with the igb and idor regarding her compensation.despite the fact that she had been promised an annual salary of upon assumption of the interim administrator position,tamayo never saw an increase in her paychecks.during the time that she acted as interim administrator,she continued to be paid at her previous salary of per year.in august,tamayo complained to both the igb and the idor that she was not receiving the correct salary however,her monthly paychecks never increased.
in november and december of,after being paid at the lower deputy chief council salary rate for a number of months,tamayo advised the igb that she believed her lack of compensation was based on the fact that she was a woman,and she was not cooperating with the governor office and the idor in their attempts to control the igb.the igb thereafter attempted to remedy the situation,but its efforts allegedly were stymied by the governor office and the idor,which controlled the igb personnel and budget.in march,the igb advised tamayo to file a discrimination charge with the eeoc.
on april,tamayo took the advice of the igb and filed a discrimination charge.the charge named the idor as her employer.it complained that the idor had failed to approve her promised salary increase at least in part because she was a woman,and it alleged discrimination in violation of title vii.tamayo immediately informed the igb of her actions.
on february,tamayo publicly testified before the illinois house gaming committee about the governor and the idor alleged interference with igb operations,their alleged misuse of public funds and their alleged attempts to influence the outcome of licensing investigations and sales of casinos.in march,after this testimony,the governor replaced the entire igb board with new commissioners.tamayo alleges that,immediately after the new commissioners were appointed,she began to be excluded from all meetings and activities necessary for the proper performance of her duties as igb administrator.on november,tamayo was removed officially from the administrator position.her replacement was mark ostrowski,a male,and he was paid substantially more than tamayo had been paid during her time as administrator.
after her replacement,tamayo returned to her position as deputy chief counsel however,she was given routine work assignments,banned from important igb meetings,prohibited from working on any licensing matters and prohibited from attending staff meetings.in effect,she claims,she was ostracized within the agency.accordingly,she resigned her employment on may,she claims that this resignation constituted a constructive discharge.on march,tamayo filed a second charge with the eeoc,again naming the idor as the respondent employer,but this time alleging retaliation in violation of title vii and the equal pay act 
on june,tamayo filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.the complaint named as defendants the igb and the idor it also named governor blagojevich,idor director hamer and chief of staff monk the individual defendants in both their official and their individual capacities.the defendants filed motions to dismiss on numerous grounds.on december,the district court dismissed the claims against the individual defendants in their official capacities with prejudice,and it dismissed the claims against the individual defendants in their individual capacities without prejudice.
on january,tamayo filed an amended complaint,the complaint at issue in this appeal.her complaint alleged six counts,four naming the idor and the igb,and two naming the individual defendants.against the idor and the igb,she alleged both retaliation and discrimination claims under the equal pay act and title vii.against the individual defendants,she alleged violations of the first and fourteenth amendments,pursuant to.
after this amended complaint was filed,the individual defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them based upon qualified immunity.on may,the district court granted their motion.in its view,tamayo complaint established that her salary dispute involved personal animosity between her and the individual defendants rather than animosity based on her gender therefore,she could not succeed on a sex discrimination claim.at.additionally,the court concluded that tamayo complaint had not alleged facts sufficient to establish a first amendment claim.because her testimony before the state legislature had been given pursuant to her duties as an employee,and not as a citizen,her first amendment claim could not succeed under garcetti ceballos,d.accordingly,the court dismissed tamayo claims against the individual defendants under federal rule of civil procedure b.
the idor then moved to dismiss the claims against it on the ground that the complaint showed that the igb,not the idor,in fact was tamayo employer.on may,the district court granted the idor motion to dismiss under rule b as well.it held that tamayo had pleaded herself out of court by alleging that she was employed by the igb,not the idor.additionally,it noted,her allegations established that the idor did not have de facto control over her employment,and therefore it could not be considered liable as her indirect employer.
the court then invited the igb to file a motion to dismiss tamayo remaining claims,citing the recent supreme court ruling in bell atlantic twombly,d.the igb complied.its subsequent motion to dismiss contended that tamayo had failed to allege enough facts to show that the actions taken against her were motivated by sex discrimination or retaliation by the igb,rather than by a political motive.
on july,the district court granted the igb motion to dismiss the remaining claims.the court concluded that tamayo complaint had established that her problems were a result of a political power struggle between herself and the governor office,and not a result of discrimination or retaliation on the part of the igb.it also held that her title vii claims necessarily failed because she had not properly named the igb as the respondent in her eeoc charges,a prerequisite to filing suit against it.
after dismissing the claims against each named party,the court entered judgment in favor of the defendants on july.tamayo timely appealed.
tamayo challenges the dismissal of her complaint.the defendants maintain that tamayo complaint is infirm on two general grounds first,they contend that she did not plead enough facts regarding her sex discrimination and first amendment claims to plausibly suggest a right to relief second,they contend that she alleged too many facts regarding the actual reasons for her constructive discharge and effectively pleaded herself out of court.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that tamayo alleged sufficient facts in her complaint to prevent dismissal of her sex discrimination and retaliation claims at this stage.on the other hand,we conclude that the district court properly dismissed tamayo first amendment claims against the individual defendants.we first address tamayo claims involving sex discrimination and retaliation we then shall turn to her first amendment claims.
we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss based upon rule b.mccready ebay,cir.a plaintiff complaint need only provide a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,sufficient to provide the defendant with fair notice of the claim and its basis.a bell atlantic.at.we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accepting as true all facts alleged,and drawing all possible inferences in her favor.killingsworth,at.
we previously have stated,on numerous occasions,that a plaintiff alleging employment discrimination under title vii may allege these claims quite generally a complaint need not allege all,or any,of the facts logically entailed by the claim,and it certainly need not include evidence.bennett schmidt,cir quoting am.nurses ass illinois,cir see also kolupa roselle park,cir federal complaints plead claims rather than facts.indeed,l itigants are entitled to discovery before being put to their proof,and treating the allegations of the complaint as a statement of the party proof leads to windy complaints and defeats the function of federal rule of civil procedure rule.bennett,at.
the defendants submit that the supreme court recent decision in bell atlantic,dramatically altered the earlier legal landscape.in bell atlantic,consumers brought a lawsuit against local telephone and internet exchange carriers,alleging that these companies had entered into a conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws.the plaintiffs complaint alleged facts showing that the companies had engaged in parallel conduct.the complaint then simply asserted that,upon information and belief,the defendants had entered into a contract,combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective local telephone high speed internet services markets.id.at.the united states district court for the southern district of new york dismissed the complaint according to rule b,noting that the facts in the complaint suggested only that the companies were engaged in parallel complaint failed to allege any facts suggesting the existence of an agreement.id.at.the district court noted that parallel conduct alone is no more indicative of a conspiracy than it is indicative of sound business practices.id.therefore,the court concluded that the complaint had not alleged sufficient facts to survive a b motion to dismiss.id.
the second circuit reversed.relying on conley gibson,d,it held that a complaint need not specifically allege any of the antitrust plus factors,because to rule that allegations of parallel anticompetitive conduct fail to support a plausible conspiracy claim,a court would have to conclude that there is no set of facts that would permit a plaintiff to demonstrate that the particular parallelism asserted was the product of collusion rather than coincidence.bell atlantic.at quoting twombly bell atl,cir.under the supreme court holding in conley,the second circuit concluded,mere allegations of parallel conduct sufficed to prevent dismissal at this stage.id.
the supreme court granted certiorari in bell atlantic to address the proper standard for pleading an antitrust conspiracy through allegations of parallel conduct.id.the court acknowledged that,under its prior conley precedent,the complaint had alleged sufficient facts to survive rule b dismissal.nevertheless,the court reversed the second circuit ruling.its opinion expressly disavowed the conley standard that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.bell atlantic.at quoting conley,at.instead,it held that allegations of parallel business conduct,along with a bare assertion of conspiracy,are not sufficient to state a claim under the sherman act.id.to survive dismissal,the court concluded,the complaint must allege enough factual matter which,if taken as true,would suggest that an agreement had been made.id.at.allegations of parallel conduct with an assertion of conspiracy gets the complaint close to stating a claim,but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
since bell atlantic,we cautiously have attempted neither to nor to its holding.we have stated that the supreme court in bell atlantic retooled federal pleading standards,and retired the conley formulation.killingsworth,at quoting bell atlantic.at quoting conley,at.we also have cautioned,however,that bell atlantic must not be overread.limestone dev.vill.of lemont,cir.although the opinion contains some language that could be read to suggest otherwise,the court in bell atlantic made clear that it did not,in fact,supplant the basic standard.bell atlantic.at expressly disclaiming the establishment of any heightened pleading standard see also lang tcf bank,cir noting that is still all that is required limestone,at same.a plaintiff still must provide only enough detail to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,and,through his allegations,show that it is plausible,rather than merely speculative,that he is entitled to relief.lang.at citing bell atlantic.at internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted.
the task of applying bell atlantic to the different types of cases that come before us continues.in each context,we must determine what allegations are necessary to show that recovery is plausible.see limestone,at noting that specific requirements will depend on the type of case.for complaints involving complex example,antitrust or rico fuller set of factual allegations may be necessary to show that relief is plausible.id.the court in bell atlantic wished to avoid the in terrorem effect of allowing a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim to force defendants into either costly discovery or an increased settlement value.at see also blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.therefore,we have explained,i f discovery is likely to be more than usually costly,the complaint must include as much factual detail and argument as may be required to show that the plaintiff has a plausible claim.limestone,at.
in equal employment opportunity commission concentra health services,cir,a case decided shortly after bell atlantic,we were asked to determine the minimum pleading requirements in the title vii context.there,an employee alleged that he had been discharged from his employment in violation of the retaliation provisions of title vii.the complaint asserted that the employee had been fired after reporting that his boss was having a sexual relationship with another subordinate and,as a result of that relationship,was favoring her in the workplace.the complaint did not allege that the employee had objected to his boss conduct because he believed that it was sexual harassment instead,the complaint alleged that the employee had reported his boss for favoring a paramour.id.at.because employees are protected against retaliation only when they reasonably believe that the activities they oppose violate title vii,and because favoring a paramour in the workplace,absent some relationship,does not constitute a violation of title vii,the employee subsequent report was not protected conduct.id.at.accordingly,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.id.it noted that the facts alleged,although not logically foreclosing the possibility that some other aspect of the employee report may have been covered under title vii,did not themselves suggest that a violation of title vii had occurred.id.at.on appeal we noted,in dicta,that this dismissal was probably correct,because the plaintiff actions were logically consistent with the possibility that the affair was caused by sexual harassment,but did not suggest that possibility any more than money changing hands suggests robbery.id.at.
the plaintiff then filed an amended complaint,almost identical to the first complaint,but omitting any facts describing the content of the employee report.instead,it summarily asserted that the defendant had violated title vii by retaliating against the employee after he opposed conduct in the workplace that he objectively and reasonably believed in good faith violated title vii.id.at.simply removing unfavorable facts,however,did not save the plaintiff claim.the district court dismissed the complaint again,this time because it alleged too few facts rather than too many.the court noted that the amended complaint offered only conclusory allegations,and it failed to provide the defendants with sufficient notice of the nature of the claim.id.we affirmed,concluding that a general allegation of retaliation for reporting some unspecified act of discrimination did not provide the necessary notice to the defendant so that it could begin investigating and defending against the claim.id.at.
in concentra,we described the supreme court bell atlantic opinion as establishing two hurdles for a complaint in federal court 
first,the complaint must describe the claim in sufficient detail to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.second,its allegations must plausibly suggest that the plaintiff has a right to relief,raising that possibility above a speculative level if they do not,the plaintiff pleads itself out of court.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we further explained that,after bell atlantic,it is no longer sufficient for a complaint to avoid foreclosing possible bases for relief it must actually suggest that the plaintiff has a right to relief,by providing allegations that raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.citing bell atlantic.at.
acknowledging that a complaint must contain something more than a general recitation of the elements of the claim,however,we nevertheless reaffirmed the minimal pleading standard for simple claims of race or sex discrimination.concentra,at.reaffirming our prior holdings in bennett,at,and kolupa,at,we noted 
o nce a plaintiff alleging illegal discrimination has clarified that it is on the basis of her race,there is no further information that is both easy to provide and of clear critical importance to the claim.requiring a more detailed complaint in bennett would have replicated the inefficient chase for facts decried in bennett and dioguardi durning,cir.
concentra,at.even after bell atlantic,concentra affirmed our previous holdings that,in order to prevent dismissal under rule b,a complaint alleging sex discrimination need only aver that the employer instituted a specified adverse employment action against the plaintiff on the basis of her sex.
additionally,bell atlantic explicit praise of form of the federal rules of civil procedure illustrates that conclusory statements are not barred entirely from federal pleadings.the court noted that a complaint of negligence in compliance with form provides sufficient notice to defendants,even though it alleges only that the defendant,on a specified date,negligently drove a motor vehicle against plaintiff who was then crossing an identified highway.bell atlantic.at see also iqbal hasty,cir.to survive dismissal at this stage,the complaint need not state the respects in which the defendant was alleged to be negligent,driving too fast,driving drunk,although such specificity certainly would be required at the summary judgment stage.bell atlantic.at iqbal,at.in these types of cases,the complaint merely needs to give the defendant sufficient notice to enable him to begin to investigate and prepare a defense.
with this precedent in mind,we conclude that tamayo complaint included enough facts in support of a claim of sex discrimination under title vii and the equal pay act to survive dismissal at this stage of the proceedings.she alleged that she is a female.at.she alleged facts regarding her promised and actual salary,as well as the salaries of other similarly situated male employees.id.at.she stated her belief that she was paid less than the similarly situated male employees both because she was a woman and because she was not cooperating with the governor office and the idor in their attempts to control the igb.id.at emphasis added.she further alleged that she has been subjected to adverse employment actions by defendants on account of her gender,id.at,and she listed specific adverse employment actions.she stated that defendants have treated plaintiff differently than similarly situated male employees and exhibited discriminatory treatment against plaintiff in the terms and conditions of her employment on account of plaintiff gender.id.at.finally,she stated that she filed two eeoc charges alleging sex discrimination and that she was issued a notice.id.at.these facts certainly provide the defendants with sufficient notice to begin to investigate and defend against her claim.as we explained in concentra,it is difficult to see what more tamayo could have alleged,without pleading evidence,to support her claim that she was discriminated against least in her sex.
similarly,we conclude that tamayo complaint alleged enough facts to state a claim for retaliation.she alleged that she had performed her job satisfactorily at all times.at.she stated that she filed two eeoc charges alleging sex discrimination and that she was issued a notice.id.at.she then alleged since plaintiff began to complain about her lack of equal pay and filing her charge of discrimination with the eeoc,plaintiff has been subjected to adverse employment actions by defendants in retaliation for her complaints.id.at see also id.at an almost identical statement,substituting complain about the sexual discrimination she was experiencing for complain about her lack of equal pay.the complaint then listed a number of specific adverse employment actions.the defendants were put on notice about the nature of the claims and,unlike in concentra,tamayo did not attempt to obfuscate the facts to avoid dismissal.the allegations in her complaint were sufficient to state a claim of retaliation under the standard outlined in bell atlantic and concentra.
finally,we conclude that tamayo has alleged sufficient facts regarding her section sex discrimination claim to survive dismissal at this stage.in addition to the allegations,she specified that defendants blagojevich,hamer and monk treated plaintiff less favorably than such male employees on account of her gender.id.at.despite the individual defendants contention that tamayo failed to allege that they personally had violated her rights,the complaint further alleged that the individual defendants intentionally engaged in a course of conduct to prevent plaintiff from being paid the per year that plaintiff was told that she would receive.id.at.drawing all inferences in tamayo favor,these allegations are sufficient to state a claim of sex discrimination under section.
having determined that tamayo pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim of discrimination,we must now decide whether she effectively pleaded herself out of court by also including in her complaint additional facts that suggest that the defendants actions were motivated by a political power struggle rather than by animus.
our case law recognizes that a party may plead itself out of court by pleading facts that establish an impenetrable defense to its claims.massey merrill lynch,cir.a plaintiff pleads himself out of court when it would be necessary to contradict the complaint in order to prevail on the merits.kolupa,at.if the plaintiff voluntarily provides unnecessary facts in her complaint,the defendant may use those facts to demonstrate that she is not entitled to relief.mccready,at jackson marion county,cir.
the district court concluded that tamayo pleaded herself out of court by filling pages of her complaint with facts showing the political motivations behind her low pay and constructive discharge.the defendants submit that the district court was correct.they rely upon bell atlantic statements that a plaintiff must do more than avoid foreclosing possible bases for relief in her complaint she must also show that relief actually is plausible.see bell atlantic.at.in the defendants view,when tamayo voluntarily alleged facts that suggested her ill treatment was for some other,reason,her pleading burden effectively increased she then should have alleged additional facts to suggest that her sex discrimination theory was not mere speculation.
tamayo undoubtedly did allege a number of facts in support of her first amendment claim that tend to suggest an alternative,motivation for the defendants actions however,this alternative is not mutually exclusive with sex discrimination.unlike the plaintiffs in massey,at tamayo does not allege any facts that establish an impenetrable defense to her sex discrimination claim she merely alleges facts that ultimately make her success on the merits less likely.recovery is still plausible under her complaint.
although our pleading rules do not tolerate factual inconsistencies in a complaint,they do permit inconsistencies in legal theories.see,cleveland policy mgmt,d.to succeed in a title vii discrimination action,an employee need not show that her sex was the exclusive reason for her employer actions.she must prove only that sex was a motivating factor.hossack floor covering assocs.of joliet,cir bellaver quanex,cir.although the defendants ultimately may be able to prove that they would have engaged in the same conduct based on their political disagreements with tamayo,it is not implausible that tamayo sex also was a motivating factor in their behavior.the complaint certainly shows that the defendants were upset with tamayo failure to cooperate with their policies however,it leaves open the possibility that,had she been a male,they would not have reacted by blocking her salary increase or ostracizing her in the office.such a contention may be difficult for tamayo to prove however,that is a question to be confronted later in the litigation when the plaintiff is put to her proof.
we next must address the district court alternative ground for dismissing tamayo claims against the idor and the igb that tamayo complaint failed for want of an employer.title vii and the equal pay act impose liability upon the complaining employee employer.a d.the idor contends that it can not be held liable because tamayo complaint alleged that the igb,and not the idor,was her employer.conversely,the igb asserts that it can not be held liable because tamayo named the idor,and not the igb,as her employer in her eeoc charges.filing an eeoc charge against the defendant is,the igb notes,a prerequisite to suit under title vii.the district court agreed with both the idor and the igb and granted both defendants motions to dismiss.
we first address the idor assertion that it can not be considered tamayo employer because the igb,and not the idor,actually employed tamayo.the idor is correct that the complaint alleges that the igb hired,promoted,demoted and ultimately constructively discharged tamayo.nevertheless,the complaint also asserts that the idor,not the igb,controlled her compensation.consistent with the riverboat gambling act,the complaint states that the salary of the administrator was determined by the igb and approved by the director of the idor.at emphasis added see also ilcs a.furthermore,it alleges that the idor in fact exercised control over tamayo salary by refusing to authorize her promised raise.tamayo salary is the subject of her equal pay act claim,as well as one of the adverse employment actions alleged in her title vii claim,and the complaint alleges that the idor exercised control over this highly significant aspect of her employment.
the idor also is alleged to have exercised at least some control over the igb personnel decisions.tamayo complaint states that the idor sought to require the igb to hire outside counsel,at,and sought to cause the igb to lay off five employees,id.at.additionally,she alleges that hamer,the director of the idor,asked her how she,as my employee and being paid by us,would handle his request to discontinue the isle of capri investigation.id.at.finally,the complaint asserts that the igb advised tamayo to file an eeoc charge against the idor,informing her that it could not do anything to help her because the idor was controlling the personnel and budget.id.at.such allegations,if true,suggest that the idor functioned as tamayo employer for the purposes of title vii and the equal pay act.
despite these allegations,the defendants contend that tamayo complaint also alleges facts that conclusively show the idor was not her employer.they point to her statements,made to hamer and others,that the idor attempts to control the igb were improper they also highlight the fact that she told hamer that the igb was an independent agency under the law and that she reported to the igb and not hamer,idor or the governor office.id.at.particularly at this stage of the proceedings,however,the defendants contention is without merit.certainly,tamayo has made clear her belief that the idor and the governor office should not have exercised any control over her employment.however,her statements that the idor should not control the igb do not preclude the possibility of her other allegation that the idor did in fact control the igb personnel decisions.similarly,her assertion that the igb was an independent agency,id.at,is neither conclusive nor an admission that the idor was not also her employer for the purposes of title vii and the equal pay act.
the equal pay act defines an employer as including any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee and includes a public agency.d.title vii defines employer as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce
