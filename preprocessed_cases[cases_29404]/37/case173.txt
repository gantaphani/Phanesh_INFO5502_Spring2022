defendants the city of richmond and the city council of the city of richmond city appeal the judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate invalidating a municipal services agreement msa entered into by the city and the scotts valley band of pomo indians of california tribe.the trial court concluded the city violated the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et ceqa when it approved the msa we reverse.
factual background and procedural history 
the tribe is a federally recognized indian tribe whose status was terminated in and restored by the secretary of the interior secretary in.as a result of the termination,the tribe was divested of its tribal lands.in january,the tribe submitted an application requesting the secretary acquire acres in unincorporated west contra costa county in trust for the benefit of the tribe the proposed site is adjacent to the city of richmond.the tribe plans to use the site to develop,construct and operate a class iii gaming facility,consisting of a structure that would house,among other things,gaming machines and gaming tables 
in february,the tribe released a draft environmental impact statement deis prepared pursuant to the federal national environmental policy act of et.
on april,representatives from the city met with the tribe to begin discussions on entering into an agreement regarding the provision of municipal services to the tribe.
on april,the city submitted comments regarding the deis to the department of the interior bureau of indian affairs bia.
on may,the city and the tribe formally entered into an agreement to negotiate the msa.
on september,the tribe responded to the city comments on the deis.
on november,city staff submitted a report to the city council outlining key provisions of the proposed msa.in the report,staff noted that it was unknown whether the federal government would approve the tribe application to acquire the proposed casino site.the impact that a state tribal compact would have on the tribe obligations regarding the casino was also unknown if approved,staff predicted the casino would have a tremendous impact on the surrounding residents and business.as the city would not have any say over the federal or state decisions concerning the tribe casino,staff recommended that the city proceed with the msa to secure funding in order to mitigate the casino direct impact,as well as to improve services throughout the city to mitigate indirect impacts.staff cautioned that if an msa was not approved,the city opportunity to influence the casino project and receive mitigation in the future could be severely limited.
on november,the city council voted to approve the msa.the approval resolution includes a statement that the federal,state,and city actions associated with the casino are not projects of the city within the meaning of ceqa.
on december,the city and the tribe executed the msa.the msa provides that the city will receive,in exchange for the provision of specified city services a nonrecurring payment of,million of which is earmarked for fire protection and the remainder of which is earmarked for police and public works,an annual contribution of million in years one and two,million in years three and four,million in years five and six,and million adjusted annually by the consumer price index cpi in years seven to,and an annual payment of,adjusted annually by the cpi,for the term of the msa,intended to fund salaries for new police,fire,and public works personnel and equipment.the city also agreed to support the tribe application.the city disavowed any commitment to make physical changes to the environment as a result of the agreement,but indicated an intent to comply with ceqa in the future if necessary.
on july,the parchester village neighborhood council,the citizens of east shore parks,sustainability,parks,recycling and wildlife defense fund,and whitney dotson plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the city.plaintiffs contended the msa was unlawful because the city was required to conduct an environmental review under ceqa before entering into the agreement.they claimed the city violated ceqa by improperly determining that their approval of the msa did not constitute the approval of a project subject to ceqa and that their actions were exempt from ceqa.
on september,the trial court issued a final ruling adopting its tentative ruling in favor of plaintiffs.
on november,the trial court filed its judgment for plaintiffs.
on november,the trial court filed its peremptory writ of mandate,requiring the city to set aside its approval of the msa.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
a claim that an agency approved a project with potentially significant environmental effects before preparing and considering an eir is an issue concerning procedural error that is to be decided by the courts independently.save tara city of west hollywood cal th,fn.d,save tara.
ceqa is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide protection to the environment.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d.in general,ceqa compels government first to identify the environmental effects of projects,and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives.it permits government agencies to approve projects that have an environmentally deleterious effect,but also requires them to justify those choices in light of specific social or economic conditions.sierra club state bd.of forestry cal th,d.
under ceqa,local agencies such as the city are required to prepare an eir on any project that they intend to carry out or approve which may have a significant effect on the environment.the legislature has made clear that an eir is an informational document and that t he purpose of an environmental impact report is to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized and to indicate alternatives to such a project.citations.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d.however,an agency has no duty of compliance with ceqa unless its actions will constitute approval of a project.citation.concerned mccloud citizens mccloud community services dist.th,d mccloud.
ceqa applies only to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies,subd.a.a project subject to ceqa is defined as an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,and which is any of the following a an activity directly undertaken by any public agency.b an activity undertaken by a person which is supported,in whole or in part,through contracts,grants,subsidies,loans,or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies.c an activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.
iii.the trial court ruling 
the trial court found that,for purposes of plaintiffs petition,the city endorsement and construction commitments specified in the msa constituted a project within the meaning of public resources code section because they amounted to an activity directly undertaken by the city with the potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,tit,subd.a.the court found that while the msa has an emphasis on funding mechanisms it also commits the city to a range of fire improvements,along with various traffic improvements and a bicycle lane.the court also found it significant that the msa includes an official endorsement of the tribe application.
the city claims its decision to enter into the msa was not an approval of a project under ceqa.it contends the msa merely concerns the funding of hypothetical improvements that will be carried out only if certain preconditions are satisfied.
iv.is the tribe casino a ceqa project of the city 
we first address plaintiffs repeated claims that the tribe casino is itself a project that triggers the city obligation to comply with ceqa.they contend that because the casino is the activity for which all these approvals are made,and the casino is clearly a definite course of action that will change the physical environment,the msa triggered ceqa.they assert the city qualifies as both a responsible agency and a lead with respect to the casino project.the city counters that it had no regulatory authority over the casino and therefore the casino is not a project of the city within the meaning of ceqa.we find the city position to be persuasive.
as noted above,public resources code section defines project to include an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,and which is a n activity directly undertaken by any public agency.id.subd.a,italics added.the ceqa guidelines,tit,et describe an activity directly undertaken by any public agency to include public works construction and related activities clearing or grading of land,improvements to existing public structures,enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances,and the adoption and amendment of local general plans or elements thereof guidelines,subd.a.the guidelines further provide that approval,with respect to private projects,occurs upon the earliest commitment to issue or the issuance by the public agency of a discretionary contract,grant,subsidy,loan,or other form of financial assistance,lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use of the project.guidelines,subd.b.the guidelines must be read in the context of public resources code section which provides that local agencies shall prepare an environmental impact report on any project that they intend to carry out or approve which may have a significant effect on the environment.italics added.
in our view,the tribe casino development does not constitute a project of the city under ceqa because the city has no legal authority over the property upon which the casino will be situated.while the msa does indicate that the city agreed to support the tribe efforts to acquire the land and to obtain the requisite approvals from the bia and the governor,this expression of support does not transform the casino into a project so as to trigger the city preparation of an eir.
first,an agency does not commit itself to a project simply by being a proponent or advocate of the project city of vernon board of harbor comrs.th,d,disapproved on other grounds in save tara,supra,cal th,fn.if having high esteem for a project before preparing an environmental impact report eir nullifies the process,few public projects would withstand judicial scrutiny,since it is inevitable that the agency proposing a project will be favorably disposed to it.citation.save tara,supra,at.secondly,the proposed casino will be built on a site that is entirely outside the city boundaries.therefore the city has no legal jurisdiction over the property.should the city change its mind and decide to disapprove of the project,its decision would not be binding on the bia or the governor.
plaintiffs claim the city has substantial influence over the federal government decision to grant the tribe application because,under title of the united states code section b a of the igra,the city opinion on the matter must be considered the referenced statute requires the secretary to consult with appropriate local officials before approving an application.as the city notes,however,the provision under which the tribe sought the casino site b b iii does not require local government approval or support while plaintiffs assert the city exercised considerable control over the casino project size,timing and impacts,they do not cite to anything in the record to support their assertion that the msa represents the city pivotal approval of this project,or that its refusal to support the tribe could have prevented the casino from being constructed.
additionally,the case that plaintiffs rely on,county of amador city of plymouth th d amador,actually undermines their position.in amador,the appellate court found the acquisition of trust lands for a casino development was not the project of the city of plymouth within the meaning of ceqa precisely because neither the taking of lands in trust nor the casino development requires the formal approval of the city amador,supra,at.instead,the municipal services agreement involved in that case was deemed to be subject to ceqa because it unconditionally obligated the city to vacate a portion of a city road and to remodel the city existing fire station.the agreement also conditionally obligated the city to construct connections to the casino sewer and water systems and to increase system capacity to meet the needs of the casino development.amador,supra,at.the appellate court made clear that the project for purposes of ceqa consisted of the things which the msa commits the city to construct.amador,supra,at,fn.further,the court affirmed the ceqa project was not the casino itself,for the approval of that project,with the exception of the state role in authorizing gambling pursuant to a compact,is confined to the federal government.amador,supra,at.in sum,the casino project is not a project of the city within the meaning of ceqa.
is the msa support of the tribe application a ceqa project 
plaintiffs claim the msa support of the tribe application to the bia constitutes a project requiring ceqa review.we have already held that the tribe casino is not a project of the city for the purposes of ceqa.accordingly,it follows that the city endorsement of the tribe application is also not the city project.
again,plaintiffs reliance on amador is misplaced.in amador,the city had sent a letter to the secretary in support of the tribe application to place the land in trust.the letter was incorporated into the msa.amador,supra,th.while the appellate court stated it is unrealistic to assert that the city support of the tribe application has no consequences for the process being pursued by the tribe,id.at,the court did not hold that the expression of support,standing alone,was a project for ceqa purposes.further,in discussing why it would not sever the letter of support from the municipal services agreement,the court did not hold the letter was invalid because it was a project.rather,the court held that the city letter of support constituted the sole consideration for the tribe entering into the msa and that this support thus was an approval of obligations under the msa to engage in activities in violation of ceqa,rendering the letter void and the entire contract a nullity.amador,supra,at.
vi.is the msa a funding mechanism 
the city asserts that ceqa does not apply to agency actions that simply provide a mechanism for funding possible improvements and do not commit the public agency to approve any specific project.the city further notes the msa does not ignore the possibility that ceqa may apply in the future should any improvements be implemented because the agreement provides if and to the extent the city hereafter determines that it is required to comply with ceqa with respect to any activities undertaken to fulfill its obligations under this agreement,the city shall comply with ceqa at such time.plaintiffs argue that the msa,while including provisions related to funding,also sets forth substantive duties that commit both the tribe and the city to approve and construct numerous improvements and provide related services,thereby triggering ceqa review.
in save tara,supra,the supreme court addressed the proper application of ceqa in the context of a public agency approval of a contract relating to a proposed development.in that case,the city of west hollywood had agreed to allow a private developer to redevelop property for senior housing.the agreement was conditioned on future compliance with ceqa.save tara,supra,cal th.the court concluded that,because the city had already committed itself to the project,it was required to prepare and consider an eir before entering into the agreement.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court considered the following factors.first,the city agreed to initially lend the developer nearly half a million dollars,a promise not conditioned on ceqa compliance and if the city did not give final approval to the project,it would not be repaid.id.at.secondly,the agreement provided that whether ceqa requirements had been met was to be reasonably determined by the city manager,language that could have left the city open to charges it acted unreasonably,had it ultimately declined to certify the eir or make any needed ceqa findings.ibid.third,the agreement had no provision for appealing to the city council the city manager decision on,or waiver of,ceqa compliance.id.at.fourth,the agreement arguably left open the question whether the city remained free to find that the eir was legally adequate and yet to reject the project on substantive environmental grounds.id.at.fifth,the city made public announcements that it was determined to proceed with the development of the project.id.at.sixth,the city proceeded with tenant relocation on the assumption the property would be redeveloped as in the proposed project.ibid.these factors tended strongly to show that the city commitment to the project was not contingent on review of an eir.ibid.
unlike the municipality in save tara,it appears to us that the city did not unconditionally commit itself to making any of the physical changes referenced in the msa.we thus agree with the city contention that the msa is best understood as a mechanism for funding proposed projects that may be modified or not implemented at all depending upon a number of factors,including ceqa environmental review.guidelines,subd.b.
we addressed a situation similar to the present one in citizens to enforce ceqa city of rohnert park th d rohnert park.in that case,a city had entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with an indian tribe regarding a gambling casino the tribe proposed to construct outside the city limits.id.at.the mou was an agreement to establish a source of funds for potential future improvements if the casino project takes place.id.at.the mou also addressed the ways in which the tribe agree d to mitigate potential impacts of its casino project.id.at.noting that the mou acknowledged ceqa review could be required if the city were to provide infrastructure for the casino,we held the city entry into the mou was not a project because the agreement merely authorized a funding mechanism.id.at.
in rohnert park,we cited to kaufman bay,morgan hill unified school dist.th d kaufman broad,wherein the appellate court held that a school district resolution to establish a community facilities district cfd to raise funds,to acquire sites for the construction of schools,to lease or purchase portable classrooms and buses,and to rehabilitate future facilities was not a project for purposes of ceqa compliance.citation.rohnert park,supra,th.the court in kaufman broad explained the only foreseeable impact from formation of cfd is that when the district does determine sometime in the future to acquire sites for the construction of schools,to lease or purchase portable classrooms and buses,and to rehabilitate future facilities it will have some of the funds necessary to do so.when it makes those decisions,which depend in large part on the pattern of development within the district,it will have to examine the environmental impacts.here the district resolution forming cfd is not an essential step culminating in action which may affect the environment.citation.kaufman broad,supra,at.
we found the mou in rohnert park to be similar to the funding mechanism addressed by the appellate court in kaufman broad it sets no time for development and does not obligate the city to undertake a specified construction project.rather,it is an agreement to establish a source of funds for potential future improvements if the casino project takes place.the mou specifically acknowledges that ceqa review and compliance may be required if the city ever provides infrastructure related to the casino project.mere authorization of the funding mechanism set out in the mou is not a project for purposes of ceqa.rohnert park,supra,th.
plaintiffs claim that the msa is not merely a funding mechanism because it commits the city to support the tribe applications to the governor and the bia,as well as to the construction of substantial physical improvements and services.while plaintiffs concede that the specific location and timing of some of these improvements and services will be identified more specifically in the future,they argue that the city has definitely committed to support the casino project and assume responsibility for providing extensive supportive facilities and services by entering into the msa.plaintiffs seek to distinguish rohnert park and kaufman broad,arguing that the agreements at issue in those cases only committed the government agencies to financial arrangements,and were therefore construed by the courts as mere funding mechanisms that are not subject to ceqa.they claim the msa includes substantive duties that commit both the tribe and the city to approve and construct numerous improvements and provide related services we are not persuaded.
the msa at issue in the present case is similar to the rohnert park mou.both agreements set no timeline for the construction of physical improvements and do not obligate the city to undertake any specified construction project.rohnert park,supra,th.similarly both documents specifically acknowledge that ceqa review might be required if the municipality ultimately provides infrastructure related to the casino projects.rohnert park,supra,at.while an agreement conditioning of initial approval on ceqa compliance is not determinative with respect to the timing of ceqa review,it is relevant.
in save tara,supra,our supreme court considered the impact of a similar ceqa compliance condition in an agency agreement allowing private development.the court concluded that the agreement conditioning of final approval on ceqa compliance is relevant but not determinative in deciding whether a public agency has committed itself to,and therefore approved,a project.save tara,supra,cal th.such a condition can be a legitimate ingredient in a preliminary agreement for exploration of a proposed project,but if the agreement,viewed in light of all the surrounding circumstances,commits the public agency as a practical matter to the project,the simple insertion of a ceqa compliance condition will not save the agreement from being considered an approval requiring prior environmental review.id.at.the court applied the general principle that before conducting ceqa review,agencies must not take any action that significantly furthers a project in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of ceqa review of that public project.citations.id.at.in the present case,we conclude the msa ceqa compliance condition is a legitimate ingredient of the parties agreement.
the msa is also distinguishable from the agreement that was invalidated in amador,supra.in amador,the municipal services agreement required the city to remodel its fire station,to construct any required connection to its existing sewer collection system,to install a backflow valve and sampling manhole with meter,to obtain any required easements for sewer infrastructure,and to vacate a city road.further,the msa did not specifically acknowledge that any of these actions,or any other actions taken by the city might require ceqa review.amador,supra,th.for these reasons,the appellate court deemed the agreement unlike the mere funding agreement in rohnert park.ibid.
the present case also contrasts with citizens for responsible government city of albany th d albany,relied on by plaintiffs.in albany,the city council negotiated an agreement allowing a developer to add a cardroom gaming facility to its existing horse racing track operation.id.at.the city council then passed several resolutions ordering the development agreement,among other i
