claim of the patent shows this limitation in context 
the method of playing a game of bingo comprising 
a providing a player with a bingo card having a plurality of numbered spaces formed as a matrix having five rows and five columns used in the play of a bingo game 
b providing a plurality of bingo balls,each having individual numbers corresponding to the numbered spaces on the bingo card 
c a player making a first wager to be eligible for the bingo game

e randomly selecting consecutive bingo balls 
f awarding a first preselected amount when the player achieves a predetermined winning combination on the matrix of the bingo card 
g designating a portion of the second wager to a separate progressive jackpot pool 
h establishing a predetermined combination as a winning combination for the progressive jackpot pool and 
i awarding the progressive jackpot pool to the player when he achieves the predetermined winning combination on the bingo card.

on appeal,gametech argues that,the progressive predetermined winning combination limitation requires fixation of the entire winning combination before drawing the first bingo ball in any given bingo game.according to gametech,a player of a planet bingo game will know ahead of time that red squares will give the progressive bingo and the position of those red squares on the board,but a player of rainbow bingo will not know this information until after the first ball is drawn.planet bingo responds that progressive predetermined winning combination merely requires that the participants in the game know,before the start of play,the predetermined rules for winning a progressive jackpot.planet bingo argues that the disclosure only requires that the player know in advance that he according to claim of the patent is playing for a red bingo to win the progressive prize,not what the exact location on the board the red squares will be before the game begins.thus,the claims recite a progressive predetermined winning combination,but the parties dispute what must be predetermined before drawing the first bingo ball.
the claim language governs claim meaning.phillips awh,en banc.in this case,the claim language supports gametech construction.the claims recite a progressive predetermined winning combination not merely predetermined rules for identifying a winning combination.the rules may dictate that a red bingo will win the progressive game.the winning combination,however,identifies the particular squares,colored red,that will produce the progressive bingo.
