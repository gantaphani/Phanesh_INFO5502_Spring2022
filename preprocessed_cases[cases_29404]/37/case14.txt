the united states appeals from an august,order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york jack weinstein,judge entering a judgment of acquittal in favor of defendant appellee lawrence dicristina,setting aside the guilty verdict on one count of violating the illegal gambling business act the igba,and one count of conspiring to do so under.the district court ruled that dicristina conviction must be set aside because texas hold poker was not covered by the igba.united states dicristina,d.because we find that the plain language of the igba covers dicristina poker business,we reverse the judgment of acquittal and remand to the district court with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict,enter a judgment of conviction on both counts,and proceed with sentencing dicristina.
background 
the basic facts of this case are not in dispute between december and may,dicristina,along with his stefano lombardo and others,operated a poker club in the back room of a warehouse in staten island,new york,out of which he conducted a legitimate business selling electric bicycles.dicristina,d at.the poker games which were generally held twice a week,were advertised by word of mouth and text message.id.the club contained two tables at which no limit texas hold was played.id.the dealers collected a five percent rake for the house from each pot,percent of which they kept as payment.id.the remaining funds from the rake were used for expenses relating to the operation of the business and for profits.id.other than the operation of these poker games,no unlawful conduct by dicristina is alleged.id.dicristina and lombardo pleaded guilty on december.on may,dicristina was permitted to withdraw his guilty plea,and the matter was set for trial.
on june,dicristina moved to dismiss the second superseding indictment on the basis that poker is not or predominated by chance,and thus is not encompassed in the igba enumerated list of illegal types of gambling.the district court heard testimony by dicristina expert,randall heeb,as to why skill predominates over chance in poker,dicristina,d at,but reserved decision on the motion to dismiss,and the parties went forward with trial.id.at.over dicristina objection,the district court ruled that the question of whether poker fell within the igba was a question of law to be decided by the court,excluded heeb testimony as irrelevant,id.at,and instructed the jury that gambling under the igba includes playing poker for money.
the jury found dicristina guilty on both counts charged in the second superseding indictment.dicristina then renewed his motion to dismiss in the form of a motion for a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure.he argued that in order for conduct to come under the purview of the igba,it must be sufficiently similar to the nine games enumerated in b and poker did not fall within the statutory definition of an illegal gambling business because it was neither nor predominated by chance.dicristina,d at.the government argued that subsection b did not,by its plain language,restrict the games that constitute unlawful gambling under the igba and therefore it was sufficient for purposes of the statute that a gambling activity was illegal under state law,as poker was under new york law in this instance.id.after considering additional briefing and expert testimony from both sides,the district court dismissed the second superseding indictment and entered a judgment of acquittal.
the district court determined that both the government and dicristina presented plausible readings of the statute,and that the legislative history was not decisive as to whether congress meant to include poker within the igba.reasoning that the igba did not provide explicit criteria for defining gambling,and that there were ambiguities in the federal definition of gambling,the district court found that the governing criteria must be derived by determining what common characteristics unif y the games listed in b into a cohesive group.id.at.the district court found that dictionary,common law,and other federal definitions of gambling argue in favor of a definition limited to games of chance.id.at.it then determined that poker did not constitute gambling under the igba because poker is predominated by skill rather than chance.id.at.this timely appeal followed.

we review a district court legal conclusions,including those interpreting the meaning of a statute,de novo.united states stewart,cir united states koh,cir.
when interpreting a statute,we must begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.united states kozeny,cir interpreting quoting united states albertini,d internal quotation marks omitted.where the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.id.quoting united states ron pair,d see also.bank germain,d we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.

ii.text of the statute 
statutory scheme 
the igba provides in relevant part 
prohibition of illegal gambling businesses 
a whoever conducts,finances,manages,supervises,directs,or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
b as used in this section 
illegal gambling business means a gambling business which 
i is a violation of the law of a state or political subdivision in which it is conducted 
ii involves five or more persons who conduct,finance,manage,supervise,direct,or own all or part of such business and 
iii has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of in any single day.
gambling includes but is not limited to,bookmaking,maintaining slot machines,roulette wheels or dice tables,and conducting lotteries,policy,bolita or numbers games,or selling chances therein.
state means any state of the united states,the district of columbia,the commonwealth of puerto rico,and any territory or possession of the united states.
emphasis added.
subsection e of the igba excludes from the statute scope any bingo game,lottery,or similar game of chance conducted by a organization.id.e emphasis added.
pursuant to b l i,we look to state law definitions of gambling.new york law provides that 
a person engages in gambling when he stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his control or influence,upon an agreement or understanding that he will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.
a contest of chance is in turn defined under new york law as any contest,game,gaming scheme or gaming device in which the outcome depends in a material degree upon an element of chance,notwithstanding that skill of the contestants may also be a factor therein.id.the parties do not dispute that poker constitutes gambling under new york state law.see dicristina,d at noting that dicristina had waived the argument that poker was not gambling under new york law and explaining that it has no merit 
the supreme court has observed that the igba declar es that certain gambling activities violate federal as well as state law,thereby giv ing the federal government a new substantive weapon with which to strike at organized crime principal source of revenue illegal gambling.iannelli united states,d.in sanabria united states,d,the court noted that 
congress did not assimilate state gambling laws per se into the federal penal code,nor did it define discrete acts of gambling as independent federal offenses.the government need not prove that the defendant himself performed any act of gambling prohibited by state law.it is participation in the gambling business that is a federal offense,and it is only the gambling business that must violate state law.
id.at internal citations and footnotes omitted.
requirements of the igba 
the plain language of clearly outlines the activity that it proscribes.it criminalizes the act of running a gambling business that operates in violation of the law of the state in which the business is conducted is conducted by five people or more and is either in operation for more than thirty days or earns more than in one day.see b.the inclusion of elements and demonstrates that the focus of the statute criminal proscription is not on what game is being played,but on the size of the business and the revenue derived by those who are running it.see sanabria,at it is participation in the gambling business that is a federal offense emphasis added.as the district court noted,most kitchen table poker games would not satisfy either or both of these requirements.dicristina,d at.dicristina poker business,it is undisputed,satisfied both.
dicristina contends that the igba does not apply to a poker business,however,because poker does not fit within the definition of gambling set forth in subsection b see appellee br.at.but unlike subsection b,which defines illegal gambling business,or subsection b,which defines the term state,subsection b is tellingly not prefaced by the verb means.see groman comm r of internal revenue.w hen an exclusive definition is intended the word means is employed.had congress intended to create a definition of gambling unique to the igba,or to confine the reach of the igba to businesses involving certain types of gambling,it could have inserted such language instead,subsection b states that gambling includes but is not limited to the nine activities listed.b emphasis added.it does not include the words games similar to or any other such language limiting subsection b to include only games analogous to those enumerated rather,the phrase includes but is not limited to signals a list of examples of gambling activities 
dicristina contends that reading the statute in this way renders subsection b purposeless.see appellee br.at.we disagree.subsection b lists acts of running a gambling business poolselling,bookmaking,maintaining gambling devices,and conducting games rather than the games themselves.b.it thus serves as an illustration of what may constitute running a gambling operation.as the district court recognized,this reading of subsection b supports the notion that congress was concerned with illustrating types of gambling businesses rather than on creating a limiting definition of gambling under federal law.dicristina,d at.
dicristina also argues that e confirms that the unifying characteristic of the prohibited games is that each is a game of chance,appellee br.at,because the games that are included by the language of subsection b must be the same as those games that are excluded by subsection e.subsection e,it is undisputed,creates an exemption for the activities of charities.it does not make any reference to subsection b,and does not state that it modifies or applies to that subsection in any way.had congress intended to limit the reach of the igba to businesses operating games of chance,it could have done so by inserting that language in subsection b.the district court decision to limit the igba to games of chance was based on its finding that the statute was ambiguous as to what gambling activities it covered.see dicristina,d at.because we find no such ambiguity,we decline to limit the statute reach beyond its plain terms.
thus,the question of whether skill or chance predominates in poker is inapposite to this appeal the language of the statute is clear that it contains only three requirements,all set forth in subsection b,and all of which were met in this case.
our precedent is consistent with this holding.in united states gotti,cir,we ruled of 
this statute provides that w hoever conducts,finances,manages,supervises,directs,or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.a.an illegal gambling business,in turn,is defined as one which i is a violation of the law of a state in which it is conducted ii involves five or more persons who conduct,finance,manage,supervise,direct,or own all or part of such business and iii has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of in any single day.b.
id.at emphasis in original.
in gotti,defendant bondi was convicted of two counts of violating the igba one for running a bookmaking business,and one for maintaining an electronic machine poker game called joker poker.he challenged his conviction of the latter count on the grounds that joker poker machines were not illegal gambling devices under new york state law because the games played thereon were games of skill rather than contests of chance.id.at.we rejected this argument,finding that under new york law a contest of chance encompasses games in which the skill of the contestants may play a role,so long as the outcome depends in a material degree on chance.id.
while the parties in gotti did not raise the argument now made by dicristina,we specifically ruled in that case that an illegal gambling business is defined as one which met the three elements articulated in subsection b.id.at dicristina now asks us to find that the statute requires the government to prove that the alleged business activity meets a fourth element the definition of gambling in subsection b.
as the district court acknowledged,the only circuit court to have directly addressed this issue is the third circuit in united states atiyeh,cir.in atiyeh,the third circuit rejected the argument dicristina now advances,stating 
defendant argues that the conduct for which he was convicted,becoming a custodian of funds that were wagered or to be wagered,does not come within the limited definition of what constitutes gambling under b.this argument is flawed.the relevant definition for our purposes is that of an illegal gambling business,provided for in b,not the definition of gambling provided for in b.the jury found that defendant violated a pennsylvania statute,and therefore operated an illegal gambling business as defined by b.we have held that the mere custodianship of funds is sufficient to constitute a violation of,because such custodianship is considered to be gambling under state law even though it may not appear to fit within gambling as defined in b.
at footnote omitted.thus,the third circuit has arrived at an understanding of the igba similar to the one we reach today.
indeed,federal courts have repeatedly applied the igba to businesses operating games including poker that are not enumerated therein,without reading the statute to contain a definition in subsection b.see united states useni,cir applying igba to bingo hall gotti,at same as to business operating video game joker poker united states pack,at cir,unpublished opinion same as to gambling business that included poker united states trupiano,cir same as to gin rummy business united states rieger,cir same as to poker business united states zannino,cir same united states angiulo,cir same united states reitano,cir same as to blackjack business united states shursen,cir same united states dadanian,cir same as to poker club,rev on reh g on other grounds,united states tarter,cir rejecting argument that igba did not cover defendant small scale poker business,which consisted of seven card stud with a fifty cent opener and a two to four dollar limit on raises united states dey,cr,wl,at june,poker business united states hsieh,cr,wl,at,same.
in sum,courts have overwhelmingly read the igba to have only three elements the gambling business violates the law of the state in which the business is conducted the business involves five or more persons who conduct,finance,manage,supervise,direct,or own all or part of such business and the business has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of in any single day.see,united states truesdale,cir under section,an illegal gambling business is defined as a gambling business that violates state or local law,involves or more people,and is in continuous operation for more than days or has gross revenue of in any single day.united states cyprian,cir same united states sacco,cir en banc same.we agree,and today hold that an illegal gambling business is one which meets the three elements articulated in subsection b.
iii.legislative history 
based on the clear text of the igba,we could conclude without an examination of congress intention in drafting it.indeed,we look to the legislative history of a statute only where the text itself is not absolutely clear.disabled in action of metro.hammons,cir accord mary jo,at h aving found the relevant provisions of the statute unambiguous,we do not have warrant to consult the legislative history of the statute.we agree with the district court that there appears to be something for everybody in the legislative history,dicristina,d at,and we review it here briefly only to demonstrate that congress unmistakable purpose in enacting the igba bolsters our reading of the statute clear and unambiguous text.
the legislative history is remarkably clear that the passage of this statute was driven by the desire to crack down on organized crime.as the district court noted,t he debates focused not on prohibiting particular kinds of gambling,but on targeting particular kinds of criminals,reaching those who are engaged in an illicit gambling business of major proportions.dicristina,d at quoting,at,at the aim of was to give the federal government a new substantive weapon,a weapon which will strike at organized crime principal source of revenue illegal gambling,at see also senate judiciary hr gs at message from the president of the united states relative to the fight against organized crime the purpose of this legislation is to bring under federal jurisdiction all illegal gambling operations which involve or affect interstate commerce.thus,the igba was driven by concerns about the revenue generated by large scale gambling business rather than the games that were played.see,at senate judiciary hr gs at statement of tydings the greatest single source of revenue for organized crime is its gambling activities,which net an estimated seven to fifty billion dollars a year.
there was some discussion during the legislative debates of which games organized crime was using toward this end.various legislators noted the fact that organized crime was involved in lotteries,dice games,and illegal casinos in addition to horse racing and sporting events.cong.rec,statement of mcclellan.numbers rackets,dicristina,d at,were discussed,as was bookmaking,which many were concerned allowed national crime syndicates to finance their activities,see id.at legislative history reflects concern about money made in bookmaking.as the district court acknowledged,there is nothing in the legislative history suggesting that whether a game was predominated by chance was relevant to whether a business operating that game constituted an illegal gambling business under the igba.see dicristina,d at.
although poker was not discussed at length,the dialogue about poker that did occur suggests congress anticipated that poker would be included within the reach of the igba as it was ultimately enacted.
mikva i would like to yield further but i have more examples of overreach that would even curl the hair of the gentleman from virginia.
i do not know how many of my colleagues engage in a friendly game of poker now and then,but under th e igba definition of gambling if five or more of them engage in such a game of poker and it lasts past midnight you do have that safeguard thus continuing for a period of days,then you have been running an organized gambling business and you can get years,and the federal government can grab the pot besides 
we have a whole series of new crimes involving gambling and some of them,as i indicated,include even the poker game that goes beyond midnight.under the bill,it can be an organized gambling game and one can get up to years for having participated in that poker game.
the concern that the igba would criminalize private poker games was assuaged by comments mentioning the requirements currently set forth under b,and not by comments indicating that poker is a game of skill.
poff i suggest that the gentleman is in error when he poses his hypothetical statement.i direct his attention to page,line and of the bill.there you will find that illegal gambling means a business and has been and remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of days or has a gross revenue in excess of in any single day.the poker game which the gentleman has described does not meet that criterion.
mikva but that is not true because later on there is a presumption that it is an illegal gambling business.that language appears on page and is as follows 
if five or more persons conduct,finance,manage,supervise,direct,or own all or part of a gambling business and such business operates for or more successive days,then,for the purpose of obtaining warrants for arrests,interceptions,and other searches and seizures,probable cause that the business receives gross revenue in excess of in any single day shall be deemed to have been established.
poff if they are in the gambling business.
mikva i suppose it depends on whether you are gambling for profit or pleasure,but i happen to know a lot of people who do enjoy the profit as well as the pleasure,and i would hate to rely on the nondefinition of business to protect somebody from a zealous attorney.
thus,to the extent that poker was discussed,there was some acknowledgment that some businesses operating poker games would fall within the igba,but that the other requirements of the statute would exclude the typical friendly game of poker from the statute reach.
iv.rule of lenity 
dicristina argues that the rule of lenity requires us to construe any ambiguity in the igba in his favor.see appellee br.at.t he rule of lenity only applies if,after considering text,structure,history,and purpose,there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute.barber.at i
