the issue in this appeal from the judgment of the district court arises from efforts of the mechoopda indian tribe of chico rancheria in butte county,california,to obtain federal approval to conduct gaming operations.the indian gaming regulatory act,permits indian tribes to conduct gaming on indian lands.the act defines indian lands to mean all lands within any indian reservation and any lands title to which is held in trust by the united states for the benefit of any indian tribe id.indian gaming is not permitted on newly acquired lands that is,lands the secretary of the interior took into trust for a tribe after october,when the act went into effect.an exception to this bar allows indian gaming on lands the secretary takes into trust after the date as part of the restoration of lands for an indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition.id.b b iii.
the mechoopda tribe has been restored to federal recognition.the issue at the administrative level was whether land the tribe purchased and offered to the department of the interior to take into trust for its benefit qualified as restored lands.the act does not define restoration of lands.the interior department and the agency largely responsible for regulating indian national indian gaming that any lands located within the areas historically occupied by the tribes are properly considered to be lands taken into trust as part of the restoration of lands.grand traverse band of ottawa and chippewa indians attorney for dist.of,d.shortly after final agency action in this case,the interior department codified its view in regulations requiring,among other things,that a tribe demonstrate a significant historical connection to the land.b 
the mechoopda tribe had approximately enrolled members when this case began.most lived in or near what is now chico,california,the largest city in butte county in the portion of the state.the tribe traces its history to a rancheria in chico.in,john bidwell,a wealthy california businessman and politician,purchased a ranch and hired indians to live and work there.when bidwell died,he left the ranch to his wife.between and bidwell conveyed acres of the ranch where the indians were rancheria to a private board in trust for the indians.the united states took over as trustee of the rancheria in.acting pursuant to the california rancheria act,the government terminated the mechoopda tribe recognition in and ended the trust status of the land.see notice of termination.june.
the tribe brought a lawsuit contesting its termination.the suit ended when the government and the tribe entered into a settlement agreement.as the settlement agreement provided,the government restored the tribe to federal recognition in.see notice of reinstatement.may.the settlement agreement also forbade the tribe from reestablishing the boundaries of the rancheria.
in,the tribe purchased a parcel of land in butte county.the tribe plan was to have the government take the land in trust so that the tribe could develop and operate a casino there.the parcel is located approximately miles from the area of the former rancheria,which is in the center of the city of chico.in addition to requesting the secretary to take the parcel into trust for the tribe benefit,the tribe submitted applications to the gaming commission for review of a gaming management contract and for approval of a gaming ordinance.
the matter was initially referred to the office of the general counsel for the gaming commission to prepare an advisory legal opinion on whether gaming on the land would be is,whether the land,if taken into trust,would qualify under the restored lands exception.relying on material the tribe provided,acting deputy counsel coleman concluded that the tribe had a historical and cultural nexus to the proposed gaming site that was sufficient to show that the parcel was not merely an acquisition but a restoration of previously used lands.her conclusion rested,in part,on the fact that the proposed gaming site was within the boundaries of the mechoopda villages before the mechoopda relocated to the bidwell ranch.her memorandum also indicated that the proposed site was within land that was promised the mechoopda by an unratified treaty of.there was other evidence showing the historical and cultural significance of the land to the mechoopda.the memorandum stated that the interior department office of the solicitor concurred in her conclusion.
coleman memorandum was dated march.the secretary did not make a final decision to take the land into trust until may.in the interim,on june,the attorney for butte county wrote to the secretary to dispute coleman opinion.the county objected to coleman conclusion that the tribe had a historic connection to the gaming site.as the county saw it,the tribe that worked and lived on the bidwell ranch,and from whom the modern tribe is descended,was not the same tribe as the historic tribe that had allegedly occupied the gaming site.rather,the people residing at the ranch were a disparate group of indians from many tribes.the county urged that the only land to which the tribal members could show a common connection was on the site of the former the bidwell ranch.
to support its assertions,the county attached a report prepared by its consultant,stephen dow beckham,a professor of history at lewis clark college.the report provided a history of the bidwell ranch and those who worked and resided there.beckham cited the findings of a bureau of indian affairs employee who visited the ranch in.the bia employee concluded that the indians did not belong to any particular band,but are remnants of various small bands,originally living in butte and nearby counties.beckham report also included a detailed account of the families who resided at the ranch between and.a significant number of these individuals belonged to a tribe interchangeably referred to as michopda,mishopda,or.while this is the historic tribe discussed in coleman analysis,beckham found that many of the ranch indians were from other report lists members of the wailaki,concow,winton,yuki,pit river,and sioux tribes.why the indians of the bidwell ranch ultimately assumed the name mechoopda presumably a variant of the michopda tribe from which some of them were unclear.
the acting deputy assistant secretary for policy and economic development responded to the county in a short rejection letter.the letter,dated august,stated y ou ask that the department reject the march,determination of the national indian gaming commission nigc that the parcel proposed to be taken into trust would qualify as restored land.we are not inclined to revisit this decision now because the office of the solicitor reviewed this matter in,and concurred in the nigc determination of march.there is no indication that the interior department ever revisited this determination and actually considered the county evidence.
on february,the gaming commission approved the tribe gaming ordinance,indicating that the approval was only for gaming on indian lands.on may,the secretary published in the federal register his final decision to take the tribe land into trust the county filed an action claiming that both agency actions were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the agencies,ruling that the agencies had considered the necessary factors,and the county appealed.
the case boils down to several straightforward propositions of administrative law.we have what is known as informal agency adjudication.governing procedural rules,derived mainly from of the apa,and the due process clause,are few.even so,agency decisions in informal adjudication are subject to judicial review under of the apa.see,reliance consumer prod.safety comm n.if the agency decision is arbitrary,capricious or an abuse of discretion it must be set aside.
two legal propositions are important to the disposition of this case.
first,under e,the agency must provide an interested butte a brief statement of the grounds for denial of the party request.as this court held in tourus records,dea,the agency must explain why it decided to act as it did.the agency statement must be one of reasoning it must not be just a conclusion it must articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.at quoting henry friendly,chenery revisited reflections on reversal and remand of administrative orders,duke,and motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins.
second,an agency refusal to consider evidence bearing on the issue before it constitutes arbitrary agency action within the meaning of.see,state farm,at comcast fcc.this proposition may be deduced from case law applying the substantial evidence test,under which an agency can not ignore evidence contradicting its position.the substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.universal camera nlrb.although we are dealing with the question whether agency action is arbitrary or capricious,in their application to the requirement of factual support the substantial evidence test and the arbitrary or capricious test are one and the same.ass of data processing serv,bd.of governors of fed.reserve,accord am.radio relay league,fcc.
the interior department managed to violate the minimal procedural requirements e imposed.when butte county furnished the interior secretary office with a copy of the beckham report and gave numerous reasons why the tribe land did not constitute restored land,that issue was still pending before the secretary.the secretary final determination did not come until two years later,on march,yet the entirety of interior response to butte county was this we are not inclined to revisit this decision the opinion of the gaming commission now because the office of the solicitor reviewed this matter in,and concurred in the nigc determination of march.
this response violates e for the same reason the response in tourus records violated that provision.the response provides no basis upon which we could conclude that it was the product of reasoned decisionmaking.at.it had all the explanatory power of the reply of bartelby the scrivener to his employer i would prefer not to.which is to say,it provided no explanation.
interior response was also arbitrary.reasoned decisionmaking is not a procedural requirement.ferry,icc.it stems directly from of the apa.that much was made clear in another informal adjudication to preserve overton park volpe.interior response speaks as if the secretary had already decided the issues we are not inclined to revisit the in fact the matter remained pending.the rest of the response is senseless.so what if the solicitor had reviewed the gaming commission decision in and agreed with it the secretary had yet to decide whether he agreed,which is what counted the very point of butte county submission was that the information it submitted called into doubt the judgment of the gaming commission.to refuse to evaluate that information because the never looked at with the gaming commission is totally irrational.
all that remains is interior argument that several statements in an environmental supplied the missing reasoning and showed that the secretary in fact did take into account the county evidentiary submission.the environmental assessment came after interior had advised the county that it would not revisit the restored lands question.there is nothing to indicate that it changed its mind in fact the environmental assessment relied on the response to the county attorney.and it added that whether the tribe lands qualified as restored lands was irrelevant to the question being,whether the secretary taking the lands into trust to allow the tribe to operate a casino there would have a significant environmental impact.the only other point in the environmental assessment was that interior could not rescind the status of the tribe.this comment and the others were responsive to an august letter from a butte county administrator dealing with environmental issues.but the comment was not responsive to the arguments raised in the county attorney letter regarding restoration of the lands.
according to our dissenting colleague,the environmental assessment indicated that interior understood the county and the beckham report to be denying the tribe existence at the chico rancheria on the thesis that the modern tribe had no connection with the historical mechoopda tribe that occupied vast areas of butte county and hence had no historical connection to the historical tribe land.dissenting op.at.but the county attorney letter submitted with the beckham report clearly states that the county challenged coleman restored lands opinion and did not contest the mechoopda federal recognition.rather,it argued that the only land ever occupied by the people who ultimately were recognized as a tribe was the bidwell ranch property t he tribal members can not demonstrate any ties or connections to any other property.the thesis of the beckham report,as the dissent appears to recognize at one point,goes entirely to the restored lands issue by supporting the county argument that the tribe had no connection to any land other than its former rancheria.the later letter from the butte county administrator did,in fact,challenge the tribe status,which explains why the environmental assessment advised the county that recognition was irreversible.but that point does not speak at all to the tribe historic connection with the land in question.
our dissenting colleague provides her own analysis of the beckham report and concludes that it does not undermine the evidence the tribe submitted.we are not so sure,but that is not the point.an agency action must be upheld,if at all,on the basis articulated by the agency itself.state farm,at citing sec chenery.the secretary mentioned none of the dissent reasons for rejecting the beckham report.the secretary simply refused to give the county an audience.
for all of these reasons,we set aside the secretary final action to take the tribe lands into trust the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
so ordered.
congress determined in enacting the indian gaming regulatory act igra that indian tribes restored to federal recognition may be eligible for a restoration of lands on which gaming is permitted.b b iii see also id.at issue is whether the decisions of the secretary of the interior and the national indian gaming commission nigc granting the mechoopda tribe application for a restoration of lands and for gaming on those lands were arbitrary and capricious.a review of the administrative record indicates these decisions are reasonable and supported by substantial evidence of the tribe ample historical and cultural connections to land at issue the chico parcel.the record demonstrates that the secretary considered butte county views and its report and explained why he was not inclined to revisit the determination by the nigc and interior solicitor that the chico parcel would qualify as restored lands.the secretary rationale is the county report addressed only a narrow aspect of the tribe history and did not challenge the expert studies on which determination relied in addressing the tribe full history.the secretary rationale was elaborated in contemporaneous agency memoranda when the assistant secretary for indian affairs,who made the decision on behalf of the secretary to approve the tribe application to take the chico parcel into trust as a restoration of lands,concluded that the county sought to deprive a federally recognized tribe of rights protected by law.accordingly,because as tourus records,dea,instructs,the secretary neither violated the requirements of e nor ignored the county views or its report,and because the challenged decisions are supported by substantial evidence in the record,i would affirm the grant of summary judgment to the secretary,the nigc,and the tribe,and i respectfully dissent.
the background to the tribe application to the secretary to take the chico parcel into trust pursuant to section of the indian reorganization act ira,sets the context for the county request to the secretary on june,and for the secretary response.the applicable statutes required the secretary to determine whether the chico parcel qualified as a restoration of lands allowing gaming under section of the igra,b b iii.in the tribe case,interior office of the solicitor requested that nigc assume primary responsibility for providing a legal opinion on this question.the secretary also had to examine the environmental effects of taking the chico parcel into trust under the national environmental policy act nepa.only if the restoration of lands and environmental determinations favored granting the tribe application could the secretary act under the ira to approve the tribe application to take the chico parcel into trust for,in part,casino gaming.see tomac,taxpayers of.against casinos norton.in mak ing any decision or determination with respect to a federally recognized indian tribe,the secretary could not subclassify a tribe by denying it privileges and immunities available to other federally recognized tribes.f 
the county has long been involved with interior regarding the tribe efforts to locate a parcel of land qualifying as a restoration of lands under section of the igra.as early as,when interior was considering the restoration of lands determination,a member of the butte county board of supervisors had written to the nigc urging the secretary to take the chico parcel into trust because the tribe has historical and cultural ties to the land planned for the reservation,stating that i t was part of a large area that was to be deeded to the mechoopda under treaties signed in the,and that the tribe proposed casino on the chico parcel would allow them to reestablish a connection to the soil of their ancestors.letter from curt josiassen,member of the butte county board of supervisors july.the letter also referenced the fact that the county and the tribe had discussed the proposed gaming site in a series of meetings.articles in butte county newspapers emphasized the tribe connection to the chico parcel.see,editorial,it a gamble,but at least it a chance,the,chico,ca,chico and much of butte county is literally built on the bones of the mechoopda.
the tribe was originally federally recognized in the treaty of,in which the united states promised to the tribe land located near the ranch of general john bidwell however,the treaty was never ratified and the land was not turned over to the tribe.see anne currie,bidwell rancheria,cal.hist.soc y.as a result of a change in federal indian policy and law,the tribe federal recognition was withdrawn in and assets of its rancheria were distributed.see,june.the tribe sued and in was reinstated to its former federal status as part of a stipulated judgment between the tribe,the united states,and the city of chico in butte county,california.see notice of reinstatement to former status for the mechoopda indian tribe of the chico rancheria.may,order for entry of judgment and judgment,scotts valley band of pomo indians of the sugar bowl rancheria,et united states,no.the tribe attempt to have the secretary take a parcel of land into trust in failed under the secretary of section of the igra.however,after litigation required the secretary to adopt a broader interpretation,the tribe requested the secretary to take the chico parcel into trust in november,finished acquiring the chico parcel in december,and on march,requested the nigc to determine whether the chico parcel would qualify as a gaming site under the restoration of lands provisions of section of the igra.
the tribe historical status with respect to the chico parcel was confirmed in a comprehensive determination by the nigc in in which interior solicitor concurred.the determination concluded that the tribe had proven its historical and cultural connection to the chico parcel and that the parcel qualified as restored indian lands under igra and nigc regulations and should be taken into trust.see nigc determination at.the determination considered the factual circumstances of the tribe acquisition of the chico parcel,the location of the chico parcel about ten miles from the tribe former rancheria on the bidwell ranch,the chico rancheria,and the tribe historical and cultural nexus to it as well as the temporal relationship between the tribe restoration to federal recognition in and the tribe acquisition of the chico parcel in,concluding that all of these factors supported finding that taking the chico parcel into trust would constitute a restoration of lands to the tribe for purposes of igra section.in reaching this conclusion the determination relied on the key studies of the origins of the tribe.these included the field notes of ethnologist hart merriam,who had interviewed chico rancheria residents in,and regarding the locations of mechoopda villages the declaration of craig bates,the curator of ethnography for yosemite national had researched and published over one hundred articles and papers on native americans,sixteen of which directly related to the history and culture of the maidu indians of california,including the mechoopda tribe of chico the tribe is the sole surviving group of the northwestern valley maidu indians and has historical and cultural connections to the chico parcel and reports prepared in by ethnographer and historian brian bibby,an expert on california indian communities,describing connections among the tribe,the chico parcel,and the historical villages of the mechoopda.the determination noted that the chico parcel was within the boundaries of historical mechoopda village locations and within the boundaries of the land promised to the mechoopda in the unratified treaty of.
also part of the administrative record was the currie report,published in in the california historical society quarterly,tracing the history of the mechoopda tribe since,when general john bidwell purchased acres of land including land the mechoopda tribe occupied.see also editorial,the,the mechoopda did most of the mining work that made john bidwell rich and did much of the work on his ranch that allowed him to prosper.the determination explained that although general and bidwell had established a mechoopda indian village for their indian employees,and bidwell had deeded a rancheria in trust for the tribe,this land was lost after the tribe federal recognition was terminated in,and that the city of chico,california now occupies the site of the tribe former rancheria.further,the determination noted that the stipulated judgment stated the tribe could not attempt to reestablish the boundaries of its former rancheria.
the tribe formally applied to the secretary on march,to take the chico parcel into trust as restored lands under igra section.on april,the secretary issued notice of and sought comment on the tribe application to take the chico parcel into trust,requesting comments within thirty days from numerous california state and county officials.see.on july,the county wrote the tribe that,in view of its discussions with the tribe about mitigation measures,the county withdraws any formal concerns regarding the proposed location of the casino and the placement of the acres of land,the chico parcel into trust status.letter from paul mcintosh,chief administrative officer for butte county,to steve santos,tribal chairman,mechoopda indian tribe of chico rancheria july.
a year later,by letter of august,to the secretary,the nigc,and the solicitor office,the tribe expressed concern that the county not stall the project by delaying agreement on mitigation measures.in a second letter to the secretary,dated october,the tribe reported that after five years of discussion about the chico parcel and the tribe expenditure of over seven million dollars,the county was now calling for the consideration of other sites.
on march,the county informed the secretary that it opposed development of a casino on the chico parcel,noting environmental objections.see letter from dennis whittlesey,butte county special counsel for gaming,to gale norton,secretary of the interior.however,three months later the county shifted gears,challenging the tribe existence for the first time,and making a new request of the secretary.it is this request that underlies the county challenges to the approval of the tribe application to take the chico parcel into trust.
by letter of june,to the secretary,the board of supervisors of butte county asked the secretary to reject the legal determination made in by the nigc and the solicitor that the mechoopda tribe is a historical tribe whose chico parcel qualifies to be taken into trust as restored lands.informing the secretary that the county opposed the tribe application for restored lands,the county advised its position now was that the tribal members only homeland was the former chico rancheria at the bidwell ranch and they can not demonstrate any ties or connections to any other property.letter from dennis whittlesey,butte county special counsel for gaming,to dirk kempthorne,secretary of the interior,at june,county letter of june.the letter also stated 
butte county does not contest the mechoopda federal recognition.indeed,we acknowledge that the department of the interior has the legal right under the indian reorganization act to extend federal recognition to groups of disparate indians residing in a common place.however,the mechoopda is not a historical tribe as is documented by the beckham report.to the contrary,it was a rancheria tribe and the only land ever occupied by the people who ultimately were recognized as a tribe was the bidwell ranch property set aside for their residency by the bidwells.
county letter of june at.
the beckham report,dated january,was submitted to the secretary on june,and forwarded by the county to the nigc on july.prepared by stephen dow beckham,a history professor at lewis clark college in portland,oregon,the report addressed the bidwells history,including their efforts to protect indians and provide lands for them to live on,and the ancestry of the indians working for them who lived on the chico rancheria set aside for them by the bidwells.beckham concluded those indians were never an indian tribe with a federal relationship,county letter of june at quoting the beckham report at,and so were not a historical tribe with ties to the historical mechoopda.in contrast to the comprehensive historical analysis of the tribe by the nigc and the solicitor in,the beckham report focused on the chico rancheria and did not address whether the secretary should take the chico parcel into trust under section of the ira.the report also did not address the bates,bibby,or currie studies relied on in the determination.neither did it mention the tribe original federal recognition in.that is,beckham opined primarily that the mechoopda inclusion of people of mixed ancestry and surviving indians from other maidu villages and tribes terminated tribal existence at the chico rancheria.
the secretary responded to the county june,request by letter of august,from acting deputy assistant secretary george skibine.the secretary acknowledged the county opposition to the tribe application to take the chico parcel into trust and recognized that the county now was requesting the secretary to reject the determination that the parcel would qualify as a restoration of lands under igra section.the secretary declined to do so we are not inclined to revisit this decision now because the office of the solicitor reviewed this matter in,and concurred in the nigc determination of march.
in tourus records,this court held that an agency fulfills its obligation under e to provide a brief statement of the grounds for denying an interested party request where internal agency memoranda clarify the agency conclusory denial,id.at quoting e.the court explained that the requirement for an agency to provide a brief statement serves two purposes first,to ensure that the agency has given careful consideration to the request,and second,to give the party an opportunity to inform the agency of any errors it may have made and to facilitate judicial review.id.at.the court emphasized,however,that nothing more than a brief statement is necessary as long as the agency explains why it chose to do what it did.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in that case the court held the agency denial of an in forma pauperis request,challenged as being arbitrary and capricious,would have been insufficient,standing alone,because the conclusory declaration that the requestor affidavit of indigency was inadequately supported did not explain why the agency regarded the request as unsupported and was not,e from the statement context.id.the agency statement of denial provide d no basis upon which the court could conclude that it was the product of reasoned decisionmaking.id.however,because internal memoranda represent ing the contemporaneous explanation of the agency decision clarified the agency rationale,the court determined a remand was unnecessary and affirmed the agency denial.id.at quoting camp pitts.the same analysis applies here.
notwithstanding its brevity,the secretary letter revealed,on its face,familiarity with the substance of the beckham report and recognition that the beckham report sought to reopen the question of the tribe historical status,a matter comprehensively addressed in the determination.the secretary refuted the assertions by the county and the conclusion of the beckham that the tribe had no identity as a tribe before its federal recognition in,even on the chico pointing to the determination,which addressed the chico rancheria indians status and the broader reach of the tribe history,including its federal recognition in,supra note.the laconic denial letter also reflected the fact that the beckham report did not mention the land being considered for trust status,instead challenging the tribe existence and the ability of interior to restore any land at all to the tribe.
the rationale behind the secretary decision is,e,upon comparing the determination and the beckham report.the beckham report addressed only a portion of the tribe historical record and did not challenge,much less identify any deficiencies in,the expert studies relied upon in the determination.the report also did not refer to the tribe broader history.for example,it omitted any mention of the tribe initial recognition in,even thought it took place at the bidwell ranch,supra note,and it did not otherwise address the legal significance of that status.given the comprehensive analysis in based on undisputed expert studies of the tribe history and connection to the chico parcel,the county submission gave the secretary no reason to revisit that matter,particularly as the county request was based in interior view,as reflected in the administrative record discussed infra,on the outlawed concept of subcategories of federally recognized tribes,subcategories that were thus beyond the secretary authority to recognize.see supra note.rather,in view of the county previous efforts to delay approval of the tribe application,the secretary had little reason to conclude other than that the county latest attempt to derail approval presented no basis for revisiting the matter addressed three years earlier in the comprehensive determination by the nigc and the solicitor.
furthermore,the secretary letter does not stand as the sole explanation of the agency decisionmaking rationale.tourus records,at.the rationale for the secretary decision not to revisit the matter,and instead to rely on the comprehensive and effectively unchallenged determination by the nigc and the solicitor,was elaborated in contemporaneous documents in the administrative record that were relied upon by the assistant secretary for indian affairs who,on behalf of the secretary,made the decision to approve the tribe application.first,interior response to comments during the nepa proceeding described the county position in its august,letter,which restated the views expressed in its june,letter,as challeng ing the revised environmental assessment rea project site historical and cultural significance to the mechoopda tribe.response to comments at.this response indicated that interior understood the county and the beckham report to be denying the tribe existence at the chico rancheria on the thesis that the modern tribe had no connection with the historical mechoopda tribe that occupied vast areas of butte county and hence had no historical connection to any land.the county ju
