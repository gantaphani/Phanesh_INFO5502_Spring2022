after a series of disputes involving the licensing and financing of the new portland meadows,tnpm,a horse racing operation partially owned by vicki and darrell lee,the lees filed a section action in the district court against stephen walters,brad higbee,george rankin,richard reid,laura fine and joanne mcadam,all members of the oregon racing commission orc.the lees complaint alleged,inter alia,that a provision in the oregon statute pursuant to which they had been ordered excluded from the portland meadows track by the orc violated due process because it was unconstitutionally vague.on summary judgment,the magistrate judge agreed that the provision was invalid and,on that basis,ruled that the entire statute,oregon revised statutes section,was void for vagueness.however,at trial the lees did not prevail on any of their damages claims,and they appealed the district court judgment.in order to resolve some of these claims,it is necessary to determine the validity of the exclusion orders.
we vacate the district court ruling that section is unconstitutionally vague because,after holding one of its provisions unconstitutional,the court failed to sever that provision as required by oregon law.on appeal,it is not necessary to decide any constitutional question.the lees exclusion orders were based upon two separate grounds,one of which was a violation of another provision of the provision that has not been challenged.we uphold the exclusion orders on the basis of the unchallenged provision and therefore need not reach the issue of whether the challenged provision is constitutional 
factual and procedural history 
at all times relevant to this action,the lees,with gene ferryman,tnpm,a corporation with a perpetual lease on portland meadows,a race track in portland,oregon.
the orc is the state administrative agency responsible for regulating the horse racing industry in oregon.the agency licenses,inspects and supervises all race meets and monitors track finances.as a condition of receiving its race meet license from the orc,tnpm was required to maintain several bank accounts,including a mutuel clearing account,into which gross receipts from wagering were deposited,and a purse account,out of which purses were paid to winning horses.during the relevant time period,former oregon administrative rule required race tracks to maintain in their purse accounts sufficient funds to cover all monies due horsemen in regard to purses,stakes,rewards,claims and deposits.it is not clear from the record to what extent applicable statutes and administrative rules regulated the commingling of funds from the various accounts.
in the early,tnpm began to experience financial difficulties.in february,the owners of portland meadows won a judgment in state court against tnpm for unpaid rent.while reviewing tnpm finances in order to determine whether it could satisfy the judgment,darrell lee discovered that ferryman had for several months been funneling tnpm funds into a private account.on march,after ferryman had refused to return the money,the lees withdrew from tnpm mutuel clearing account and from its purse account.they used the withdrawn money to satisfy the state court judgment and pay overdue taxes.
the next day,having discovered the lees withdrawals from the two accounts,the orc convened an emergency meeting over which mcadam presided.the commission concluded that the lees use of the funds from the mutuel clearing and purse accounts was improper and,pursuant to section,ordered them excluded from portland meadows.section states 
the oregon racing commission may exclude from any and all race courses any person whom the commission deems detrimental to the best interest of racing or any person who willfully violates any provision of this chapter or any rule or order issued by the commission or any person who has been found guilty of violating any laws of this state,another state or the united states related to gambling or wagering or which adversely reflects on the person honesty.the commission may take such action without first providing a hearing and without being subject to either criminal or civil liability.however,if no hearing is provided,then,within days after the board action and upon demand of the aggrieved party,the commission shall grant a hearing as provided in ors chapter,except that such hearing shall take place no later than days following demand.
the statute thus provides three grounds for exclusion from racing venues the orc may exclude any person it deems detrimental to the best interest of racing,any person who willfully violates any provision of this chapter or any rule or order issued by the commission,and any person who has been found guilty of violating any laws of this state,another state or the united states related to gambling or wagering or which adversely reflects on the person honesty.the orc explained darrell lee exclusion as follows this order is based on the finding by the commission that lee conduct has been detrimental to the best interests of racing or he has willfully violated provisions of statutes relating to racing,or the rules of racing approved by the commission.thus,darrell lee was ordered excluded pursuant to the first and second grounds enumerated in the statute vicki lee exclusion order contained nearly identical language.
on march,after they tried unsuccessfully several times to retrieve their personal belongings from portland meadows,the lees petitioned for review of their exclusion orders in state court.on march,an oregon circuit court judge issued a preliminary injunction enjoining,with several conditions,the enforcement of darrell lee exclusion order.
the subsequent state court litigation between the parties resolved a number of issues but left several others,including the constitutionality of section,unresolved.no party contends that the prior litigation in state court has a preclusive effect on this court review of the constitutionality of section or the validity of the exclusion orders.
on march,the lees filed a complaint in district court alleging several section claims arising principally from their exclusion from portland meadows.in their second amended complaint,they alleged,inter alia,that section was unconstitutional on its face because the detrimental to the best interest of racing provision was impermissibly vague.the district court,after considering for summary judgment,ruled that the challenged provision rendered the entirety of section unconstitutional.on that basis,the district court found the exclusion orders invalid.four of the lees section claims subsequently went to trial.following a jury trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.the lees appealed.
at summary judgment,the lees challenged the constitutionality of oregon revised statutes section.the district court,in finding section void for vagueness,ruled that because the detrimental to the best interest of racing provision was not defined by the statute or the applicable administrative rules,it falls into the category of statutes that invite arbitrary enforcement.the district court reasoned that,although the orc may have excluded the lees on the basis of the improper withdrawal of funds from the tnpm accounts,
it also could be due to the alleged personal animosity between the orc and darrell lee.the problem is that under ors,the orc appears to have the authority to exclude darrell lee,or anyone else,because of that animosity,or because of speech,or for virtually any reason at all,as long as the orc concludes that the exclusion would be in the best interests of racing.
however,in its summary judgment order the district court ruled that section was facially unconstitutional in its entirety without considering whether the purportedly infirm detrimental to the best interest of racing provision could be severed from the remainder of the statute whether a statutory provision is severable is a question of state law.dep t of treasury fabe,d.in oregon,there is a presumption of severability 
it shall be considered that it is the legislative intent,in the enactment of any statute,that if any part of the statute is held unconstitutional,the
