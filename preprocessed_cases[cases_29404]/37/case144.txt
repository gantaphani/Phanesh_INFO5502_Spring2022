facts procedural history 
prior to the communist revolution in cuba,elvira de la vega glen and her sister,ana maria de la vega glen,were cuban citizens and residents who jointly owned beachfront property on the peninsula de hicacos in varadero,cuba.on or about january,in conjunction with the revolution,the cuban government expropriated the property.the glens allege that the expropriation was illegal.also in,the sisters fled cuba.
in,in joint venture with the cuban government,club med constructed and subsequently operated a luxury hotel on the property that the glens had owned.in,ana maria de la vega glen died and passed any interest she still had in the varadero beach property to her nephew robert glen.the glens now both citizens allege that club med reaped a profit of many millions of dollars from its wrongful occupation and use of their property from into.in,club med turned over its interest in the resort to an unidentified third party.
in the district court,the glens asserted three claims against club med.two of these,unjust enrichment and trespass,are based on florida law.the third claim was that club med violated the twea.et,by engaging in business transactions prohibited by that federal statute.the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim,holding that the glens are barred by the act of state doctrine from recovering on the state law claims and that the twea does not provide a private right of action.glen club méditerranée,d.
ii.issues on appeal contentions of the parties 
the glens appeal the dismissal of their unjust enrichment and trespass claims only.they primarily argue that the congressional enactment of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act the act,et,prevents the courts from dismissing lawsuits like theirs pursuant to the act of state doctrine,a rule of decision explained by the supreme court in kirkpatrick,environmental tectonics,int,d.the glens maintain that the act clarifies foreign policy towards cuba and makes application of the act of state doctrine to their lawsuit inappropriate.club med contends that,even after the act,the act of state doctrine bars the glens recovery.

iv.discussion 
the act of state doctrine is a rule of decision that precludes the courts of this country from inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory.banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d.the doctrine prevents any court in the united states from declaring that an official act of a foreign sovereign performed within its own territory is invalid.kirkpatrick,at.at.it requires that the acts of foreign sovereigns taken within their own jurisdictions shall be deemed valid.fogade enb revocable trust,cir quoting kirkpatrick,at.at.
the act of state doctrine is a product of judicial concern for separation of powers,a result of the judiciary recognition that it is the province of the executive and legislative branches to establish and pursue foreign policy and that judicial determinations regarding the validity of the acts of foreign sovereigns might negatively affect those policies.see kirkpatrick,at.at sabbatino,at.at.in sabbatino,the supreme court applied the act of state doctrine to foreclose judicial consideration of the validity of the cuban government expropriation of a shipment of sugar.at.at.the court held that the judicial branch will not examine the validity of a taking of property within its own territory by a foreign sovereign government.id.as a result,a counterclaim based on asserted invalidity of the expropriation failed.at.at.
to distinguish sabbatino,the glens primarily argue that,since the enactment of the act,the act of state doctrine does not prevent lawsuits like theirs from proceeding because,unlike sabbatino,these cases do not require the courts to decide the effect of official action by the cuban government.in so arguing,the glens rely on kirkpatrick,which states,act of state issues only arise when a court must is,when the outcome of the case turns effect of official action by a foreign sovereign.when that question is not in the case,neither is the act of state doctrine.at.at.
the effect of the cuban government expropriation is,however,just as relevant to the glens claims as it was to the counterclaim in sabbatino.as the district court recognized,the glens state law causes of action for trespass and unjust enrichment are predicated on their continued ownership of the varadero property the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is that the cuban government expropriated the varadero property and that plaintiffs have a right to sue club med from sic benefitting from the expropriation.glen,d at.the validity of the cuban government act of expropriation is directly at issue in this litigation.the glens maintain that the expropriation was invalid but,if it was valid,then they have been divested of their ownership of the property and can not maintain a claim for trespass or for any benefit that club med may have gained from its use of the property resolution of the expropriation effect would be necessary to a determination of whether the glens own the varadero property 
recognizing that they must own the varadero property in order to succeed on their state law claims and attempting to avoid application of the act of state doctrine,the glens rely on the act,which they argue establishes both that they continue to have an ownership interest in the property and that the act of state doctrine can not be applied to bar their recovery.we note here that the glens have not asserted a claim against club med based on the statutory cause of action created by title iii of the act.all parties agree that they are unable to do so because,as a consequence of presidential action authorized by the statute,the private right of action created therein has been suspended and is not available to litigants.see authorizing the president to suspend the effective date of the legislation if such suspension is necessary to the national interests of the united states.thus,the glens rely on the act solely to support their arguments that their state law causes of action are sustainable.
in support of their first contention,that the act establishes their ownership interest in the varadero property,the glens cite the findings section in title iii of the statute.by paraphrasing and taking language from this section out of context,the glens arrive at the conclusion that congress has established that the expropriations committed by the cuban government failed to extinguish the ownership rights of those who owned the properties prior to the takings.we disagree.
the sections of the act cited by the glens explicitly acknowledge that the cuban government,under the leadership of fidel castro,confiscated the property of millions of cuban citizens,thousands of united states nationals,and thousands more cubans who later became naturalized united states citizens.b.while the statute condemns these confiscations as wrongful,it does not proclaim them ineffective.it is the purpose of the statute to deter third party foreign investors from trafficking in the confiscated property defined as purchas ing an equity interest in,manag ing,or enter ing into joint ventures using property and ass
