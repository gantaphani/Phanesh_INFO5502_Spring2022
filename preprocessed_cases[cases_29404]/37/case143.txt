plaintiff first american kickapoo operations appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on its claim for tortious interference with contract.we affirm.
factual background 
the indian gaming regulatory act igra establishes a statutory basis for the operation and regulation of gaming by indian tribes to promot e tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments,while simultaneously shield ing tribes from organized crime and other corrupting influences and ensur ing that indian tribe s are the primary beneficiar ies of gaming operations.the igra effects these goals in part by providing for federal oversight of contracts between tribes and entities for the management of tribal gaming operations.tribes may enter into contracts for the management of these gaming operations only with the approval of the national indian gaming commission nigc chairman.a unapproved management contracts are void,and a gaming operation that violates any provision of the igra is subject to closure and fines of up to per violation.
on april,the kickapoo tribe of oklahoma entered into an operating lease agreement with first american.the operating lease provided for constructing,equipping,and operating a class ii casino on tribal land first american agreed to construct the casino and lease all the gaming equipment it required.the tribe agreed to repay,without interest,the costs of construction,although first american guaranteed a monthly payment to the tribe of which took precedence over repaying the construction loan.in return for lease of the gaming equipment,first american was to be paid forty percent of the operation net revenues.first american indicates that it spent establishing and developing the casino,which opened may.on june,the nigc notified the tribe that its gaming ordinances did not comply with the requirements of the igra.the tribe voluntarily closed the casino,and on june,passed gaming ordinances that subsequently met with nigc approval.also in june,the tribe submitted the operating lease to the nigc for an opinion as to whether the operating lease was a management contract requiring nigc approval.in a letter dated june,deputy general counsel for the nigc offered her opinion that the operating lease was a management contract.on july,the tribe business committee unanimously decided to terminate the tribe relationship with first american.on august,the tribe executed a letter of intent with multimedia games,and subsequently entered into a agreement to rent gaming equipment from multimedia.
ii.procedural history and standard of review 
the operating lease provides that any claim arising out of or related to it must be adjudicated in the tribe courts first american has brought suit against the tribe in tribal court.a.in addition,first american filed suit against multimedia in oklahoma state court,requesting injunctive relief and damages for tortious interference with contractual and business relations.multimedia removed the case to federal court,where first american motion for a preliminary injunction was denied.
in march,multimedia moved for summary judgment on first american claim of tortious interference with contract,arguing that the operating lease fell within the regulations definition of a management contract and was therefore void for lack of nigc approval.multimedia maintained that a void contract can not serve as a predicate for a claim for tortious interference with contract and that summary judgment was therefore appropriate on this claim.the district court denied the motion in may,holding that the language of the operating lease is ambiguous with respect to whether that agreement provides for management of the gaming operation by first american.order of may,at.
on the same day in june,both parties moved for summary judgment.first american urged the court to find that any provisions in the operating lease providing for management were severable,and that the remainder constituted a valid construction loan and equipment lease.multimedia moved for summary judgment on both the tortious interference with contract and tortious interference with business relations claims,but on grounds unrelated to the validity of the operating lease.the district court denied both motions on july,holding with regard to first american motion that the operation of a severability clause in the operating lease depended on the parties intentions and other disputed fact questions.neither party moved for summary judgment again.
while the district court never explicitly revised its holding that the operating lease was ambiguous,between july and september the district court and the parties appear to have experienced a change of mind on the issue.in an order following a pretrial conference,the district court stated that t he parties are in agreement that the determination as to whether the agreement is a management contract is a question of law for the court.order of,at.the district court invited the parties to submit whatever extrinsic evidence they thought relevant to the question.the court determined the operating lease to be an unapproved management contract and therefore void,leav ing the plaintiff with a claim based on the existence of a business relationship.order of,at.first american accordingly tried its remaining claim for tortious interference with business relations to a jury,which found for multimedia.
first american appeals the district court order rejecting its claim for tortious interference with contractual relations.first,it argues that the operating lease is ambiguous and on that account should have been interpreted by a jury.second,even if the language of the operating lease is unambiguous and therefore suitable for interpretation as a matter of law,first american maintains that the district court should have found the operating lease not to be a management contract.third,even if the lease is an unapproved management contract,first american insists that it can nevertheless form the basis for a suit for tortious interference with contract.finally,first american urges that we sever those portions of the contract which might make it a management contract,leaving the remainder of the contract to furnish a basis for its claim for tortious interference with contract.
the district court did not specify the legal nature of its september,order rejecting first american claim for tortious interference with contract.we conclude,however,that the court granted summary judgment.the order essentially adopts the reasoning put forward by multimedia briefs in support of its first motion for summary judgment,suggesting that the district court regarded its order of september as a grant of summary judgment.moreover,the order does not resolve any disputed questions of fact.
to be sure,we can not tell whether the september order was in the nature of a reconsideration of the district court order of may,denying multimedia first motion for summary judgment,or whether it was a sua sponte grant of summary judgment.ultimately,this does not matter,because either approach would be permissible.a court disposition of a single claim in a suit involving multiple claims is subject to reconsideration until the entry of judgment on all of the claims,absent an explicit direction for the entry of judgment on the single claim.b see also moses cone mem.hosp.mercury const,d e very order short of a final decree is subject to reopening at the discretion of the district judge.paramount pictures thompson theatres,cir t he court retains the power to alter rulings until final judgment is entered on a cause.
the district court could also have granted summary judgment sua sponte.while we do not encourage the practice of granting summary judgment sua sponte,we will not reverse absent evidence of prejudice.so long as the losing party was on notice that it had to come forward with all of its evidence,a sua sponte grant of summary judgment may be appropriate.ward utah,cir quoting celotex catrett,d.since multimedia first motion for summary judgment was argued on precisely the grounds ultimately adopted by the district court,first american was on notice to provide all of its evidence relevant to this argument.moreover,before ruling on whether the operating lease was a management same ruling that disposed of the tortious interference with contract district court invited the parties to proffer any extrinsic evidence they thought relevant to this question.order of,at.
while it would have facilitated appellate review for the district court to be more explicit about what it was doing,the district court did not commit reversible error in proceeding as it did.whatever the precise path the district court took to granting summary judgment,we review that grant de novo,applying the same legal standard employed by the district court.simms ex rel dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.analysis 
ambiguity and extrinsic evidence 
first american first complains that the district court erred in construing an ambiguous contract as a matter of law.the district court reception of extrinsic evidence,in first american estimation,confirms the court unchanged assessment of the operating lease as ambiguous,violates the oklahoma law of contracts,and requires reversal.although the district court admission of extrinsic evidence may have been error,we do not agree that the district court used the evidence to construe an ambiguous contract,or that any error in admitting the evidence warrants reversal.
first american emphasizes that the district court never recanted its early determination that the operating lease is ambiguous.aplt.br.at.but the court september orders amply demonstrate that the district court did in fact revise its earlier finding.first,the parties and the court were in apparent agreement that the construction of the contract was a matter of law,an agreement inconsistent with a continuing belief that the operating lease is ambiguous.second,while extrinsic evidence is often received to resolve contractual ambiguities,the district court september orders explain that the evidence was intended to provide context for the agreement,not to clarify any ambiguities.in admitting extrinsic evidence the court was not so much concerned about whether or not any particular language in the agreement is ambiguous as it was about the overall context in which the agreement was entered into and the business purposes which animated the parties to the contract in entering into the contract.order of,at.in its september order,the district court put the extrinsic evidence submitted to the use anticipated in the earlier order the court conclusion that the operating lease is a management contract is based on the language of the agreement,and the extrinsic evidence shows that this conclusion is entirely consonant with the context in which the agreement was negotiated and executed and the business purposes of the parties to the agreement.order of,at.the admission of extrinsic evidence thus did not signal an ongoing assessment of the contract as ambiguous.
but even if the district court did revise its earlier finding of ambiguity,first american argues that the district court nevertheless erred in admitting extrinsic evidence to construe an unambiguous contract.the district court september order distinguishes between the use of extrinsic evidence to clarify an ambiguous contract and the use of extrinsic evidence to illuminate the context in which an unambiguous contract was executed.there is considerable support for the district court position,some of it from the oklahoma courts and this court.see amoco production lindley,the contract can be explained through the circumstances at the time of contracting and subsequently taking into consideration the subject matter thereof.gibbs trinity universal ins,in order to ascertain the intent of the parties to a contract,it is sometimes necessary,and always proper,to consider the situation of the parties and the legal principles which they are presumed to know and have in mind.see also first nat.bank in dallas rozelle,cir t he surrounding circumstances and the relationship of the parties should be taken into consideration c onstruing the contract in the light of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at the time of its execution does not violate the parol evidence rule,even though the writing is not deemed ambiguous.internal citations omitted applying oklahoma law williston on contracts ed corbin on contracts ed restatement second contracts cmt.b.
first american insists,however,that the current state of oklahoma contract law precludes the use of extrinsic evidence to interpret unambiguous contracts.see pitco production chaparral energy,to decide whether a contract is ambiguous we look to the language of the entire agreement if a contract is complete in itself,and when viewed as a totality,is unambiguous,its language is the only legitimate evidence of what the parties intended.that intention can not be divined from extrinsic evidence but must be gathered from a examination of the instrument.footnotes omitted gamble,simmons,cir if the contract is ambiguous we may resort to extrinsic evidence to construe the agreement.however,if the contract is unambiguous its language is the only legitimate evidence of what the parties intended internal citation omitted.
when sitting in diversity jurisdiction,this court applies the most recent version of the law articulated by the state highest court.vitkus beatrice,cir.the current state of the oklahoma law of contracts appears to be that unambiguous contracts may be construed only in light of the language contained within the contracts four corners.we need not resolve this question of state law,however,because an error in the admission of evidence is harmful only if the substantial rights of a party are affected.because we agree with the district court ultimate determination that the contract is unambiguously a management contract,the district court error in admitting extrinsic evidence was harmless.acres,cir holding that the admission of a letter written six months after the contract was executed was not prejudicial since the court judgment is sustained by evidence independent of the letter.
management contracts 
first american next argues that the district court erred in holding that the operating lease is a management contract,and thus subject to nigc approval.the district court found the operating lease to be much more than a vendor agreement to provide gaming equipment.order of,at.in so holding,the district court referred to the nigc deputy general counsel opinion letter and multimedia march,brief,both of which singled out for censure numerous provisions in the operating lease.according to the district court,t he provision of the totality of the expertise and services which the operating lease obligates first american to provide would clearly amount to management of at least part of indeed,major portions of the gaming operation.id.
the regulations promulgated under the igra define a management contract as any contract,subcontract,or collateral agreement between an indian tribe and a contractor if such contract or agreement provides for the management of all or part of a gaming operation.while neither the statute nor the regulations define management,the regulations do define a primary management official as any person who has authority t o set up working policy for the gaming operation.
the operating lease affords first american considerable opportunity to set up working policy for the tribe gaming operation.the operating lease obliges first american to develop employment procedures 
first american shall have the responsibility in the form of technical assistance to formulate procedures approved by the business committee,which provide for employment,direction,control,and discharging of all personnel performing services in and on the properties in connection with the maintenance,operation,and management of the gaming operation said approval shall be accomplished within ten working days and in the absence of action shall be deemed approved.
operating lease,article h b.the operating lease assigns the responsibility for formulating procedures for managing employees to first american,not to the tribe,and there is no provision in the operating lease for the tribe to formulate those procedures itself should it disapprove of first american procedures.moreover,the language of the article assumes that the tribe business committee will approve first american proposed rules,and it provides for approval by default if the tribe does not act quickly to register any dissatisfaction with them.
other provisions require first american to provide additional management services.first american is obliged to provide supervisors who supervise the skill game center facilities in the compliance with the terms of this agreement.a.the tribe is given thirty days to review and approve a plan of operation of the facilities,a plan presumably prepared by first american.id.first american will provide personnel who will supervise,train,and instruct the tribe employees for the first three months after the opening of the operation.h b.
it is not only the definition of management extrapolated from the regulations definition of primary management official that suggests the operating lease is a management contract.the statute and regulations also list responsibilities and benefits a contract must allocate between tribe and management contractor if it is to be approved by the nigc.these requirements include limits on the term of a management contract and the percentage of a gaming operation income the management contractor may receive as a fee,provision for a guaranteed minimum monthly payment to the tribe,and the assignment of a variety of functions to one party or the other.there is no requirement that each of the enumerated functions be performed by the management contractor,only that the responsibilities of each of the parties for each identifiable function be enumerated.b.
the operating lease contains a number of features the statute and regulations require of management contracts.the operating lease provides that first american will receive as an equipment lease fee forty percent of monthly net game revenues from the gaming operation.b a.forty percent of net revenues is the maximum percentage permitted by the statute a coincidence that suggests the operating lease was drafted with a view to compliance with this restriction.see c i.that suggestion is reinforced by the fact that the length of the operating lease is five years,the maximum term permitted by the statute.b b h the operating lease also satisfies the statute requirement that the tribe be guaranteed a minimum payment that has preference over the retirement of development and construction costs.b f.the operating lease guarantees the tribe a monthly payment of from first american,which takes precedence over the reimbursements of development and construction costs advanced by first american.b c.the operating lease also sets a ceiling for the amount first american will spend on development and improvements,and a corresponding limit on the amount it can recover from the tribe,as required by the statute.b b g.
the district court determination that the operating lease is unambiguously a management contract is supported by an nigc bulletin discussing in general terms the distinction between management contracts and consulting agreements and by an informal opinion letter authored by the nigc deputy general counsel identifying the operating lease as a management contract.the informal pronouncements of an agency,which are not subject to agency procedures,do not warrant chevron deference.see utah wilderness alliance dabney,cir.rather than requiring our deference,such materials may be accepted by a court only as they have power to persuade.skidmore swift.while we do not defer to the opinions expressed in the opinion letter and bulletin,we do observe that the nigc apparent position coincides with our holding in this case.
bulletin defines management broadly to include planning,organizing,directing,coordinating,and controlling all or part of a gaming operation.nigc bulletin at.the bulletin singles out seven management activities as especially probative of the question whether an agreement is a management contract.id.at.an agreement need not include all seven activities to be a management contract the presence of all or part of these activities in a contract with a tribe strongly suggests that the contract or agreement is a management contract requiring nigc approval.id.at.the operating lease contains five of the seven provisions the bulletin identifies as highly suggestive of a management agreement provision for accounting procedures,payment of a minimum guaranteed amount to the tribe,construction financed by a party,a contract that establishes an ongoing relationship between a tribe and party,and compensation based on a percentage fee.
this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the operating lease does not much resemble a consulting agreement,which bulletin opposes to management contracts.a contract that identifies a finite task,specifies a date for its completion,and provides recompense based on an hourly or daily rate or fixed fee may very well be determined to be a consulting agreement rather than a management contract.bulletin at.
the opinion letter authored by the nigc deputy general counsel also identifies the operating lease as a management contract.the opinion letter singles out provisions in the operating lease permitting first american to develop procedures,supervise completion of construction and improvements,and train and supervise employees for the first three months of operation.the opinion letter also notes that a five year term is typical of management contracts,and that reimbursement based on a percentage fee gives first american a strong incentive to manage,so as to maximize its own return.opinion letter at.while the bulletin and the opinion letter do not compel our deference,they do offer confirmation of our conclusion that the operating lease is indeed a management contract.
despite the close correspondence between the operating lease and the requirements of the regulations,first american insists that the operating lease is not a management contract because neither party intended it to be a management contract,because it was not performed as a management contract,and because it confers no rights to manage,only opportunities to do so at the tribe request.it is questionable whether oklahoma law permits the use of extrinsic evidence in construing unambiguous contracts,and even if it did,the evidence as to the parties intentions and the manner in which the contract was performed does little to advance its position.
first american last argument,however,that a contract is only a management contract if it confers rights rather than opportunities to manage,would be significant if it accurately stated the law.but this argument is problematic for several reasons,not least of which is the fact that neither the statute nor the regulations contain a definition of manager or management that would suggest that management is only management when the manager decisions are not subject to tribal oversight.nor does the ordinary definition of management suggest that a manager is not a manager if an owner,board,or other manager is capable of overriding particular management decisions.bulletin agrees that t he exercise of ultimate authority by the tribal council or the board of directors does not mean that an entity or individual reporting to such a body is not managing all or part of the operation.bulletin at.
first american cites a number of cases to support its argument,but none of them is particularly supportive.some of the cases cited contain no analysis of what makes an agreement a management contract because the agreement involved was acknowledged by the parties and the court to be a management contract.see world touch gaming,massena,d first am.casino pequot nation,d united states ex rel.mosay buffalo,wl.others contain no relevant analysis because they identified the agreement as a consulting agreement.see,harrah entm t,wl.june,calumet gaming,kickapoo tribe of kansas.one of first american cases identifies as a de facto management contract three cont
