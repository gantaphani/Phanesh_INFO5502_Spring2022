cias,formerly currency identification analysis systems filed a patent infringement suit against alliance gaming corporation and its subsidiary bally gaming,collectively alliance.the patent in suit is united states patent the patent,entitled information transfer and use,particularly with respect to counterfeit detection.both cias and alliance produce systems for the detection of counterfeit usage.the alliance detection systems for tickets used in casino slot machines are known as the slot data system sds and slot management system sms.cias charged that these systems infringe the patent,literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.alliance moved for summary judgment of,on the ground that on the correct claim construction the alliance systems do not infringe any claim of the patent.the district court granted alliance motion,construing the relevant terms of the claims in light of the accused systems.the court held that this mooted alliance counterclaim of unenforceability,and entered final judgment dismissing the suit in its entirety 
we conclude that although the district court erred in its construction of the term comprised of,that error did not affect the construction of the substantive terms that support the judgment of.that judgment is affirmed.
discussion 
the grant of a motion for summary judgment requires that there is no reasonable view of the material facts,taking cognizance of the evidentiary standards and burdens,whereby a reasonable jury could find for the.anderson liberty lobby,d celotex catrett,d.the district court claim construction receives plenary review,cybor fas,as does the summary judgment based thereon.
the claims of the patent establish and limit the patentee right to exclude,by describing the outer boundaries of the invention,hilton davis chem,d.the patent describes and claims a system for detecting counterfeit objects such as gambling chips,labels,currency,commercial paper,and other objects.the system is a process whereby each authentic object is assigned coded identification information,such as by a,that is recorded on the object and also stored in a facility then,upon presentation of the object for authentication,the computerized system compares the object coded information with the stored information and determines whether the object is authentic or counterfeit.
the accused alliance systems are directed to detection of counterfeit betting tickets,as are used in tito slot machines.alliance argues that it is not new to detect counterfeit objects by comparing their markings,and that patentability of the cias invention turned on the nature of the detection system,that is,the information by which authenticity is determined.alliance states that the principal difference between its system and that of the patent is that alliance uses a secret algorithm,which alliance asserts was excluded from the claims during examination and reexamination,in view of prior art.
claim is the broadest claim of the patent,with emphases added to the terms whose construction by the district court is challenged by cias on this appeal.with the exception of these terms,it was established or conceded that the claims read on the alliance systems 
a counterfeit detection system for identifying a counterfeit object from a set of similar authentic objects,each object in said set having unique authorized information associated therewith comprised of code elements coded according to a detectable series,the system comprising 
means at a first facility for storing said authorized information 
means at a plurality of facilities other than said first facility for code elements from a similar object and providing information related to the code elements 
means coupled to receive said information related to code elements from said object for at least temporarily storing that information and 
means at said first facility for detecting counterfeits coupled to said storing means and to said means for temporarily storing,said detecting means including a computer programmed to detect a counterfeit from information in said storing means at said first facility and from information received by said means for temporarily storing when information related to code elements machine read from a similar object is different from said authorized information and 
means for detecting when information relating to said code elements read from a similar object is the same as information previously read from a similar object,whereby a counterfeit may be detected.
claim was also at issue 
a counterfeit detection system for identifying a counterfeit object from a set of similar objects,each object in said set having unique randomly selected authorized information associated therewith comprised of code elements,the system comprising as in claim.
the district court had determined that the resolution of alliance motion for summary judgment required construction of several claim terms,unique authorized information,comprised of,code elements,detectable series,and randomly selected.cias appeals only the construction of unique authorized information,comprised of,and randomly selected.
patent claims are construed as they would be understood by persons experienced in the field of the invention,on review of the patentee description of the invention in the specification and the proceedings in the patent and trademark office.see generally phillips awh,en banc claims are construed in light of the specification and the prosecution history.
comprised of 
the district court found that the meaning of comprised of has not been clearly resolved in precedent,and therefore the court held that the ordinary and customary meaning should be used.the court ruled that comprised of does not have the same meaning as comprising,which also appears in claim,and that comprised of should be construed as a term that excludes the presence of all elements beyond those presented in the comprised of clause.thus the court defined comprised of as a limiting description of composition,reasoning that t his construction preserves the distinction between comprised of and comprising,the latter of which in fact is a patent term of art when used in a transitional phrase 
we conclude that this ruling is not correct.although comprised of is not used as regularly as comprising,and comprised of is sometimes used other than as a transition phrase,nonetheless it partakes of recognition as an term.see generally chisum on patents b,at claims usually are structured with a preamble,a transition phrase,and the elements or steps that are necessary to the right to exclude.the usual and generally consistent meaning of comprised of,when it is used as a transition phrase,is,like comprising,that the ensuing elements or steps are not limiting.the conventional usage of comprising generally also applies to comprised of.
alliance argues that several judicial decisions have used comprised of to mean consists of.however,these rare usages do not remove from comprised of its conventional meaning when used as a transition term.the only patent case that illustrates this casual usage appears to be glaxo grp.apotex,where the invention was a highly pure amorphous form of ca cefuroxime,and the opinion described the accused product as an amorphous comprised of ca,sorbitol,and zinc chloride by mass.this usage of comprised of was not as a claim transition term,but was the court description of the defendant product there was no issue of whether comprised of was a limiting term in patent claim style.similarly,in aro convertible top replacement,d the court stated the decisions of this court require the conclusion that reconstruction of a patented entity,comprised of unpatented elements,is limited to such a true reconstruction of the entity this linguistic usage is not concerned with claim drafting and,if anything,it is and.
the other cases to which alliance directs us are not patent cases,and the usage is simply as descriptive text.an example is admiral fin.united states,where the court wrote that admiral seek s total restitution in the amount of,comprised of,representing capital contributions to haven,and,representing the amount that admiral claims it saved the g
