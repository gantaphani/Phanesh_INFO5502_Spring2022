background 
a.the igra and the tribes gaming compact with idaho 
the indian gaming regulatory act igra provides a comprehensive framework for regulating gaming on indian land.see.the igra divides tribal gaming into three classes i,ii and iii.the parties agree that operation of the tribal video gaming machines at issue in this case constitutes class iii gaming.class iii gaming may be conducted on indian lands if it is authorized by the tribe seeking to conduct the gaming located in a state which does not bar such gaming and conducted in conformance with a compact entered into by the indian tribe and the state d.
in,the tribes and idaho entered into a gaming compact.see,approval of the compact by the assistant secretary of the interior for indian affairs.the parties intended the compact to govern the licensing,regulation and operation of class iii gaming conducted by the tribes on indian lands located within idaho.compact k.the compact authorizes the tribes to conduct any class iii gaming activity that the state of idaho permits for any purpose by any person,organization,or entity,as the phrase is interpreted in the igra.compact a.remarkably,the compact did not specify a limit on the numbers of gaming machines,nor did it specify a term of the compact duration.
when the compact was negotiated,the tribes and state could not agree on what types of class iii games idaho allowed others to conduct.idaho position was that the electronic gaming currently conducted by the tribes in idaho is an imitation of casino games and prohibited under idaho and federal law.the tribes position was that idaho allowed all class iii gaming except sports betting.
unable to compromise on the scope of permissible class iii gaming,the parties agreed to seek a declaratory judgment to determine which class iii games the compact authorized.the tribes and state each filed suit in the district court seeking declaratory relief.the court consolidated the cases into the present action.
proposition one 
while this case was pending in the district court,the voters of idaho adopted an initiative called proposition one that authorized indian tribes to conduct gaming using tribal video gaming machines.section two of proposition one stated that the indian tribes suffer from disproportionate unemployment and poverty and that recently tribes have proceeded in good faith to make major investments in indian gaming facilities,and that those facilities have finally enabled the tribes to reduce unemployment and welfare and improve living conditions on their reservations.proposition one informed voters about the disagreement between the tribes and idaho regarding video gaming machines the voters approved proposition one on november.
proposition one added two sections to the idaho code,and.section allows indian tribes to conduct gaming using tribal video gaming machines pursuant to gaming compacts which specifically permit their use.idaho code.section authorizes tribes to amend their gaming compacts to permit the use of tribal video gaming machines.it also provides that the gaming machines authorized by such an amendment are limited to the number currently operated by the affected tribe plus,and that no annual increase in numbers may exceed of the number of gaming machines possessed on january.idaho code b.in addition,the statute provided that tribes adopting the prescribed amendments agreed to contribute of the annual net gaming income to local educational programs and schools.idaho code c.
shortly after proposition one became law,the coeur,kootenai,and nez perce tribes employed the amendment procedure in idaho code section to amend their compacts with idaho by incorporating the terms of.the amendments granted them the right to operate tribal video gaming machines,subject to the statute limitations of numbers and requirements of school payments.
district court ruling 
the voters approval of proposition one narrowed the dispute before the district court by clarifying idaho public policy regarding tribal video gaming machines.the remaining issue before the district court was whether the existing compact between the tribes and idaho must be renegotiated before the tribes could operate tribal video gaming machines.the court held that the compact does not require the tribe s and the state of idaho to enter into renegotiations before the tribe s are authorized to conduct gaming using tribal video gaming machines.further,the court ordered the parties to adopt a brief written amendment clarifying that the tribe is authorized to operate tribal video gaming machines as that term is defined in idaho code.the court found t hat the machines used by the tribes in their gaming operation in may are tribal video gaming machines 
discussion 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.sierra club babbitt,cir.the compact states that it is to be construed in accordance with the laws of the united states.compact.we apply general principles of contract interpretation to construe a contract governed by federal law.see kennewick irrigation dist.united states,cir.the parties here rely on idaho contract law,however,and we accept that practice because we discern,and the parties note,no difference between idaho and federal contract law.
authorization of tribal video gaming machines 
the compact has two,somewhat differing provisions addressing the permissible scope of the tribes class iii gaming.
section,authorized class iii gaming,provides 
t he tribes may operate in its gaming facilities located on indian lands,any gaming activity that the state of idaho permits for any purposes by any per son,organization,or entity,as the phrase is interpreted in the igra.the tribes may not operate any other form of class iii gaming activity.
section.d,games conducted by other tribes,states 
in the event any other indian tribe is permitted by compact or final court decision to conduct any class iii games in idaho in addition to those games permitted by this compact,this compact shall be amended to permit the tribes to conduct those same additional games 
the plain language of section authorizes the tribes to operate video gaming machines because idaho permits three other tribes to operate tribal video gaming machines in the state.an indian tribe is an entity under the igra.artichoke joe cal.grand casino norton,cir interpreting d b.the coeur,kootenai,and the nez perce tribes all legally operate tribal video gaming machines in idaho pursuant to idaho code section.if section of the compact stood alone,authorization of the tribes to conduct video gaming would appear to be automatic,because section does not mention any requirement of an amendment of the compact.
the state relies,however,on section.d,which does contemplate an amendment to the compact to permit gaming conducted by other tribes.we agree in part with the state section.d is applicable here.section.d is more specific in its application to gaming by other tribes than is section specific terms of a contract govern inconsistent,more general terms.cal.gas city of santa ana,cir per curiam see also restatement second of contracts.we agree with the district court,therefore,that an amendment of the tribes compact is required for the tribes to be able to operate their video gaming machines as a result of the permitted operation of such games by other tribes in idaho.
we reject,however,the state contention that section.d requires renegotiation of the tribes compact in order to arrive at the necessary amendment.section.d provides that,when any other tribe is permitted by compact to conduct class iii games not permitted by the tribes compact,the compact shall be amended to pe
