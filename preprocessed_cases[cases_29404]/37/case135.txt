the appellees petition for rehearing is granted.the published opinion filed october,is vacated and a revised opinion is attached.
this appeal represents another chapter in the dispute over the secretary of the interior decision to take a tract of land in downtown kansas city,kansas the shriner tract,or simply the tract,into trust for the benefit of the wyandotte tribe of oklahoma,which intends to operate a casino on the property.the governor of kansas,along with three other indian tribes,attempted to block the trust acquisition by filing suit in federal court,claiming that the secretary erroneously determined that she was statutorily bound to take the tract into trust.sac fox nation babbitt,d.while that case was pending in the district court,however,the wyandotte purchased the tract and the secretary took it into trust.we eventually remanded the case to the secretary for reconsideration of her decision to take the tract into trust,thus officially ending the sac fox nation case.
on reconsideration after our remand,the secretary reaffirmed her decision to take the shriner tract into trust for the wyandotte.the sac fox nation joined by an additional indian again challenged this determination with a new complaint in federal court,thereby initiating the instant case.the district court affirmed the trust status of the tract,a judgment from which the plaintiffs now appeal.
while sac fox nation and the present case present issues related to a single trust acquisition of the shriner are distinct in one highly significant respect at the time the plaintiffs filed their complaint in the latter case,the shriner tract was already held by the united states in trust for the wyandotte.as a result,the waiver of sovereign immunity provided by congress in the quiet title act,no longer applied to any action challenging the united states title to the tract.without an applicable waiver of sovereign immunity at the time the complaint was filed,the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to the secretary decision.thus,we are constrained to vacate the district court judgment and order this case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
the history of how the wyandotte used congressionally designated funds to purchase the shriner tract is long and complex,and our previous opinions have described this history in detail.see wyandotte nation sebelius,cir sac fox nation norton,cir,cert.denied,d.we therefore here provide only a brief factual summary before narrowing our focus to the procedural history necessary to our resolution of this appeal.
factual background 
over the last two hundred years,the wyandotte ceded much of its traditional territory to the united states.sac fox nation,at.in,congress enacted legislation providing for payments to the wyandotte as compensation for certain of these land transfers.id.at.public law,stat.expressly provides for distribution of these allocated funds among members of the wyandotte tribe,requiring that eighty percent of the allocated funds be distributed to tribal members as per capita payments,a.the remaining twenty percent is required to be used and distributed in accordance with the following general plan laid out in b 
b a sum of of such funds shall be used for the purchase of real property which shall be held in trust by the secretary for the benefit of such tribe.
the amount of such funds in excess of shall be held in trust by the tribal business committee of such tribe for the benefit of such tribe.
any interest or investment income accruing on the funds described in paragraph may be used by the tribal business committee of such tribe for any of the following purposes 
a education of the members of such tribe including or scholarships.
b medical or health needs of the members of such tribe including prosthetics.
c economic development for the benefit of such tribe.
d land purchases for the use and benefit of such tribe.
e investments for the benefit of such tribe.
f tribal cemetery maintenance.
g tribal building maintenance.
h tribal administration.
b.in addition,c requires the secretary to enforce the statute but does not require her approval for the wyandotte selection of property to be placed in trust or its management of the excess funds.id.at c.
the wyandotte tribe attempts to utilize the funds allocated in b form the factual basis for this case.although the wyandotte received these funds in,the tribe made no immediate effort to acquire trust property pursuant to b instead,the funds were invested and eventually commingled with other tribal monies in investment accounts.in april,however,the wyandotte authorized the use of a portion of the pl set aside funds for the purchase of property in downtown kansas city,kansas,with the intention that this property would be held in trust by the united states and would be used for gaming purposes by the tribe.pursuant to this plan,in june,nations company contracted by the wyandotte to develop the tribe gaming into a contract to purchase the shriner tract for.in anticipation of the purchase,the wyandotte also filed a land acquisition application with the department of the interior in january,thus initiating the secretary review process prior to taking the tract into trust.
this process hit a snag when a department of interior appraisal in february concluded that the shriner tract had a market value of only subsequently,in late june,nations realty entered into a new contract to purchase the shriner tract for a revised purchase price of.at approximately the same time,nations realty also entered into a separate and agreement with the seller of the shriner tract,obligating nations realty to pay in return for the seller agreement not to operate a gaming facility within one mile of the shriner tract.prior to closing,nations realty assigned its interest in the real estate purchase contract to the wyandotte there is no evidence,however,that the wyandotte received any assignment of,or were directly involved in,the and nondisclosure agreement.
on june,the secretary published notice of her decision,pursuant to her duty under b of,to acquire title in the name of the united states in trust for the wyandotte tribe of oklahoma for the shriner tract no sooner than days after the date of this notice.june.
b.the sac fox nation case 
on july,exactly thirty days after the secretary published notice of her decision,the governor of kansas and three indian sac and fox nation of missouri,the iowa tribe of kansas and nebraska,and the prairie band of potawatomi suit in the united states district court for the district of kansas challenging the secretary decision to take the shriner tract into trust for the wyandotte.the suit claimed that b created no mandatory duty for the secretary to place the shriner tract in trust,and that the secretary had failed to determine whether the wyandotte had actually used b funds to purchase the tract in any case sac fox nation,at.
in order to prevent the secretary from taking the shriner tract into trust prior to resolution of these claims,the sac fox nation plaintiffs requested,and the district court granted,a temporary restraining order tro forbidding the secretary from consummating the trust acquisition.id.at.the wyandotte,however,immediately filed an interlocutory appeal with this court,arguing that the real estate contract for the purchase of the shriner tract was due to expire and,if the tro was not dissolved,the opportunity for the tract to be placed in trust would be lost.id.in order to preserve the status quo,we granted the wyandotte request and dissolved the tro 
subject to the conditions which constitute the law of this case,that the respective rights of the parties to obtain judicial review of all issues which have been raised in the complaint below shall be preserved,including standing of all parties,jurisdiction,compliance by the secretary with all requirements of law,and the ultimate question of whether gaming shall be permitted on the subject land.
id.quotations omitted.
with the tro dissolved,the wyandotte proceeded with their purchase of the tract on july,and the secretary took the tract into trust for the benefit of the tribe.id.the district court denied the plaintiffs subsequent motions challenging the trust acquisition,and eventually dismissed the case on procedural grounds.id.
on appeal from this judgment,we reversed the district court procedural dismissal.reaching the merits of the plaintiffs claims,we agreed with the secretary that b created a nondiscretionary duty to take any land purchased with the funds designated in that section into trust for the wyandotte.id.at.however,we found that the secretary factual determination that the wyandotte used only b funds for the shriner tract purchase lacked sufficient record support id.at.we therefore remanded the case to the district court,with instructions to remand to the secretary for further consideration of the question of whether b funds were used for the acquisition of the shriner tract.id.at.
the district court issued a judgment remanding the case to the secretary on august.importantly,the district court clarified in a later order that the sac fox nation case was officially closed after the remand,thus requiring any challenges to the secretary decisions on remand to be brought in a new and separate action 
consistent with the mandate of the tenth circuit,this court entered a final judgment in these sac fox nation cases on august.as directed by the tenth circuit,the judgment in part remanded these cases to the secretary of the interior for further consideration of the question of whether.funds were used for the acquisition of a tract of land called the shriner tract.the court did not maintain jurisdiction over these cases after the judgment and order of remand.the court believes any appeal of the secretary determination following the remand must be considered a new and separate action,which the instant motion indicates has been filed.
therefore,the court shall deny plaintiffs motion to supplement the record and arrange a scheduling conference because the cases are closed,and the challenge plaintiffs seek to make should be made in a new and separate action.
remand to the secretary and the genesis of the instant case 
on remand,the secretary reconsidered her decision and again concluded that the wyandotte had used only b funds to purchase the shriner tract.in the published notice of this determination,the secretary described the history of the wyandotte investment of the b funds and concluded,based primarily on the analysis of a public accounting firm,that the value of those funds,including appreciation,was at the time of the shriner tract than enough to cover the purchase price.
the former sac fox nation plaintiffs requested reconsideration of this determination,which the secretary granted.in june,after receiving additional briefing from the parties,the secretary issued a written opinion confirming her prior determination that the wyandotte had purchased the shriner tract using only b funds,thereby triggering a nondiscretionary duty to take the tract into trust.in particular,the secretary expressly determined that the language of b,although ambiguous,should be read so as to permit the use of interest or investment income accrued on the original allocated in that section,thus allowing the wyandotte to use up to for purchase of the shriner tract.the secretary also concluded that the purchase price actually paid for the tract was,as alleged by the sac fox nation that the wyandotte remaining b funds were used to satisfy this purchase price.
plaintiffs tried to file their challenge in the original sac fox nation case,but were required by the district court to file under a new case number.accordingly,in july,of the former sac fox nation plaintiffs plus an additional indian tribe,the kickapoo tribe of indians of the kickapoo reservation in the instant complaint in federal court,specifically challenging the secretary march and june decisions.the complaint characterized the secretary determination that the shriner tract was purchased with b funds as arbitrary,capricious,and unsupported by substantial evidence,and argued that the secretary therefore erred by justifying her decision to take the tract into trust as required by b.as relief,plaintiffs requested that the district court enter a declaratory judgment voiding the secretary decision and order the secretary to revoke the trust status of the tract and rescind all other trust actions and applications and activities concerning the same.
plaintiffs also sought to supplement the administrative record with additional evidence they claimed undercut the secretary determination that the wyandotte paid for the tract with only b funds,including a check written on an account of nations realty parent company and allegedly used as earnest money for the purchase.the district court granted this request,once again remanding the case to the secretary for the limited purpose of additional investigation or explanation of the supplemental evidence proffered by plaintiffs and ordering the secretary to tender her explanation to the court within days.
in december,pursuant to the district court order,the secretary issued another opinion reiterating that only b funds and the investment income therefrom were used to purchase the shriner tract.the secretary credited the wyandotte assertion that the earnest money check was applied to closing costs and other costs over and above the purchase price of the tract,and therefore concluded that materials presented by plaintiffs in this second remand refute neither the public accounting firm findings nor the reasoning behind the secretary conclusion that wyandotte acted within the law in funding the shriner tract purchase.
on may,the district court affirmed the secretary decision to take the shriner tract into trust.the court concluded that because b is ambiguous as to whether the wyandotte could utilize the interest and investment income from that section allocation of funds towards the purchase of trust property,the secretary interpretation of section b is entitled to deference and should be affirmed under chevron,natural resources defense council,d the secretary determination that the earnest money check was not applied to the purchase price of the shriner tract was supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record the secretary determination that only b funds were used for the purchase,based on a public accounting firm analysis of the wyandotte accounts and a department of interior financial analyst review of that analysis,also found sufficient support in the record and the secretary determination that the actual purchase price of the shriner tract was,not,was similarly supported by the record.thus,the court denied plaintiffs claims for relief and upheld both the secretary legal interpretation of b and her substantive findings that only b funds were used to purchase the shriner tract.
plaintiffs now appeal the district court order affirming the secretary decision.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs dispute all of the district court conclusions and ask this court to invalidate the secretary decision as arbitrary and capricious,to declare void the trust determination of the shriner tract,and alternatively,to remand the case,again,to the secretary for a full and fair review of the question of whether only funds awarded by were used to purchase the tract.plaintiffs appeal thus raises the same central question that has animated their litigation since whether the wyandotte used funds designated by b to purchase the shriner tract,so as to trigger a nondiscretionary duty on the part of the secretary to take the tract into trust.
before we may reach the various facets of this question,however,we are faced with a jurisdictional argument raised by the secretary for the first time on appeal.the secretary now argues that sovereign immunity bars the present suit because,at the time the instant complaint was filed,the shriner tract was already held in trust by the united states for the wyandotte,and the quiet title act,retain s the united states immunity from suit by third parties challenging the united states title to land held in trust for indians.united states mottaz,d.
normally,of course,absent extraordinary circumstances,we do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal.hill.gas serv,cir quotation omitted.however,claims of sovereign immunity implicate our jurisdiction and therefore present an exception to the general rule against considering new arguments on appeal.united states richman,cir.thus,because we have a duty to ascertain whether we have jurisdiction prior to reaching the merits of an appeal,ellenberg military,cir,we begin by addressing the secretary contention that plaintiffs suit is barred by sovereign immunity.our review of questions of sovereign immunity is de novo.shivwits band of paiute indians utah,cir.
a.the quiet title act and sovereign immunity generally 
the concept of sovereign immunity means that the united states can not be sued without its consent.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,jacks,cir.such consent may be found only when congress unequivocally expresses its intention to waive the government sovereign immunity in the statutory text.united states murdock mach.eng g,cir quotation omitted.in cases concerning the united states title to real property,the supreme court has construed the quiet title act as a waiver of sovereign immunity providing the exclusive means for challenging such title mottaz,at.quoting block north dakota ex rel.bd.of and sch.lands,d.
the quiet title act states,in relevant part 
the united states may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the united states claims an interest,other than a security interest or water rights.this section does not apply to trust or restricted indian lands 
a.thus,the act waiver of sovereign immunity is qualified by an exception for suits challenging title to lands held in trust for indian tribes when the united states claims an interest in real property based on that property status as trust or restricted indian lands,the quiet title act does not waive the government immunity.neighbors for rational,at quoting mottaz,at.
several questions are raised by the secretary invocation of the quiet title act in the present context.first,does the plaintiffs suit qualify as a quiet title action so as to render a quiet title act analysis applicable if so,does the fact that plaintiffs brought the sac fox nation case challenging the shriner tract trust status before the secretary had actually taken the tract into trust affect application of the act finally,does either this court order in sac fox nation purporting to retain plaintiffs right to contest the trust acquisition,or the secretary continued participation in this litigation up to the present,provide a means to avoid application of the united states sovereign immunity in this case 
plaintiffs suit is a quiet title action sufficient to invoke the quiet title act 
two of this court recent decisions dealing with similar facts require that we treat plaintiffs suit as a quiet title action against the united states,thus invoking the quiet title act.in neighbors for rational development,norton,the secretary took property owned by the pueblo indians of new mexico into trust,and the pueblos subsequently made plans to develop the land.at.neighbors for rational development neighbors,an organization of local citizens,challenged the secretary decision as arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,and otherwise not in accordance with law because the secretary failed to comply with nepa,and failed to consider the regulatory factors for trust acquisitions in.id.at.
neighbors argued that the quiet title act did not apply because it was not an adverse claimant but a third party,and its suit was not a quiet title action but an apa challenge to the secretary decision to place the land in trust.id.we held,however,that neither of these circumstances were relevant to our application of the act.instead,we held that a court faced with a suit challenging the united states title to land held in trust for an indian tribe must focus on the relief sought by the plaintiffs.id.at.
in this case,neighbors asks the court to enter declaratory judgment that the trust acquisition is null and void.neighbors also seeks to permanently enjoin the secretary from converting the indian school property to trust status without fully complying with all federal laws,regulations,and guidelines,including the national environmental policy act.we think these requests fall within the scope of suits the indian trust land exemption in the quiet title act sought to prevent.
id.at alterations in original.we based this conclusion on congress intent,as expressed in the quiet title act,that third parties be prevented from interfering with the united states obligations to the indians.id.at.in sum,we concluded,the quiet title act precludes neighbors suit to the extent it seek s to nullify the trust acquisition.id.at.
a similar factual situation developed in shivwits band,at.the shivwits band of paiute indians the shivwits purchased tracts of land adjacent to a highway south of george,utah,and after the secretary took these tracts into trust,finalized several leases permitting an advertising company to erect billboards on the trust land.at.when the state of utah threatened criminal action and the city of george issued a order to the advertising company,the shivwits filed a federal action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.id.the state and city counterclaimed,challenging the statute under which the united states took the land into trust and claiming,inter alia,that the taking of the land in trust and the approval of the billboard lease violated nepa and doi regulations id.relying on our neighbors for rational development analysis,we held that the quiet title act barred jurisdiction to hear the state and city arguments to the extent they sought to challenge the bia decision to take the property at issue into trust for the band.id.at.
the relief sought by plaintiffs complaint in this case is functionally identical to that sought by the plaintiffs in neighbors for rational development and shivwits band.plaintiffs seek a determination that the secretary decision to place the shriner tract in trust is not within the scope of her authority,that the agency did not comply with applicable procedures,and that its action is otherwise arbitrary,capricious or an abuse of discretion,and that the agency determination must be declared void ab initio the complaint also seeks an injunction an order of mandamus requiring the agency to revoke the trust status of the tract and rescind all other trust actions and applications and activities concerning the same.similarly,plaintiffs opening brief to this court requests that we invalidate the secretary decision as arbitrary and capricious,and declare void the trust determination of the shriner tract.
as such,plaintiffs requested relief plainly presents a direct challenge to the united states title for the shriner tract held in trust for the wyandotte and therefore fall s within the scope of suits the indian trust land exemption in the quiet title act sought to prevent.neighbors for rational,at.thus,unless facts exist which distinguish plaintiffs suit from those we dismissed in neighbors for rational development and shivwits band,the united states sovereign immunity prevents the federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over this case.
c.the timing of plaintiffs complaint in the instant case precludes application of the quiet title act waiver of sovereign immunity 
plaintiffs argue that this case is distinguishable from neighbors for rational development and shivwits band based on the timing of their challenge to the secretary decisions.in both of those cases,the united states already held title to the land in trust for the tribes at the time the suit challenging the secretary decision was filed here,however,plaintiffs emphasize that they filed a complaint challenging the secretary decision in sac fox nation prior to the secretary taking the shriner tract into trust.thus,they argue,the quiet title act waiver of sovereign immunity permitted the court to hear their suit at the time it was initiated,and the secretary subsequent actions did not divest the court of this jurisdiction.
although plainti
