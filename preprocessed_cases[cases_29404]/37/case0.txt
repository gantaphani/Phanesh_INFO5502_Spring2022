held the nevada ethics in government law is not unconstitutionally overbroad.
a that law prohibits a legislator who has a conflict both from voting on a proposal and from advocating its passage or failure.if it was constitutional to exclude carrigan from voting,then his exclusion from advocating during a legislative session was not unconstitutional,for it was a reasonable time,place,and manner limitation.see clark community for creative.

nevada commission on ethics,petitioner michael carrigan 
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of nevada 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
the nevada supreme court invalidated a recusal provision of the state ethics in government law as unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the first amendment.we consider whether legislators have a personal,first amendment right to vote on any given matter.
nevada ethics in government law provides that a public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of,but may otherwise participate in the of,a matter with respect to which the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in his situation would be materially affected by,inter alia,h is commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others.stat.section a d of the law defines the term commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others to mean a commitment to a person who is a member of the officer household is related by blood,adoption,or marriage to the officer employs the officer or a member of his household or has a substantial and continuing business relationship with the officer.paragraph e of the same subsection adds a catchall to that definition a ny other commitment or relationship that is substantially similar to one of those listed in paragraphs a d.
the ethics in government law is administered and enforced by the petitioner in this litigation,the nevada commission on ethics.in,the commission initiated an investigation of michael carrigan,an elected member of the city council of sparks,nevada,in response to complaints that carrigan had violated by voting to approve an application for a project known as the lazy.carrigan,the complaints asserted,had a disabling conflict in the matter because his friend and campaign manager,carlos vasquez,worked as a paid consultant for the red hawk land company,which had proposed the lazy project and would benefit from its approval.
upon completion of its investigation,the commission concluded that carrigan had a disqualifying conflict of interest under e catchall provision because his relationship with vasquez was substantially similar to the prohibited relationships listed in a d.its written decision censured carrigan for failing to abstain from voting on the lazy matter,but did not impose a civil penalty because his violation was not willful,see.before the hearing,carrigan had consulted the sparks city attorney,who advised him that disclosing his relationship with vasquez before voting on the lazy project,which he did,would satisfy his obligations under the ethics in government law.
carrigan filed a petition for judicial review in the first judicial district court of the state of nevada,arguing that the provisions of the ethics in government law that he was found to have violated were unconstitutional under the first amendment.the district court denied the petition,but a divided nevada supreme court reversed.the majority held that voting was protected by the first amendment,and,applying strict scrutiny,found that e catchall definition was unconstitutionally overbroad.
we granted certiorari.
the first amendment prohibits laws abridging the freedom of speech,which,as a general matter means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message,its ideas,its subject matter,or its content.ashcroft american civil liberties union,quoting bolger youngs drug products.but the amendment has no application when what is restricted is not protected speech.see,roth united states,obscenity not protected speech.the nevada supreme court thought a legislator vote to be protected speech because voting is a core legislative function.at,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we disagree,for the same reason.but before discussing that issue,we must address a preliminary detail the challenged law not only prohibits the legislator who has a conflict from voting on the proposal in question,but also forbids him to advocate the passage or failure of the proposal evidently meaning advocating its passage or failure during the legislative debate.neither carrigan nor any of his amici contend that the prohibition on advocating can be unconstitutional if the prohibition on voting is not.and with good reason.legislative sessions would become massive meetings if those who had a right to speak were not limited to those who had a right to vote.if carrigan was constitutionally excluded from voting,his exclusion from advocat ing at the legislative session was a reasonable time,place and manner limitation.see clark community for creative.
a universal and tradition of prohibiting certain conduct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition is constitutional principles of liberty fundamental enough to have been embodied within constitutional guarantees are not readily erased from the nation consciousness.republican party of white,internal quotation marks omitted.laws punishing libel and obscenity are not thought to violate the freedom of speech to which the first amendment refers because such laws existed in and have been in place ever since.the same is true of legislative recusal rules.the nevada supreme court and carrigan have not cited a single decision invalidating a generally applicable recusal rule and such rules have been commonplace for over years.
e arly congressional enactments provid e contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the constitution meaning,printz united states,quoting bowsher synar.that evidence is dispositive here.within years of the founding,both the house of representatives and the senate adopted recusal rules.the house rule to which no one is recorded as having objected,on constitutional or other grounds,see currie,the constitution in congress the federalist period,was adopted within a week of that chamber first achieving a quorum the rule read no member shall vote on any question,in the event of which he is immediately and particularly interested.annals of cong.members of the house would have been subject to this recusal rule when they voted to submit the first amendment for ratification their failure to note any inconsistency between the two suggests that there was none.
the first senate rules did not include a recusal requirement,but thomas jefferson adopted one when he was president of the senate.his rule provided as follows 
where the private interests of a member are concerned in a bill or question,he is to withdraw.and where such an interest has appeared,his voice is disallowed,even after a division.in a case so contrary not only to the laws of decency,but to the fundamental principles of the social compact,which denies to any man to be a judge in his own case,it is for the honor of the house that this rule,of immemorial observance,should be strictly adhered to.a manual of parliamentary practice for the use of the senate of the united states.
contemporaneous treatises on parliamentary procedure track parts of jefferson formulation.see,clark,manual,compiled and prepared for the use of the new york assembly cushing,manual of parliamentary practice,rules of proceeding and debate in deliberative assemblies ed.
federal rules applicable to judges also date back to the founding.in,congress passed a law requiring district court judges to recuse themselves if they had a personal interest in a suit or had been counsel to a party appearing before them.act of may,ch,stat.in,congress expanded these bases for recusal to include situations in which the judge is so related to,or connected with,either party,as to render it improper for him,in his opinion,to sit on the trial of such suit.act of,ch,stat.the statute was again expanded in,to make any personal bias or prejudice a basis for recusal.act of,stat.the current version,which retains much of the version language,is codified at.see generally liteky united states,frank,disqualification of judges,yale,hereinafter frank.there are of course differences between a legislator vote and a judge,and thus between legislative and judicial recusal rules nevertheless,there do not appear to have been any serious challenges to judicial recusal statutes as having unconstitutionally restricted judges first amendment rights 
the nevada supreme court belief that recusal rules violate legislators first amendment rights is also inconsistent with traditions in the states.a number of states,by rule,have long required recusal of public officials with a conflict.see,in re nashua,if one of the commissioners be interested,he shall not serve commissioners court tarver,if any member has a peculiar,personal interest,such member would be disqualified stubbs florida state finance,so,a public official can not legally participate in his official capacity in the decision of a question in which he is personally and adversely interested today,virtually every state has enacted some type of recusal law,many of which,not unlike nevada,require public officials to abstain from voting on all matters presenting a conflict of interest.see national conference of state,voting recusal provisions,online at http as visited june,and available in clerk of court case file.
in an attempt to combat this overwhelming evidence of constitutional acceptability,carrigan relies on a handful of cases from the and afterwards.see brief for respondent citing clark united states,cadc miller hull,and camacho brandon.even if they were relevant,those cases would be too little and too late to contradict the need for legislative recusal.but they are not relevant.the first was vacated as moot,see clark united states,cadc en banc,and the other two involve retaliation amounting to viewpoint discrimination.see miller,supra,at camacho,supra,at.in the past we have applied heightened scrutiny to laws that are viewpoint discriminatory even as to speech not protected by the first amendment,see paul.carrigan does not assert that the recusal laws here are viewpoint discriminatory,nor could he the statute is and applies equally to all legislators regardless of party or position.
but how can it be that restrictions upon legislators voting are not restrictions upon legislators protected speech the answer is that a legislator vote is the commitment of his apportioned share of the legislature power to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal.the legislative power thus committed is not personal to the legislator but belongs to the people the legislator has no personal right to it.as we said in raines byrd,when denying article iii standing to legislators who claimed that their voting power had been diluted by a statute providing for a veto,the legislator casts his vote as trustee for his constituents,not as a prerogative of personal power.in this respect,voting by a legislator is different from voting by a citizen.while a voter franchise is a personal right,t he procedures for voting in legislative assemblies pertain to legislators not as individuals but as political representatives executing the legislative process.coleman miller,opinion of frankfurter.
carrigan and justice alito say that legislators often us e their votes to express deeply held and highly unpopular views,often at great personal or political peril.post,at opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment quoting brief for respondent.how do they express those deeply held views,one wonders do ballots contain a attachment that will be displayed to the public,reading something like i have a deeply held view about this this is probably desirable this is the least of the available evils my personal view is the other way,but my constituents want this my personal view is the other way,but my big contributors want this i do have the slightest idea what this legislation does,but on my way in to vote the party whip said vote aye there are,to be sure,instances where action conveys a symbolic meaning such as the burning of a flag to convey disagreement with a country policies,see texas johnson.but the act of voting symbolizes nothing.it discloses,to be sure,that the legislator wishes for whatever reason that the proposition on the floor be adopted,just as a physical assault discloses that the attacker dislikes the victim.but neither the one nor the other is an act of communication.rumsfeld forum for academic and institutional rights,expressive value was not created by the conduct itself but by the speech that accompanies it 
moreover,the fact that a nonsymbolic act is the product of deeply held personal belief even if the actor would like it to convey his deeply held personal belief does not transform action into first amendment speech.nor does the fact that action may have social consequences such as the unpopularity that cost john quincy adams his senate seat resulting from his vote in favor of the embargo act of,see post,at.however unpopular adams vote may have made him,and however dee
