frank snowney appeals the dismissal of his complaint after the superior court granted the defendants motion to quash service of summons based on lack of personal jurisdiction.snowney contends the defendants,some of whom own or operate hotels in the state of nevada,have sufficient contacts with the state of california to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction.we conclude that the defendants who own and operate the nevada hotels have sufficient contacts with california to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction based on their advertising in california,interactive internet site,telephone number for hotel reservations,and other activities purposefully directed at california residents.we conclude further that the defendants who do not own or operate the hotels have insufficient contacts with california to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction.
factual and procedural background 
defendants harrah las vegas,harrah laughlin,harrah operating company,rio properties,and harveys tahoe management company,collectively hotel defendants,own and operate hotels in nevada.defendants harrah entertainment,rio hotel casino,and harveys casino resorts are holding companies each of which owns a hotel defendant but does not own or operate a hotel in nevada.defendants harrah reno holding company,rio vegas hotel casino,harrah management company,and harveys,neither own a hotel defendant nor own or operate a hotel in nevada.
snowney sued harrah entertainment,and others in february alleging counts for violation of the unfair competition law,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and false advertising he filed the complaint as both a representative action and a class action.
the defendants jointly moved to quash service of summons based on lack of personal jurisdiction.they argued that they do business only in nevada and have no significant contacts with california to justify either general or specific jurisdiction.a declaration by brad kerby,corporate secretary of harrah entertainment,stated that none of the defendants has a principal place of business in california,operates a hotel in california,conducts business in california,or has bank accounts or employees in california.he also acknowledged that harrah marketing services corporation,a subsidiary of defendant harrah operating company,maintains offices in california that assist customers who contact those offices and attempt to attract a limited number of gaming patrons to harrah properties.
snowney opposed the motion to quash,submitting a transcript of the deposition of the defendants declarant together with his own declaration and declarations by his attorney.snowney argued that the evidence showed that a substantial portion of the hotels patrons were california residents that the defendants advertised to california residents through billboards in california,print advertisements in california newspapers,and radio and television advertisements on california stations that they accepted reservations from california residents via the internet and telephone that an internet site provided driving directions to the hotels from california locations that two of the defendants were qualified to do business in california and that a related marketing company maintained offices in california.snowney argued that these activities supported the exercise of specific jurisdiction.
the superior court concluded that the defendants had insufficient contacts with california to justify the exercise of general or specific personal jurisdiction in california.the order granting the motion to quash states,the fact that a defendant advertises in the forum state,induces readers of its advertisements to patronize its business,and profits substantially from this foreseeable economic reality does not automatically confer specific jurisdiction.citations.emphasis omitted.the order further states,the defendants herein are doing business with california residents but are not doing business in california.the court dismissed the action.
contentions 
snowney principal contention is that the defendants have sufficient contacts with california to justify the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction.we address his other contention in the unpublished portion of this opinion.

constitutional limits to the exercise of personal jurisdiction 
a plaintiff opposing a motion to quash service of process has the initial burden to demonstrate facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.vons,supra,cal th at,d.if the plaintiff satisfies that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to present a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.burger king rudzewicz,d burger king accord,vons,at,d.
