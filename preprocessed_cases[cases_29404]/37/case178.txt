plaintiffs and appellants california commerce casino,and michael sana collectively,plaintiffs appeal a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining without leave to amend of a demurrer interposed by defendants and respondents arnold schwarzenegger in his official capacity as governor of the state of california,tom campbell in his official capacity as director,california department of finance,and california infrastructure and economic development bank defendants.
summary statement 
as a preliminary matter,this court has subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal.government code section,subdivision e,added by section of assembly bill reg.sess.assembly bill,insofar as it provides for direct review by the california supreme court of certain matters,is unconstitutional because it abridges the court of appeal appellate jurisdiction.in re perris city news th,d.
the essential issue presented on appeal is the statute of limitations applicable to this action in which plaintiffs are challenging the constitutionality of assembly bill,a bill wherein the legislature ratified amended gaming compacts among the state of california and five indian tribes.although plaintiffs contend they are attacking solely the validity of assembly bill and not any matters authorized by assembly bill,plaintiffs action,if successful,would have the effect of invalidating the amended compacts which were ratified thereby.therefore,the various theories raised in plaintiffs complaint should have been tested in a validation action within days of the enactment of assembly bill.code civ,et.however,plaintiffs waited nearly months to file suit,and therefore,the trial court properly ruled the action was.
in addition to being filed late in the trial court,the matter was not filed timely on appeal.the issue of the timeliness of the appeal is inextricably intertwined with the issue of whether this action was subject to the validation statutes.because plaintiffs lawsuit was subject to the time limits specified for validation actions,the time for filing notice of appeal is governed by code of civil procedure section,within the statutory scheme pertaining to validating proceedings,not by california rules of court,former rule a.code of civil procedure section requires notice of appeal in a validation action to be filed within days of notice of entry of judgment.the notice of appeal herein was filed days after notice of entry of judgment.therefore,the appeal must be dismissed as untimely.
factual and procedural background 
the federal indian gaming regulatory act.
the federal indian gaming regulatory act igra was enacted in as a means of generating tribal government revenue and to promote triable economic development,and strong tribal governments.
igra separates gaming into three categories and provides for different modes of regulation for each category.class gaming,social games for minor prizes or traditional forms of indian gaming,subd.is subject to tribal regulation only,subd.a.class gaming bingo and similar games and card games that are allowed by a state,subd.is jointly regulated by federal and tribal authorities,subd.a.class gaming,which includes all forms of gambling that are not class gaming or class gaming,subd,requires a compact that is negotiated between a tribe and a state,subject to federal approval and oversight,subd.d.
state gaming laws and proposition.
in,when the federal legislation was enacted,california prohibited all slot machines and all banking and percentage card games,et california constitution also prohibited all lotteries except the state lottery.cal,art.iv,subds.a,d.the state constitution also declared the legislature has no power to authorize,and shall prohibit casinos of the type currently operating in nevada and new jersey.cal,art.iv,subd.e,added by initiative.
in,the voters approved proposition,which required the state to enter into specified compacts,et proposition was a purely statutory measure.in,the california supreme court held most of proposition unconstitutional because it conflicted with the constitutional ban on gambling.hotel employees restaurant employees internat.union davis cal th,d.
the compacts and the subsequent approval of proposition.
on september,governor davis executed class iii gaming compacts with indian tribes.the compacts allowed the tribes to operate slot machines at their casinos on indian lands,and limited each tribe to a maximum of slot machines.
the compacts were conditioned upon the passage of proposition,which would resolve the supreme court concerns about proposition by amending the state constitution to permit tribes to operate slot machines and banking and percentage card games pursuant to compacts.
in march,the voters approved proposition,which added the following provision to the state constitution f notwithstanding subdivisions a and e,and any other provision of state law,the governor is authorized to negotiate and conclude compacts,subject to ratification by the legislature,for the operation of slot machines and for the conduct of lottery games and banking and percentage card games by federally recognized indian tribes on indian lands in california in accordance with federal law.accordingly,slot machines,lottery games,and banking and percentage card games are hereby permitted to be conducted and operated on tribal lands subject to those compacts.cal,art.iv,subd.f.
with the passage of proposition,the compacts finally were approved.
the compact amendments.
on june,some four years after the approval of proposition,governor schwarzenegger and five of the tribes amended their compacts to allow the tribes,after paying substantial fee increases,to operate slot machines in excess of the previous limit of the compact amendments also provided for enhanced environmental protection and employee rights.
the compact amendments,inter alia,required each of the five tribes to make annual payments to the state with the agreement that it is the state intention to assign these revenue contributions totaling at least million annually to a third party for purposes of securitizing the revenue stream in the form of bonds that can be issued to investors.
during the life of the bonds and in order to protect the tribes ability to make the payments underlying the bonds,the state agreed not to authorize slot machines or banking or percentage card games within the tribes core geographic market area,except to another indian tribe with a valid class iii gaming compact.also,the compact amendments provided the five tribes could seek injunctive relief to enjoin the authorization of any such gaming,so as to protect the marketability of the bonds and to provide the stability in gaming operations needed to ensure the tribes annual payments.
ratification of the amended compacts via assembly bill 
the legislature ratified the amended compacts in assembly bill,which was enacted on july.
assembly bill is a bill.section thereof added section to the government code,which ratified the amendments of gaming compacts entered into by the state and the five tribes.
assembly bill was enacted as an urgency statute to take immediate effect,in order to ensure that sufficient funds are available when needed to fund essential transportation programs and to ensure that the revenues available under the amended compacts ratified pursuant to this act are made available to the state as expeditiously as possible assembly bill.
assembly bill,among other things,approved the specific details of the bond financing arrangements by adding article commencing with to chapter of division of title of the government code hereafter,article.article authorized the issuance of bonds securitized by the moneys paid by the five tribes to the state pursuant to the amended compacts.assembly bill also required that any action challenging the validity of any matter authorized by article be brought in accordance with,and within the time specified in code of civil procedure section et,pertaining to validation actions,subd.d see code civ,et.
proceedings.
plaintiffs herein are california commerce casino,a gaming business entity,and michael sana,one of its key employees.the defendants include the governor of california,the state director of the department of finance and.the five tribes,which enjoy sovereign immunity see generally,agua caliente band of cahuilla indians superior court cal th,d,were not named as defendants.
plaintiffs filed suit in superior court on may,nearly eleven months after assembly bill become effective.six weeks later,on july,they filed the operative first amended complaint.
i first,second and third causes of action,alleging violation of constitutional prohibition against granting a franchise or special privilege or creating a vested right or interest by way of urgency legislation.
in the first three causes of action,plaintiffs alleged that assembly bill violates the constitutional provision that bars the grant of vested rights or franchises by way of an urgency measure.cal,art.iv,d.
the first cause of action,which was denominated a petition for writ of mandate,alleged that because assembly bill was improperly adopted as an urgency measure,defendants have a mandatory duty not to implement its provisions.
the second cause of action sought injunctive relief to prevent the implementation of assembly bill on the ground it was unconstitutionally enacted as an urgency measure.
the third cause of action sought declaratory relief to the effect assembly bill enactment as an urgency measure violates the california constitution,or alternatively,a declaration that assembly bill is subject to the right of referendum under article ii,section a of the state constitution,a right which assembly bill attempted to circumvent.
ii fourth,fifth and sixth causes of action,alleging assembly bill violates proposition prohibition on borrowing to fund state budget deficits.
in the next three causes of action,plaintiffs alleged assembly bill violates proposition,a provision of the california constitution that prohibits borrowing to fund state budget deficits plaintiffs alleged assembly bill violates proposition because it authorizes the issuance of up to billion in bonds,the proceeds of which will be used almost exclusively to fund state budget deficits and because it proposes to meet the debt obligations created by these bonds exclusively with moneys paid by the five tribes under the amended which are therefore derived from a designated source of revenue.
the fourth cause of action,which was denominated a petition for writ of mandate,alleged that because assembly bill violates proposition,defendants have a mandatory duty not to implement its provisions.
the fifth cause of action sought injunctive relief to prevent the implementation of assembly bill on the ground it contravenes proposition.
the sixth cause of action sought declaratory relief to the effect that assembly bill violates proposition and is thus unconstitutional.
iii seventh,eighth and ninth causes of action,alleging assembly bill unconstitutionally contracts away the state police power to regulate gaming.
in the final three causes of action,plaintiffs alleged assembly bill unconstitutionally attempts to contract away the state police power to regulate gaming for the next years until the bonds are repaid.
the seventh cause of action,which was denominated a petition for writ of mandate,alleged that because assembly bill unconstitutionally contracts away the state police power,defendants have a mandatory duty not to implement it.
the eighth cause of action sought injunctive relief on the same ground.
the ninth cause of action sought declaratory relief to the effect that assembly bill is unconstitutional because it purports to contract away the state police power.
defendants demurred on two grounds the complaint failed to state a viable claim in that it was filed after the statute of limitations allowed to challenge contracts and financing arrangements and the complaint failed to name,and because of sovereign immunity is unable to name,the five affected tribes as necessary parties to the action.
trial court ruling.
on november,the trial court issued an order sustaining the demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend,ruling the pleading was by the applicable statute of limitations.the trial court reasoned,since plaintiffs first amended complaint challenges the validity of matters authorized by assembly bill,despite their opposition arguments to the contrary,it is subject to the requirements of code civ.proc.et.
the trial court also held the pleading failed,and because of sovereign immunity,is not able to name the five affected tribes as necessary and indispensable parties to this case.
a judgment of dismissal was entered on november.on december,plaintiffs filed notice of appeal.
contentions 
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in dismissing the action as,and that it abused its discretion in concluding the five tribes are necessary and indispensable parties 
defendants seek dismissal of the appeal as untimely.they further argue that in any event,the trial court properly dismissed the action because the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations and due to plaintiffs failure to join the five tribes as indispensable parties 
discussion 
this court has subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal government code,subdivision e,purporting to abridge this court appellate jurisdiction,is unconstitutional.
before discussing the parties contentions,we address a threshold question as to subject matter jurisdiction.
section of assembly bill contains its own provision pertaining to appellate procedures.section of assembly bill added,inter alia,government code section which states in relevant part at subdivision e notwithstanding any other provision of law,the exclusive means to obtain review of a superior court judgment entered in an action brought pursuant to chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure to determine the validity of any bonds to be issued,any other contracts to be entered into,or any other matters authorized by this article shall be by petition to the supreme court for writ of review.any such petition shall be filed within days following the notice of entry of the superior court judgment,and no extension of that period shall be allowed.if no petition is filed within the time allowed for this purpose,or the petition is denied,with or without opinion,the decision of the superior court shall be final and enforceable as provided in subdivision a of section of the code of civil procedure.italics added.
this provision,abridging the court of appeal appellate jurisdiction,is patently unconstitutional as explained in in re perris city news,supra,th at page,d the jurisdiction of the various levels of appellate courts within california is defined by the california constitution.the constitution provides that the supreme court has appellate jurisdiction only when judgment of death has been pronounced cal,art.vi,when it transfers a case to itself from the court of appeal,subd.a,or when it reviews a decision of the court of appeal,subd.b.with those exceptions,courts of appeal have appellate jurisdiction when superior courts have original jurisdiction,subd.a.once appellate jurisdiction has been conferred by the constitution,it can not be destroyed or abridged by legislative action.powers city of richmond cal th,d.any attempt to do so is void.in re assessment cal.
therefore,government code section,subdivision e,providing for direct review by the california supreme court,is unconstitutional.in accordance with the principle that courts of appeal have appellate jurisdiction when superior courts have original jurisdiction cal,art.vi,subd.a,this court has subject matter jurisdiction to review the judgment of the superior court herein.
plaintiffs appeal is governed by validation statutes therefore,plaintiffs notice of appeal was untimely,requiring dismissal.
having declared unconstitutional government code section,subdivision e,providing for petition for writ of review to the supreme court within days,the issue remains whether the appeal is timely.
the judgment of dismissal was entered on november,and the clerk served notice of entry of judgment that same day.plaintiffs filed notice of appeal days later,on december.
on june,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the appeal,contending this action is governed by the validation statutes and therefore the notice of appeal,filed more than days after notice of entry of judgment,is untimely.code civ.the issue of the timeliness of the appeal is inextricably intertwined with the issue of whether this action was subject to the validation statutes.therefore,this court deferred ruling on the dismissal motion pending consideration of the merits of the appeal.
in order to determine the timeliness of the notice of appeal,we must determine whether the underlying action was governed by the statutory scheme pertaining to validation proceedings.kaatz city of seaside th,d kaatz.this requires us to resolve the principal issue of the appeal itself.ibid.a contrary approach would preclude review on the merits of a trial court decision by having the appellate court assume the applicability of a statute providing for a shortened appeal period without regard to whether that assumption is correct.therefore,we must consider whether plaintiffs action was,in fact,subject to the validation statutes.ibid.
we indicate in advance the balance of our decision by summarily noting our conclusion that because plaintiffs various constitutional challenges to assembly bill,if successful,would have invalidated the compacts,said challenges should have been asserted in a validation action.therefore,the appeal period under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b is applicable.consequently,the appeal must be dismissed as untimely 
standard of appellate review.
in determining whether a plaintiff has properly stated a claim for relief,our standard of review is clear we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citations.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.our review is de novo.ibid.
the nature and purpose of validation actions.
the procedures applicable to validation actions are set forth at code of civil procedure section et.
code of civil procedure section enables a public agency to bring a validation action upon the existence of any matter which under any other law is authorized to be determined pursuant to this chapter,and for days thereafter italics added.
if no proceedings have been brought by the public agency pursuant to this chapter,any interested person may bring an action within the time and in the court specified by section to determine the validity of such matter.code civ,italics added.
under the statutory scheme,an agency may indirectly but effectively validate its action by doing nothing to validate it unless an interested person brings an action of his own under section within the period,the agency action will become immune from attack whether it is legally valid or not.city of ontario superior court cal d,ontario accord friedland city of long beach th,d friedland embarcadero mun.improvement dist.county of santa barbara th,d.as to matters which have been or which could have been adjudicated in a validation action,such constitutional be raised within the statutory limitations period in section et or they are waived.friedland,supra,at,d.
we recognize the statutory period of limitation for commencing a validation action is extremely short but it is not unique in its brevity.see,time for filing statement of election contest.what constitutes a reasonable time is a question ordinarily left to the legislature,whose decision a court will not overrule except where palpable error has been committed.citation.friedland,supra,th at,d.given the policies underlying the validation statutes,including the need to limit the extent to which delay due to litigation may impair a public agency ability to operate financially,the limitations period for filing a validation action code civ,is not unreasonable.id.at,d.
a validation action implements important policy considerations.a central theme in the validating procedures is speedy determination of the validity of the public agency action.citation.the text of code of civil procedure section and cases which have interpreted the validation statutes have placed great importance on the need for a single dispositive final judgment.citation.the validating statutes should be construed so as to uphold their purpose,the acting agency need to settle promptly all questions about the validity of its action.citation.a key objective of a validation action is to limit the extent to which delay due to litigation may impair a public agency ability to operate financially.citation.friedland,supra,th at,d.a validation action also serves to fulfill the important objective of facilitat ing a public agency financial transactions with third parties by quickly affirming their legality.id.at,d.in particular,t he fact that litigation may be pending or forthcoming drastically affects the marketability of public bonds.id.at,d.
overview of the five sections which comprise assembly bill.
assembly bill,which ratified amendments of compacts entered into by the state of california and the five tribes,consists of five sections.
section of the bill sets forth the legislature findings and statement of purpose and declares,inter alia it is in the public interest and a matter of urgency to authorize,and to implement as soon as possible,the sale of the right to receive those payments and a portion of certain other payments under the compacts,and the issuance of the bonds by the purchaser of the assets,in order to ensure that funds will be available for the purpose of funding essential transportation improvements and projects in the state.
section of assembly bill added section to the code of civil procedure to enable the five tribes to seek a preliminary and permanent injunction against any gambling that violates their exclusive right to conduct class iii gaming.this statute also provides no undertaking shall be required on the part of the tribes in connection with any action to seek a preliminary or permanent injunction.ibid.
section of assembly bill added section to the government code.government code section ratifies the amendments of gaming compacts entered into by the state and the five tribes,and provides that specified acts and agreements related to the amended compacts are not projects for the purposes of the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et.
section of assembly bill added article to chapter of division of title to the government code.article,consisting of government code section et,is captioned tribal compact assets securitization.this article authorizes established by,to sell,on behalf of the state,some or all of the state compact assets to a special purpose trust,and empowers the trust to issue bonds securitized by the moneys paid by the five tribes to the state pursuant to the amended compacts.the portion of the compact assets to be sold shall be an amount necessary to provide the state with net proceeds of the sale,not to exceed one billion five hundred million dollars,subd.a.with respect to the net proceeds,the largest share,some billion,was to be deposited to the traffic congestion relief fund,subd.c 
article,within section of assembly bill,also includes the following provision d the special purpose trust and the bank shall be treated as public agencies for purposes of chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure,and any action or proceeding challenging the validity of any matter authorized by this article shall be brought in accordance with,and within the time specified in,that chapter,subd.d,italics added.
article also states this article and all powers granted hereby shall be liberally construed to effectuate its intent and their purposes.
the final section of assembly bill,namely,section,declares the bill is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,health,or safety within the meaning of article iv of the constitution and shall go into immediate effect.the facts constituting the necessity are in order to ensure that sufficient funds are available when needed to fund essential transportation programs and to ensure that the revenues available under the amended compacts ratified pursuant to this act are made available to the state as expeditiously as possible,it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.
pertinent statutes requiring and authorizing validation actions to challenge the amended compacts or various matters authorized by assembly bill.
the validation statutes,code of civil procedure section et,do not specify the matters to which they apply.rather,they apply to any matter which under any other law is authorized to be determined pursuant to this chapter code civ,italics added accord planning conservation league department of water resources cal th,d.therefore,we look to other statutes and cases that have interpreted them to determine the scope of public agency actions that are subject to validation under the validation statutes.kaatz,supra,th at,d.
here,there are two statutes which provide for validation actions to challenge the validity of the amended compacts or the validity of certain matters authorized by assembly bill,namely,government code section,subdivision d,and government code section.
a.the validation provision in section of assembly bill.
government code section,subdivision d,added by section of assembly bill or article,specifically provides the special purpose trust and the bank shall be treated as public agencies for purposes of chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure and any action or proceeding challenging the validity of any matter authorized by this article,article shall be brought in accordance with,and within the time specified in,that chapter,subd.d,italics added.
by its terms,said provision is limited in its scope.only challenges to matter s authorized by this article,subd.d,which article relates to securitization of tribal compact assets,are subject to the validation provision contained in section of assembly bill.the amended compacts were ratified by section of assembly bill,not by section thereof.therefore,a challenge to the validity of the amended compacts would not be governed by the validation requirement of section of assembly bill.
b.the validation provision of government code section.
leaving aside the limited scope of the validation provision found in section of assembly bill,there is a much broader validation provision which is pertinent here.government code section added by stats,ch,which preceded the enactment of assembly bill,provides in relevant part at subdivision a the state or any state board,department,agency,or authority,may bring an action to determine the validity of its bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations,or evidences of indebtedness pursuant to chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure.italics added.as noted,where a public agency may bring a validation action under code of civil procedure section,any interested person may bring a reverse validation action within the same period.code civ,kaatz,supra,th at,fn,d.
the type of contracts subject to validation under government code section.
although government code section provides for validation of contracts without limitation or qualification,the parties recognize that not all contracts are subject to validation under said statute.
a.the ontario decision construing the type of contracts subject to validating proceedings.
due to the dearth of authority construing government code section,which authorizes validating proceedings to determine the validity of state contracts,we begin our analysis with the supreme court extensive discussion of the validation statutes in ontario,supra,cal d.the ontario decision construed government code section,which authorizes a local agency to bring an action to determine the validity of its bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations or evidences of indebtedness pursuant to code of civil procedure section et,italics added.
the quoted language from government code section is germane because it is identical to the pertinent language in government code section.it is a rule of construction that after the courts have construed the meaning of any particular word,or expression,and the legislature subsequently undertakes to use these exact words in the same connection,the presumption is almost irresistible that it used them in the precise and technical sense which had been placed upon them by the courts.city of long beach payne cal d.
in view of the fact the legislature enacted government code section using the same language which ontario construed,and in particular,its interpretation of the term contracts,the legislature is presumed to have been aware of and to have concurred in the judicial construction.see marina point,wolfson cal d,kaatz,supra,th at,d.
in ontario,supra,taxpayers challenged a city plan for the financing of an automobile racing stadium that included the issuance and sale,without voter approval,of in mortgage bonds to finance the project,the award of a contract to a private party,without competitive bidding,for the construction of the stadium at a cost of,and the lease of the stadium for years to a entity that would operate the facility as a private business venture.ontario,supra,cal d at.
the plaintiffs essential claims were that the plan promoted a private commercial enterprise without any public benefit and was an unconstitutional gift of public funds.ontario,supra,cal d at.after filing an answer,the city moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground the plaintiffs failed to comply with particular requirements pertaining to summons under the validation statutes.id.at.the trial court denied the motion,impliedly finding the plaintiffs claims were governed by the validation statutes but expressly holding the plaintiffs had shown good cause to excuse their failure to comply with the special summons requirements.ibid.
the city sought a writ of prohibition,contending the trial court had abused its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss,a position the supreme court rejected.ontario,supra,cal d at.in the course of determining the trial court acted within its discretion,ontario provided an extensive discussion of the validation statutes 
ontario stated code of civil procedure sections through were first enacted in.the legislation was proposed by the judicial council,which explained that it had been concerned for some years with the numerous statutes providing periods within which appeals may be taken at variance with the time for notice of appeal contained in the rules on appeal.citation.in particular,the council pointed to numerous scattered statutes authorizing actions by cities,counties,and public agencies to establish the validity of their bonds or assessments or the legality of their existence,and providing special procedures for appeals in such cases ontario,supra,cal d at.
the ontario court continued,noting that government code sections and were enacted in,two years after the enactment of code of civil procedure section et.ontario,supra,cal d at.the city therein argued the use of the word contracts in government code section indicated the validation statutes applied to any public agency contract.ontario,supra,at.while conceding the challenged stadium agreement facially appeared to be embraced by government code section because there was no limitation or qualification on the word contracts ontario,supra,at,the supreme court did not end its inquiry there.
instead,ontario concluded a closer examination of government code section suggested a much narrower construction of contracts for at least four reasons first,the legislative counsel digest characterized the measure as one allowing a local agency to bring an action to determine the validity of evidences of indebtedness.second,section was enacted as part of chapter of part,division,title,of the government code.chapter is entitled bonds,and deals exclusively with the power of local agencies to sell their bonds,replace defaced or lost bonds,and pledge their revenues to pay or secure such bonds.if government code section were intended to be a provision of general application,logically it should have been placed in article miscellaneous of chapter general of the same part,in which a group of such unrelated matters are collected.third,the key language of government code section bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations or evidences of indebtedness was taken directly from code of civil procedure section of chapter under canons of statutory interpretation,it should ordinarily be given the same meaning as it had in the earlier statute.but as a perusal of the companion legislation reveals,when chapter was adopted it was made applicable only to such matters as the legality of the local entity existence,the validity of its bonds and assessments,and the validity of joint financing agreements with other agencies.if government code section was intended to reach any and all contracts into which an agency may lawfully enter,the restricted language of code of civil procedure section was inappropriate for that purpose.finally,that language is peculiarly inapt for expressing such a general meaning in any event,as it lists the word contracts in the midst of four other terms which all deal with the limited topic of a local agency financial obligations.ontario,supra,cal d at.
ontario also observed if,as the city here argues,the word contracts in government code section is taken to mean any contract into which the agency may lawfully enter,the expansion of the statute becomes apparent.the vast majority of such an agency dealings are necessarily undertaken by means of contracts some involve routine ministerial matters,but others embody important policy decisions affecting the public at large.i f the city construction of the word contract is correct,virtually every taxpayer has become an interested person with regard to virtually every action of a local public agency.it is unreasonable to assume that the members of such a large and amorphous group are likely to have prompt notice of each agency action affecting them.yet whether such a person has such notice or not,he is given only days in which to discover the existence,scope and effect of the agency action,to reach a conclusion as to its validity,to determine whether the agency has instituted a validating proceeding or imminently intends to do so,and if not,to prepare and file a proceeding of his own.in an age of increasingly complex government,this seems a heavy burden to impose on the vigilant taxpayer.ontario,supra,cal d at.
graydon pasadena redevelopment agency d.graydon.
graydon is also instructive.there,the pasadena redevelopment agency agency entered into an agreement with a developer for the development of a retail shopping center.to finance the public cost of the retail shopping center development for acquisition of land,demolition of buildings,relocation of residents and businesses,and construction of parking facilities,the agency sold tax allocation bonds in the principal amount of approximately million.on november,the agency governing body awarded and authorized execution of a negotiated contract for construction of the subterranean garage for the project.graydon,supra,d at.
less than three months later,graydon,the plaintiff,filed a petition for mandamus alleging,inter alia,the contract for the construction of the subterranean garage for the retail center was awarded without competitive bidding in violation of provisions of the health and safety code.the answers asserted,inter alia,the action was barred because it was not filed within the time prescribed by code of civil procedure section et.graydon,supra,d at.the trial court denied graydon petition for writ of mandate,ruling that in light of the agency statutory purpose to eliminate blight,the agency ability to operate and accomplish its statutory purpose and the purposes of the redevelopment plan would be substantially impaired unless the contract is subject to a prompt validation procedure.id.at,italics deleted.
the reviewing court agreed.it reasoned the negotiated contract for the construction of the subterranean garage is an integral part of the whole method of financing the public costs associated with the retail center.the financing is by bonds issued by the agency to be paid from tax increments allocated to the agency.the record indicates that if completion of the retail center was delayed beyond march,because of delay in commencement of construction,a loss of tax increment revenue of would result for the fiscal year the ability of the agency to pay its bonds,dependent in large part upon the flow of tax increment monies resulting from the completion of the retail center,was thus directly linked to the award of the questioned contract.the contract is inextricably bound to the agency financial obligations.these bonds were intimately and inextricably bound up with the award of this contract.delay in the completion of the retail center because of the delay which would inevitably have resulted if the contract had been competitively bid would have had a direct bearing on the financial ability of agency to meet its financial obligations and statutory purpose.these conclusions compel the result we reach here.the lack of a prompt validating procedure would impair this public agency ability to operate and carry out its statutory purpose.we hold that chapter of title of part of the code of civil procedure commencing with applies and that this action,which was not commenced until january,more than days after the contract came into existence on november,is barred by the limitation provisions of sections and.graydon,supra,d at,italics added.
c.the recent decision in kaatz.
unlike graydon,the matter in issue in kaatz was not the proper subject of a validation proceeding because it did not involve a challenge,either direct or indirect,to a public financing arrangement.kaatz,supra,th at,d.
in kaatz,benjamin kaatz brought suit as a taxpayer to challenge certain actions of the city of seaside arising out of its purchase and sale of acres of residential property that were formerly part of the fort ord military base.kaatz alleged,inter alia,that immediately after the city purchased the property from the united states army in july,it conveyed the entire acreage to a developer,k b bakewell,for a fraction of its fair market value.following motions for judgment on the pleadings and for dismissal filed by k b bakewell,joined in by the city,the suit was dismissed on the basis that it was time barred.kaatz,supra,th at,d.
the lower court concluded the challenged purchase and sale of property were matters that were embraced by government code section language permitting a local agency to bring a proceeding under the validation statutes to determine the validity of its bonds,warrants,contracts,obligations or evidences of indebtedness,and kaatz had not filed suit to determine the validity of the city actions within days as required by the validation statutes.kaatz,supra,th at,d.
the appellate court reversed,holding that based upon the limited scope of the validation statutes,that the city conveyance of the with the city prior execution of the underlying contract with the developer concerning the potential acquisition and sale of the not subject to validation.we therefore find that the trial court erred in its application of the statute of limitations for validation proceedings and consequent dismissal of the action.kaatz,supra,th at,d.
guided by ontario and other authorities,kaatz found i t is therefore clear that contracts under government code section should be assigned a restricted meaning.rather than authorizing proceedings to validate any public agency even any contract constituting a financial obligation of a public agency fn.omitted the contracts under government code are only those that are in the nature of,or directly relate to a public agency bonds,warrants or other evidences of indebtedness.kaatz,supra,th at,d,italics added.
the kaatz court was unpersuaded by the authorities cited by the respondents therein,stating for instance,in graydon,supra,d at page.which bakewell claimed at oral argument to be the principal case supporting its pasadena redevelopment agency sold approximately million in tax allocation bonds to finance the public cost of a retail shopping development the graydon plaintiffs challenged a component of that project,namely,the award and execution by the agency of a contract for construction of the subterranean garage,claiming that it was illegal because it was awarded without competitive bidding.citation.the appellate court held that the action was subject to the validation statutes because,while it may not have been a direct challenge to the agency issuance of bonds to fund the project,the subterranean garage contract was an integral part of the whole method of financing the public costs associated with the retail center.the financing is by bonds issued by the agency.citation.thus,the public agency action being challenged indirectly in graydon was a public financing arrangement these bonds were intimately and inextricably bound up with the award of this contract to construct the subterranean garage.citation.the case before us involves no such challenge direct or indirect to a public financing arrangement.kaatz,supra,th at,d,italics added.
guided by ontario and its progeny,we conclude contracts subject to validation under government code section are those that are in the nature of,or directly relate to the state or a state agency bonds,warrants,or other evidences of indebtedness.see kaatz,supra,th at,d discussing.we now turn to the three theories pled by plaintiffs in their attempt to invalidate assembly bill,and by extension,the amended compacts.
all three theories pled by plaintiffs alleging assembly bill violates various provisions of the california constitution were an attack on the validity of the amended compacts contracts and therefore should have been raised in a reverse validation action within days of assembly bill ratification of the amended compacts.
because the amended compacts are inextricably intertwined with the intended use of the income stream created by them and with bonds to be issued,the lack of a prompt validating procedure to validate the compacts would frustrate the statutory purpose of assembly bill.
the amended compacts are,in the words of graydon,inextricably bound up with the use of the income stream created by the amended compacts and with the bonds to be issued.graydon,supra,d at.the terms of the amended compacts confirm this fact.
section of the amended compacts provides in relevant part a the tribe shall make annual payments to the state of million for years the tribe understands that it is the state intention to assign these and other tribes revenue contributions totaling at least million annually to a third party for purposes of securitizing the revenue stream in the form of bonds that can be issued to investors.further,section e of the amended compacts provide in the event the bonds securitized in part by the tribe annual payments referenced in section,subdivision a are not issued or following the conclusion of the tribe annual payments securitizing the issued bonds,the tribe shall be relieved of its obligation to make the payments specified in various sections,if and only if any person or entity other than an indian tribe with a federally authorized compact engages in any gaming activities specified in subdivision a of section of this amended compact within the tribe core geographic market,until such time that such gaming ceases.
thus,the amended compacts are inextricably intertwined with the state intended use of the income stream created by them and with the bonds to be issued at a later date.therefore,the ability of the five tribes and the state to accomplish the statutory purpose of assembly bill would be substantially impaired absent a prompt validating procedure as to such contract s.graydon,supra,d at.that is because the negotiated amended compacts are an integral part of the whole method of financing ibid.the state transportation programs and are needed to ensure that the revenues available under the amended compacts ratified pursuant to assembly bill are made available to the state as expeditiously as possible assembly bill.
as defendants point out,the application of the validation statutes is not contingent on whether the bonds are ultimately issued at the end of the process.the applicability of the validation statutes is determined at the beginning of the financing process when the this case the amended to implement that process are approved.
plaintiffs theories that assembly bill was improperly enacted on an urgency basis and that it unconstitutionally contracts away the police power are an attack on the validity of the compacts and therefore should have been tested in a prompt validation action.
in the first,second and third causes of action,plaintiffs alleged assembly bill is unconstitutional because it grants a franchise or special privilege or creates a vested right or interest by way of urgency legislation.this challenge to the validity of assembly bill is at the same time a challenge to the validity of the amended compacts.in the event plaintiffs were to prevail on their request for mandamus,injunctive or declaratory relief on the theory assembly bill enactment as an urgency statute renders it unconstitutional,the amended compacts,which were ratified by assembly bill,would be invalidated.
the same analysis applies to the seventh,eighth and ninth causes of action,wherein plaintiffs alleged assembly bill unconstitutionally contracts away the state police power to regulate gaming.said challenge to the validity of assembly bill is at the same time a challenge to the validity of the amended compacts.in the event plaintiffs were to prevail on their request for mandamus,injunctive or declaratory relief on this theory,the now ratified amended compacts would be invalidated.
therefore,both of these alleged infirmities in the amended compacts should have been tested in a timely reverse validation action.the amended compacts between the state and the five tribes are contracts.government code section authorizes the filing of a validation action or reverse validation action to determine the validity of a state contract,in accordance with code of civil procedure section et.code of civil procedure section provides contracts shall be deemed to be in existence upon their authorization and contracts shall be deemed authorized as of the date of adoption by the governing body of the public agency of a resolution or ordinance approving the contract and authorizing its execution.here,the amended compacts came into existence on july,the date assembly bill took effect.
consequently,plaintiffs could and should have brought a reverse validation action within days of the july,ratification of the amended compacts code civ,to challenge their validity on the theories that assembly bill unconstitutionally ratified them on an urgency basis and that assembly bill unconstitutionally contracted away the police power.having failed to raise these constitutional challenges to the validity of the amended compacts in a timely reverse validation action,these theories are now barred.to reiterate,as to matters which have been or which could have been adjudicated in a validation action,such constitutional be raised within the statutory limitations period in section et or they are waived.friedland,supra,th at,d,italics added.
plaintiffs theory that assembly bill violates proposition prohibition on borrowing to fund state budget deficits also should have been raised in a reverse validation action.
plaintiffs remaining theory,which was the subject of the fourth,fifth and sixth causes of action,is that assembly bill violates proposition prohibition on borrowing to fund state budget deficits.plaintiffs alleged assembly bill viola
