we must decide whether,in the course of negotiations under the indian gaming regulatory act,a state can challenge a bureau of indian affairs decision to hold a parcel of land in trust for an indian tribe and whether it can challenge the tribe federally recognized status.
this litigation is between a small federally recognized indian tribe which wishes to build and to operate a class iii gaming casino and hotel on tribal trust land and the state of california,which seeks to regulate or to oppose such activity.
to regulate gaming on indian lands,congress enacted the indian gaming regulatory act,et the igra,which created a cooperative federalis t framework that balance d the competing sovereign interests of the federal government,state governments,and indian tribes,by giving each a role in the regulatory scheme.in re indian gaming related cases,cir quoting artichoke joe norton,d.the igra assigns authority to regulate gaming to tribal and state governments depending on the class of gaming involved.
class i gaming includes social games solely for prizes of minimal value or traditional forms of indian gaming engaged in by individuals as part of,or in connection with,tribal ceremonies or celebrations,and its regulation is left exclusively within the jurisdiction of the indian tribes,id.a.id.at.class ii gaming includes bingo and certain card games but excludes any banked card games,electronic games of chance,and slot machines.id.at.class iii gaming includes all forms of gaming that are not class i gaming or class ii gaming.class iii gaming,which is contemplated by the tribe here,often involves the types of games usually associated with gambling.in re indian gaming related cases,at.
the igra sets out detailed procedures for indian tribes seeking to conduct class iii gaming,which is allowed on indian lands only if conducted in conformance with a tribal state compact entered into by the indian tribe and the state.d c.negotiations for a gaming compact begin at the request of an indian tribe having jurisdiction over the indian lands upon which a class iii gaming activity is being conducted,or is to be conducted.id.d a.the indian tribe request triggers the state obligation to negotiate in good faith.id.
if negotiations are successful,the tribe and the state will enter into a compact to allow class iii gaming subject to the approval of the secretary of the interior.id.d b.if negotiations are unsuccessful,the tribe can sue the state in district court.id.d a i.if,in turn,the district court finds that the state has failed to negotiate in good faith,it must order the parties to reach an agreement.id.d b iii.if no agreement is reached after days,the court must order each party to submit a proposal to a mediator,who selects the proposal that best comports with the igra and other federal laws.id.d b iv.
of course,gaming is confined to indian lands and negotiations are begun by a tribe with jurisdiction over such lands.the igra defines indian lands as all lands within the limits of any indian reservation and any lands title to which is held in trust by the united states for the benefit of any indian tribe or individual and over which an indian tribe exercises governmental power.id.
the bureau of indian affairs the bia obtains authority to hold land in trust for indian tribes from the indian reorganization act,et the ira,under which the secretary of the interior is authorized to acquire any interest in lands for the purpose of providing land for indians and to hold those lands in trust for the indian tribe or individual indian for which the land is acquired.id.indians include all persons of indian descent who are members of any recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction.id.
big lagoon rancheria is a federally recognized indian tribe located on the shoreline of big lagoon near trinidad in humboldt county,california.it claims jurisdiction over two parcels of land adjacent to one another.one consists of nine acres purchased by the united states in.the other consists of eleven acres taken into trust for big lagoon rancheria by the bia in.big lagoon rancheria seeks to operate a class iii gaming casino and hotel on the parcel held in trust for the tribe.
in,the bia purchased the parcel for james charley and his family.charley,an indian whose family lived on the parcel,died soon thereafter,and his wife moved the rest of the family away.one of charley sons,robert charley,may have lived at big lagoon between and,but the parcel otherwise appears to have remained vacant.later,in the late or early,robert nephew by marriage,thomas williams,and his family obtained the bia permission to camp on the land.though they did not have a claim of ownership,they apparently constructed a home there.
the williamses came to view the land as a rancheria eligible for termination under the california rancheria termination act,stat.they applied for dissolution of the rancheria a step that would have distributed the land to individual tribe members in.although approved,the dissolution never took place.
big lagoon rancheria first appeared on a list of indian tribal entities that have a government to government relationship with the united states in,and has appeared on many subsequent lists.the bia has held the parcel in trust for the tribe under since at least.
in,the bia took the parcel that is the focus of this appeal in trust for big lagoon rancheria.it is unclear exactly when the state of california became aware of the entrustment decision.but the state interests were plainly affected,and the state was plainly aware in,when it petitioned to intervene and subsequently filed two amicus briefs before the department of the interior board of indian appeals in a challenge to the bia decision.big lagoon park,acting sacramento area dir,bureau of indian affairs,ibia.moreover,california has by its own admission been aware of the entrustment and the potential for casino gambling on the parcel since,when the state began negotiating with big lagoon rancheria directly with respect to the parcel.
when negotiations to build the hotel and casino broke down in,big lagoon rancheria sued the state of california under the igra,alleging that california had failed to negotiate in good faith.in,as part of the litigation,the state questioned whether the lands on which big lagoon proposed to build its casino were indian lands over which big lagoon properly had jurisdiction to conduct gaming activities.
the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice as part of a settlement in when big lagoon rancheria and the state reached an agreement allowing the tribe to build a hotel and casino.that agreement,known as the barstow compact,lapsed in because the california legislature failed to ratify it.negotiations then began anew,but again failed,foundering principally because the state insisted on environmental mitigation measures related to the casino construction as well as a share of big lagoon rancheria revenue from gaming.throughout the course of the negotiations,the state proceeded on the assumption that it was obligated to negotiate in good faith under the igra.
big lagoon rancheria filed the instant suit in district court in,once again alleging under d a i that california had failed to negotiate in good faith.the tribe substantially prevailed when the district court declared that california had failed to negotiate in good faith and that the tribe was entitled to conduct gaming subject only to the secretary of the interior approval of a gaming compact.big lagoon rancheria california,d.the state of california appeals from the district court adverse grant of summary judgment,and also appeals the district court order refusing to grant a continuance to conduct additional discovery under.f now.d big lagoon rancheria,challenging the district court ruling that negotiation over environmental measures did not necessarily constitute bad faith by california 
california first argues that big lagoon rancheria lacks standing to compel it to negotiate in good faith under the igra because the bia entrustment decision was improper and because it is not properly recognized as an indian tribe.although the state frames these issue
