pursuant to.and,you asked the justices for their opinions regarding the proper construction of article ii,section of the delaware constitution in relation to your initiative to reinstitute a sports lottery.to assist you and the general assembly in fulfilling your respective constitutional duties to enact a balanced budget before the end of the fiscal year,we agreed to expedite our response.for the reasons that follow,we answer your question in part,but conclude that certain aspects of your question can not be answered on the current record.
in a march,letter to this court,providing a basic outline of the proposed sports lottery,you described the sports lottery as follows 
a the sports lottery would be under control of the state.specifically,the state would have the power and the duty to operate and administer the sports lottery and promulgate rules and regulations for that purpose.the state would control,among other things,the type and number of games to be conducted,the payouts from the sports lottery games,price or prices of tickets for any game,the licensing of agents for sports lotteries,the regulation of licensed agents,vendors and other persons involved in the sports lottery,advertising standards,and security arrangements.in general,the applicable elements of control exercised by the state over the video lottery pursuant to,et would be extended to the sports lottery.
b the sports lottery would be operated for the purpose of raising funds.specifically,my proposal would mandate that proceeds from the sports lottery,less amounts returned to winning players,be returned to the state at a rate of no less than of the total win.all amounts returned to the state for its use would be used for administration of the delaware lottery contributed to the general fund.
c the games offered by the sports lottery would be,at all times,lotteries within the meaning of that term in article ii,section.the games offered as part of a sports lottery would be structured so that,in every case,the outcome is determined by chance.to achieve that,games offered through the sports lottery would involve a line or a similar mechanism,the purpose of which would be to make the outcome of wagering on the winner of the contest a proposition and to ensure that approximately equal amounts of wagers accrue on each side of the game.for example,a line might be the predicted point spread between two teams.or,for total games,the line would be a number representing the total score for that game,and the player would select either the over more points than the line would be scored or the under less points than the line would be scored.using the line template to ensure that the game is decided by chance,the state lottery is contemplating one or more of the following games.
i single game lottery players must select the winning team in any given contest with a line.
ii total lottery players must select whether the total scoring in a game will be over or under the total line.
iii parlay lottery players must select the winning outcome on multiple elements,such as the winner of two or more games,the winner of two or more bets.
no game would offer a based on pool or wagering.
in your initial letter,you requested the justices opinions regarding the following question 
is the proposed delaware sports lottery,as described above,in whole or in part,a permissible lottery under state control under article ii,section of the delaware constitution of 
in a march,supplemental letter,you forwarded a copy of house bill,which was the enabling statute for the proposed sports lottery.
we appointed andre bouchard of bouchard,margules friedlander,to present an affirmative response and lawrence ashby of ashby geddes,to present a negative response to your question we also asked counsel to consider the following subsidiary issues that we concluded might affect our ability to answer your question 
may the justices,in their discretion,opine on the constitutionality of a proposed statute that has been introduced by the general assembly,but not yet passed 
if not,please reformulate the governor question and specify any factual limitations that would allow the justices to answer his request as fully as possible.please analyze the issue as reformulated.
if the justices may opine on the governor request as submitted,please address whether it is constitutionally permissible to delegate to the director of the state lottery the authority to provide for the features and attributes of any sports lottery games.in addition,please address whether there are any essential characteristics that any such games must possess to qualify as a permissible lottery under the constitution.
on april,members of the general assembly offered house substitute for house bill.although we expressed concern,in an april,letter,that the circumstances underlying your initial request for our opinions may have significantly changed and were in flux possibly mooting your initial request,we agreed to maintain the original briefing schedule.
the general assembly then passed house substitute to house bill,as amended,by the requisite majority,and you signed that legislation on may.that same day,you renewed your request for our opinions,informing us that you had instructed the department of finance and the delaware lottery office to begin implementing a sports lottery.you also reiterated the need for a timely response to enable you to work with the general assembly to craft and pass a balanced budget for fiscal year before june.
on may,we heard oral argument.in addition to hearing counsel for both sides of the issues,we allowed the national football league we had already allowed the nfl to submit a brief as amicus curiae to participate in the argument.
discussion 
when presented with a request for an opinion of the justices,the individual justices may give the governor their opinions in writing touching the proper construction of any provision in the constitution of this state,or the constitutionality of any law or legislation passed by the general assembly.it is well within the justices discretion to decide whether and to what extent to answer questions the governor presents because we are convinced that your questions touch upon the proper construction of article ii,section of the delaware constitution,we answer your questions to the extent possible,to better enable you and the general assembly to discharge your respective constitutional duties to present and enact a balanced budget.
the fact that you have already signed to does not prevent us from providing an advisory opinion.a contemplates an opinion about the constitutionality of any law as well as legislation passed but presumably as yet unsigned.for example,in the justices answered a question presented by governor du pont concerning legislation that he had already signed in that case,the justices recognized the governor need to commit funds and hire personnel.in,the justices similarly answered a question concerning legislation already signed by governor du pont because his request establishe d a need for an opinion due to present constitutional duties awaiting performance by the governor.
in your may,letter renewing your request for our opinions,you advised us that over the next several weeks,the state will begin working with the video lottery agents,potential vendors,and other interested parties to create a sports lottery.you also advised us of your view that the potential revenue generated by a sports lottery is an important component of constructing a balanced budget.therefore,it is clear that our opinions may assist you in committing funds,hiring personnel,and addressing the current budgetary situation.
to determine whether the proposed sports lottery,in whole or in part,constitutes a permissible lottery under article ii,section of the delaware constitution,we must address several subsidiary issues.they are whether the sports lottery will be under state control whether it is constitutionally permissible to delegate to the director of the state lottery the authority to provide for the features and attributes of the sports lottery whether lotteries,as permitted by the delaware constitution,must be games of pure chance or predominately chance and finally depending on our answers to those questions,whether the three specific games described in your original letter are constitutionally permissible.
the proposed sports lottery will be under state control 
article ii,section a of the delaware constitution permits l otteries under state control for the purpose of raising funds.here,we each conclude that the state will control all significant aspects of the sports lottery.as with the currently operating video lottery,the state lottery director will control the sports lottery.the lottery director will be responsible for determining the t ype and number of sports lottery games to be conducted,the price or prices for any sports lottery games,the rules for any sports lottery games,and the payout and manner of compensation to be paid to winners of sports lottery games.to requires the lottery director to administer the sports lottery in a manner which will produce the greatest income for the state while minimizing or eliminating the risk of financial loss to the state.
the lottery director will oversee the state purchasing or leasing of all sports lottery machines which shall appear exclusively at facilities operated by video lottery agents licensed by the state.as is the case with the video lottery proceeds,the lottery director will manage the daily or weekly transfer of the sports lottery proceeds to the state lottery fund 
the lottery director will also oversee the licensing of a risk manager,who must be a bookmaker currently licensed to operate,and operating,sports books in the united states.the risk manager may be an independent contractor and need not be a state employee.although the risk manager will be responsible for defining certain crucial aspects of the sports lottery,the state frequently hires outside experts without relinquishing its inherent control.we note that the state already contracts with outside entities in its control and operation of the video lottery 
for the above reasons,we conclude that the sports lottery satisfies the state control requirement found in article ii,section a of the delaware constitution.
to does not impermissibly delegate legislative power 
we further conclude that the sports lottery legislation does not impermissibly delegate legislature power to the lottery director.
the general assembly need not spell out every detail concerning the administration of a law a statute does not unlawfully delegate legislative power,if the statute establish es adequate standards and guidelines for the administration of the declared legislative policy and for the guidance and limitation of those in whom discretion has been vested.this nondelegation principle is intended to prevent arbitrary and capricious action,and to assure reasonable uniformity in the operation of the law.
we have previously recognized that t he preciseness of the statutory standards will vary with both the complexity of the area at which the legislation is directed and the susceptibility to change of the area in question.it also is well established that,at times,the general assembly may better achieve its legislative goals by deferring to an administrative agency greater skill and knowledge for example,the general assembly relies on the department of natural resources and environmental control to fix and regulate hunting seasons and bag limits as necessary to protect,manage and conserve all forms of protected wildlife of this state.
we conclude that to does not impermissibly delegate legislative powers to the lottery director.in that legislation,the general assembly established adequate standards and guidelines by requiring the lottery director to initiate a sports lottery governed by those rules and regulations that the lottery director believes will produce the greatest income for the state while minimizing or eliminating the risk of financial loss to the state.to explicitly defines a sports lottery as a lottery in which the winners are determined based on the outcome of any professional or collegiate event,including racing,held within or without the state,but excluding collegiate sporting events that involve a delaware college or university and amateur or professional sporting events that involve a delaware team.
in this case,the scope of the delegation is comparable to the scope of the authority delegated to the lottery director over existing state lotteries.in administering the video lottery,the lottery director is responsible for determining the t ype and number of games to be conducted,the p rice or prices of tickets for any game,the n umber and sizes of the prizes on the winning tickets,and the m anner of selecting the winning tickets.the general assembly reasonably deferred to the lottery director skill and knowledge in creating the specific sports lottery games,and no reasons are cited to us creating concern that the lottery director would exceed his authority or otherwise act in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
we,therefore,conclude that to does not impermissibly delegate legislative authority to the lottery director.
the delaware constitution permits lotteries involving an element of skill 
the next issue we must address is whether the fact that the sports lottery involves an element of skill precludes it from being a lottery authorized by the delaware constitution.
although article ii,section authorizes state controlled lotteries,the delaware constitution does not define the term lottery.we are fortunate,however,to have the benefit of analyses by two distinguished delaware jurists concerning the meaning of the term lottery.then delaware district court judge walter stapleton addressed this issue in national football league governor of the state of delaware,where the nfl sought injunctive relief barring delaware from conducting a lottery based on the nfl games judge stapleton found three elements necessary to a lottery prize,consideration and chance.for reasons discussed below,judge stapleton determined that lotteries,as permitted by the delaware constitution,need not be matters of pure chance rather,the element of chance may be accompanied by an element of calculation or even of certainty provided that chance is the dominant or controlling factor.
one year later,governor du pont asked the then three delaware supreme court justices for an advisory opinion addressing whether pool or parimutuel wagering on jai alai exhibitions constitutes a lottery under state control within the constitutional exception although chief justice herrmann and justice duffy did not address whether the delaware constitution authorizes lotteries that involve an element of skill,justice mcneilly explicitly adopted judge stapleton cogent analysis and lottery definition 
in our opinion,judge stapleton convincingly and correctly interpreted article ii,section.he described a split of authority concerning whether a lottery may incorporate an element of skill as follows 
under the english rule,a lottery consists in the distribution of money or other property by chance,and nothing but chance,that is,by doing that which is equivalent to drawing lots.if merit or skill play any part in determining the distribution,there is no lottery in the united states,however,by what appears to be the weight of authority at the present day,it is not necessary that this element of chance be pure chance,but it may be accompanied by an element of calculation or even of certainty it is sufficient if chance is the dominant or controlling factor.however,the rule that chance must be the dominant factor is to be taken in the qualitative or causative sense.
judge stapleton concluded that a bsent clear language in the constitution supporting a contrary rule,one should read article ii,section consistent with the majority,dominant factor rule although it is not without significance that a majority of jurisdictions in the united states apply the dominant factor rule,we find judge stapleton historical review of the delaware legislature interpretation of the term lottery entirely persuasive,independent of any jurisdictional headcount.
judge stapleton explained that,by two separate votes in and
