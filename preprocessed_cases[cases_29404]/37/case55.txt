the state of michigan,the intervenor in this litigation,appeals the april,order of the district court,declaring that it is permissible for the grand traverse band of ottawa and chippewa indians the band to conduct gaming at a site which is located off of the band initial reservation and which was acquired and placed in trust for the band after the enactment of the indian gaming regulatory act,et.igra,pursuant to an exception for such gaming on lands taken into trust as part of the restoration of lands for an indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition,b b iii.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the decision of the district court.
substantive facts 
the band is a federally recognized indian tribe presently maintaining a relationship with the united states.the band previously maintained a relationship with the united states from until,and is a successor to a series of treaties with the united states in,and.in,of the interior,columbus delano,improperly severed the relationship between the band and the united states,ceasing to treat the band as a federally recognized tribe.this occurred because the secretary had misread the treaty of detroit,stat.following termination of the relationship,the band experienced increasing poverty,loss of land base and depletion of the resources of its community.
between and,the band continually sought to regain its status as a federally recognized tribe.the band efforts succeeded in when it became the first tribe acknowledged by the secretary of the interior pursuant to the federal acknowledgment process,part now part.on january,the department of the interior declared a single acre parcel as the initial reservation of the band.the history of the band original recognition,executive termination and later is essentially parallel to that of the pokagon band of potawatomi indians,the little traverse bay bands of odawa indians,and the little river band of ottawa indians.all three tribes were parties to the same series of treaties and the same termination by secretary delano in.
on april,the band acquired title to a parcel of land in whitewater township,grand traverse county,michigan,that is commonly referred to as the turtle creek site.located on the east shore of grand traverse bay,turtle creek is at the heart of the region that comprised the core of the band aboriginal territory and was historically important to the economy and culture of the band.acquisition of the turtle creek site was important for the band to maintain a connection to the east shore region and to provide services and economic development to its members located on the east shore.although the turtle creek site is not located within or contiguous to the band last recognized reservation,it is within the lands that the band ceded to the united states by the treaty of.the trust application for the turtle creek site did not indicate that it was being acquired for gaming purposes,though it did specify that it may be used for future economic development.the site was placed into federal trust on august.
in august,the band entered into a gaming compact with the state of michigan pursuant to the igra,for class iii gaming on reservation lands.the compact is virtually identical to those signed between the state and six other indian tribes on the same day.the united states department of the interior approved the compact under the igra procedures.the michigan house of representatives and the michigan senate approved the compacts by concurrent resolution on september,and september,respectively.the compacts became effective on november,when the secretary of the interior published his approval of the compacts in the federal register.
on june,the national indian gaming commission approved the band gaming code pursuant to and.in accordance with the band gaming code,the grand traverse band gaming commission issued a license authorizing gaming at the turtle creek site.the band opened its turtle creek casino on june.the casino operations now employ hundreds of tribal members and fund hundreds of tribal government positions responsible for administering programs such as health care,elder care,child care,youth services,education,housing,economic development and law enforcement.
procedural history 
on june,the day the band commenced casino operations at turtle creek,it brought a declaratory judgment action against the attorney for the western district of michigan.the complaint sought a declaration concerning the legality of the class iii gaming being conducted at turtle creek.the united states filed a counterclaim,seeking to declare the turtle creek facility illegal and to enjoin further gaming at the facility.the state of michigan was permitted to intervene as a defendant and to file a complaint seeking to declare the operations illegal under the compact.
the state contended that the turtle creek casino operation is illegal because the igra,bars casino gaming on tribal lands taken into trust after october,which is the case with turtle creek,unless the land meets one of the exceptions set forth in.the state argued that turtle creek does not meet any of the exceptions,and,consequently,gaming is unlawful,absent a determination by the secretary of the interior and the consent of the governor of michigan,that the casino would be in the best interests of the tribe and its members and would not be detrimental to the surrounding community.the band has not sought such a determination from the secretary,nor the consent of the governor,insisting that the turtle creek location satisfies one of the exceptions.
the band original complaint asserted that the gaming prohibition contained in does not apply when a tribe has a valid compact.following the decision of this court in keweenaw bay indian community united states,cir,the band abandoned this claim,amended its complaint,and asserted that the turtle creek site is within or contiguous to the boundaries of the reservation of the indian tribe on october,pursuant to a,and thus was exempted from the prohibition against gaming.the united states then moved for a preliminary injunction against continued gaming operations at turtle creek.in response,the band proffered additional theories to support its exemption from the prohibition the turtle creek land is exempt because it had been taken into trust as part of the initial reservation of an indian tribe acknowledged by the secretary of interior,pursuant to b b ii and the land is exempt because it constituted part of the restoration of lands for an indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition pursuant to b b iii.
on march,the district court denied the united states motion in a published opinion.see grand traverse band of ottawa chippewa indians united states attorney for the dist.of,d grand traverse band i.the district court held that the government had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success in proving that the turtle creek land does not satisfy the restoration of lands exemption,b b iii.id.at.the district court further stayed the litigation,pending a reference of the matter to the national indian gaming commission nigc.id.at.the court found that it could benefit from the nigc determination of both factual and legal issues relating to the application of the restoration of lands exception.id.at.the state appealed the district court denial of the preliminary injunction,but this court dismissed the appeal because the state,as an intervenor,had not joined with the united states motion for preliminary injunction,and therefore lacked standing to pursue the appeal.see grand traverse band of ottawa chippewa indians office of the attorney for the dist.of,cir.may.
on august,kevin washburn,general counsel for the nigc,sent the district court a letter regarding whether the turtle creek site is exempt from the prohibition against gaming for lands acquired after the effective date of the igra.the nigc found that the turtle creek site is exempt from the prohibition pursuant to the exception for lands that are taken into trust as part of the restoration of lands for an indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition.b b iii.to reach this conclusion,the nigc answered two questions whether the band became an indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition when the secretary of the interior invoked an administrative process to formally acknowledge the tribe in and whether the turtle creek lands were taken into trust as part of the restoration of lands for the band.in answering both questions in the affirmative,the nigc reasoned as follows 
the band had a relationship with the united states until at which time bia officers improperly terminated the federal trust relationship by administrative action.the clear import of acknowledgment of the band under federal acknowledgment procedures was to undo the effect of the improper administrative action and to resume a proper relationship between the band and the federal government.the result was restoration under the plain meaning of that term.accordingly,it is difficult to argue that the band is not a restored tribe if the term should be interpreted according to its plain meaning the band has assembled substantial evidence tending to establish that the turtle creek site has been important to the tribe throughout its history and remained so immediately on resumption of federal recognition the site is within the area ceded to the united states by the ancestors of the present band the region surrounding the casino site also has a modern nexus to the tribe.it is located within the service area for which tribal members are entitled to receive services by the bia at the time of termination,band members lived not far from the turtle creek site.for most of the band recorded history,it has lived and worked in this general area in light of this showing of continuous interest in the area,the band has regained beneficial title to land that it may have ceded but did not abandon.in regaining its beneficial use the fee being held by the united states to land that has been at the heart of the band culture throughout history and particularly within the context of its restoration process,the nigc believes that the turtle creek site constitutes land that has been not merely obtained but,in some sense,restored to the band under section b b iii.
the department of the interior subsequently concurred with the nigc opinion.
as a consequence of this administrative opinion,the united states abandoned its opposition to the turtle creek casino and withdrew from the litigation.the district court then permitted the band to amend its complaint for a second time,to reflect that the only issues that remained for trial were whether the turtle creek site satisfied the restoration of lands exception and whether the compact afforded the governor of michigan with an absolute veto power over the siting of a casino at turtle creek.
a bench trial was held in january.on april,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order in which it held that the turtle creek site was subject to the restoration of lands exception.grand traverse ii,supra.the court noted,and the parties agreed,that the nigc finding that the restoration of lands exception applied to the turtle creek site was not entitled to the highest level of deference accorded to an administrative agency because the nigc had not employed formal adjudicatory procedures.grand traverse band ii,d at holding that nigc opinion was not entitled to deference per chevron,natural resources defense council,d.nevertheless,the court gave such deference to the nigc opinion as it deemed appropriate in light of the thoroughness,reasoning and consistency of its determination.id.at citing united states mead,d.the court deemed it appropriate to afford the nigc opinion substantial weight and found no reasonable basis for altering its conclusion that the band is a restored tribe within the meaning of the igra.id.
the court then independently examined whether the turtle creek site is exempt from the prohibition pursuant to the exception for lands that are taken into trust as part of the restoration of lands for an indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition under b b iii.as the nigc had done,the court broke this question into two parts first,whether the band is a restored tribe and second,whether the acquisition of turtle creek is part of a restoration of lands.
the court found that the words restored and restoration in the statutory exception were not defined in the igra,and therefore it looked to the plain meaning of the words.grand traverse band ii,d at.the court noted that the dictionary definition of restore includes the following meanings to give back as something lost or taken away,make restitution of,return,to put or bring back as into existence or use and to bring back or put back into a former or original state.id.citing webster new third new int l dictionary.the court also looked to the dictionary definition of restoration,which includes the following meanings an act of restoring or the condition or fact of being restored as bringing back to or putting back in to a former position or conditions,reinstatement,renewal,or reestablishment.id.citing webster at.the court then held that the band clearly was a restored tribe under a plain meaning interpretation 
t he undisputed history of the band treaties with the united states and its prior relationship to the secretary and the bia demonstrates that the band was recognized and treated with by the united states.both prior to and after such treaties,until,the band was dealt with by the secretary as a recognized tribe.only in was that relationship administratively terminated by the bia.this history of recognition by congress through treaties and historical administration by the secretary,subsequent withdrawal of recognition,and yet later by the secretary fits squarely within the dictionary definitions of restore and is reasonably construed as a process of restoration of tribal recognition.the plain language of subsection b b iii therefore suggests that this band is restored.
having found in favor of the band on the first question whether the band was a tribe restored to federal recognition,the district court proceeded to address the second question whether the turtle creek site was acquired as part of a restoration of lands.the court ruled in favor of the band on this question as well.id.at.the court further rejected the state assertion that gaming is barred by section c of the compact,which allegedly gives the governor of michigan absolute veto power over gaming activities on lands taken into trust for the band.id.at.the court held that the plain language of the compact merely incorporated by reference the governor concurrence power pursuant to,and therefore the governor had no greater veto power than that vested by.id.at.
based on the foregoing,the district court concluded that gaming is permissible at the turtle creek site pursuant to b b iii the restoration of lands exception.the court entered judgment in favor of the band on april.id.at.the state filed a timely appeal.
in this appeal,the state has not contested the district court ruling that the acquisition of turtle creek was part of a restoration of lands.accordingly,the sole issue for this court is whether the band is a tribe restored to federal recognition.like the district court below,we answer this question in the affirmative.
section of the indian gaming regulatory act igra,generally prohibits gaming on lands acquired by the secretary of the interior in trust for an indian tribe after october,unless an exception is satisfied.that section states,in relevant part 
a prohibition on lands acquired in trust by secretary 
except as provided in subsection b of this section,gaming regulated by this chapter shall not be conducted on lands acquired by the secretary in trust for the benefit of an indian tribe after october,unless 
such lands are located within or contiguous to the boundaries of the reservation of the indian tribe on october,or 
the indian tribe has no reservation on october,and 
b such lands are located in a state other than oklahoma and are within the indian tribe last recognized reservation within the state or states within which such indian tribe is presently located.
b exceptions 
subsection a of this section will not apply when 
a the secretary,after consultation with the indian tribe and appropriate state and local officials,including officials of other nearby indian tribes,determines that a gaming establishment on newly acquired lands would be in the best interest of the indian tribe and its members,and would not be detrimental to the surrounding community,but only if the governor of the state in which the gaming activity is to be conducted concurs in the secretary determination or 
b lands are taken into trust as part of 
i a settlement of a land claim,
ii the initial reservation of an indian tribe acknowledged by the secretary under the federal acknowledgment process,or 
iii the restoration of lands for an indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition.
the igra does not define the words restored and restoration in the restoration of lands exception set forth at b b iii.therefore,this court must give the words their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import.williams taylor,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted referring to webster dictionary definitions to determine the meaning of a statutory term.the district court appropriately looked to the dictionary definitions of restore and restoration,which include the following meanings to give back,return,make restitution,reinstatement,renewal,and reestablishment.grand traverse band ii,d at citing webster at.the court then correctly held that the band clearly was a restored tribe under these definitions.the band had treaties with the united states and a prior relationship with the secretary of the interior at least as far back as.until,the secretary had treated the band as a recognized tribe.as the state concedes,the united states unilaterally ceased to treat the band as a tribe commencing in,when secretary of the interior columbus delano improperly severed the relationship between the united states and the band.in,the secretary finally the relationship through the administrative acknowledgment process.as the district court concluded,this history of governmental recognition,withdrawal of recognition,and then reinstatement of recognition fits squarely within the dictionary definitions of restore and is reasonably construed as a process of restoration of tribal recognition.grand traverse ii,d at.thus,we hold that the band is a tribe restored to federal recognition under the plain language of b b iii.
the state attempts to evade the plain language of the restoration of lands exception by arguing that the term restoration has a distinct meaning when applied to indian tribes and their trust status with the federal meaning that precludes tribes like the band from constituting a restored tribe when it has been administratively through the acknowledgment process.the state argues that indian tribes inherently possess sovereignty,subject only to the plenary powers,and trust obligations,of the united states.the state further argues that an indian tribe trust relationship with the united states,once established by congress,can be extinguished only by congressional action and not by administrative action of the secretary of the interior.moreover,when congress has terminated that trust relationship,only congress can restore it the secretary of the interior has no power to restore trust status administratively through the acknowledgment process.the state points to a federal regulation providing that groups which are,or the members of which are,subject to congressional legislation terminating or forbidding the federal relationship may not be acknowledged by the secretary.e.
the band counters that a termination of tribal recognition can occur not only through congressional legislation but also through a complete refusal of the federal government,which includes the executive branch,to treat the band as a tribe.thus,in and for the next hundred years,during which the secretary of the interior erroneously refused to treat the band as a tribe,the band suffered a de facto termination of the trust relationship,even though only congress legally could terminate that relationship.since the executive branch effectively could terminate the trust relationship,it also could restore it,which is what the acknowledgment process accomplished.
to support its view that the power to terminate the trust relationship of a tribe lies exclusively with congress,the state cites the first circuit decision in joint tribal council of the passamaquoddy tribe morton,cir.in that case,the federal government argued,among other things,that the passamaquoddy tribe was equitably precluded from invoking the trust relationship purportedly established by congress through the indian nonintercourse act.the court rejected this argument,holding that once congress has established a trust relationship with an indian tribe,congress alone has the right to determine when its guardianship shall cease.id.at citing united states nice.tiger investment.the tribe simply did not have the power to terminate the relationship.id.the unremarkable holding in passamaquoddy,however,is irrelevant to the instant case.there is no dispute that only congress had the legal right to terminate the band recognition because congress originally had recognized the band.but the relevant question is whether a termination nevertheless took place because the executive branch of the government illegally acted as if the band recognition had been terminated,as evidenced by its refusal to carry out any trust obligations for over one hundred years.
a prominent treatise on federal indian law states that federal recognition of a tribe requires a legal basis for recognition congressional or executive action and the empirical indicia of recognition,namely,a continuing political relationship with the group,such as by providing services through the bureau of indian affairs.cohen,handbook of federal indian law.the first circuit adopted professor cohen test for tribal recognition in mashpee tribe sec y of the interior,cir breyer.see also shoshone bus.council babbitt,cir historically,the federal government has treated a tribe as recognized if congress or the president has created a reservation for the group and the united states has a continuing political relationship with the group.citing cohen,supra,at.the implication of professor cohen test,which we adopt today,is that the empirical acts that are tantamount to the termination of tribal recognition are analytically distinct from the legality of those acts,just as the empirical act of terminating an individual employment,being told to leave the workplace and never to return is distinct from the legality of that act,a breach of contract.
once tribal recognition is understood as having both legal and empirical elements,it becomes clear that the state argument must fail.the state has conceded that t he united states unilaterally ceased to treat the band as a tribe commencing in,when secretary of the interior columbus delano improperly severed the relationship between the united states and the band.in other words,acting through the secretary of the interior,the federal government terminated the political relationship with the group,in particular,the provision of services.because the department of interior refused to recognize the band as a political entity,the band experienced increasing poverty,loss of land base and depletion of the resources of its community,particularly when compared to those tribes that appeared on the department of interior list of federally recognized tribes.grand traverse band ii,d at.thus,the undisputed facts show that the federal government withdrew the band recognition in under the second factor of the cohen test 
since the secretary of the interior had the power to terminate the band federal recognition,he also had the power to restore that recognition.that is exactly what the secretary did in through the acknowledgment process,which applies only to those american indian groups indigenous to the continental united states which are not currently acknowledged as indian tribes by the department of the interior and who have not been subject to federal legislation t
