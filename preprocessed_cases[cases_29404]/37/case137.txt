background 
double eagle operates a hotel and casino in cripple creek,colorado.in the casino,two types of employees interact with the customers playing slot machines slot technicians and security officers.the slot technicians oversee the operation of the machines,including repairs,while the security officers are in charge of policing the slot area.each type of employee receives tips from customers and are required by casino policy to share these tips.the manner for sharing tips between slot technicians and security officers is the foundation of the dispute leading to this proceeding.
prior to may,all tips were pooled with half the tips going to slot technicians and the other half to security officers.because the slot technicians outnumbered the security officers,a slot technician share of the tip pool was smaller than a security officer share.on may,in response to complaints from the slot technicians,double eagle changed its policy.under the new policy,tips were not first divided between the different groups of employees.instead,each slot technician and security officer received an equal share of the total tip pool.
by october,the relative number of slot technicians and security officers had shifted.because the security officers now outnumbered the slot technicians,the slot technicians sought to revert to the original policy so that they could receive a larger share of the tips.this created friction between the two groups of employees,and as a result,double eagle management orally issued a rule prohibiting discussion of the policy.after a number of incidents in which the slot technicians expressed their dissatisfaction over the policy,including one in which a slot technician violated the tip rule,one technician was fired and two others were suspended.alleging violations of the nlra,the employees union,international brotherhood of electrical workers,local,initiated administrative proceedings against double eagle.
although the administrative law judge alj found that double eagle committed numerous violations of the nlra,we limit our discussion to the few issues that double eagle raises in its petition for review the alj held that the tips rule violated a of the nlra as a result,the alj held that the employees who were disciplined for violating this rule had been unlawfully punished.the alj also ordered double eagle to cease and desist from maintaining a rule prohibiting discussion of the policy on the casino floor and to offer reinstatement and back pay to the disciplined employees.double eagle appealed this order and the board affirmed on these issues.the board further held that double eagle customer service,confidential information,and communication rules violated a.double eagle timely petitions for review of the board decision and the nlrb for enforcement of the order.

customer service rule 
we begin our review by discussing a rule maintained by double eagle entitled customer service,as the analysis is relevant to our discussion of the tips rule.the customer service rule,contained in double eagle employee handbook,states 
never discuss company issues,other employees,and personal problems to or around our guests.be aware that having a conversation in public areas with another employee will in all probability be overheard.
the board held that this rule overly restricted the employees ability to discuss issues and therefore violated a.double eagle petitions for review of this holding,arguing that the board erred because it misinterpreted the scope of its rule.
the board began its analysis of the customer service rule by recognizing that a rule like the one at issue here,which prohibits employees from discussing working conditions,is viewed by the board as analogous to a rule for purposes of considering its legality.double eagle hotel casino and int l brotherhood of electrical workers,local,at,wl.the right to solicit employees to join the union is guaranteed by because could not occur without the ability to solicit.the right to solicit,however,is not absolute.as the ninth circuit has recognized,the right of employees to solicit or distribute materials must be balanced against an employer right to maintain discipline in its establishment.silver spur casino,cir citing republic aviation.
in beth israel hospital,d,the supreme court discussed how this balancing occurs in retail industries 
in the retail marketing and restaurant industries,the primary purpose of the operation is to serve customers,and this is done on the selling floor of a store or in the dining area of a restaurant.employee solicitation in these areas,if disruptive,necessarily would directly and substantially interfere with the employer business.on the other hand,it would be an unusual store or restaurant which did not have stockrooms,kitchens,and other nonpublic areas,and in those areas employee solicitation of nonworking employees must be permitted.
id.at.based on this reasoning,the ninth circuit held in silver spur that a it found more akin to a retail than prohibit solicitation in its gambling area,restaurant,and bar.at.
upon determining that the customer service rule should be treated as a rule,the board held that double eagle lawfully could prohibit employees from soliciting each other and discussing their working conditions in the casino gambling areas,and adjacent aisles and corridors frequented by customers,but it could not maintain a general ban on that activity beyond that area.at.double eagle does not dispute this interpretation of the nlra instead,it contends that its customer service rule complies with this requirement and that the board erred in interpreting its rule more broadly.
the board interpreted the customer service rule to prohibit discussion in public areas.thus,for example,the rule would bar discussions in such public areas as parking lots and restrooms.id.because the prohibition on discussing issues was not limited to the gaming floor and adjacent corridors,the board held that the rule was overly broad and therefore violated a.
double eagle objects to the board interpretation of this rule because the rule does not state that employees can not discuss company issues in public areas.the term public areas appears only in the second sentence of the rule,and this second sentence does not prohibit any merely cautions employees that guests will likely overhear any conversation held in public areas.the rule properly interpreted,double eagle argues,does not prohibit all discussion of company issues in public areas because the employees can discuss issues when guests are not around.
double eagle interpretation is more consistent with the text of the rule.nonetheless,even under this interpretation,the rule violates a.the rule first sentence,which prohibits discussion of company issues,contains nothing to limit the scope of its application.under this rule,the presence of a single guest can transform an area in which employees have a right to discuss work conditions,such as the parking lot or break room,into a place where discussion is prohibited.while existing case law permits a casino to limit employees discussions on the gaming floor,see,silver spur,at,no court has interpreted the nlra to permit an employer to adopt a rule that follows each of its customers.we therefore hold that even accepting double eagle interpretation of its customer service rule,the rule is unlawfully broad.
double eagle also argues that the board erred in holding its unwritten rule prohibiting discussion of the policy violated a.double eagle contends that its rule is lawful because it only prohibits discussion of the policy on the casino floor,not in other areas.the board opinion did not discuss the tips rule instead,it simply adopted the reasoning given by the alj.see at for the reasons set forth by the judge,we agree with the judge that the respondent oral rule,proscribing the discussion of tips and its tip policy anywhere on the respondent property,is overly broad and unlawful.we therefore look to the alj decision to review this issue.
double eagle argued before the alj that the tips rule only prohibited discussion of the policy on the casino floor and that this rule was necessary to avoid disrupting its customers.the alj rejected these arguments.the judge found that the tips rule was not limited to the gaming floor but was,anywhere on company property.double eagle hotel casino and int l brotherhood of electrical workers,local,and,slip op.at,wl div.of judges.additionally,the judge held that even if the rule was simply limited to the gaming floor the rule would be unlawful.id.
in arriving at this conclusion,the alj acknowledged that existing precedent permitted a casino to prohibit solicitation on the gaming floor.the judge,however,relied on cases recognizing a distinction between talking and solicitation.id.quoting grainger,wl.based on this distinction,the alj concluded that prohibit ing employees from discussing matters pertaining to unionization while on duty,but allowing discussion of other matters,violates section a.id.citing teledyne advanced materials,wl.thus,the alj rejected analyzing the tips rule under the case law and held that double eagle could not prohibit discussion of the policy at all.
we disagree.the rule legality must be considered in the context of,as opposed to,precedent.to begin,we note that the customer service first rule discussed properly treated by the board as a rule because it prohibit ed employees from discussing working conditions.at.the tips rule is identical in this prohibits employees from discussing a policy that directly affects their income.we also note that both parties rely on cases in addressing the rule.
moreover,the cases relied on by the alj arose in a context,whereas a casino is more appropriately considered a retail environment.see silver spur,at.we think the distinction between the two contexts is important for the following reasons.as discussed above,when considering rules which restrict employees rights,employees right to must be balanced against the employer right to operate its business.see republic aviation.in work areas where no customers are present,the employees productivity is of primary concern.consequently,an employer may implement rules against solicitation during work hours to prevent interference with work productivity.stores,cir.
when worker productivity is the primary concern,rules should be distinguished from rules.see id.quoting grainger.such a distinction is sensible because discussion of union activities is often less disruptive than solicitation and therefore has a less significant impact on worker productivity.the board decisions also properly recognize that employees discussions can adversely affect productivity and therefore may be limited.indeed,an employer may adopt a rule however,the rule must apply to all topics,not simply those related to the job.see teledyne advanced materials,at it is well established that an employer violates section a when,as here,employees are forbidden to discuss unionization while working,but are free to discuss other subjects unrelated to work.this rule prohibits an employer from discriminating against union discussions under the pretext of increasing worker productivity.if worker productivity is really the concern,then all discussions should be prohibited because these topics all interfere with the employees work equally.
in restaurants,bars,casinos,and other retail stores,however,the employer interest is not limited to productivity,but also includes the treatment of its customers.beth israel,at.in the retail marketing and restaurant industries,the primary purpose of the operation is to serve the customer.as a result,e mployee solicitation on the selling floor of a store or in the dining area of a restaurant,if disruptive,necessarily would directly and substantially interfere with the employer business.id.therefore,when the enjoyment of the customer is at it is in the retail and service is less of a reason to treat solicitation and discussion differently because both could prove equally disruptive to the customer.consequently,the board decisions treat and rules identically in this context.see,aroostook county regional ophthalmology,wl treating a rule that prohibited discussion of grievances within earshot of patients as a rule.because the tips rule was adopted in a retail setting for the purpose of preventing discussion of working conditions around customers,we conclude that the tips rule must be considered under the same legal standard as the customer service rule.thus,contrary to the alj conclusion,double eagle can maintain its tips rule so long as it is limited to the casino gambling area,and adjacent aisles and corridors frequented by customers.
double eagle contends that the rule was so limited,and that it merely stated that employees could not discuss while on the casino floor.the alj,however,found that the tips rule prohibited discussion of the policy anywhere on the premises.double eagle therefore argues that the board,by adopting the alj decision,erred in finding that the rule extended beyond the casino floor and that it could not maintain its tips rule limited in this way.
whether the tips rule applied only on the casino floor or more broadly is a question of fact.we therefore review the record to determine whether the board finding is supported by substantial evidence.see e interstate builders,cir.no fewer than four employees testified before the alj that the tips rule extended beyond the casino floor.see tr.at we were told that we could discuss tips on the floor,in the break room,locker room,anywhere.testimony of carol marthaler id.at employees could not discuss the policy on t he gaming floor,break room,or bathrooms.testimony of betty ingerling id.at you were not to talk about tips on the premises.testimony of lowell moses id.at we were not to discuss the policy on the floor,break room,out back in our smoking area,anyplace within the building.testimony of larry custer.
although there was also testimony to the contrary,the substantial evidence standard of review does not permit us to question the board balancing of this conflicting evidence.see four b,at.the board conclusion that the tips rule applied beyond the casino floor is supported by substantial evidence and therefore we accept this factual finding.thus,because we interpret a to prohibit a rule of this breadth,we deny double eagle petition on this issue.
although we hold that the tips rule violated a,we must exercise our authority to modify the board order.see f granting courts of appeals jurisdic
