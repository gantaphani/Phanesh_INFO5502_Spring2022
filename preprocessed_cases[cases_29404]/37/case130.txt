background 
a.the indian gaming regulatory act igra 
in california cabazon band of mission indians,d,the supreme court invalidated an attempt by california to enforce california penal code the bingo statute against tribes that operated bingo halls.the supreme court characterized the bingo statute as regulatory,rather than criminal,and held that public law prohibited the enforcement of state regulatory statutes against indian tribes 
i f the intent of a state law is generally to prohibit certain conduct,it falls within pub.grant of criminal jurisdiction,but if the state law generally permits the conduct at issue,subject to regulation,it must be classified as and pub.does not authorize its enforcement on an indian reservation.
cabazon,at.because california permitted a substantial amount of gaming activity,including bingo,the bingo statute could not be characterized as criminal or prohibitory and therefore could not be enforced on indian lands.
as a response to the cabazon decision,congress enacted igra as a means of granting states some role in the regulation of indian gaming.as noted in the opinion below,
igra was congress compromise solution to the difficult questions involving indian gaming.the act was passed in order to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments and to shield tribal gaming from organized crime and other corrupting influences to ensure that the indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation.igra is an example of cooperative federalism in that it seeks to balance the competing sovereign interests of the federal government,state governments,and indian tribes,by giving each a role in the regulatory scheme.
artichoke joe norton,d,alteration in original.
igra creates three classes of gaming,each of which is subject to a different level of regulation.class i gaming covers social games solely for prizes of minimal value or traditional forms of indian gaming engaged in by individuals as part of,or in connection with,tribal ceremonies or celebrations.class ii gaming includes bingo and card games that are explicitly authorized by a state or not explicitly prohibited by the laws of the state and are legally played at any location in the state.id.a ii.class ii gaming specifically excludes banked card games and slot machines 
at issue in this case is class iii gaming,the most heavily regulated and most controversial form of gambling under igra.class iii gaming includes all forms of gaming that are not class i gaming or class ii gaming.id.it includes the types of games usually associated with gambling,as well as slot machines and parimutuel.class iii gaming is lawful on indian lands only if three conditions are satisfied authorization by an ordinance or resolution of the governing body of the indian tribe and the chair of the national indian gaming commission nigc location in a state that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person,organization,or entity and the existence of a compact approved by the secretary of the interior.id.d.
igra compacting requirement allows states to negotiate with tribes that are located within their borders regarding aspects of class iii indian gaming that might affect legitimate state interests.id.d c.the compacting process gives to states civil regulatory authority that they otherwise would lack under cabazon,while granting to tribes the ability to offer legal class iii gaming.keweenaw bay indian cmty.united states,cir.igra also imposes on states an obligation to conduct compact negotiations in good faith,d a,and allows tribes to enforce that obligation in federal court,id.d a 
california regulation of indian gaming under igra 
after the enactment of igra,certain indian tribes in california sought to negotiate compacts with the state to permit the operation of class iii gaming on their reservations.the class iii games over which the tribes sought to banked or percentage card games and electronic gaming machines similar to slot machines were not permitted under california law.see code.however,california did allow other forms of class iii gaming,such as nonelectronic keno and lotto.rumsey indian rancheria of wintun indians wilson,cir.
during the administration of governor pete wilson,california refused to negotiate with tribes with respect to the forms of gaming that they sought to conduct.because the state did not permit live banked or percentage card games or slot devices,it took the view that it had no obligation to negotiate with respect to those games or devices.the tribes argued that,because the state permitted other types of class iii games,it could not refuse to negotiate over a particular subset of class iii games.see mashantucket pequot tribe connecticut,cir agreeing with the tribe position.in rumsey,this court rejected the tribes view,holding that 
igra does not require a state to negotiate over one form of class iii gaming activity simply because it has legalized another,albeit similar form of gaming.instead,the statute says only that,if a state allows a gaming activity for any purpose by any person,organization,or entity,then it also must allow indian tribes to engage in that same activity.d b.in other words,a state need only allow indian tribes to operate games that others can operate,but need not give tribes what others can not have.
the rumsey decision meant that the state of california had no obligation under federal law to negotiate with the tribes over the class iii gaming that the tribes wanted to operate.the tribes thus resorted to california initiative process to impose a obligation on california to negotiate class iii gaming compacts.a coalition of california tribes drafted proposition,which required the state to enter into a model class iii gaming compact covering banked card games and slot machines.the proposition required the governor to execute compacts within days after any federally recognized indian tribe requested such an arrangement.if the governor took no action within days,the compacts were deemed approved.flynt cal.gambling control comm n,th,d,cert.denied,d cal.gov t code.proposition also contained a provision waiving california sovereign immunity to suits brought under igra.see id.
after the passage of proposition on the november ballot,the hotel employees and restaurant employees international union filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the california supreme court,seeking to prevent the governor from implementing the proposition.the union alleged that proposition violated article vi,section e of the california constitution,which states that the legislature has no power to authorize,and shall prohibit casinos of the type currently operating in nevada and new jersey.the california supreme court agreed with the union and issued a peremptory writ of mandate,preventing the governor from implementing proposition.hotel employees rest.employees int l union davis,cal th,d.
before the california supreme court ruled in hotel employees,governor gray davis took office and sought to negotiate class iii gaming compacts with several indian tribes in california.however,once the california supreme court issued its ruling,the state no longer had authority to execute the compacts.to address this problem,the davis administration proposed an amendment to the california constitution that would exempt indian tribes from the state constitutional prohibition on class iii gaming.the davis administration and various indian tribes continued to negotiate compacts,adding a provision that conditioned execution of the compacts on ratification of the proposed state constitutional amendment.in september of,the governor concluded compacts with indian tribes.the california legislature quickly ratified all compacts.artichoke joe,d at.
in march of,california voters ratified proposition,amending the california constitution to provide 
notwithstanding subdivisions a and e,and any other provision of state law,the governor is authorized to negotiate and conclude compacts,subject to ratification by the legislature,for the operation of slot machines and for the conduct of lottery games and banking and percentage card games by federally recognized indian tribes on indian lands in california in accordance with federal law.accordingly,slot machines,lottery games,and banking and percentage card games are hereby permitted to be conducted and operated on tribal lands subject to those compacts.

the compacts create a unique opportunity for each tribe to operate its gaming facility in an economic environment free of competition from the class iii gaming on lands in california.compact between the state of california and the augustine band of mission indians,pmbl.e.the compacts condition the operation of class iii gaming facilities on tribes agreeing to certain arrangements and paying into a special distribution fund,which is used by certain state agencies to cover expenses related to indian gaming.since the original compacts took effect,additional compacts have been entered into by the governor and approved by the secretary.artichoke joe,d at.at present,of the tribes with compacts operate casinos with slot machines.casinos have become the main source of revenue for indian tribes in california.some california tribes are still without compacts,however.id.
district court proceedings 
under proposition,indian tribes are the only entities that are permitted to conduct class iii gaming in california.california law does not bar gaming altogether,however.games,such as poker,are permitted in card rooms that generally charge membership fees or hourly rates.also,california allows charities to engage in bingo for fundraising.who are currently conducting gaming operations within those this action to challenge the indians exclusive right to conduct class iii gaming.plaintiffs gaming operations are not nearly as lucrative as the gaming allowed to tribes.plaintiffs allege that allowing only indians to conduct casino gaming violates igra and plaintiffs right to equal protection under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.
plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief on four counts of their complaint.count one charged the federal defendants,namely,the secretary and assistant secretary of the interior,with violating igra and the fifth amendment guarantee of equal protection by approving california compacts 
count two sought similar relief under against governor gray davis,the director of the california division of gambling control,and the chair and members of the california gambling control commission.plaintiffs alleged that proposition and the compacts violate both igra and the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.plaintiffs sought to invalidate the current compacts and to bar the governor from entering into any future compacts prospective compacts.count three also targeted prospective compacts plaintiffs sought to enjoin the state defendants from passing legislation thought to precede a compact with the lytton band,a tribe that plaintiffs expected would build a casino near san francisco.
finally,in count four,plaintiffs sought to enjoin california attorney general,the director of the california division of gambling control,and the chair and members of the california gambling control commission from prosecuting plaintiffs under the relevant sections of the penal code that proscribe gaming,so long as the compacts remain in effect.
the district court held that it had jurisdiction to resolve the claims against the federal defendants,the claims against the governor related to existing compacts,and the claims against the state attorney general and the director of the california division of gambling control as to the enforcement of state gaming laws against plaintiffs.artichoke joe,d at.however,the court dismissed count three and plaintiffs other claims as to the prospective compacts on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that they faced an immediate and imminent threat of harm from the prospective compacts.id.at.the court also dismissed the california gambling control commission from counts two and four,finding that plaintiffs had not demonstrated that the threat of enforcement was fairly traceable to the commission 
on the merits,the district court determined that proposition satisfies igra requirement that a state permit class iii gaming for any purpose,by any person,organization,or entity.id.at.the court went on to decide that granting indian tribes a monopoly on class iii gaming does not violate the fifth or the fourteenth amendment guarantee of equal protection.id.at.the district court therefore granted defendants motion for summary judgment id.at.

statutory text 
the parties dispute the proper construction of d b,which provides that c lass iii gaming activities shall be lawful on indian lands only if such activities are b located in a state that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person,organization,or entity.construing this provision involves two separate but related questions of interpretation.first,we must decide whether proposition,which permits class iii gaming only on indian lands,is consistent with d b requirement that a state be one that permits such gaming before a class iii gaming compact may take effect.then we must decide whether any person,organization,or entity should be read to exclude indian tribes.to resolve these questions,we examine the text both in isolation and in the context of the statute as a whole.
a permits such gaming 
in construing the phrase permits such gaming in d b,we are mindful of cases that characterize as patent bootstrapping the notion that a compact can satisfy both the permits such gaming requirement under d b and the compact requirement under d c.see citizen band potawatomi indian tribe of green,cir holding that a compact allowing the importation of gambling devices onto a tribe lands violated the johnson act because,standing alone,the compact could not satisfy d b permits such gaming requirement united states santa ynez band of chumash mission indians of santa ynez reservation,d describing games that are illegal under state law as uncompactable.however,proposition distinguishes the present controversy from the bootstrapping cases.proposition does more than authorize the governor to enter into compacts.it explicitly states that slot machines,lottery games,and banking and percentage card games are hereby permitted to be conducted and operated on tribal lands subject to the regulations embodied in the compact.proposition emphasis added.thus,there is from the compact permits such gaming in certain circumstances.d b.
plaintiffs argue that,because california has no authority to permit gaming on indian lands under cabazon,permits such gaming can refer only to the state ability to regulate gaming operations conducted on lands.when enacting igra,plaintiffs contend,congress would have known that the state,acting alone,could not permit class iii gaming on indian lands and,thus,that a state law providing for class iii gaming conducted only by indian tribes on indian lands could not satisfy the requirement of d b.this argument is plausible but does not foreclose an alternative understanding of the verb permit,for three reasons under cabazon,california did not lack jurisdiction to apply its prohibition on class iii gaming on indian lands before igra was enacted at the same time congress passed igra,it gave california the regulatory authority that cabazon took away,and we have not construed igra use of the word permit to require a legally binding affirmative act,see rumsey,at.
under cabazon,the supreme court applied the general rule that a state has jurisdiction over indian lands only if congress has explicitly ceded that jurisdiction.at.but see id.at.explaining exceptions in which a state may exercise jurisdiction without an express congressional mandate.california claimed that it had jurisdiction over gaming activities on indian lands pursuant to authority ceded by public law,which conferred broad criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against indians within all indian country within the state.id.at.because california permitted some of the gaming at issue,however,with violations of the law deemed to be mere misdemeanors,the supreme court concluded that the statutes actually were regulatory rather than prohibitory or criminal in nature.public law did not confer jurisdiction on the state to regulate gaming and,thus,california could not base its jurisdiction on that statute.nonetheless,the general criminal jurisdiction that california exercises under public law allowed california to prohibit gaming for indian tribes,if the scheme was prohibitory rather than regulatory.id.at.therefore,and,california still had some jurisdiction over indian lands pertaining to gaming.
igra changed the landscape but did not divest california of its general criminal jurisdiction over indian lands.rather,it devised a method to give back some of the regulatory authority that the supreme court had held inapplicable to indian lands in cabazon.one of the bases of the holding in cabazon was that congress had not explicitly ceded regulatory authority for gaming to the states in public law or otherwise.igra responded by creating a statutory basis for gaming regulation that introduced the compacting process as a means of sharing with the states the federal government regulatory authority over class iii gaming.cabazon,at,d.simultaneously,igra put into effect,which provides that all state laws pertaining to the licensing,regulation,or prohibition of gambling,including but not limited to criminal sanctions applicable thereto,shall apply in indian country in the same manner and to the same extent as such laws apply elsewhere in the state.a.the federal government retained the power to prosecute violations of state gambling laws in indian country,so as to preserve the delicate balance of power between the states and the tribes.see sycuan band of mission indians roache,cir explaining the limit on a state jurisdiction to enforce the gambling laws that extend into indian lands.however,the fact that the federal government retained that power does not change the fact that california may enact laws and regulations concerning gambling that have an effect on indian lands via.see united states,cir discussing the relationship between state law and exclusive federal enforcement power in d.
further,our decision in rumsey supports a construction of the phrase permits such gaming under which california could permit gaming on indian lands both before and after the ratification of proposition.rumsey held that,in the statute at issue,permit had a clear and unambiguous meaning.at.in united states launder,cir,we adopted a black law d ictionary definition of the term permit as meaning t o suffer,allow,consent,let to give leave or license to acquiesce,by failure to prevent,or to expressly assent or agree to the doing of an act.rumsey,at.in other words,under rumsey,the word permit in this statute does not necessarily require an affirmative act of legal authority in order to permit conduct.california may permit class iii gaming within the meaning of igra even if it acquiesces,by failure to prevent class iii gaming.under rumsey,mere tolerance of class iii gaming might be enough to satisfy d b requirement that a state permit such gaming for any purpose by any person,organization,or entity.d b.
plaintiffs are quick to point out that rumsey dealt with a state obligation to negotiate under igra,rather than the limits of a state negotiating authority in the compacting process.indeed,most cases interpreting d b have done so in the context of addressing a state duty to negotiate with a tribe concerning class iii gaming.see,rumsey,at cheyenne river sioux tribe south dakota,cir construing the phrase such gaming in d b in deciding whether the state had to negotiate with the tribes about traditional keno mashantucket pequot tribe,at construing the same provision in deciding which games were subject to negotiation.however material,this distinction does not compel a reading of permits such gaming that requires california to legalize class iii gaming before executing valid compacts under igra.
we are still left,then,with a statutory provision that is susceptible to more than one interpretation.neither the statutory text read in isolation nor judicial constructions of it resolve the ambiguity.
b any person,organization,or entity 
we reach a similar conclusion with respect to the requirement of d b that a state permit class iii gaming by any person,organization,or entity.there is nothing in the text itself that definitively resolves whether congress intended indian tribes to fall within the scope of any person,organization,or entity under this provision.
plaintiffs interpret this phrase in d b to exclude indian tribes from any person,organization,or entity,because they read the subsection simply as a nations clause.if no other class iii gaming is permitted in a state,they contend,then federal law bars indians from conducting such gaming.under this construction,d b merely places indians on an equal footing with other gambling businesses in the state.as rumsey put it,after citing d b,a state need only allow indian tribes to operate games that others can operate,but need not give tribes what others can not have.at see also a providing that state laws on gambling shall apply in indian country in the same manner and to the same extent as such laws apply elsewhere in the state.there is no statutory provision expressly allowing states to enter into exclusive arrangements with indian tribes.plaintiffs reasonably interpret igra as a statute that is intended to maintain a competitive balance between indian and gaming interests under california and federal law.
defendants,on the other hand,construe any person,organization,or entity to include indian tribes.looking only to the text itself,the breadth of the provision does suggest that it is meant to be read inclusively permits such gaming for any purpose by any person,organization,or entity does not lend itself to easy circumscription.d b emphasis added.the statute does not explicitly exclude indians from its scope.and rumsey did not hold that a state may not give tribes what others do not have,but only that a state need not do so.at.
as the district court noted,congress employed capacious language to define those situations in which it would be legal for indian tribes to conduct class iii gaming operations on indian lands.artichoke joe,d at.nonetheless,the parties textual dispute ultimately reduces to what the statute does not say.because the statute does not explicitly exclude indians from the phrase any person,organization,or entity,defendants read igra to allow provisions legalizing class iii gaming monopolies on indian lands to satisfy the requirements of d b.because the statute does not expressly permit indian tribes to run class iii gaming enterprises as a monopoly,plaintiffs read d b to require states to permit class iii gaming for any purpose by any person,entity,or organization.
looking to past judicial constructions of the text,defendants have somewhat the better of the argument.in the context of deciding whether california could condition approval of a compact on a tribe agreement to certain and employment provisions,we said that the core of the compact between indian tribes and the state is the exchange of the exclusive right to conduct lucrative las class iii gaming,free from competition for the tribes agreement to a number of restrictions and obligations concerning their gaming enterprises.in re indian gaming related cases,at.an arizona district court reached a similar result in a case deciding that a compact,standing alone,can not legalize indian gaming under igra.the court read d b to require a state to first legalize a game,even if only for tribes,before it can become a compact term.am.greyhound racing,hull,d,vacated on other grounds,cir emphasis added.similarly,the california supreme court,adopting the reasoning of the district court in the present case,has construed d b to allow tribal monopolies of class iii gaming activities see flynt,d at.although the trend of judicial construction of d b slightly favors defendants view,none of the cases controls the issue before us.
c the subsection and the statute as a whole 
reading d b in the light of igra as a whole also fails to resolve the ambiguity conclusively.looking both to similar text used elsewhere in the statute and to other operational text addressing the application of state law on tribal lands,we find potentially relevant provisions supporting each party interpretation of d b.
igra uses identical text to govern whether tribes may engage in class ii gaming under b a.a tribe may conduct class ii gaming operations only if that tribe is located within a state that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person,organization or entity.plaintiffs argue that the absence of a compacting process for class ii gaming shows that the verb permits must refer to what states allow on lands.they then cite the familiar canon of construction that identical text appearing more than once in the same statute is presumed to have the same meaning.see batjac,goodtimes home video,cir.however,this argument begs the question whether a state could permit class ii gaming only on indian lands,even without a compacting process.
other sections of the statute that employ text similar to the phrase any person,organization,or entity in d b lend support both to plaintiffs and defendants interpretations of that text.section d a provides that,i f any indian tribe proposes to engage in,or to authorize any person or entity to engage in,a class iii gaming activity on indian lands of the indian tribe,the governing body of the indian tribe shall adopt and submit to the chairman an ordinance or resolution that meets the requirements of b.emphasis added.in this provision,the term any person or entity implicitly excludes indian tribes.other subsections,however,qualify the phrase any person or entity when it is meant to exclude indian tribes.thus,for example,d restricts a state ability to tax gaming activities.it states that igra should not be read to authorize the imposition of any tax,fee,charge,or other assessment upon an indian tribe or upon any other person or entity authorized by an indian tribe to engage in class iii activity.emphasis added.section b a also qualifies any person or entity with the phrase other than the indian tribe when distinguishing between indian and entities.these qualifiers suggest that the unadorned phrase any person or entity includes indian tribes.
looking to other operative text in the statute that addresses the applicability of state law on tribal lands,we again find support for both of the proposed interpretations.section b a states that tribal licensing requirements for class ii gaming operations must be at least as restrictive as those established under state law governing similar gaming within the jurisdiction of the state within which such indian lands are located.emphasis added.read narrowly,this text supports the notion that congress was legislating with the assumption in mind that existing state law would apply to tribal gaming least insofar as class ii gaming is concerned.read broadly,the text supports plaintiffs interpretation that igra confers most favored nation status on indian tribes.
section d seems to carry the same assumption to the context of class iii gaming,stating that 
n othing in this subsection shall impair the right of an indian tribe to regulate class iii gaming on its indian lands concurrently with the state,except to the extent that such regulation is inconsistent with,or less stringent than,the state laws and regulations made applicable by any compact 
in establishing consistency between state and tribal gaming regulations,congress apparently assumed the existence of state regulation of class iii gaming.
finally,establishes federal jurisdiction over violations of state gaming laws on indian lands.section a states that,for purposes of federal law,all state laws pertaining to the licensing,regulation,or prohibition of gambling,including but not limited to criminal sanctions applicable thereto,shall apply in indian country in the same manner and to the same extent as such laws apply elsewhere in the state.this provision suggests that existing state law is expected to apply to both indian and gaming activities.however,c,by excluding class iii gaming operations conducted under compacts from the term gambling in a,expressly carves out such operations from this jurisdictional scheme.
in summary,an examination of igra as a whole fails to resolve the ambiguities inherent in d b.we thus turn to sources outside the operative statutory text.
congressional findings,purpose,and legislative history 
as is true of the operative text,congress statements of intent in enacting igra,and igra legislative history,leave us in equipoise between the parties competing interpretations of the statute.both plaintiffs and defendants find support for their respective positions,but no party has directed our attention to,nor can we find,any statement of intent or legislative history that clearly demonstrates that congress even considered the question before us.
the official legislative history of formal record of the select committee report and the subsequent floor silent on the specific issue of tribal monopolies on class iii gaming.this silence does not definitively favor either interpretation of igra although,as the district court noted,silence does suggest that tribal gaming monopolies were not at the forefront of what congress had in mind.artichoke joe,d at.drawing inferences as to congressional intent from silence in legislative history is always a precarious business.symons chrysler.loan guarantee.
the legislative history conveys quite clearly that congress devised the compacting process as a means to resolve the most contentiously debated issue in the legislation which,state,or regulate class iii gaming,at,reprinted in.indian tribes resisted ceding any authority over gaming to the states.id.at,reprinted at.the states,on the other hand,resisted tribally or federally regulated class iii gaming,especially because many states already had in place regulatory systems for such gaming.id.igra drafters conceived of the compact as the best mechanism to assure that the interests of both sovereign entities are met with respect to the regulation of complex gaming enterprises.id.
the legislative history thus shows that congress looked to the compacting process primarily as a means of balancing state and tribal interests.the select committee articulation of these interests refers only obliquely to the economic concerns of third parties 
in the committee view,both state and tribal governments have significant governmental interests in the conduct of class iii gaming a tribe governmental interests include raising revenues to provide governmental services for the benefit of the tribal community and reservation residents,promoting public safety as well as law and order on tribal lands,realizing the objectives of economic and indian,and regulating activities of persons within its jurisdictional borders.a state governmental interests with respect to class iii gaming on indian lands include the interplay of such gaming with the state public policy,safety,law and other interests,as well as impacts on the state regulatory system,including its economic interest in raising revenue for its citizens.
id.emphasis added.recognition of the interests of is implied,but only as a consideration for the state,not for congress directly.
plaintiffs direct our attention to parts of the legislative history showing that congress intended to preserve an environment of competition among entities engaged in class iii gaming.although the notion of competition does appear in the legislative history,it figures most prominently in the context of warning states not to abuse the compacting process to protect gaming interests it is the committee intent that the compact requirement for class iii not be used as a justification by a state for excluding indian tribes from such gaming or for the protection of other gaming enterprises from free market competition with indian tribes.id.
this is not to say that the statute effect on existing gaming interests was entirely absent from congress deliberations.the select committee on indian affairs stated that igra allows states to consider negative impacts on existing gaming activities.id.at,reprinted at.however,the legislative history seems simply to assume rather than affirmatively to require existing,competitive gaming activities.congress intended that igra not allow states to reject indian gaming on the mere showing that indian gaming will compete with non indian games.rather,states must show that economic consequences will be severe and that they will clearly outweigh positive economic consequences.id.
other portions of the legislative history suggest that congress enacted igra with the assumption that states would use laws and regulatory systems that police extant class iii gaming operations to regulate similar operations on tribal lands.one goal of igra is to foster a consistency and uniformity in the manner in which laws regulating the conduct of gaming activities are applied.id.at,reprinted at.the justice department opposed the creation of a federal agency to regulate class ii and class iii gaming activity because,in the department view,the expertise to regulate gaming activities and to enforce laws related to gaming could be found in state agencies.id.at,reprinted at.
congress shared the justice department concern about the effect of tribal class iii gaming operations on existing state regulatory systems.the select committee noted the strong concerns of states that state laws and regulations relating to sophisticated forms of class iii gaming be respected on indian lands.id.at,reprinted at.its admonition to the states not to use compact negotiations to protect other gaming enterprises,from competition with indian tribes also reveals the assumption that the class iii gaming compacts would be concluded in states with laws and agencies that regulate existing class iii gaming operations.
other portions of the legislative history support defendants interpretation.we first note that any express congressional consideration of gaming interests in the text of igra seems to have fallen out as congress worked through competing drafts of the legislation.as introduced,senate bill contained text that provided explicitly for the interpretation that plaintiffs urge here.section d and provided 
except as provided in paragraph of this subsection,class iii gaming shall be unlawful on any indian lands under section of title,united states code.
a a gaming activity on indian lands that is otherwise legal within the state where such lands are located may be exempt from the operation of paragraph of this subsection where the indian tribe requests the secretary to consent to the transfer of all civil and criminal jurisdiction,except for taxing authority,pertaining to the licensing and regulation of gaming over the proposed gaming enterprise to the state within which such gaming enterprise is to be located and the secretary so consents.
cong.rec.emphasis added.the final version of,however,uses the current,broader text.the current text originated in,a bill that ultimately failed in committee.id.at,b.the fact that the permits such gaming text was taken from another bill suggests that the substitution was deliberate,and the particular substitution that the drafters chose implies that congress intended a broader meaning than the one proposed by plaintiffs.
further,at least one individual legislator did recognize a preference for indian gaming.in his separate statement following the select committee report,senator evans observed that 
indian tribes may have a competitive economic advantage because,rightly or wrongly,many states have chosen not to allow the same types of gaming in which tribes are empowered to engage.ironically,the strongest opponents of tribal authority over gaming on indian lands are from states whose liberal gaming policies would allow them to compete on an equal basis with the tribes.
at,reprinted at.although not dispositive as to congress view of class iii gaming monopolies,senator evans comments do show that at least one legislator,and perhaps other interested parties as well,viewed indian monopolies as a possibility under igra.igra stated purposes also tend slightly to favor defendants interpretation.section provides that igra purpose is 
to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments 
to provide a statutory basis for the regulation of gaming by an indian tribe adequate to shield it from organized crime and other corrupting influences,to ensure that the indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation,and to assure that gaming is conducted fairly and honestly by both the operator and players.
those stated purposes address the indian tribes interests in matters related to their autonomy and the state interest in the prevention of crime.nowhere is there any reference to the idea that igra serves as a means of policing equality between indian and gaming operations in the context of class iii gaming.at the same time,congress interests in tribal and do not necessarily translate into approval of gaming monopolies.
the statement of congressional findings in is similarly ambiguous 
indian tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming activity on indian lands if the gaming activity is not specifically prohibited by federal law and is conducted within a state which does not,as a matter of criminal law and public policy,prohibit such gaming activity.
id.one way to interpret this section is to note that congress wanted to grant to indian tribes an exclusive right,a right unavailable to gaming interests,and to read such gaming activity to refer back to the entire phrase gaming activity on indian lands.this reading favors defendants.it is equally possible,however,to read this section to say that the only exclusive right granted is the right to regulate gaming activity on indian lands and thus to read such gaming activity to refer back only to the remaining phrase the gaming activity which,in general,must be a type of gaming activity that a state does not prohibit.this reading favors plaintiffs.
in sum,an examination of the legislative history and igra stated purposes does not resolve the ambiguities in the operative text.both plaintiffs interpretation and defendants interpretation remain plausible.we therefore turn to other interpretive aids.
the blackfeet tribe presumption 
ambiguity in a statute that is enacted for the benefit of indians implicates a canon of construction.in montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d,the supreme court held that the standard principles of statutory construction do not have their usual force in cases involving indian law.as we said earlier this term,t he canons of construction applicable in indian law are rooted in the unique trust relationship between the united states and the indians.id.at.quoting oneida county oneida indian nation,d.the court then described the two canons of construction that apply specially in indian law,one of which is that statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the indians,with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.id.
this presumption,also known as the trust doctrine,grew out of the trust obligation that congress owes to indian tribes.initially,the presumption was applied in the context of indian treaties as a counterbalance to congress ability to abrogate a treaty obligation unilaterally without a tribe consent.see felix cohen handbook of federal indian law ed.collecting cases.later decisions extended this presumption beyond the context of indian treaties to land disputes,united states santa fe pac.state jurisdiction to tax,bryan itasca county,d and the application of the bill of rights to tribes in matters of,santa clara pueblo martinez,d 
the blackfeet presumption simply requires that,when there is doubt as to the proper interpretation of an ambiguous provision in a federal statute enacted for the benefit of an indian tribe,the doubt will benefit the tribe,for a mbiguities in federal law have been construed generously in order to comport with traditional notions of sovereignty and with the federal policy of encouraging tribal independence.merrion jicarilla apache tribe,d quoting white mountain apache tribe bracker,d see also native vill.of venetie council alaska,cir applying the blackfeet presumption when choosing between two interpretations of the indian child welfare act of.this presumption is subject to two implicit limitations.first,the presumption applies only to federal statutes that are passed for the benefit of dependent indian tribes.hoonah indian ass morrison,cir internal quotation marks omitted.second,ambiguity is a prerequisite for any application of the blackfeet presumption.thus,in rumsey,we refused to apply the presumption favoring tribes where doing so would contradict the plain words of the statute.at.
neither of those limitations prevents us from turning to the blackfeet presumption in this case.as discussed above,the relevant text of the statute is ambiguous.further,igra is undoubtedly a statute passed for the benefit of indian tribes.igra declaration of policy,providing that the statute is intended as a means of promoting tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments,firmly places the statute in the category of legislation to which the blackfeet presumption applies.
application of the blackfeet presumption is straightforward.we are confronted by an ambiguous provision in a federal statute that was intended to benefit indian tribes.one construction of the provision favors indian tribes,while the other does not.we faced a similar situation in the context of indian taxation in quinault indian nation grays harbor county,cir.in choosing between two characterizations of a tax law plagued with ambiguity,we adopted the construction that favored the indian nation over the one that favored grays harbor county,noting that it is not enough to be persuaded that the county is a permissible or even the better reading.id.at.
here,we must follow a similar approach.we adopt defendants construction,not because it is necessarily the better reading,but because it favors indian tribes and the statute at issue is both ambiguous and intended to benefit those tribes.
neither of the two exceptions to the application of the blackfeet presumption causes us pause.the first exception is that deference to an agency interpretation can overcome the presumption in favor of indian tribes.haynes united states,cir.but see navajo nation,at noting a circuit split as to whether deference to an agency interpretation takes priority over the blackfeet presumption.assuming,without deciding,that the secretary interpretation of d b is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,and united states mead,d,that interpretation likewise adopts defendants construction of the statute and favors indian tribes.in other words,the blackfeet presumption and the doctrine of agency deference point to the same result.
the second exception involves the avoidance of constitutionally doubtful interpretations of a statute.in williams babbitt,cir,we declined to adopt the department of the interior interpretation of the reindeer industry act of.although the agency interpretation was not unreasonable and was owed chevron deference,we ruled that the agency interpretation raised severe constitutional concerns that prevailed over any deference owed to the agency.williams,at.we reasoned that,because chevron deference trumps the blackfeet presumption,and the supreme court held in edward debartolo florida gulf coast building constr.trades council,d,that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance trumps chevron deference,it follows that constitutional avoidance also trumps statutory constructions favoring indians.williams,at.
the doctrine of constitutional avoidance requires that every reasonable construction must be resorted to,in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.rust sullivan,d quoting debartolo,at.emphasis omitted.here,we need not invalidate california grant to indian tribes of exclusive class iii gambling privileges in order to save the statute from unconstitutionality because,as we are about to explain,plaintiffs constitutional arguments do not carry the day.id.at.moreover,the privileges granted to indian tribes do not raise constitutional concerns that are sufficiently grave to trigger the application of the doctrine.id.rather,the award of exclusive class iii gaming franchises simply furthers the federal government trust obligations to indian tribes and helps promote their economic.as the supreme court has cautioned elsewhere,s tatutes should be interpreted to avoid serious constitutional doubts,not to eliminate all possible contentions that the statute might be unconstitutional.reno flores,d citation omitted.thus,the doctrine of constitutional avoidance does not apply here.see united states,d stating that the constitutional doubt doctrine does not apply mechanically whenever there arises a significant constitutional question the answer to which is not obvious.
conclusion 
igra is a statute that congress enacted for the benefit of indian tribes.section d b remains ambiguous after consulting its text,context,purpose,and legislative history.we therefore apply the blackfeet presumption and hold that california proposition permits class iii gaming within the meaning of igra by legalizing such gaming operations only when conducted by the entity of an indian tribe.
equal protection 
having held that igra allows the state of california to grant to the indian tribes a monopoly on class iii gaming,we must decide the second question that plaintiffs pose whether that monopoly violates plaintiffs right to equal protection under the laws.the equal protection claim requires us to answer two questions.first,we must decide whether the distinction between indian and gaming interests is a political or a racial classification,so we can determine the proper level of deference that is owed to the classification.second,we must decide whether,under the applicable standard of review,legitimate state interests justify the grant to indian tribes of a monopoly on class iii gaming.
nature of the classification in igra and in proposition 
in areas of social and economic policy,a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.fcc beach communications,d.plaintiffs seek to avoid this deferential standard of review by arguing that the tribal monopoly on class iii gaming amounts to a racial preference for native americans,which would be subject to strict scrutiny.adarand constructors,pena,d.a racial preference violates equal protection guarantees unless it is narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests.see also rice cayetano,d striking down a voting limitation.
in the context of a challenge to legislative classifications relating to indians or indian tribes,the starting point for our analysis is morton mancari,d.in mancari,the supreme court upheld an employment preference for native americans seeking positions in the bureau of indian affairs bia.the class action plaintiffs,who were applicants for bia employment,argued that the preference amounted to invidious racial discrimination that violated their right to equal protection.the supreme court noted that,if credited,the plaintiffs argument would call into question the entirety of congress regulation of indian affairs under article i,section of the constitution 
literally every piece of legislation dealing with indian tribes and reservations,and certainly all legislation dealing with the bia,single out for special treatment a constituency of tribal indians living on or near reservations.if these laws,derived from historical relationships and explicitly designed to help only indians,were deemed invidious racial discrimination,an entire title of the united states code would be effectively erased and the solemn commitment of the government toward the indians would be jeopardized.
mancari,at.
the court concluded that strict scrutiny did not apply because the preference for indians relied on a political,rather than a racial,classification.the hiring preference was not directed toward a racial group consisting of indians instead,it applie d only to members of federally recognized tribes.id.at.thus,even if an applicant demonstrated the required quantum of indian blood,he or she still would have to show membership in a federally recognized tribe in order to qualify for the hiring preference.
the court tied its deferential standard of review to congress interest in furthering tribal sovereignty.the indians who qualified for the preference were not racially defined,but rather were members of tribal entities whose lives and activities are governed by the bia in a unique fashion.id.at.the preference was also an important part of the indian reorganization act of.the overriding purpose of that particular act was to establish machinery whereby indian tribes would be able to assume a greater degree of,both politically and economically.id.at.the court held that legislative classifications furthering that same purpose were political and,thus,did not warrant strict scrutiny instead of ordinary,scrutiny as long as the special treatment can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of congress unique obligation toward the indians,such legislative judgments will not be disturbed.here,where the preference is reasonable and rationally designed to further indian,we can not say that congress classification violates due process.id.at.
supreme court cases decided shortly after mancari emphasized the federal government interest in tribal sovereignty and the unique relationship between tribal and federal governments.in fisher district court,d per curiam,the court upheld the exclusive jurisdiction of the northern cheyenne tribal court to handle adoptions,even though tribal litigants could not gain access to montana court system.citing mancari,the court rejected the argument that denying tribal litigants access to the system constituted racial discrimination 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribal court does not derive from the race of the plaintiff but rather from the status of the northern cheyenne tribe under federal law.moreover,even if a jurisdictional holding occasionally results in denying an indian plaintiff a forum to which a has access,such disparate treatment of the indian is justified because it is intended to benefit the class of which he is a member by furthering the congressional policy of indian.
fisher,at.citing mancari,at.
in united states antelope,d,two indian defendants argued that prosecuting them under a federal criminal law,for a crime committed on indian lands,constituted racial discrimination because the federal law allowed a lower burden of proof than the corresponding state law.exposing them to federal prosecution,they argued,violated their right to equal protection because a who had committed the same crime would have been prosecuted under state law,not federal law.the court rejected that argument,elaborating on its opinion in mancari 
t he principles reaffirmed in mancari point to the conclusion that federal regulation of indian affairs is not based upon impermissible classifications.rather,such regulation is rooted in the unique status of indians as a separate people with their own political institutions.federal regulation of indian tribes,therefore,is governance of political communities it is not to be viewed as legislation of a racial group consisting of indians 
antelope,at.quoting mancari,at.
although discussions of mancari arise primarily in the context of federal statutes relating to indian tribes,in washington confederated bands tribes of yakima indian nation,d yakima iii,the supreme court described the circumstances in which review applies to state laws.the court applied review to an equal protection challenge to a state law where federal legislation extended that law into indian country.washington had enacted a law,chapter,washington laws,to assert partial civil and criminal jurisdiction over indian lands pursuant to the grant of authority from congress in public law.yakima iii,at.chapter asserted such jurisdiction depending on the nature of the land,tribal or reservation and the subject matter of the underlying law,compulsory school attendance and motor vehicle registration.id.at.the yakima nation challenged the resulting checkerboard jurisdictional pattern,claiming that it lacked a rational foundation and therefore violated the nation right to equal protection.the court sustained the classifications,applying review 
it is settled that the unique legal status of indian tribes under federal law permits the federal government to enact legislation singling out tribal indians,legislation that might otherwise be constitutionally offensive.states do not enjoy this same unique relationship with indians,but chapter is not simply another state law.it was enacted in response to a federal measure explicitly designed to readjust the allocation of jurisdiction over indians.the jurisdiction permitted under chapter is,as we have found,within the scope of the authorization of pub.and many of the classifications made by chapter are also made by pub.for these reasons,we find the argument that such classifications are suspect an untenable one in enacting chapter,washington was legislating under explicit authority granted by congress in the exercise of that federal power.
id.at.citations omitted.
thus,when a state law applies in indian country as a result of the state participation in a federal scheme that readjusts jurisdiction over indians,that state law is reviewed as if it were federal law.if rationally related to both congress trust obligations to the indians and legitimate state interests,the state law must be upheld.
our early discussions of mancari suggested that,so long as a federal statute evinced a rational relationship to congress trust obligations toward the indians,it involved a political classification,so review was appropriate.see,alaska chapter,associated contractors of,pierce,cir upholding a contracting preference for native businesses for construction contracts in alaskan villages.more recently,however,we have suggested that the classification is not always easy to identify.as we noted above,williams rejected the secretary construction of the reindeer act.at.under the secretary interpretation,the reindeer act granted a preference to individual native alaskans,who belonged to no tribal organization,that allowed them to engage in reindeer herding anywhere in alaska,free from competition.so construed,the act would not relate to indian land,tribal status,or culture.id.consequently,review would not apply and the statute most likely would constitute an impermissible racial preference.we applied the canon of constitutional avoidance to reject the secretary interpretation.id.at.
plaintiffs suggestion that williams controls the outcome of the present case ignores the obvious distinctions between an unqualified preference for individual native alaskans and the limited preference for tribes reflected in the text of igra.the operative terms of igra expressly relate only to tribes,not to individual indians.only tribes,not individual indians,may enter into compacts with other sovereign governments.indeed,as in mancari itself,only federally recognized tribes are covered.further,through igra compacting process,and through its reliance on tribal governments and tribal ordinances to regulate class iii gaming,the statute relates to tribal status and tribal.the very nature of a compact is political it is an agreement between an indian tribe,as one sovereign,and a state,as another.the statute contemplates that the tribes must exercise their sovereign will in deciding whether to participate in class iii gaming.see d a providing for class iii gaming only if authorized by a tribal ordinance or resolution.
moreover,congress express purpose was to promote tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments.the regulation of gaming by an indian tribe also was intended to ensure that the indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation.id.in its findings,congress recognized that indian tribes had been conducting gaming activities on indian lands as a means of generating revenue for tribal governments.id.congress created the mechanism of compacts to resolve the conflicting interests of the tribes and the states,which it acknowledged as two equal sovereigns,at,reprinted at.
additionally,unlike the legislation construed in williams,igra pertains only to indian lands.d.like the vast majority of statutes by which congress fulfills its obligations to the indian tribes,igra regulates activities only on indian lands.see williams,at collecting statutes.this limitation is critical given the connection between tribal lands and tribal sovereignty.indian tribal territory has always held a separate status under federal law.tribes exercise substantial governing powers within their territory,they have important economic and property rights,and a number of federal laws also govern other relationships,all to the exclusion of state law.cohen at footnotes omitted.these governing powers and economic rights extend only as far as the borders of indian lands.once outside,the tribes shed their sovereignty and are fully amenable to state law.under igra,for example,individual indians or even indian tribes could not establish a class iii gaming establishment on lands 
accordingly,igra falls squarely within the rule of mancari.williams continued to recognize that a statute relating to tribal,to tribal status,or to indian lands is subject to review.at.igra is just such a statute,notwithstanding the dictum in williams that doubted whether congress could give indians a complete monopoly on the casino industry.id.at.as our lengthy discussion of the statute has made clear,igra does not give indians a monopoly it neither relates to indians as distinct from federally recognized tribes nor,itself,creates a monopoly.
in arguing against review,plaintiffs also rely on cases applying federal law to businesses to argue that tribal gaming operations do not involve uniquely indian interests their reliance is misplaced.the test used to determine whether review applies to a federal statute we have been discussing the test used to determine whether tribes are immune from otherwise generally applicable federal laws are distinct,with the latter being much more demanding.see donovan coeur tribal farm,cir listing the three exceptions to the principle that federal statutes that are silent on the issue of applicability to indian tribes apply with equal force to indians and.plaintiffs,in other words,conflate two distinct concepts 
we conclude,then,that igra pertains to indian lands and to tribal and tribal status of federally recognized tribes.accordingly,under mancari,review applies.
turning next to proposition,we must apply yakima iii.proposition was enacted in response to igra,a federal law explicitly designed to readjust the regulatory authority of various sovereigns over class iii gaming on the lands of federally recognized indian tribes.the classifications in proposition echo those made in igra.in ratifying proposition,the people of california were legislating with reference to the authority that congress had granted to the state of california in igra.accordingly,review applies to proposition as well 
having identified the level of deference that we owe to the legislation at issue,we turn to the merits of plaintiffs equal protection challenge.
igra and the compacts 
igra is rationally related to congress stated purposes of encouraging tribal autonomy and economic development.we recognized,in alaska chapter,at,that the furtherance of an economic community on indian lands was a goal related to congress special trust obligations.igra and the compacts further that goal by authorizing gaming.congress recognized that the revenue generated from tribal gaming operations often means the difference between an adequate governmental program and a skeletal program that is totally dependent on federal funding,at,reprinted at.thus,igra and the compacts also are rationally related to the federal government interest in fostering tribal.
proposition 
proposition presents a more difficult question because it establishes the monopoly of which plaintiffs principally complain.we conclude,nonetheless,that proposition passes the test.
states have wide latitude in establishing classifications to balance interests and remedy perceived problems 
the problem of legislative classification is a perennial one,admitting of no doctrinaire definition.evils in the same field may be of different dimensions and proportions,requiring different remedies.or so the legislature may think.or the reform may take one step at a time,addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.the legislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there,neglecting the others.the prohibition of the equal protection clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.
beach communications,at.quoting williamson lee optical of.where there exists an appropriate connection to the state police power,even the grant of a monopoly does not,in itself,offend equal protection principles.see,city of new orleans dukes,d per curiam reversing an appellate court holding that a grandfather clause exemption from a ban on pushcart vendors,which amounted to the creation of a protected monopoly for the favored class member,violated equal protection internal quotation marks omitted pac.states box basket white.holding that the grant of a monopoly,if otherwise an appropriate exercise of the police power,is not void as denying equal protection of the law.
california has two legitimate interests to which proposition bears a rational connection.the first is the regulation of vice function that lies at the heart of a state police permitting certain forms of gambling only on the lands of sovereign tribal entities that enter into compacts with the state.the second is to promote cooperative relationships between the tribes and the state by fostering tribal sovereignty and.
i local prohibitions and exceptions for vice activities 
the circuits that have given significant attention to equal protection challenges to state gambling laws have,by and large,held that the regulation of gambling lies at the heart of the state police power.helton hunt,cir,cert.denied,d internal quotation marks omitted.in helton,the court held that statutes providing for the destruction of certain gaming machines and the prosecution of their owners did not violate equal protection principles.see also casino ventures stewart,cir noting that,because gambling restrictions are aimed at promoting the welfare,safety,and morals of south carolinians,they represent a exercise of state police power united states williams,cir upholding a pennsylvania statute prohibiting certain gaming activities.our own precedent,although not discussing the issue in great detail,is largely in accord.see jacobson hannifin,cir upholding a nevada law giving the state gaming commission the power to deny licenses for gaming establishments for any cause deemed reasonable by such commission.
upholding a local advertising ban on casino gambling in puerto rico,the supreme court placed gambling in a category of products or activities deemed harmful,such as cigarettes,alcoholic beverages,and prostitution,which state legislatures have dealt with by means ranging from location restrictions to outright prohibition.posadas de assocs.tourism of,d using the shorthand term vice activity to refer to these products and activities,the court has rejected both first amendment and equal protection challenges to legislative classifications aimed at reducing specific harms associated with vice activity.united states edge broad,d.such classifications have withstood scrutiny whether they distinguish between states,political subdivisions within a state,or establishments within the same locality.
in salsburg maryland,the supreme court upheld a maryland statute that excepted only certain localities from the state exclusionary rule of evidence.the exception applied only to the use of such evidence in anne arundel,wicomico and prince george counties in the prosecution of any person for a violation of the gambling laws contained in state statutes.id.at.quoting.of.drawing from laws regulating the sale of alcohol,salsburg held that maryland 
could validly grant home rule to each of its counties and to the city of baltimore to determine this rule of evidence by local option.it is equally clear,although less usual,that a state legislature may itself determine such an issue for each of its local subdivisions,having in mind the needs and desires of each.
id.at.footnote omitted.the court held that the state had acted reasonably in singling out the counties excepted from the evidentiary rule because that selection was related to population concentration.particularly in the field of criminal law,states have discretion to enact distinctions of this kind.see id.at.
laws in the area of liquor control have shown particular resilience against equal protection challenges.cases upholding such laws teach that a state constitutionally can allow a local subdivision to elect a more stringent regulatory approach or outright prohibition,or conversely can exempt a local subdivision from a ban on vice activity.although the analysis has changed somewhat since rippey texas,and eberle michigan,the judicial trend still favors the validity of laws as exercises of the state police power.for example,the seventh circuit,in philly,byrne,cir,upheld a law allowing voters within a given chicago city precinct to vote that precinct dry.the court rejected a due process challenge by restaurant owners in chicago who had lost their liquor licenses by popular vote.id.at.
the sixth circuit followed a similar approach in rejecting an equal protection challenge to a law.in,ohio department of liquor control,cir,the court applied review to uphold an ohio statute allowing counties to go dry by elections.it held that,so long as the police power is not abused to violate a person federal constitutional rights,drawing distinctions between political subdivisions or allowing those subdivisions to distinguish themselves by an exercise of their own political will is permissible state action that survives scrutiny.id.at citing liquormart,rhode island,d.
the plaintiffs in,were owners of bars and stores.they challenged the law because the state of ohio had issued licenses exempting certain breweries from the law.the plaintiffs asserted that their establishments were similarly situated to the breweries exempted from the ban and that the legislative distinction was therefore arbitrary.rejecting their claim,the sixth circuit credited the legislative judgment that beer sales from the licensed establishments did not involve the same risks of disorderly conduct and crime posed by sales from the unlicensed establishments.id.at.although the safer course would be to ban all sales,the court noted that the all or nothing approach was not the only one that would survive review.id.at.
the same analysis applies where states,or local voters,choose to exempt a political subdivision from prohibitions on vice activity.quite recently,the georgia supreme court upheld state statutes that give local governments the option of excepting certain businesses and venues from a ban on the sale of alcohol on sunday.state heretic.the plaintiffs,who were bar owners whose establishments did not qualify for the exception,alleged that the discriminatory application of the exception amounted to a denial of equal protection.
rejecting that challenge,the georgia supreme court relied in part on mcgowan maryland,d.in that case the united states supreme court upheld a exception of certain retail establishments in only one county from a ban on the sale of specified merchandise on sunday.in addition to challenging the discriminatory treatment of different establishments in the same county,the plaintiffs in mcgowan challenged the statute because the exemption applied to only one county in the entire state.the supreme court rejected both arguments.as to the distinction between vendors,the court held that,given the state legitimate concerns,such as enforcement problems,the classification was reasonable.id.at.as to the preferential treatment of vendors in anne arundel county,the court held that territorial uniformity is not a constitutional prerequisite and that the prescription of different substantive offenses in different counties is generally a matter for legislative discretion.id.at.
in addition to relying on mcgowan,the state court in heretic rested its decision on a distinction between vice activities and generic economic enterprises,rejecting the plaintiffs argument that their claim was controlled by the court prior holding that no rational basis supported a state law prohibiting furniture stores from operating on sunday.the heretic court was unpersuaded by an analogy between alcohol and furniture the present case is distinguishable because the state lacks the interest in regulating the sale of furniture that it has in regulating the sale of alcohol,which poses significant risks to the health and safety of the general public.at.
similarly,we are unpersuaded by plaintiffs argument that allowing california to grant to tribes a monopoly on class iii gaming operations,restricted to indian lands,necessarily will lead to indian monopolies on other forms of economic activity.as a practical matter,congress viewed gambling as a unique form of economic enterprise and was strongly opposed to the application of the jurisdictional elections authorized by this bill to any other economic or regulatory issue that may arise between tribes and states in the future,at,reprinted at.as a constitutional matter,the state interests that justify,as a valid exercise of a state police power,california restriction of class iii gaming o
