insofar as the district court dismissed carver claims for retrospective relief,we hold that dismissal was in error,and accordingly vacate the court judgment.in so holding,we express no opinion on the merits of these claims,or any defenses that defendants may raise.otherwise,we affirm.

on or about august,carver won in the new york state lottery.
section r of the new york social services law provides that any recipient of state funds who wins a lottery prize of or more must reimburse the state department of social services from the winnings,up to half of the prize amount 
any person who is receiving or has received,within the previous ten years,public assistance pursuant to the provisions of this article,and who wins a lottery prize of six hundred dollars or more shall reimburse the state department of social services from the winnings,for all such public assistance benefits paid to such person during the previous ten years provided,however,that such crediting to the department shall in no event exceed fifty percent of the amount of the lottery prize.
soc.serv.to enforce this obligation,r directs the state commissioner of social services to enter into an agreement with the director of the lottery,pursuant to tax b,for the crediting of lottery prizes against public assistance benefits.see also tax b directing the state office of temporary and disability assistance to coordinate the crediting of lottery prizes pursuant to soc.serv.r.
pursuant to social services law r and tax law b,the new york state office of temporary and disability assistance otda intercepted,to be credited against the public assistance carver had been paid.carver alleges that the intercepted funds were then paid over to new york city.to recover his intercepted winnings,carver initiated a series of lawsuits in state and federal court.
carver initiated this lawsuit on september,styling his complaint as a putative class action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated.named as defendants were the city of new york,and various subsidiary agencies and city officials carver did not join the state of new york or any state agency or employee.carver asserted a taking violative of his rights under the federal and new york state constitutions a violation of his equal protection rights under the federal and new york state constitutions a violation of substantive due process under the federal and new york state constitutions a violation of of the fair labor standards act,a violation of new york state minimum wage law,labor law and inadequate notice of his rights as a lottery winner,in violation of tax law b he sought,inter alia,damages and prospective injunctive and declaratory relief.before serving an answer,the defendants moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,for lack of standing,and under rule b,for failure to state a claim.
on april,the district court granted the defendants motion,dismissing carver complaint under rule b for lack of standing.the court explicitly declined to reach the merits of carver claims,premising its decision to dismiss entirely on standing grounds.this appeal timely followed.

the district court found first that t he only injury alleged by plaintiff is the withholding of his lottery winnings,and held that such withholding qualified as an.the court went on,however,to hold that causation was lacking that the otda,not the city defendants,effected the action that constitutes carver claimed injury,and that carver ha d not alleged any facts supporting an inference that the city defendants influenced the otda decision to withhold his lottery winnings.in fact,stated the court,according to plaintiff allegations,the city defendants took no relevant action in this matter other than supervising plaintiff participation in the wep years prior to the events leading to this action until after the otda withheld plaintiff lottery winnings,at which time they allegedly accepted funds which were transferred to them pursuant to a system of statutes,regulations,contracts,and practices.internal quotation marks omitted.
we disagree.carver has standing to assert his claims insofar as he alleges injury when the city paid him minimum wage subject to a reimbursement obligation.carver pertinently claims that the city defendants violated state and federal labor law by paying him minimum wage while requiring that he return some portion of those wages in the event he won the lottery.on this theory,carver was directly injured by the city alleged failure to abide by state and federal labor law when compensating him for his work.
true,on this theory,the city seemingly could not have complied with its obligations without,for example,agreeing to return or reject any intercepted lottery winnings as necessary to ensure that carver wages did not fall below statutory minimums,or exempting his wages from the reimbursement obligation,or paying him more in anticipation of his lottery win.but this is a merits issue not necessary for us to consider here,and we decline to do so.the standing question is distinct from whether carver has a cause of action.see,whitmore arkansas,d our threshold inquiry into standing in no way depends on the merits of the petitioner contention that particular conduct is illegal,quoting warth,at.alteration in original am.civil liberties union of santillanes,cir standing is not a proxy for ruling on the merits and is determined at the outset of the lawsuit.long term care partners,llc united states,cir at its core,
