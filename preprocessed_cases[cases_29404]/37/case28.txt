opinion of the court 
in this interlocutory appeal we review an order of the united states district court for the district of delaware denying a motion for preliminary injunction filed by the national football league,the national basketball association,the national hockey league,the office of the commissioner of baseball,and the national collegiate athletic association collectively,leagues.the leagues sought to enjoin delaware state officials from implementing certain elements of its sports lottery act act.laws ch,et,on september.as we shall explain,we need not decide whether the district court denial of the leagues preliminary injunction was proper because we hold as a matter of law that elements of delaware sports lottery violate federal law.
in march,the governor of delaware,jack markell,proposed legislation authorizing sports betting and table gaming at existing and future facilities in delaware.on march,governor markell sought an advisory opinion from the delaware supreme court pursuant to and,regarding the constitutionality of his proposal under the delaware constitution.in a letter to the delaware supreme court,governor markell described three types of proposed sports gambling bets on individual games bets on individual games and parlay bets on may the request for an advisory opinion from the delaware supreme court was markell signed the act into law.in re request of governor for an advisory opinion in re request of governor,wl,at.may.
after hearing oral argument,the delaware supreme court issued an opinion on may,which found that betting would not violate state law.in analyzing the legality of the act and the lotteries proposed pursuant to the act,the delaware supreme court relied heavily on judge stapleton decision in national football league governor of the state of delaware nfl.that case concerned the nfl challenge to a sports betting scheme known as scoreboard that delaware conducted during the season.scoreboard was comprised of three games football bonus,touchdown,and touchdown ii.in football bonus,the state offered two pools of seven nfl games each and bettors had to predict the a point one or both of the pools.in touchdown,bettors selected both the winners and point spreads for either three,four,or five nfl games.finally,touchdown replaced touchdown midway through the bettors to pick the winners,against the point spread,for between four and twelve nfl games.all of the scoreboard games conducted in were confined to betting on the nfl,and all required that the bettor wager on more than one game at a time.
in nfl,judge stapleton held such wagering was permissible under the delaware constitution because chance is the dominant factor in parlay betting.the delaware supreme court reached the same conclusion in its advisory opinion,in re request of governor,wl,at,but did not decide the constitutionality of betting,except to recognize that it differs from the parlay games addressed by judge stapleton.id.the delaware supreme court did not address the federal statutory question presented in this appeal.
following receipt of the delaware supreme court advisory opinion,on june the state published its proposed regulations to implement the act regulations.according to the regulations,delaware intends to implement a sports betting scheme that would include wagers in which the winners are determined based on the outcome of any professional or collegiate sporting event,including racing,held within or without the state,but excluding collegiate sporting events that involve a delaware college or university,and amateur or professional sporting events that involve a delaware team.delaware proposed sports betting scheme includes betting in addition to parlay betting,as the regulations define the term maximum wager limit to include the maximum amount that can be wagered on a single sports lottery wager be it or parlay regulations,definition of maximum wager limit emphasis added.
delaware intends to commence its sports betting scheme on september,in time for the start of the upcoming nfl regular season.though the nfl is its focus,delaware intends to the regulations on all major professional and college sports.
on july,the leagues filed a complaint against governor markell and wayne lemons,the director of the delaware state lottery office collectively,delaware or state,claiming that elements of delaware proposed sports betting scheme violate the professional and amateur sports protection act paspa,et although paspa has broadly prohibited sports gambling since it took effect on january,the statute also grandfathered gambling schemes in individual states to the extent that the scheme was conducted by that state between and.
four days after filing their complaint,the leagues filed a motion for preliminary injunction,requesting that the district court enjoin the state from commencing,instituting,operating and maintaining a proposed sports lottery to the extent that such lottery permits i sports betting,ii betting on sports other than professional football,or iii any other sports betting scheme that was not conducted by the state of delaware in pending final adjudication of the leagues action.
the district court held a scheduling conference on july at which it urged the parties to reach an agreement by which the state would stand down pending an expedited adjudication of the merits.the parties could not reach such an agreement,however,so the district court asked for written submissions and held a conference on august.following the conference,the court orally denied the leagues motion and scheduled a trial for december.on august,the district court issued a memorandum order explaining its reasons for denying the injunction.
in its memorandum order,the district court found that the leagues had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits.office of comm r of baseball markell,d,wl,at.noting that both sides vigorously and ably contend that they are entitled to win on the merits,the district court stated on the current record,the court is simply not in a position to give either side a nod on the merits.indeed,there may exist factual disputes as to what,if anything,the state of delaware actually did in the past with respect to sports gambling or as to what,if any,proposed sports betting activities are exempted by the federal statute at issue.id.at.the district court also noted that the leagues suggested in their letter brief that the court treat their motion for preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment and questioned whether the leagues had demonstrated both the requisite irreparable harm and that the balance of the equities fell in their favor.see id.at.
on august to receipt of the district court memorandum leagues filed their notice of appeal.three days later,the leagues filed a motion to expedite their appeal and their opening brief.on august,delaware filed a motion to dismiss the appeal and its opposition to the leagues motion to expedite.on august,we granted the leagues motion to expedite,issued a briefing schedule,and set oral argument for august.
it is often noted that the wheels of justice move for good reason.as the procedural history of this case demonstrates,however,that is not always the case.when a party seeks injunctive relief,the stakes are high,time is of the essence,and a straightforward legal question is properly presented to us,prudence dictates that we answer that question with dispatch.
we begin,as always,by considering whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.the leagues claim we have jurisdiction under a,which provides courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from interlocutory orders of the district courts granting,continuing,modifying,refusing,or dissolving injunctions.emphasis added.the state disagrees,arguing that we must apply the test set forth in carson american brands,d,which requires the leagues to show that the district court denial of the motion for preliminary injunction will have a serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence and can be effectively challenged only by immediate appeal.id.at.see also stringfellow concerned neighbors in action,d.
in arguing that the leagues must establish the carson factors,delaware relies on dicta from some of our prior cases stating that both orders expressly denying injunctions and orders having the practical effect of denying injunctions must meet the carson test.see vuitton white,cir ross zavarella,cir.but none of the cases upon which delaware relies involved express denials of injunctive relief rather,they dealt with orders that were alleged to have the practical effect of denying injunctive relief.accordingly,the leagues need not demonstrate that the order will have a serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence and can be effectively challenged only by immediate appeal.see cohen bd.of trs.of of,cir.the language of a is clear and the leagues need not satisfy any jurisdictional hurdle beyond the fact that they have appealed from an order refusing to enter an injunction.
we next turn to the scope of our review under a.we have adopted a broad view of appellate jurisdiction under this section.see kershner mazurkiewicz,cir see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.jurisdiction of the interlocutory appeal under a is in large measure jurisdiction to deal with all aspects of the case that have been sufficiently illuminated to enable decision by the court of appeals without further trial court development.moreover,we have held that w hen an appeal is taken from an order made appealable by statute,we have all the powers with respect to that order listed in.united parcel,postal,cir.accordingly,we have broad authority to decide this case as appropriate under.
having determined that we have authority to address all aspects of this case,we must determine whether it is proper to exercise that authority.as a general rule,when an appeal is taken from the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction,the reviewing court will go no further into the merits than is necessary to decide the interlocutory appeal.callaway block,cir.this ordinarily requires that we review the decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,employing the standard test.see allegheny energy,dqe,cir.nevertheless,the supreme court has held the general rule of limited review is one of orderly judicial administration,not a limit on judicial power.thornburgh am.coll.of obstetricians gynecologists,d,overruled on other grounds by planned parenthood of se.casey,d.
in thornburgh,the supreme court considered whether this court properly exercised its jurisdiction in striking down portions of a pennsylvania statute following an appeal from the district court partial denial of a preliminary injunction.see id.at.the supreme court acknowledged that review of a preliminary injunction is normally limited to the injunction itself,but explained if a district court ruling rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law,and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance,that ruling may be reviewed even though the appeal is from the entry of a preliminary injunction.id.at the same time,the supreme court cautioned a different situation is presented when there is no disagreement as to the law,but the probability of success on the merits depends on facts that are likely to emerge at trial.id.at.in affirming this court decision to address the merits of the plaintiff case,the supreme court quoted from our opinion 
thus,although this appeal arises from a ruling on a request for a preliminary injunction,we have before us an unusually complete factual and legal presentation from which to address the important constitutional issues at stake.the customary discretion accorded to a district court ruling on a preliminary injunction yields to our plenary scope of review as to the applicable law.
id.at.quoting am.coll.of obstetricians gynecologists thornburgh,cir.
the approach taken in thornburgh has been embraced by a number of our sister courts of appeals.in an appeal from the grant of a preliminary injunction in campaign for family farms glickman,cir,the court of appeals for the eighth circuit exercised its discretion to reach the merits of the underlying dispute,determining that it was faced with a purely legal issue on a fixed record.id.at.the court explained t he considerations that caution against a broad scope of review in the usual interlocutory is,a tentative and provisional record with conflicting material are not present here.id.at.likewise,in solantic,llc city of neptune beach,cir,the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit assessed the merits of the plaintiff first amendment claim on appeal after the district court denied his request for a preliminary injunction.finding that the facts of the case were simple and straightforward,and the record need ed no explanation,id.at,the court explained that we do not think it necessary or prudent to confine our opinion to holding that the plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits,when it is altogether clear that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits of its first amendment claims,id.at emphasis in original.finally,in doe sundquist,cir,the court of appeals for the sixth circuit considered the merits of the plaintiffs claim following a denial of their preliminary injunction motion.the court noted that i f an issue unaddressed by the district court is presented with sufficient clarity and completeness and its resolution will materially advance the progress of the litigation,consideration of that issue is proper.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court explained that t he sort of judicial restraint that is normally warranted on interlocutory appeals does not prevent us from reaching clearly defined issues in the interest of judicial economy.id.citation omitted.
in light of thornburgh and its progeny,we must determine whether the record in this appeal presents a pure question of law that is intimately related to the merits of the grant or denial of preliminary injunctive relief,united parcel,at,or whether the leagues probability of success on the merits depends on facts that are likely to emerge at trial,thornburgh,at.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that this case falls into the former category.
in denying the leagues motion for preliminary injunction,the district court hypothesized that there may exist factual disputes as to what,if anything,the state of delaware actually did in the past with respect to sports gambling or as to what,if any,proposed sports betting activities are exempted by the federal statute at issue.markell,wl,at emphasis added.contrary to the district court supposition,we have reviewed the record and can not find any material issues of fact in dispute.as the leagues rightly argue,judge stapleton opinion in nfl is the definitive word regarding the scope and extent of delaware gambling scheme as it was conducted in the state neither challenged judge stapleton findings years ago nor does so now.likewise,the parties do not dispute the scope and extent of the sports gambling scheme that delaware intends to implement on september.as counsel for delaware properly and candidly conceded at oral argument,the state intends to conduct widespread betting on both professional and college sports beyond the scope of the parlays permitted in.in sum,the parties agree upon what delaware did in and what delaware intends to do now.given the absence of any disputed issue of material confirmed by both parties at oral conclude that this case does not turn on a legal issue that might be seen in any different light after final hearing,united parcel,at,and is ripe for adjudication as a matter of law.therefore,we will proceed to assess the merits of the leagues claim that delaware sports betting scheme violates paspa 
we begin our legal analysis with the statutory language.paspa prohibits any person or governmental entity from sponsoring,operating,advertising or promoting 
a lottery,sweepstakes,or other betting,gambling,or wagering scheme based,directly or indirectly through the use of geographical references or otherwise,on one or more competitive games in which amateur or professional athletes participate,or are intended to participate,or on one or more performances of such athletes in s
