once again we confront the question whether a police officer use of force during the arrest of an unarmed citizen was sufficiently excessive to violate the citizen constitutional rights.officer david miller of the las vegas metropolitan police department responded to a call from the las vegas club hotel casino informing him that security personnel had encountered frankie davis reading a magazine in an area of the casino not open to the public.after davis,who had been handcuffed by casino employees and remained handcuffed throughout his encounter with officer miller,refused to consent to being searched by the officer,miller slammed him into a wall several times,pinned him against the floor,and punched him in the face.at some point during this encounter,miller fractured davis neck.davis was unarmed at all times 
davis filed suit against officer miller and other defendants under,alleging that miller used excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment in effecting his arrest.he also brought a claim against miller under nevada battery statute.the district court granted miller motion for summary judgment as to both claims on the basis of qualified immunity and davis appealed.we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment as to both claims and remand for a trial on the merits.
background 
the facts,according to davis and the independent witnesses who support his version of the events,are as follows on november,security officer shane mundell,a casino employee,found frankie davis reading a magazine while sitting atop a stairwell in a area of the establishment.mundell radioed for backup and fellow security officer richard mabe responded shortly thereafter.mabe instructed davis to descend two flights of stairs and to approach the security officers.davis complied.
while davis was coming down the stairs,mabe pulled out a set of handcuffs.davis initially protested that handcuffs were unnecessary,but after mabe and mundell informed him that the handcuffs were for everyone safety and that they intended to merely escort him off the property,davis voluntarily placed his hands behind his back and was handcuffed by mundell.
davis was then escorted to the casino security office and placed in a holding area.a casino employee contacted the las vegas metropolitan police department,informed the dispatcher that they had someone in custody,and requested that an officer be sent to the scene.officer miller eventually arrived at the casino security office in response to the call,walked into the holding area,ordered davis to stand,and confirmed that he was in handcuffs.miller then patted davis down and asked him if he could search his pockets.davis declined to consent,but informed miller that he was unarmed,a fact that miller was already aware of as the result of the patdown.
notwithstanding davis refusal to consent to a search,miller attempted to reach inside davis left pocket to retrieve davis wallet.davis rotated his hips away from miller in an attempt to prevent him from grabbing the wallet.miller then pushed davis into a corner,pinning him against the wall,and again reached for the wallet.davis pushed off the wall toward miller,and the two engaged in a brief pushing and pulling match.officer miller then spun davis around and pushed him out of the holding area and into an adjacent hallway.he then slammed davis against the wall opposite the holding area,and then swung him into another wall,also.one of these impacts left a sizable dent in the wall sheet rock.miller then threw davis onto the floor causing davis teeth to strike the floor.he landed on top of davis,and placed his knee on davis back.davis began wiggling and attempted to slide out from underneath miller because he was in pain.miller then turned davis over and punched him in the face.in the course of miller actions,he fractured davis neck.
ultimately,davis stopped moving.officer miller completed his search,pulled davis up from the floor,escorted him off the property,placed him in a patrol car,and transported him to the las vegas city jail.during the ride to the jail,davis told miller that he was in a great deal of pain.upon arrival at the jail,miller arranged for davis to be held pending the filing of charges for obstructing a police officer.davis was subsequently transported to university medical center by jail personnel,where he was diagnosed with a neck fracture.
the police department internal affairs bureau conducted an investigation of the incident and issued a report in which it concluded that officer miller did not use the minimal amount of force necessary and had options other than punching the suspect in the face who was on the ground in handcuffs.accordingly,the department suspended officer miller for ten hours and ordered him to participate in use of force training.
in january of,davis filed suit against miller and other defendants,asserting,inter alia,a claim for use of excessive force and a state law battery claim against miller.miller and other defendants filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted miller motion for summary judgment in full.ruling from the bench,the court reasoned that summary judgment should be granted as to davis excessive force claim because it not clearly excessive force,and thus it not so clear that officer miller is not entitled to qualified immunity.he entitled to qualified immunity,and he,therefore,dismissed from the case.as to davis state law battery claim,the court ruled as follows let see,officer miller,the state law claims,they were all discretionary.he entitled to immunity on those claims as well.
on june,the court entered an order granting summary judgment to officer miller and his supervising officer,and granting partial summary judgment to the department.davis then requested certification of the order pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the court granted the request,certified the order,and entered judgment in favor of officer miller and his supervising officer.davis then filed this timely appeal challenging the grant of summary judgment to miller.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.

standard of review 
a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.buono norton,cir.its decision as to whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity is likewise reviewed de novo.bingham city of manhattan beach,cir.
b.the section claim 
davis principal argument on appeal is that the district court erred in concluding that officer miller was entitled to qualified immunity with respect to his excessive force claim.specifically,davis argues that his fourth amendment rights were violated when officer miller fractured his neck by slamming him into a wall several times and punching him in the face while he was pinned to the floor,and that a reasonable officer in miller position would have known that his conduct was unlawful.
in saucier katz,the supreme court held that a court should determine whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity by first deciding whether,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right,d citing siegert gilley,d.if so,the court must determine whether the right violated was clearly established such that it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.citing wilson layne,d.if we conclude that both of these inquiries are answered in the affirmative,the officer is not entitled to qualified immunity.id.at.
in assessing an excessive force claim,we must first identify the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed by the challenged application of force the validity of the claim must then be judged by reference to the specific constitutional standard which governs that right.graham connor,d.here,davis claims that officer miller violated his rights under the fourth amendment a fourth amendment claim of excessive force is analyzed under the framework outlined by the supreme court in graham connor.smith city of hemet,cir en banc.under graham,all claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive or the course of an arrest,investigatory stop,or other seizure should be analyzed under the fourth amendment and its reasonableness standard.at.this analysis requires balancing the nature and quality of the intrusion on a person liberty with the countervailing governmental interests at stake to determine whether the force used was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.smith,at.thus,w e first assess the quantum of force used to arrest the plaintiff and then measure the governmental interests at stake by evaluating a range of factors.deorle rutherford,cir.factors we consider in assessing the government interests at stake include the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.graham,at.courts may also consider the availability of alternative methods of capturing or subduing a suspect.smith,at.
davis contends that an analysis of officer miller conduct under the graham factors demonstrates that miller decision to slam the handcuffed davis into a wall several times and to punch him in the face while he was immobilized on the ground was unreasonable.specifically,he argues that trespassing on the casino premises and obstructing a police officer are relatively minor offenses he did not pose an immediate threat to officer miller or anyone else because he was handcuffed,surrounded by several security guards,and was not carrying any weapons he was not actively resisting arrest or attempting to flee but was instead resisting miller unlawful attempts to seize his wallet and miller punched him in the face when he was already sprawled flat on the floor with his hands cuffed behind him.
this is hardly the first case in which we have analyzed similar claims of excessive force by police officers.in smith city of hemet,for example,a resident of that city alleged that police officers used excessive force when they responded to a call from his wife,who claimed that he was physically abusing her.at.the responding officers were aware that smith was unarmed and that he was in his pajamas,but they nonetheless slammed smith against the wall,threw him to the ground,slid him off the porch while face down,him repeatedly,and either permitted or instructed a police dog to attack him on three occasions,at least one such attack occurring while the officers had him pinned to the ground.id.at internal citation omitted.smith filed an action against the officers claiming that they had used excessive force in subduing and arresting him.id.at.the district court granted the officers motion for summary judgment.id.at.on appeal,we reversed,explaining that 
b ecause the excessive force inquiry nearly always requires a jury to sift through disputed factual contentions,and to draw inferences therefrom,we have held on many occasions that summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law in excessive force cases should be granted sparingly this is because such cases almost always turn on a jury credibility determinations.
id.at internal quotations omitted second alteration in original.analyzing the officer conduct in light of the graham factors and accepting smith version of the facts as correct,we determined that smith did not pose an immediate threat because he was unarmed and in his pajamas,notwithstanding the fact that,prior to being handcuffed,he disregarded the officers orders,refused to put up his hands,and was shouting expletives.id.at.second,we stated that an allegation of domestic violence did not warrant the conclusion that smith was a particularly dangerous criminal or that his offense was especially egregious.id.at.third,we noted that although smith continued to ignore the officers orders and physically resisted arrest,he did not attack the officers or show any signs of fleeing the area.id.at.finally,we considered the availability of alternative methods of capturing or subduing a suspect,concluding that the officers could and should have used control holds to complete the arrest rather than sic cing the canine on him once they had him restrained on the ground.id.
here,as in smith,an assessment of the facts in the light most favorable to davis shows that his fourth amendment rights were violated.we start our analysis by assessing the quantum of force used against davis.we do so because the factors articulated in graham,and other factors bearing on the reasonableness of a particular application of force are not to be considered in a vacuum but only in relation to the amount of force used to effect a particular seizure.id.at quoting chew gates,cir.looking at the facts in the light we must for purposes of this appeal,officer miller use of force was extremely severe.after davis refused to consent to being searched,miller forcefully slammed him against a wall,and then swung him into another wall,also,thereby breaking his neck.officer miller then threw davis onto the floor,placed his knee on his back,and then turned him over and punched him in the face.
next,we must assess the governmental interest that might justify the use of such force under the graham factors,starting with an assessment of the severity of the crime at issue.graham,at.trespassing and obstructing a police officer,as those offenses were committed by davis,are by no means such serious offenses as to provide an officer with a reasonable basis for subduing a person by the means employed by officer miller.indeed,these offenses are much less serious than the domestic violence offense at issue in smith,which we held did not warrant the conclusion that the plaintiff was a particularly dangerous criminal or that his offense was especially egregious.id.at.here,too,the nature of the crime s at issue provide little,if any,basis for the officer s use of physical force.id.at.
second,we assess whether the suspect pose d an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or others.graham,at.here,davis posed no immediate threat to officer miller or to anyone else.davis was unarmed,in handcuffs,and never attempted to harm miller or anyone else in any way.indeed,even if davis had wanted to harm miller,it would have been difficult for him to do so given that he was in handcuffs,was confined within a small area,and was surrounded by security guards.thus,nothing in the record suggests that davis posed an immediate threat to miller safety or to that of anyone else.
next we consider whether davis was actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.graham,at.although davis was somewhat uncooperative and resisted officer miller attempts to search his pockets,at no point during the encounter did he attempt to flee,nor could he have done so in light of the fact that he was in handcuffs,surrounded by security guards,and confined in a small holding area.thus,davis was neither actively resisting arrest nor attempting to flee.
finally,we consider whether miller could have used other methods to accomplish the search of davis pocket,smith,at chew,at,assuming that he had lawful cause to do so.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to davis,it is clear that other,less abusive methods of conducting the search were available.miller could have attempted to persuade davis to submit to the search,could have obtained the assistance of the security guards who were present,could have used less force than he did in seeking to attain his objective,or,having already conducted a,could have simply waited to conduct the search until he had delivered davis to the jail.indeed,miller was reprimanded by the police department because he did not use the minimal amount of force necessary and had options other than punching the suspect in the face who was on the ground in handcuffs to gain compliance.
in sum,the force used by officer miller was severe,the crime davis had committed was minor,the danger to officer miller was minimal as was any risk of flight,and there were many less abusive means through which miller could have accomplished his objective.thus,weighing the severity of the force used against the governmental interests at stake,we have no difficulty in concluding that the facts here
