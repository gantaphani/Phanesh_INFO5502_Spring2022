plaintiff and appellant san pasqual band of mission indians san pasqual appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants and respondents state of california and the california gambling control commission the state.in september,san pasqual and the state entered into a written contract the compact governing san pasqual operation of a casino on its land in san diego county.san pasqual contends the compact authorized it to operate up to a maximum of slot machines at its casino,but the state wrongfully refused for several years to issue it the requisite number of gaming licenses,resulting in of lost profits.
san pasqual filed two lawsuits against the state that were consolidated,alleging breach of contract and seeking damages for five years of lost profits.the state successfully obtained summary judgment in the consolidated action on the grounds a provision in the compact bars monetary damages as a remedy to either party in any action arising under the compact.san pasqual contends the court misinterpreted the provision,failed to consider admissible extrinsic evidence relevant to a proper interpretation of the provision,and erroneously resolved disputed factual issues.
factual and procedural background 
despite the large volume of materials presented in the appellate record,this appeal raises a relatively narrow issue it challenges only the one ground upon which the trial court granted summary judgment.bearing in mind the limited scope of this appeal,we limit our recitation of the evidence and procedural history to that which is relevant to the issue raised on appeal.
historical background and relevant federal law 
to provide context for the parties dispute and our discussion,we summarize the background facts,relevant federal law regarding tribal gaming and prior related litigation.
in,congress passed the indian gaming regulatory act the act et,in part,to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments.the act divides gaming into three classes.at issue here is class iii gaming which includes slot machines and other electronic gaming devices.b.in order for an indian tribe to conduct class iii gaming on its land,the act requires a written contract or tribal compact,authorizing such gaming,between that tribe and the state in which its land is located.d c.the act also requires that the state generally permits such gaming for any purpose by any person,organization,or entity.d b.
california constitution provides that the legislature has no power to authorize,and shall prohibit casinos of the type currently operating in nevada and new jersey.cal,art.iv,e.after the passage of the act,the state therefore took the position that it need not negotiate with tribes pursuant to the act for the right to conduct class iii gaming,because such gaming was not generally permitted in california within the meaning of the act.coyote valley band of pomo indians california cir,coyote valley.
a coalition of california tribes drafted and put on the november state ballot proposition authorizing class iii gaming on tribal land.coyote valley,supra,at.proposition passed and was codified at government code sections through.however,the supreme court concluded proposition was invalid because it conflicted with the constitutional prohibition against gaming in article iv,section,subdivision e.hotel employees restaurant employees international union davis cal th.
concerned that several tribes had already put some gaming devices into operation and would be vulnerable to federal prosecution coyote valley,supra,at,davis began negotiations with california tribes pursuant to the act id.at.the state also proposed a constitutional amendment allowing for gaming on indian lands proposition.to facilitate the negotiations,california tribes formed three negotiating teams,including the united tribe compact steering committee the committee.coyote valley,at.the committee was composed of approximately tribes,including san pasqual.the committee proposed the model compact contained in proposition as its opening offer.ibid.
in september,after several months of negotiations,the state executed tribal compacts with tribes throughout california,including san pasqual.proposition,the constitutional amendment allowing gaming on tribal lands,passed in march.cal,art.iv,subd.f.
the tribal compacts were substantively identical and authorized class iii gaming.cachil dehe band of wintun indians of the colusa indian community california cir,colusa ii.the tribal compacts provided that those tribes that already had gaming devices in operation could continue to operate those existing devices as a matter of right.for tribes,like san pasqual,that did not have gaming devices in operation as of september,the compacts specified they were entitled to operate up to gaming devices as a matter of right.compact.colusa ii,at.for each additional gaming device a tribe sought to operate,up to a maximum of,the tribe had to apply for a license.a separate license was required for each individual device.licenses would be allocated to tribes from a statewide pool of licenses according to a detailed draw process.calussa ii,at.
the license draws were initially operated by a third party entity.colusa ii,supra,at.in,following complaints regarding the accounting and administration of the draws,davis issued an executive order creating the california gambling control commission to take over the license draw process.ibid.
shortly thereafter,a dispute arose between the state and the tribes,including san pasqual,about the total number of licenses that were available for distribution among the compact tribes.the tribal compacts did not specify what that number would be,but instead,set forth a formula,in section.of the compact,for calculating that number the state adopted an interpretation of section.that authorized a license pool of licenses.colussa ii,supra,at.
san pasqual,along with several other tribes,sought declaratory relief in federal court the tribes agreed that the formula in section.of the compact set a ceiling on the total number of licenses available statewide,but contended the state was unreasonably interpreting the formula to arrive at a low number that deprived tribes of their full allotment of slot machines.colusa ii,supra,at.in colusa ii,the ninth circuit determined the total number of licenses that could be issued statewide through the license draw process was,providing for an additional licenses to be distributed statewide to eligible tribes.id.at.
during the time the state maintained its position that only licenses were available in the pool,san pasqual submitted multiple applications seeking to obtain its full allotment of licenses.san pasqual submitted applications in the draws held in september,july,december,october,october,august,october and december.san pasqual received licenses in the october draw,but as of,it was still short licenses.
san pasqual obtained licenses in the october license draw resulting in its ability to finally operate slot machines at its casino.
the september compact between san pasqual and the state 
the compact between the state and san pasqual is pages long.san pasqual chairperson,allen lawson,was san pasqual primary tribal representative during the negotiations,and he signed the compact on behalf of san pasqual.then governor davis executed the compact on behalf of the state and the legislature ratified it thereafter,subd.a.the compact became effective in may,when the secretary of the interior published approval of the executed compact in the federal register in accordance with the act.d a.may.
the parties dispute the meaning and purpose of section of the compact,a subdivision of section which covers dispute resolution.because section must be read in context,and not in isolation,we set forth the full text of section.
dispute resolution provisions.

procedural history 
san pasqual filed two lawsuits in los angeles superior court,that were consolidated,seeking damages for lost profits allegedly caused by the state breach of the compact.san pasqual sought lost profits of related to the december license draw,and an additional in lost profits related to all of the draws between july and december in which it failed to obtain the full number of licenses for which it applied.
thereafter,the state filed a motion for summary judgment in the consolidated action,raising numerous grounds,including that section of the compact barred both san pasqual and the state from seeking compensatory damages in any action brought under the compact.the court granted the state motion on that ground,denying the balance of the motion.judgment was entered in favor of the state on february.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
san pasqual contends the state breached the compact by refusing to issue it the full number of gaming licenses to which it was entitled under the compact during the license draws conducted between and.san pasqual contends it suffered monetary damages in the form of lost profits for those years in which it could not operate its full complement of slot machines in accordance with the compact.san pasqual argues the contract claim for damages is not barred by section because that section only waives sovereign immunity and is not a waiver of the right to damages.san pasqual contends the provision is therefore not relevant to any claim for breach of contract because the state enjoys no immunity for the breach of a contract to which it is a party.we agree with the state that section is unambiguous,applies to this action,and bars san pasqual damages claim.
we independently review an order granting summary judgment.shugart regents of university of california th.the dispositive issue on summary judgment below was the interpretation of section.the trial court determined that issue as a matter of law,finding the provision was not ambiguous and that to the extent san pasqual offered evidence to explain the meaning of the provision,it was not relevant.the trial court determination of whether an ambiguity exists is a question of law,subject to independent review on appeal.benach county of los angeles th.on issues of contractual interpretation where there is no conflicting extrinsic evidence,the appellate court is not bound by the trial court interpretation and will decide the issue de novo.accord,titan group sonoma valley county sanitation district d.
w e are permitted to consider extrinsic evidence when interpreting the compact as a matter of law if the language of the provisions is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation of the party proffering the evidence.citation.we use a process to determine whether extrinsic evidence passes the reasonable susceptibility barrier.colusa ii,supra,at.first,the court considers,without admitting,credible evidence concerning the parties intentions to determine whether the language is reasonably susceptible to a party interpretation second,if the language is reasonably susceptible to the party interpretation,the extrinsic evidence is admitted to aid interpreting the contract if the language at issue is not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by the party,extrinsic evidence should not be considered.id.at accord,wolf walt disney pictures television th,wolf,citations omitted.
the only extrinsic evidence of intent offered was the declaration of allen lawson,san pasqual chairperson.lawson attested that a t the time the compact was signed san pasqual did not intend to waive any right to obtain damages if san pasqual was wrongfully refused gaming device licenses.the proffered evidence fails,under the first step of our analysis,to qualify as relevant evidence.e vidence of the undisclosed subjective intent of the parties is irrelevant to determining the meaning of contractual language.citation.rather,it is the outward manifestation or expression of assent that is controlling.berman bromberg th,italics added.
accordingly,we are tasked with independently reviewing section and construing its meaning and purpose as a matter of law,without consideration of extrinsic evidence.general principles of federal contract law govern our interpretation of the compact which was entered into pursuant to the act.colusa ii,supra,at.but,i n practical terms,we rely on california contract law and ninth circuit decisions interpreting california law because we discern no difference between california and federal contract law.citation.ibid.
when,as here,a contract is reduced to writing,the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone,if possible.the intent of the contracting parties is ordinarily a legal question determined solely by reference to the contract terms.wolf,supra,th at.in other words,in reviewing a written contract,we look to the objective manifestation of the parties intent as expressed by the language of the agreement.the language of a contract is to govern its interpretation,if the language is clear and explicit,and does not involve an absurdity.further,a contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting,so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful,italics added.
it is well established that p arties may,by contract,limit the remedies available to them in the event of breach.corbin on contracts ed.this includes agreeing to limit or forgo certain remedies.see also united states winstar corporation,fn,italics added,citing rest d of contracts,comm.a every breach of contract gives the injured party a right to damages against the party in breach unless the parties by agreement vary the rules accord,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts,the contract may specify particular remedies to be available in the event of a breach,in addition to or in substitution for those otherwise afforded by law.
in relevant part,section a of the compact provides in the event that a dispute is to be resolved in federal court or a state court of competent jurisdiction as provided in this section,the state and the tribe expressly consent to be sued therein and waive any immunity therefrom that they may have provided that the dispute is limited solely to issues arising under this gaming compact neither side makes any claim for monetary damages that is,only injunctive,specific performance,including enforcement of a provision of this compact requiring payment of money to one or another of the parties,or declaratory relief is sought and no person or entity other than the tribe and the state is party to the action.
section a of the compact by its plain terms is a waiver of damages provision.san pasqual contends the placement of the damage waiver language after the phrase provided that reflects an intent by the parties to limit its application to only those actions where a waiver of sovereign immunity and consent to suit is required.san pasqual argues since the state is not immune from liability for breach of the compact,it has no immunity to waive,so the waiver of damages does not apply.
san pasqual relies primarily on hall university of nevada cal d hall,a case involving a claim of sovereign immunity from tort liability.we emphasize,the case did not involve a contractual waiver of liability for damages.there,the supreme court reversed an order quashing service on the state of nevada and its university.id.at.a california resident had sued the two defendants for damages arising from an auto accident caused by a university employee driving a car in california within the course and scope of his employment.ibid.the supreme court concluded that nevada did not enjoy sovereign immunity from suit in california for such a claim.id.at.in so concluding,the supreme court found it unnecessary to consider the parties dispute whether nevada had abrogated sovereign immunity by statute,or whether the statute in dispute only permitted suits in nevada,because there was no immunity from liability for nevada activities in california.id.at,fn.t he extent to which nevada has waived immunity by statute and the extent,if any,to which it can or has limited the statutory waiver is immaterial.ibid.
hall did not involve parties to a written contract who had negotiated specific provisions for the waiver of immunity provided there was no claim for monetary damages.we do not find hall instructive at all,nor do we agree with san pasqual characterization of section a of the compact.giving the damage waiver provision a fair reading,we find it to be an unambiguous bilateral provision,applicable when either party resorts to a judicial forum for resolving any dispute arising under the compact.such a construction is reasonable given the context surrounding the formation of the compact entered into by two independent sovereigns.section must be viewed within that broader context,a contract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made,and the matter to which it relates.
by design,the act limits the permissible negotiating topics between a state and a tribe in order to ensure that compacts cover only those topics that are related to gaming and are consistent with the act stated purposes.rincon band of luiseno mission indians of the rincon reservation state of california cir,fn.omitted.of relevance here,the act expressly identifies remedies for breach of contract as one of the permissible negotiating topics for the parties to resolve in crafting a tribal compact.d c v see also,rincon,at,the act anticipates a very specific exchange of rights and obligations.as the supreme court recently noted,a tribal compact under the act typically prescribes rules for operating gaming,allocates law enforcement authority between the tribe and state,and provides remedies for breach of the agreement terms.michigan bay mills indian community,italics added bay mills.
both section and section acknowledge the import of the fact the compact is an agreement between two sovereign entities.section provides in relevant part that the terms of this gaming compact are designed and intended to a evidence the goodwill and cooperation of san pasqual and state in fostering a mutually respectful relationship that will serve the mutual interests of the parties.section,the first paragraph of the dispute resolution section,provides in recognition of the relationship of san pasqual and the state,the parties shall make their best efforts to resolve disputes that occur under this gaming compact by good faith negotiations whenever pos
