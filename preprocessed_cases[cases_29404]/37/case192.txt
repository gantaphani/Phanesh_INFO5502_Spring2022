we have on appeal a decision of a district court of appeal declaring invalid a state statute.state dep t of bus.prof l reg.gulfstream park racing ass n,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.the issue before this court is whether section,florida statutes supp,is unconstitutional as a special law enacted in the guise of a general law and without compliance with the specific requirements for the enactment of special laws.we affirm and approve the holding of the district court that this statute is an unconstitutional special law because there was no reasonable possibility that the classification used in the statute would ever apply to another area of the state after the statute was amended in 
facts and procedural history 
in april,the department of business and professional regulation the department filed an administrative complaint against gulfstream park racing association,gulfstream,alleging that it had engaged in an unauthorized exchange of intertrack wagering signals.gulfstream had been conducting horse races at its racetrack in hallandale and selling the live broadcasts of the races to pompano park racing,a harness racing track in pompano beach.the department contended that gulfstream was in violation of section,which prohibits gulfstream from selling its broadcasts within its market area,because it holds a thoroughbred racing permit and is within miles of at least two other horse race permitholders.
gulfstream filed an action for a declaratory judgment in the circuit court,challenging the provisions of section on a number of constitutional grounds.among the grounds was a claim that the statute was a special law and that it was not enacted according to the state constitutional requirements that apply to special laws.after taking evidence to determine the parties and areas of the state affected by the statute,the trial court concluded that section was unconstitutional as a special law enacted in the guise of a general law 
the plaintiff presented testimony sufficient to establish,and i now find,that there was at the time of enactment,during the entire time since enactment and is now precisely one area of the state where there are three or more horserace permitholders within miles of each other.the only area of the state where there are or were three horserace permitholders within miles of each other is the area of dade and broward counties that includes gulfstream,calder,pompano park and hialeah park.
section was enacted in,laws of florida.there is no suggestion within the enacting legislation of any purpose of the mile intertrack border other than the obvious carve out the market area as it existed when the statute was enacted.
although certainly not dispositive,this conclusion is consistent with the parties description of the negotiated legislative process that preceded enactment of the statute.neither party offered any legislative history to explain some public purpose served by limiting the intertrack wager authorization within the mile border.the most plausible explanation in the testimony was that there was no public policy that led to the mile intertrack border.the restrictions against intertrack wagering at gulfstream were simply what gulfstream was required to give up for various other benefits.this sort of local interest horsetrading is specifically prohibited by article iii section.
the preponderance of the evidence and florida legislative scheme supports the conclusion that the classification created by section was constitutionally closed at the time of its enactment and remains so.the legislature imposed the statutory geographic restrictions on permitholders.moreover,the legislature decreed that additional permits may only become effectual upon affirmative vote of the county electorate.thus,for the intertrack wagering restriction to expand the legislature must repeal the geographic permit limitations,an entity must apply for a permit and meet all of the rather daunting requirements,and the electorate of the county must approve the permit.it is unsurprising under these circumstances that section has since its enactment,applied to precisely one mile area of the state.
the classification was closed at the time of enactment and remains closed.to conclude otherwise would be to reduce article iii section to mere semantics.section applies only and can apply only to the market area and so constitutes a special law in violation of article iii,section of the florida constitution.
the department and intervenors vigorously argue the high standard that must be satisfied by a party seeking to overturn a statute.the only doubt injected in this matter comes from the statute use of the word any.it implies that there might be more than one.but the statutes themselves,together with conditions as they exist now and as they existed at the time of enactment leads to the conclusion that the classification,three or more horserace permitholders within miles of each other,was and is closed in the constitutional sense.
on appeal,the first district court of appeal affirmed the trial court decision that section violates article iii,section of the florida constitution,which states,no special law shall be passed unless notice of intention to seek enactment thereof has been published in the manner provided by general law unless the law is conditioned to become effective on the vote of the electors of the area affected.gulfstream,so d at 
in its opinion,the first district did its own constitutional analysis as to whether the classification created in section was limited to one geographic area or remained open 
when gulfstream park opened for business,the restrictions on the minimum distance between wagering facilities were much more lenient,and that is why it was possible for gulfstream to be one of three horse racing tracks within a mile radius of each other.however,these conditions do not exist at present,because the other sections of the wagering act now prohibit the issuance of permits for horse racing tracks this close together.section states in part,a n application may not be considered,nor may a permit be issued by the division or be voted upon in any county,to conduct horse races,harness horse races,or dograces at a location within one hundred miles of an existing facility.stat.
if a horse racing permit can not be issued at a location within one hundred miles of an existing wagering facility,then it is safe to say that there will not be a new area in florida that would have three or more horse racing permit holders within miles of each other.because new horse racing tracks would have to be at least one hundred miles apart,the conditions that trigger the statutory prohibition against intertrack wagering in section will not be replicated.
section was enacted in and has been in effect continuously since then to prohibit the issuance of a permit to conduct horse races within one hundred miles of an existing wagering facility.however,the prohibition in section against intertrack wagering in areas where there are three or more horse racing permit holders within miles of each other was enacted subsequently in.the timing of these two laws leads us to conclude that the purpose of the limit in section was merely to describe the area where gulfstream is located.it was,even at that time,the only area that could fit the description.
the evidence presented in this case plainly shows that there is no reasonable possibility that section will be applied in another area of the state.someone would have to obtain a thoroughbred permit in key west,which would then be subject to the prohibition against intertrack wagering in the statute only if two other quarter horse permits were issued in key west,and then only if all three horse racing tracks were located within miles of each other.alternatively,the department would have to issue a quarter horse permit in a mile area that includes an existing thoroughbred permit holder and at least one other horse racing permit holder.
these hypotheticals do not show that section has any real potential to apply to others.they are highly contrived situations that demonstrate no more than a technical possibility.the evidenc
