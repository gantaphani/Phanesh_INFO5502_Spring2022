in this case,the district court dismissed federal constitutional challenges to two south carolina statutes regulating video poker,on the ground that burford sun oil,mandated abstention.because resolution of these challenges neither requires a court to adjudicate difficult questions of state law,nor disrupts state efforts to establish through a complex regulatory process a coherent policy on a matter of substantial public concern,this case falls well outside the narrow category of cases to which burford abstention may apply.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the parties do not dispute the material facts.jimmy martin and lucky strike,llc collectively martin,brought this action against three south carolina officials in their official capacities robert stewart,chief of the state law enforcement division henry mcmaster,attorney general and ralph hoisington,solicitor of the ninth judicial circuit collectively the state.martin sought to enjoin enforcement of two south carolina statutes criminalizing certain device s pertaining to games of chance.ann.like all statutes regulating gambling enterprises,such legislation lies well within the state police power.johnson collins entm t,cir.martin does not contend to the contrary,nor does he assert that the south carolina statutes violate any state law or policy.rather,martin maintains that the challenged statutes violate the constitution of the united states.
the south carolina legislature enacted the provisions at issue in a amendment to south carolina gambling laws.see acts.the first provision,section makes it unlawful for a person to keep on his premises or operate certain gaming machines,including device s pertaining to games of chance.ann.a violation of this statute constitutes a misdemeanor,punishable by a fine not to exceed,imprisonment for no more than a year,or both.id.
the second challenged provision,section,directs law enforcement officers to seize machines prohibited by section and bring them before a county magistrate.ann.the magistrate must determine whether the machine violates any law and,if it does,order its destruction.id south carolina law entitles a machine owner to a hearing before a magistrate to determine the machine legality and to an appeal of that decision to higher courts.see mims amusement law enforcement.no mechanism exists for testing a particular machine legality.

in sum,a federal court may abstain under burford from its strict duty to exercise congressionally conferred jurisdiction,quackenbush,at,only when the importance of difficult questions of state law or the state interest in uniform regulation outweighs the federal interest in adjudicating the case at bar.the state recognizes that these principles control the abstention inquiry here and,with them in mind,we turn to the case at hand.
martin seeks a single remedy an injunction against the enforcement of sections and.he maintains that these statutes violate his due process and equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.specifically,martin argues that section,which provides for criminal penalties,is void for vagueness because it fails to give fair notice of forbidden conduct and allows arbitrary enforcement,thus violating the due process clause.he also contends that the failure of both statutes to provide a mechanism for determining the legality of an amusement device and the state discriminatory enforcement of these statutes violates the equal protection clause.
these claims present no difficult questions of state law whose importance outweighs the federal interest in adjudicating martin constitutional case.nor do these claims threaten a state interest in uniform regulation that outweighs the federal interest in adjudicating the case.accordingly,burford does not permit abstention here.
the due process challenge to section involves no difficult question of state law because,as the state itself recognizes,and in fact argues,section is well defined by the supreme court of south carolina many interpretations.brief of appellees at.see,sun light prepaid phonecard state,holding that a device pertain s to a game of chance because it contains an element of chance and is not part of a legitimate promotion to sell a product.
indeed,in state deangelis,the state court rejected a vagueness challenge to precisely the same language games of chance of whatever name or kind that martin targets,holding that a n analysis of the statute wording convinces us that a man of reasonable intelligence is given fair notice of the machines proscribed and that the statute can not be used in a capricious or discriminatory manner.thus,the state law component of a vagueness limiting constructions apply to the settled the state highest court has expressly held that the statutory text is to be given its ordinary meaning.the remaining the statute ordinary meaning is unconstitutionally a matter of federal law.thus,because state law is now clear and certain,burford abstention is inappropriate.county of allegheny frank mashuda,d see also.river,at.holding case does not fall within burford doctrine when state law appears to be settled.
for similar reasons,martin discriminatory enforcement claim presents no difficult question of state law.to prevail on that claim,martin must demonstrate that he was similarly situated to persons not prosecuted and a discriminatory purpose motivated this different treatment.see united states armstrong,d.the first inquiry requires a court to determine which video poker machines are prohibited by statute,but such an inquiry hardly involves a difficult state law question given that deangelis held that a person of reasonable intelligence is given fair notice of the machines proscribed.at.if the district court should determine that state law enforcement treats parties similarly situated under the statute differently,the remaining question is purely an impermissible purpose motivated this different treatment.
finally,martin claim regarding the lack of a mechanism for determining a machine legality presents no state law question at all because indisputably south carolina provides no mechanism.thus,resolving this claim involves no interpretation of any state law,but only the determination of whether settled south carolina law violates federal constitutional rights.therefore,none of martin challenges presents difficult questions of state law,let alone difficult questions whose importance outweighs the federal interest in adjudicating martin claims 
nor do any of martin claims threaten a state interest in uniform regulation.martin launches a facial attack on the state statutes as a the sort of case federal courts often and expertly entertain.see alliance of am.insurers cuomo,cir declining to abstain under burford when case is a direct challenge to the constitutionality of a state statute,a controversy federal courts are particularly suited to adjudicate.if martin should succeed,the district court would enjoin all enforcement of the statutes at issue such relief could not possibly threaten their uniform application 
moreover,contrary to the state suggestion,brief of appellees at,there is,of course,no doctrine requiring abstention merely because resolution of a federal question may result in the overturning of a state policy.zablocki redhail,d.therefore,the threat that the federal courts might decide the entire state system unconstitutional is not a valid justification for burford abstention.neufeld,at.rather,this sort of risk is present whenever one attacks a state law on constitutional grounds in a federal court.bath mem.hosp.me.health care fin.comm n,cir.
as breyer explained in refusing to abstain from deciding similar constitutional challenges to several state statutes 
the plaintiffs do not seek individualized review of fact or cost specific regulatory decision making.to the contrary,they attack the statute as it is written.permitting a federal court to decide this kind of constitutional claim would not interfere significantly with the workings of a lawful state system,as such intervention threatened in burford 
justice breyer words reflect an important distinction,which the state fails to recognize,between federal claims that rest on an alleged predicate violation of state law and those that do not.federal claims that rest on allegations that a state agency or private actors violated state law can sometimes undermine a state efforts to regulate the federal court interprets state law differently than the state enforcement agency or the state forum that would otherwise hear the dispute.when a federal claim rests on a violation of state law,we consider it a state law claim in federal law clothing.collins,at internal quotation marks omitted.because of the diminished federal interest in adjudicating such claims and the heightened threat they pose to uniform state regulation,federal courts have less interest at stake in adjudicating such claims and often abstain in such cases.see,burford,at.due process claim that state agency unreasonably applied state law collins,at civil rico claim dependent on violations of state law for predicate acts.
but federal claims,like those at issue here,which do not rest on finding a violation of state law,are federal not only in clothing,but also in fact.such claims are plainly federal in origin and nature,are independent of any state law violation,and do not threaten uniform state regulation.mcneese,at.the burford doctrine does not permit a federal court to abstain from deciding them.see,nopsi,at.holding burford abstention is not justified when primary claim is that state body violated federal law harper,at holding that a pplying burford here was inappropriate because,unlike collins,at,case involves a vital federal question the constitutionality of a state statute neufeld,at holding burford did not apply to claims challenging state statute on federal constitutional grounds.
because martin claims neither involve difficult questions of state law nor threaten a state interest in uniform regulation,the burford doctrine does not justify abstention here.
notwithstanding the state agreement as to the undisputed material facts and its acknowledgment of controlling legal principles,it insists that burford does require abstention in this case.the state position rests on two fundamental errors a serious mischaracterization of martin claims and an equally serious misreading of our opinion in collins.
first,the state iterates and reiterates that martin seeks to have classes and categories of machines declared legal under south carolina law or to have a federal court replace south carolina forfeiture system with a method of martin own choosing.brief of appellees at.these assertions,repeated at oral argument and at least ten times in the state brief,see id.at,are simply not accurate.martin seeks only injunctive relief prohibiting the enforcement of two state statutes,which he claims violate the united states constitution.
this would be a different case if martin had,in fact,sought a federal declaration that specific machines were lawful under south carolina law or a federal injunction seeking replacement of the state forfeiture mechanism with one of the court design.in such circumstances,adjudication of martin claims might lead a federal court to effectively commandeer south carolina enforcement efforts.collins,at.but,like the plaintiffs in a case in which the second circuit recently reversed a district court dismissal on burford grounds,martin does not collateral ly attack a final determination made by any state administrative agency or seek to influence a state administrative proceeding.dittmer,at.rather,like those plaintiffs,martin presents only a direct facial attack on the constitutionality of a state statute,the kind of controversy federal courts are particularly suited to adjudicate.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also baran port of beaumont navig,cir holding facial challenge to state statute on federal constitutional grounds does not implicate the policy concerns of burford and so abstention under that doctrine would be inappropriate.in sum,martin actual claims,unlike the fictional ones described by the state,are not proper candidates for burford abstention.
moreover,and just as significantly,the state misreads collins.to be sure,in collins we properly recognized that t he regulation of gambling enterprises lies at the heart of the state police power,at,and the case at hand,like collins,involves state regulation of gambling.
but we did not abstain in collins because it involved the regulation of that important state interest.abstention on that basis would be improper.neither collins nor any other case holds that burford abstention is appropriate whenever federal litigation affects an important state interest.indeed,both the supreme court and this court have specifically rejected the view that a strong state interest alone could justify burford abstention.see county of allegheny,at.rejecting the suggestion that abstention is justified any time a district court is called on to adjudicate a case involving the state power of eminent domain educ.state bd.for higher,cir acknowledging the important and sensitive nature of state educational regulation,but holding burford abstention rests on additional concerns beyond the mere presence of an important state administrative regime,concerns not present here see also hachamovitch de buono,cir noting numerous cases have indicated that burford abstention is not required even in cases where the state has a substantial interest if the state regulations violate the federal constitution.
instead,we abstained in collins because we concluded that the criteria for burford abstention were met.that is,federal adjudication there would require a federal court to answer disputed questions of state gaming law that powerfully impact the welfare of state citizens and the relief sought would effectively establish parallel federal and state oversight of the state video poker industry.collins,at,
in contrast,federal adjudication in this case would not require a federal court to answer disputed questions of state law,nor would the relief sought establish parallel federal and state oversight.although the statutes challenged here regulate gambling,unlike collins,issues of federal constitutionality of those statutes under the fourteenth this action.as we recognized in harper,at,burford abstention is inappropriate in such a situation.in harper we contrasted collins,in which issues of state law dominated,with a case involving precisely the same kind of vital federal question as that at issue challenge to the constitutionality of a state statute.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we concluded that the district court had abused its discretion in abstaining in such a case.id.so it is here.
contrary to the state apparent belief,collins did not create a abstention doctrine that forever insulates south carolina statutes regulating gambling from federal constitutional challenge.the district court abused its discretion in abstaining here under burford because adjudication of martin claims,unlike the claims advanced in collins,neither presents difficult questions of state law whose importance transcends the case at bar,nor threatens the state interest in uniform regulation.
although the dissent concedes that abstention must be carefully cabined,post at,and takes no issue with our statement of the burford doctrine,it would hold that the district court properly abstained here.it relies on factors totally irrelevant to the extraordinary and narrow burford doctrine,the absence of a federal gambling statute,the effect of the fourteenth amendment and on relations,the history of gambling regulation,the burdens of discovery,and the alleged federalization of gambling policy.the dissent fails to apply the actual burford doctrine because it it did so it would have to hold that the district court abused its discretion in abstaining here.
the dissent analysis appears to be motivated by its preference that cases like martin be brought in state court.see,post at i see no indication in this case that the south carolina state courts have defaulted in any fashion on their obligation to entertain federal constitutional challenges to the operation of state gambling laws.id.at t he sky will not fall whenever state courts resolve a federal question.although we share the dissent respect for our state colleagues,w hen a federal court is properly appealed to in a case over which it has by law jurisdiction,it is its duty to take such jurisdiction the right of a party plaintiff to choose a federal court where there is a choice can not be properly denied.england,at.quoting willcox,at.omission in original.martin chose to file his claims in a federal forum created by can not deny him that choice even if we disagree with it.
because martin claims do not meet the extraordinary and narrow criteria for burford abstention,the judgment of the district court is 
reversed and remanded.
there are few decisions more central to state authority than whether to allow legalized gambling,how extensively,and under what terms.plaintiffs lawsuit calls for both the interpretation of state law at the heart of the state regulatory scheme and an extensive inquiry into the state enforcement practices.while plaintiffs may certainly challenge south carolina exercise of its police powers as unconstitutional,the district court was within its authority to conclude that plaintiffs constitutional challenge would be most properly heard in state court.
congress has given no indication that it wishes to sweep most federal challenges to state gambling policy into federal court.i do not believe that the general grant of federal concurrent jurisdiction in manifests any congressional intention to abrogate the discretion of federal district courts to defer under burford to the complex state administrative and judicial mechanisms involved in regulating gambling enterprises.
and it is not only congressional intent that i believe has been offended.in holding that the district court abused its discretion by abstaining,the majority diminishes the capacity of trial courts to perform the judicious balancing that lies at the heart of any exercise of equitable discretion.the majority also disrespects the role of state courts while we properly defer to federal administrative agencies under chevron step two,somehow the federal courts are now to be prohibited from showing even a lessened deference to state administrative and judicial systems operating in their own areas of expertise.further,because federal courts will make an understandable effort to avoid inconsistency and interference with the states,the majority approach will also in time shortchange litigants.finally,the majority diminishes the values of our federal system,which can hardly be served in this most traditional area of state competence by having the federal appellate courts call the shots.i am at a loss to understand what aims of law are furthered when the federal circuit courts undercut the legitimate institutional interests of so many other actors within our legal system.
this dispute is not confined simply to the case at hand.it touches on the basic application of abstention principles to state regulatory regimes in the most sensitive areas of state issue that has been rife with conflicting approaches.l ower courts continue to disagree as to when burford abstention is appropriate.erwin chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction,at nn.ed.confusion over the scope of burford abounds gordon young,federal court abstention and state administrative law from burford to ankenbrandt,depaul.
in the gambling context,specifically,similar confusion reigns,with some courts refusing to abstain,and others deciding abstention is appropriate when a federal court is confronted with challenges to state gambling laws.compare hotel rest.employees bartenders int l union local danziger,cir,judgment vacated on other grounds by brown hotel rest.employees bartenders int l union local,d refusing to apply burford abstention to challenges to portions of state gambling scheme turf paradise.downs,cir same with johnson collins entm t,cir abstaining under burford from deciding challenges to state gambling regime,midwest gaming,d same metro riverboat,bally louisiana,d same diamond game enter.howland,wl same.while factual differences no doubt exist between these cases,there is a basic divide between those who believe burford abstention has some modest utility in the face of constitutional challenges to state regulatory regimes and those who do not 
i see no indication in this case that the south carolina state courts have defaulted in any fashion on their obligation to entertain federal constitutional challenges to the operation of state gambling laws.i see no way in this case to avoid the interpretation of difficult questions of state law and interference with state regulatory policies.i see no sign in this case that interpretation of the terms of any federal statute involving gambling is at issue or that congress has done anything to remove the choice among different approaches to gambling regulation from its historic venue in the states.
given the absence of any specific manifestation of congressional jurisdictional intent in the area of gambling,i remain unconvinced that the general expression of federal jurisdictional authority pursuant to is enough to divest district courts of their discretion to accord respect to state regulatory choices regarding gaming policy and state court review of those choices.while i recognize that the fourteenth amendment and federal and state relationships including the relationships between federal and state courts in the most fundamental way,i do not think it these relationships to such an extent as to render burford abstention virtually inapplicable to all constitutional challenges in federal court to specialized state regulatory regimes.i see nothing to justify the majority holding that no reasonable district court could,in these circumstances,stay its hand.
federal courts have reason to tread cautiously in addressing a state regulation of gambling,because such schemes of regulation lie at the heart of the state police power.collins,at.in fact,few activities have been so consistently treated as being at the core of state sovereignty.id.south carolina,in particular,has long exercised its police power in this area,developing over time a complex and comprehensive system to regulate gambling activity.
the supreme court has treated the regulation of gambling as a quintessential state function for more than a century.see united states edge broad,d posadas de puerto rico assocs.tourism of puerto rico,d marvin trout.our circuit has recognized police power authority in this area time and again.see,helton hunt,cir casino ventures stewart,cir.the authority of the states as to gambling is a matter of broad consensus among our sister circuits.see gulfstream park racing ass tampa bay downs,cir the regulation of gambling lies at the heart of the state police power.quoting collins,at united states washington,cir the enactment of gambling laws is clearly a proper exercise of the state police power in an effort to promote the public welfare.medina rudman,cir same boynton ellis,cir same.
state control over gambling has also been reinforced by congress.while federal interests may sometimes be affected by,for instance,when casinos are established on indian reservations or in united states has generally sought to extend,not curb,state police power in this field.casino ventures,at.
in exercising their police power,states may reasonably conclude that gambling brings an increase in local crime,the fostering of prostitution,the development of corruption,and the infiltration of organized crime.posadas,at.they may also conclude that gambling fosters addiction and exploits human weakness,drawing down the assets of those who can least afford to gamble money away.see collins,at posadas,at.
at the same time,states often invoke the police power to control gambling rather than prohibit it.states may well conclude that permitting gambling enhances public welfare by allowing citizens free choice in their recreational pursuits and by spurring economic growth through business enterprises.in addition,gambling can generate tax revenue that may fund schools,public works,and other government programs.see collins,at.states may also conclude that legalized gambling is a lesser evil,believing the activity harms can best be harnessed when the activity is subject to regulation and kept in plain view.
the diversity of views towards gambling has given rise to schemes of regulation that are nearly as varied as the states establishing them.several and hawaii,for commercial gambling altogether.see utah const.art.vi,hawaii stat.many than,as of gambling in the form of lotteries.national gambling impact study commission final report ngisc report,available at.edu ngisc reports fullrpt.html,page last visited july.some states,such as nevada,new jersey,and mississippi,have gone further,permitting privately run gambling within their borders.and there are variations even among these.nevada,for instance,allows slot machines virtually anywhere,including at airports and supermarkets.on the other hand,mississippi and new jersey concentrate legalized gambling in limited areas,the former restricting gambling to coastal counties and riverboats,and the latter restricting gambling to atlantic city alone.ngisc report.regardless of the particular scheme,states that allow legalized gambling impose a unique mix of controls on gambling venues,including licensing requirements,number,size,and type of site standards,and advertising limitations.
i would be to identify any field of regulation about which there is broader or deeper consensus on the appropriateness of state control.
for decades,the south carolina general assembly has sought to balance the revenue gained from licensing and taxation of gambling against the social costs of gambling addiction.collins,at.in doing so,the general assembly has tried a number of plans to determine the appropriate level of gambling control,and has developed numerous mechanisms to enforce its regulations.the south carolina general assembly initially banned all gambling,with the exception of coin operated nonpayout machines with a free play feature as long as the machines did not disburse money or property to a player.ann.amended to delete the word property,see act effective june,part ii,b,acts.the state later experimented with legalized electronic gambling from to,exempting video games with a free play feature from prohibition.act and in state blackmon,the south carolina supreme court held that nonmachine cash payouts from these video gaming machines were legal under ann.supp 
such machines are now once again forbidden by south carolina law.it is presently unlawful for any person to keep on his premises or operate or permit to be kept on his premises or operated within this state certain gambling devices.the devices prohibited include any vending or slot machine,or any video game machine with a free play feature operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of value,or other device operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of value for the play of poker,blackjack,keno,lotto,bingo,or craps as well as any punch board,pull board,or other device pertaining to games of chance of whatever name or kind ann.
south carolina has long employed a multitiered regulatory of legislative,executive,administrative,and judicial enforce its gambling laws.currently,no fewer than five different state entities are part of this effort.first,state law enforcement division sled officers have the authority to enforce south carolina gaming statutes.see ann.according to plaintiffs,at least one sled officer has received specialized training on whether a particular video game machine qualifies as a game of chance.
second,the south carolina attorney general issues opinion letters that construe the statutory scheme and provide guidance to sled officers.see,letter from attorney general charles condon to south carolina law enforcement division chief robert stewart may,available at www.sctax.org publications vg opn.pdf last visited july.
third,after sled officers seize machines they consider to be in violation of state law,the devices are brought before state magistrates.these magistrates,who have expertise in the particulars of south carolina gaming laws,immediately examine each machine and make a determination of their legality as the machines are configured at that time.see ann.allendale county sheriff office two chess challenge ii.these magistrates provide specialized review of the machines,determining whether they constitute an illegal game of chance under,the very provision a federal court would need to interpret to evaluate plaintiffs claims.further,the magistrates serve to place some restraint upon law enforcement officers who represent the executive authority of the state state kizer,overruled on other grounds by state video game.
fourth,a machine owner may appeal a magistrate decision through the state court system,which has heard scores of cases defining the contours of the state gambling laws.see,video game,westside quik shop stewart,overruled in part by byrd city of hartsville,joytime distribs.amusement south carolina,johnson collins entm t,martin condon,blackmon.
fifth,the south carolina department of revenue issues biannual licenses to owners of video game machines that remain legal.see ann.allowing video machines,with a license,for the playing of music,kiddy rides,machines for the playing of amusements or video games,without a free play feature,or machines of the crane type operated by a slot and a machine for the playing of games or amusements,which has a free play feature,operated by a slot and the machine is of the nonpayout pin table type with levers or flippers operated by the player in which the course of the balls may be altered or changed.in sum,south carolina has established a specialized scheme to interpret and enforce laws that lie at the center of state sovereignty.
as the district court recognized,abstention was warranted here because plaintiffs lawsuit threatens to trammel south carolina highly reticulated regulatory regime.plaintiffs raise three claims.first,they assert that prohibition against possessing any device pertaining to games of chance of whatever name or kind is void for vagueness.second,plaintiffs challenge south carolina gambling scheme on equal protection grounds,asserting that they are being subjected to discriminatory enforcement of the laws pertaining to video game machines brief of appellants at.finally,plaintiffs challenge the procedure by which south carolina determines the legality or illegality of a particular video gaming device.the district court was entitled to abstain from deciding these claims,for reasons i shall discuss in turn.
plaintiffs first claim that the provision forbidding devices pertaining to games of chance of whatever name or kind is void for vagueness on the theory that its prohibitions are not clearly defined.grayned city of rockford,d.specifically,plaintiffs contend that this provision could be read to outlaw monopoly,simple card games,and personal computer and cell phone games such as minesweeper and solitaire.see brief of appellants at.while i emphatically do not embrace the proposition that every vagueness challenge to a state statute in federal court warrants abstention,neither do i subscribe to the view that every unclear question of state law forecloses abstention in favor of a federal vagueness challenge.contrary to the majority contention that plaintiffs challenge involves no difficult question of state law,ante at,plaintiffs claim that games of chance is not clearly defined is certainly plausible enough that the district court decision to abstain can not be considered an abuse of discretion.indeed,federal court involvement here will interfere with the detailed,individualized analysis required to determine what constitutes a game of chance and will inescapably intrude upon south carolina regulatory system.
in this case,in order to evaluate plaintiffs vagueness challenge,the federal court would have to define games of chance,a task it can not complete without delving into the meaning,interpretations,and the general regulatory context of.martin stewart,d.the meaning and precise application in any given case of games of chance lie at the core of south carolina regulation of gaming interpreting this provision would therefore enmesh the federal court in a question of state law that bears not simply on a policy problem of substantial public import,new orleans pub,council of the city of new orleans nopsi,d,but arguably on the most hotly contested issue in south carolina in recent years.collins,at.
the majority conclusion that no difficult question of state law is presented here is astounding,insofar as its basis is the south carolina supreme court holding that a man of reasonable intelligence is given fair notice of the machines proscribed by the provision.ante at citing state deangelis.while the majority says that the statutory text is clear and certain because it is given its ordinary meaning,ante at,that circular formulation begs the question of what its ordinary meaning even is.further,such highly generalized formulations of the provision meaning elide every difficult question the state courts must face when interpreting and applying.far from being clear and certain,the provision outlawing games of chance is one that south carolina state courts must apply,on a basis,to a complex and cadre of gambling technology.indeed,the development of video gaming machine technology and of the state courts application of to that technology demonstrate that the meaning and treatment of games of chance present difficult questions of state law from which the district court legitimately abstained.
for starters,not even primitive versions of the video gaming machines involved in this case were in existence at the time of deangelis.such machines did not become commercially viable until the mid to,when it first became economical to combine a monitor with a central processing unit.in fact,it was not until si redd coin machines sircoma introduced draw poker in that such devices gained any measure of popularity.see ireck galecki,video poker history,available at last visited july,see also history of video slot machines,available at last visited july,history of video poker,available at.html last visited july.although the language games of chance can be found in the gaming statute as of,ann.code,and the current statute,ann,the former was not part of a larger statutory provision that includes reference to any type of video gaming device.and although the majority is correct that slot machines have changed since the,while the substance of section has not,the difficult task of distinguishing lawful from unlawful games has been complicated dramatically by these technological developments.ante at,citing video game,at.in fact,technological developments in the years since deangelis bear very directly on the line of demarcation between prohibited games of chance and permitted games of skill.indeed,what may have been clear to a man of reasonable intelligence regarding this distinction in can simply no longer be so.the legality of a particular machine must be determined on an individual basis at the time of seizure,because video machines may be manipulated so as to change their nature from lawful to unlawful allendale county sheriff office,at.
not surprisingly,evaluations of these machines are quite detailed.for example,after a thorough examination of two chess challenge ii game machines,the magistrate judge in allendale county found the games lawful,relying in part on a detailed affidavit which explained,the chess challenge ii game operates in a different manner from the illegal games of chance chess challenge ii operates utilizing a repeating pattern and does not utilize features that would prevent a player skill from determining the outcome of the game.in addition,a player is able to identify the icons as they appear,and to time the stopping of the game to increase the chance of winning.id.at.
and in sun light prepaid phonecard,state,the south carolina supreme court held that machines dispensing,long distance telephone cards with attached game pieces constituted illegal gambling devices,because a detailed evaluation revealed that the machines housed a video screen with a gambling theme played celebration music after dispensing a winning game piece froze if a level of prize money was attained contained two meters one which recorded the amount of money entering the machine and one labeled won which record ed the value of the prizes issued by the machines lacked a mechanism for returning change and could be linked with other machines.id.at.
my friends in the majority,however,refuse to allow the state courts to undertake the delicate task of distinguishing between lawful and unlawful games.because south carolina gaming statutes justifiably call for a determination of legality,the majority notion that it somehow can interpret games of chance in bulk,without disrupting south carolina enforcement scheme,rides roughshod over the scheme itself and the principles of federalism it purports to observe.
it is thus no simple task for the south carolina courts to interpret and apply,which is entrenched in a highly reticulated regulatory scheme,to a range of,technologically advanced devices.the majority insistence that the district court abused its discretion in abstaining,however,will complicate state tasks immeasurably.it threatens to disrupt the state attempt to ensure uniformity in the treatment of an essentially local problem.nopsi,at.burford abstention exists to protect complex state administrative processes from undue federal interference.indeed,a case like this one,in which the federal court is called upon to resolve a difficult question of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar,provides a paradigmatic example of the circumstances justifying burford abstention.nopsi,at.quoting colorado river water conservation dist.united states,d.to say the district court abused its discretion in abstaining is beyond erroneous.
plaintiffs also mount an equal protection challenge to south carolina gaming laws.plaintiffs argue that because video gaming machine owners are unable to obtain review of the legality of their business pursuits like other entrepreneurs can,south carolina makes use of an arbitrary,capricious classification that is not rationally related to the purposes of the statute.complaint at,par.further,plaintiffs contend that they are being subjected to discriminatory enforcement of the laws pertaining to video game machines in an effort to restrict plaintiffs meaningful participation in the political process in south carolina,par.
the majority asserts that plaintiffs merely launch a facial attack on the state statutes as a whole,thus presenting a case federal courts often and expertly entertain.ante at.such antiseptic treatment of plaintiffs claim,however,exalts form over substance and gives short shrift to the essence of plaintiffs that the statute is being enforced against them in a discriminatory manner.see complaint at,par.simply describing a challenge as facial does not necessarily make it so.instead,courts must look to the underlying import of the claim,not just to incantation of magic words and labels.here,plaintiffs clearly desire to sift through south carolina entire gambling enforcement scheme,to probe all its intricate details in the name of discovery.see brief of appellants at.rather than recognizing the claim for what it actually is,the majority accepts what it misguidedly purports to be.
by turning a blind eye to this claim true character,the majority approach threatens one of two possible consequences,neither of which is appealing.first,if the district court treats this as a true facial challenge,rather than what plaintiffs desire it to challenge in the guise of a facial claim will have been unfairly decapitated.under a facial challenge,plaintiffs can only attack the statutory provision in the abstract,not ascertain whether it could be enforced,discriminatorily or otherwise,against particular true concern.this result leaves plaintiffs in the unenviable position of wanting to be in federal court one day,but not the next.at the same time,the majority sends the troubling message to district courts that they can skirt potential abstention problems by characterizing claims such as this as mere facial challenges.thus,in an effort to avoid interference with state law,federal courts may construe complaints to present less serious challenges than they in fact do.
the second potential consequence stems from the majority failure to anticipate how plaintiffs intend for this litigation to unfold.despite the facial label applied to their discriminatory enforcement claim,plaintiffs requested discovery here would put south carolina regulatory regime through the wringer.and as the suit moves forward,the district court will assuredly be forced to confront unsettled areas of state problem that easily could have been avoided through adherence to traditional abstention principles.
indeed,taken for what it truly is,plaintiffs equal protection challenge inevitably requires a detailed probing of south carolina enforcement scheme.thus,it was clearly not an abuse of discretion to abstain from adjudicating this claim.plaintiffs not only ask a federal court to pass upon the rationality of south carolina strategy for enforcing its gambling laws,but also seek to delve into the strategy details.such an undertaking would inevitably require the federal co
