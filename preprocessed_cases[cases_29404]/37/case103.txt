the state of california the state has entered into an agreement allowing big lagoon rancheria big lagoon to operate a casino on an parcel of land in humboldt county,california.it did so,however,only because the district court ordered it to negotiate with big lagoon under the indian gaming regulatory act igra.the state appeals that order and,for the following reasons,we reverse.
historical background and carcieri 
big lagoon is situated on two parcels of land along the shore of the eponymous lagoon in northern california.the parcel on which big lagoon proposes to operate a casino was acquired by the united states,acting through the bureau of indian affairs bia,in however,to understand the background of the case,we must go further back in time to,when the bia purchased another parcel a tract adjacent to the parcel as a homestead for james charley and his family.according to contemporaneous bia records,the purchase was paid out of an appropriation to purchase land for village homes for the landless indians of california.
by,charley had died and his widow had moved,with their children,to trinidad,california.charley son robert may have lived on the parcel from to,but the land was otherwise vacant for more than years.in or thereabouts,thomas williams robert nephew by marriage and his wife,lila,received the bia permission to camp on the land,but made no claim to ownership.
the ushered in a major change in indian policy,from isolation to assimilation.as part of the change,the federal government moved to dissolve reservations and other tribal entities and distribute their lands to individual tribe members.the policy came to california with the enactment of the california rancheria termination act,stat,in.the act mandatorily dissolved some rancherias the term for small indian settlements in california although some were later restored.see tillie hardwick united states,cal.stipulated judgment entered.a amendment to the act allowed any rancheria to request dissolution and distribution.see,stat.
the williamses apparently came to consider the parcel a rancheria because they applied for dissolution and distribution in.a bia memorandum,by contrast,notes that the parcel was not set aside for any specific tribe,band or group of indians when it was acquired in.it further notes that the occupants have not formally organized and did not have allotments or formal assignments.the bia nevertheless approved distribution to the williamses and their daughter and who were also living on the land in.
the proposed distribution never took place because,for reasons unknown,the williamses withdrew their request.but the distribution list forms the basis for membership in big lagoon as it exists today.the tribe first appeared on a list of indian tribal entities that have a relationship with the united states.it has consistently appeared on similar lists since.see.may,indian entities recognized and eligible to receive services from the united states bureau of indian affairs.its roughly two dozen members trace their ancestry,not to charley,but to his son wife nephew.
as noted,the bia purchased the parcel in.it took the land in trust for big lagoon rancheria,a federally recognized indian rancheria pursuant to.that statute,in turn,is based on,which authorizes the bia to acquire land for the purpose of providing lands to indians.title is taken in the name of the united states in trust for the indian tribe or individual indian for which the land is acquired.id.
section was enacted as part of the indian reorganization act of ira,ch,stat.another section of the ira defines indian as including 
all persons of indian descent who are members of any recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction,and all persons who are descendants of such members who were,on june,residing within the present boundaries of any indian reservation,and all other persons of or more indian blood.
id,stat.codified at.
in carcieri salazar,d,the supreme court held that the phrase now under federal jurisdiction unambiguously refers to those tribes that were under the federal jurisdiction of the united states when the ira was enacted in.id.at.thus,under carcieri,the bia lacks authority to acquire land in trust for tribes that were not under federal jurisdiction in.see id.at t he secretary authority to take the parcel in question into trust depends on whether the narragansetts are members of a recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction.
indian gaming and igra 
beginning in the,the state and several indian tribes came into conflict over the operation of bingo halls on indian lands.the conflict culminated in california cabazon band of mission indians,d,in which the supreme court held that state regulation of gaming on indian lands would impermissibly infringe on tribal government.id.at.
congress responded by enacting igra,which assigns authority to regulate gaming to tribal and state governments according to the class of gaming involved.class iii gaming which includes the gambling at issue here is allowed on indian lands only if conducted in conformance with a tribal state compact entered into by the indian tribe and the state.d c.such compacts are the result of negotiations requested by the indian tribe having jurisdiction over the indian lands upon which a class iii gaming activity is being conducted,or is to be conducted.id.d a.upon receiving such a request,the state shall negotiate with the indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact.id.
if negotiations are successful,the resulting compact goes to the bia for approval.see id.d b.if not,the tribe may sue in the district court.see id.d a i.if the district court concludes that the state has failed to negotiate in good faith,it must order the parties to reach an agreement.see id.d b iii.if no agreement is reached after days,the court orders each party to submit a proposed compact to a mediator,who selects the one which best comports with the terms of igra and any other applicable federal law and with the findings and order of the court.id.d b iv.if the state is unwilling to accept the mediator selection,the matter is referred to the bia,which must then develop procedures under which class iii gaming may be conducted on the indian lands over which the indian tribe has jurisdiction.id.d b vii ii.
a unifying thread running through the statutory provisions relating to class iii gaming is the concept of indian lands.such lands are where the gaming activities are to take place and it is the tribe having jurisdiction over those lands that requests negotiations and,if necessary,institutes legal action.igra defines indian lands as 
a all lands within the limits of any indian reservation and 
b any lands title to which is held in trust by the united states for the benefit of any indian tribe or individual and over which an indian tribe exercises governmental power.
negotiation history 
in and,the state proposed a model compact to tribes seeking to offer class iii gaming on their lands,including big lagoon.most tribes accepted the state model compact big lagoon did not.instead,it filed suit in the district court,alleging that the state had failed to negotiate in good faith under igra.
as the litigation proceeded,the state and big lagoon continued to negotiate in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.those negotiations bore fruit in,when the parties agreed that big lagoon,along with another group,would be allowed to operate a casino on lands in barstow.as part of the settlement,the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice.
the settlement proved illusory,however,because the california legislature did not ratify the agreement,as required by state law.the barstow compact lapsed by its own terms in september.
on september,big lagoon sent the state a written request for new negotiations for the purpose of entering into a tribal state compact governing the conduct of class iii gaming activities on the trust lands that constitute the big lagoon rancheria.a principal point of contention that arose during the resultant negotiations concerned the site of the casino.the state was reluctant to allow the casino to be built near the environmentally significant state resources located adjacent to the rancheria.
the state ranked its siting preferences as follows 
locating a device casino and a room hotel on a site approximately five miles from the rancheria 
locating a device casino on the parcel,a room hotel on the parcel,and parking on a separate parcel owned by big lagoon and 
locating a device casino on the parcel,a room hotel on the parcel,and dividing parking between the two parcels.
the state conditioned the second and third options on compliance with a list of environmental mitigation measures.in addition,all three options included a proviso that big lagoon would share a percentage of its revenue with the state in exchange for an exclusive right to operate a casino within a mile radius.
big lagoon responded that possible sites other than the tribe existing trust lands would have to be rejected.it noted that it had always planned to site the casino and all related development on the parcel,and that it continue d to believe that this is the best utilization of the tribe trust lands.
in its response,the state reiterated the parties difference of opinion on the eligibility of the acre parcel for gaming.it apparently acquiesced in big lagoon demand to site all development on that parcel,but proposed a device casino and room hotel.the state proposal was again conditioned on compliance with environmental mitigation measures,as well as revenue sharing.
big lagoon rejected the proposal.in a letter dated october,it demanded permission to operate a device casino and room hotel on the parcel.it agreed in principle to environmental mitigation measures,but,with respect to revenue sharing,refused to pay the state what simply amounts to a tax.it informed the state that it would file suit if an agreement was not reached by november.
in response,the state agreed to allow big lagoon to operate a casino and hotel on the rancheria,without distinguishing between the and parcels.although it acquiesced in the size of both the proposed casino and hotel,it objected to housing them in a tower of the height proposed by big lagoon.the state also continued to insist on revenue sharing,as well as specific environmental measures.
litigation history 
apparently unsatisfied with the state latest offer,big lagoon filed a second lawsuit on april.in its answer,the state admitted that big lagoon is currently on a list of federally recognized tribes,and that the united states considers the rancheria to be the trust beneficiary of certain lands the federal government owns in humboldt county,california.as an affirmative defense,however,it alleged that 
big lagoon is not entitled to injunctive relief compelling governor arnold schwarzenegger to negotiate a compact authorizing class iii gaming on land taken in trust for the rancheria subsequent to october,because big lagoon is not eligible to be a beneficiary of a trust conveyance pursuant to and,thus,was never entitled to a beneficial interest in that land.
after discovery,both big lagoon and the state moved for summary judgment.in its memorandum of law,the state argued,inter alia,that i t is against the public interest to allow gaming on land that the united states unlawfully acquired in trust for big lagoon.citing carcieri,it argued that the parcel was not indian lands eligible for gaming under igra because big lagoon was not a tribe under federal jurisdiction in.as an alternative to entering summary judgment in its favor,the state asked the district court to deny or continue big lagoon motion pending further discovery pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f now federal rule of civil procedure d.
at oral argument on the motions,the district court opined that the status of the parcel was an issue separate from the state obligation to negotiate in good faith whether it in the public interest or not,it might not be legal.in addition,the state conceded that it was not challenging the status of the parcel.
in a decision dated november,the district court held that the state had not,as a matter of law,negotiated in good faith.it addressed the status of the parcel as both bearing on the good faith of the state negotiation position and as a issue.with respect to good faith,the district court reasoned that the state could not rely on carcieri as evidence of its good faith because the case the negotiations the state can not establish that it negotiated in good faith through a post hoc rationalization of its actions.as a issue,it concluded that the status of the parcel was irrelevant 
t he state does not dispute that big lagoon is currently recognized by the federal government or that it has lands on which gaming activity could be conducted.on these facts,big lagoon is entitled to good faith negotiation with the state toward a gaming compact.that the status of the parcel may be in question does not change this result.
the district court also addressed the state proposal for revenue sharing.in so doing,it cited rincon band of luiseño mission indians schwarzenegger,cir,in which we held that a state may,without acting in bad faith,request revenue sharing if the revenue sharing provision is a for uses directly related to the operation of gaming activities,b consistent with the purposes of igra,and c not imposed because it is bargained for in exchange for a meaningful concession.id.at quoting in re indian gaming related cases,cir.the district court extended the reasoning of rincon to the state proposal for environmental mitigation.it concluded that both revenue sharing and environmental mitigation could be appropriate topics of negotiation under the circumstances described in rincon,but that the state nonnegotiable insistence on them amounted to bad faith.
implementing its rulings,the district court granted big lagoon motion for summary judgment and denied the state.it denied the state request for a rule f continuance because the status of big lagoon and its parcel has no bearing on whether the state negotiated in good faith.it ordered the parties to either conclude a compact within days,or to submit their respective proposals to a mediator.both the state and big lagoon timely appealed 
the district court initially declined to stay its order pending appeal.accordingly,the parties continued to negotiate.unable to reach an agreement,they submitted their last,best proposals to a mediator.in its proposal,the state agreed to forgo all revenue sharing if big lagoon would agree to comply with specified environmental mitigation measures.big lagoon,on the other hand,offered to prepare a environmental impact report and to negotiate towards an environmental mitigation agreement with the appropriate agency.it also agreed to contribute revenue to trust funds.
apart from revenue sharing and environmental mitigation,both proposals were substantially similar.in particular,both identified the site of the casino as within the boundaries of the tribe eligible indian lands.although that language does not specify the or parcel,nothing in the record suggests that big lagoon has altered its plan to build the casino on the latter.
the mediator found that i n light of the stringent,broad,and very substantial environmental and design requirements in the state proposal,the compact that best comports with the terms of igra,applicable federal law,and the district court order is clearly big lagoon.the district court then stayed further proceedings.
we review the district court summary judgment de novo,and must determine whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.lopez smith,cir en banc.the state challenges only the district court legal conclusion that big lagoon was entitled to negotiation under igra,and we confine our review accordingly.
in essence,the state argues that the district court erred in compelling negotiations in the face of evidence that the parcel does not qualify as indian lands under igra.it raises the issue principally as a question of whether the district court should have given it more time to develop the facts supporting that argument.big lagoon responds that the district court did not abuse its discretion in that regard because the state had ample time to conduct discovery.
in our view,there is more at stake in this case than a discovery dispute.we think it requires us to answer three questions must a tribe have jurisdiction over indian lands to compel negotiations has the state waived the indian lands requirement is the parcel indian lands we answer those questions in turn.
must a tribe have jurisdiction over indian lands to compel negotiations 
in guidiville band of pomo indians ngv gaming,cir,we described igra as requiring a tribe to show that it has indian lands as defined by igra at the time of filing suit.id.at.we further agreed with the sixth circuit statement that it is clear that the state does not have an obligation to negotiate with an indian tribe until the tribe has indian lands.id.quoting match e be nash she wish band of pottawatomi indians engler,cir.
although guidiville did not involve a claim for negotiation under igra we stand by its reasoning.we hold,therefore,that a state need not negotiate with a tribe under igra unless the tribe has jurisdiction over indian lands.as a corollary,jurisdiction over indian lands is a prerequisite to a suit to compel negotiation under igra.
the district court concluded that this prerequisite was satisfied because the state conceded that the parcel acquired by the bia was indian land.this concession,the court continued,entitled big lagoon to negotiations regardless of the status of the parcel.
we disagree.the igra grants the right to request negotiations to the tribe having jurisdiction over the indian lands upon which a class iii gaming activity is being conducted,or is to be conducted.d a emphasis added.the plain meaning of the highlighted language is that a tribe may only request negotiations to conduct gaming on a particular piece of indian land over which it has jurisdiction.
the sixth circuit described the practical significance of d a as follows 
the purposes of this requirement appear to be to ensure that the casino will be inside the borders of the state,to give the state notice of where it will be,and to require the tribe to have a place for the casino that has been federally approved.
engler,at.although the tribe ownership of indian lands was not at issue in engler,the same commonsense concerns support our reading of the statute.if the statute required only that a tribe have jurisdiction over indian lands,whether or not those lands were to be the site of gaming activity,a tribe with jurisdiction over indian lands could compel a state to negotiate for a compact to operate a casino on any other parcel.but igra authorizes compacts governing gaming activities on the indian lands of the indian tribe.d b emphasis added.
in sum,the only reasonable construction of d a is that a tribe right to request negotiations and to sue if the state does not negotiate in good faith depends on its having jurisdiction over indians lands on which it proposes to conduct class iii gaming.big lagoon insistence that gaming be conducted on the parcel tells us that it is the status of that parcel that matters.the status of the parcel is,as the state agreed at oral argument,an irrelevancy.
has the state waived the indian lands requirement 
before addressing whether the state has waived the indian lands requirement,we briefly respond to the state contention that a lack of indian lands deprives the district court of jurisdiction to compel negotiations under igra.an objection to jurisdiction can not be waived.see arbaugh y h,d.
a district court has jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.a claim depending on a particular construction of federal law falls within this jurisdiction,even if the court ultimately rejects the plaintiff construction.see bell hood.t he right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the constitution and laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another.for this reason the district court has jurisdiction.a district court lacks jurisdiction over a claim only if the alleged claim under the constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or if such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.id.at.
a claim for negotiations under igra,by definition,arises under a law of the united states.big lagoon claim is neither immaterial nor frivolous.that the parties dispute the proper construction of igra does not transform their dispute into a question of jurisdiction.in addition,we infer from igra structure that congress did not intend the indian lands requirement to be an implicit restriction on the district court general jurisdiction.see arbaugh,at w hen congress does not rank a statutory limitation as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.footnote and citation omitted.thus,we conclude that a state may waive the requirement 
as big lagoon points out,the state engaged in negotiations for almost ten years without ever challenging the status of the tribe lands.what a state may voluntarily do,however,is different than what it can be compelled to do under igra.in the barstow compact,for example,big lagoon agreed to request that the bia take the proposed site into trust.yet under our decision in guidiville,it could not have compelled the state to negotiate over that site.see at t he indian tribe must show that it has indian lands as defined by igra at the time of filing.
big lagoon further argues that the state conceded the point now on appeal in its answer,which was filed two months after carcieri was decided.in our view,however,the answer manifests the state awareness of carcieri and intent to rely on it.the state admitted that the united states considers big lagoon to be the trust beneficiary of certain lands the federal government owns in humboldt county,california.any doubt that the state chose its words carefully is dispelled by its allegation that big lagoon is not eligible to be a beneficiary of a trust conveyance pursuant to.while the state inartfully characterized the allegation as an affirmative defense,it is a clear invocation of carcieri.
the state continued to advance its argument at the summary judgment stage,devoting several pages to explaining exactly why the bia trust acquisition was unlawful under carcieri.to be sure,the argument was cast as bearing on the state good faith during negotiations like the district court,we fail to see the connection.nevertheless,the district court obviously understood the state argument as challenging big lagoon right to negotiate for a casino on the parcel,and addressed it as such in its written decision.thus,the issue was preserved for our review.see ahanchian xenon pictures,cir rule against raising issues for first time on appeal does not apply where the district court nevertheless addressed the merits of the issue citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
is the parcel indian lands 
we thus come to the heart of our inquiry is the parcel indian lands our dissenting colleague reasons that we are compelled to answer in the affirmative based on our statement in guidiville that congress use of the verb is to define indian lands requires us to assess the status of land in question at the time of the contract.see at.we agree that the statement informs our conclusion that,to demand negotiation under igra,the site of the proposed gaming must be indian lands at the time of the demand.see supra part.however,its usefulness to us ends there.
in guidiville,we held that land to be entrusted in the future did not qualify as indian lands,see at.here,by contrast,we are called upon to decide whether a past entrustment qualifies if it turns out to have been invalid.guidiville does not speak to that issue.nor does carcieri,which involved a contemporaneous challenge to an entrustment under the administrative procedure act apa.see at we must look elsewhere for guidance.
we find it in the rule that administrative actions taken in violation of statutory authorization or requirement are of no effect.city of santa clara andrus,cir citing,inter alia,utah power light united states.other courts have used different language,see,employers ins.of wassau browner,cir unauthorized agency action may be disregard ed as void,a nullity,but the upshot is the same the law treats an unauthorized agency action as if it never existed.
big lagoon and the dissent argue that a timely suit under the apa is the sole means by which to challenge agency action as unauthorized.the dissent cites wind river mining united states,cir,in which we held that the catchall statute of limitations applied to apa actions.see id.at citing a.we then explained,however,that different types of challenges to agency actions raise different concerns 
if a person wishes to challenge a mere procedural violation in the adoption of a regulation or other agency action,the challenge must be brought within six years of the decision the grounds for such challenges will usually be apparent to any interested citizen within a period following promulgation of the decision the government interest in finality outweighs a desire to protest the agency action as a matter of policy or procedure.
if,however,a challenger contests the substance of an agency decision as exceeding constitutional or statutory authority,the challenger may do so later than six years following the decision by filing a complaint for review of the adverse application of the decision to the particular challenger.such challenges,by their nature,will often require a more interested person than generally will be found in the public at large the government should not be permitted to avoid all challenges to its actions,even if ultra vires,simply because the agency took the action long before anyone discovered the true state of affairs.
id.at.although wind river spoke in terms of a party right to affirmatively challenge unauthorized agency action,the circuit whose approach we adopted has made it clear that the distinction is equally applicable to defensive attacks in enforcement proceedings.union federal labor relations.while we recognize that this case does not involve an enforcement proceeding in the usual sense,we see no reason to treat a third party enforcement of a right stemming from agency action differently from enforcement by the agency itself.
the concerns we raised in wind river are present here.the entrustment,standing alone,might not have caused the state any concern.north county community alliance,salazar,cir.one might even question whether the state had standing at that time to challenge the bia action under the apa.see a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.
it is true at least in this circuit that a challenge to unauthorized agency action is still subject to a time limit.schiller tower semiconductor,cir the circuit has explained that substantive challenges to agency action for example,claims that agency action is unconstitutional,that it exceeds the scope of the agency substantive authority,or that it is premised on an erroneous interpretation of a statutory term have no time bars.in wind river,we said that the time runs from the agency application of the disputed decision to the challenger.at.once again bearing in mind that there is no direct agency involvement in this case,we think the most apt analogue to of the entrustment is big lagoon suit to compel negotiations.as noted above,see supra part,the state promptly challenged the entrustment in response to that suit.we must,therefore,address its challenge on the merits.
as noted,igra defines indian lands as 
a all lands within the limits of any indian reservation and 
b any lands title to which is held in trust by the united states for the benefit of any indian tribe or individual and over which an indian tribe exercises governmental power.
the term reservation is not further defined.historically,it referred to the land reserved from a cession of lands from a tribe to the united states.see felix cohen,cohen handbook of federal indian law c ii ed.beginning in the,it came to include public lands reserved by the federal government for indian use.see id.in other words,land is part of a reservation if it was withheld from a cession of tribal lands or acquired by the federal government for indian use.
there are,we suppose,cases in which land held in trust for a tribe is,for some reason,not part of the tribe reservation.but whether we call the parcel part of big lagoon reservation or not,its status unquestionably stems from the bia acquisition of the parcel in trust for the tribe.
once again,under carcieri the federal government authority to acquire land for indians is limited to acquisitions for tribes that were under the federal jurisdiction of the united states when the ira was enacted in.at.the court did not,however,define what it means for a tribe to be under federal jurisdiction.see id.none of the parties or amici has argued that the tribe was under federal jurisdiction in.
neither party squarely addresses how we should go about deciding whether big lagoon was a tribe under federal jurisdiction in.the state says that further discovery will shed light on the issue,but does not explain how.big lagoon argues that it has been a federally recognized tribe since at least the time of the compact negotiations,but we are concerned with its status in,not.
a bia memorandum tells us that a helpful starting point is a list of tribes compiled shortly after the ira was enacted,but that the list is not the only or finally determinative source.see also carcieri,at breyer,concurring w e know that the bia wrongly left certain tribes off the list.big lagoon undisputed absence from the list,combined with other facts in the record,leads us to the conclusion that the tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in.
here is what we know from the record the bia acquisition of land in was for charley and his family.all were members of the lower klamath tribe,today known as the yurok tribe.the bia confirmed in that the acquisition was not set aside for any specific tribe,band or group of indians.
even if the acquisition amounted to recognition of charley and his family as a distinct tribal group,big lagoon does not trace its roots to that group.membership in big lagoon is,as noted,based on descent from thomas williams,the nephew,by marriage,of charley son robert.according to the bia,williams and his family were not formally organized in.
we agree with the state that there is much confusion in this narrative.why,for example,did the bia conditionally approve the dissolution and distribution of rancheria lands if the lands did not constitute a rancheria in the first place and how did the group go from not formally organized in to an indian tribal entit y that ha s a relationship with the united states in 
these questions are thorny indeed,and perhaps beyond our competence to answer.see western shoshone bus.council babbitt,cir holding that tribe absence from bia list of recognized tribal entities is dispositive.but they do not detract from one undisputed fact there was no family or other group on what is now the big lagoon rancheria in.the central purpose of the ira was to give a ny indian tribe,or tribes,residing on the same reservation the right to organize for its common welfare.ch,stat.codified,as amended,at.since no one resided on what is now the rancheria,there was no group to organize.the absence of big lagoon from the tribe list was not an intentional or inadvertent omission it was a reflection of reality.
as we have held,a predicate to the right to request negotiations under the igra is jurisdiction over the indian lands upon which a tribe proposes to conduct class iii gaming.igra defines indian lands as including lands held in trust for a tribe.carcieri holds that the bia authority to take lands in trust for a tribe extends only to tribes under federal jurisdiction in.thus,the effect of our conclusion that big lagoon is not such a tribe is that big lagoon can not d
