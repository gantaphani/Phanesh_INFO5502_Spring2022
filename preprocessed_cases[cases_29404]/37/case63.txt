the plaintiffs operate several tracks in michigan.a significant part of their operations involves simulcast wagering,in which a horse race that takes place in one location,often outside of michigan,is simultaneously broadcast to one or more other locations to allow bettors to wager in the same betting pool.the plaintiffs business has been decimated in recent years by competition from the state lottery and casino gaming.according to the plaintiffs expert,richard thalheimer,wagering at tracks,in real terms,declined percent between,when casino gaming began in the state,and.the defendants are state officials and the operator of a casino in detroit.

const.art.iv,amended hereinafter proposal.
in may,the plaintiffs brought suit in federal district court under,seeking an injunction against the enforcement of proposal and a declaration of its invalidity on the grounds that it violated the federal constitution and various state laws.the district court dismissed the state law counts,leaving only federal constitutional claims under the commerce clause,first amendment,and equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
in august,the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings.the exhibits to the motion included the legislative history of the state house and senate bills,a newspaper article characterizing the proponents of proposal as an unlikely combination of interests,detroit casino owners and indian casinos,and a newspaper article reporting on the success of proposal e expansion of gambling in.the plaintiffs filed a response to the motion and filed a for partial summary judgment on the basis of their second amended complaint,which was included in the motion papers but had not yet been filed with the district court.the exhibits to the plaintiffs response and motion included affidavits from one of the sponsors of the state legislation,the plaintiffs economic expert,and one of the plaintiffs owners the texts of the state legislation legislative analysis of these bills newspaper articles and the texts of a proposed amendment to the state constitution and implementing legislation allowing detroit casinos to take bets on.
the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment without prejudice to its renewal after disposition of the motion for judgment on the pleadings.the court then gave the plaintiffs leave to file their second amended complaint and did not require the defendants to file an answer until the court ruled on the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
on february,the district court granted judgment on the pleadings to the defendants on the allegations contained in the second amended complaint.with respect to the first amendment claim,the district court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had alleged only a subjective chill of their speech that was insufficient to show an.the district court then ruled that the plaintiffs dormant commerce clause claim failed because they had not shown any discrimination in favor of interests and they had not shown that their decreasing revenues amounted to a burden on interstate commerce.finally,the district court reasoned that the plaintiffs were not entitled to heightened scrutiny under the equal protection clause.the court granted judgment on this count and held that proposal survived rational basis review because michigan had a legitimate governmental interest in regulating gambling.northville downs timely appealed.
before turning to the merits,we first address the applicable standard of review.northville downs contends that the district court committed reversible error by deciding this case under federal rule of civil procedure c rather than federal rule of civil procedure.it argues that the district court improperly considered matters outside the pleadings and that the plaintiffs were not given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c are analyzed under the same de novo standard as motions to dismiss pursuant to rule b.sensations,city of grand rapids,cir citation omitted.it is that rule c requires only one action by the district court for the conversion to a summary judgment motion to occur failure to exclude presented outside evidence.max arnold sons,llc hailey,cir.max arnold makes clear that the district court need not actually rely upon materials outside of the pleadings to require the conversion of a rule c motion into a motion for summary judgment.id.if the district court failed to exclude evidence outside of the pleadings,we construe the district court denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings as a denial of a motion for summary judgment.id.although a district court should give the parties notice and an opportunity to present all material relevant to a motion for summary judgment,t he district court failure to give such notice and opportunity to respond is not reversible error where all parties in fact had a sufficient opportunity to present pertinent materials.id.at citation omitted.
northville downs contends that the district court converted the defendants motion into a motion for summary judgment because it referred to the affidavit of their economic expert and data from the michigan attorney general and referred to its own research on the history of in michigan.it argues that,had the district court given the plaintiffs notice and an opportunity to submit all relevant material,they would have presented material pertinent to their commerce clause claim,namely evidence of the revenues they have lost from the decline in simulcast wagering.
because the district court did not exclude materials outside of the pleadings,we conclude that it converted the defendants rule c motion into a rule c motion for summary judgment under max arnold.first,northville downs is correct that the district court did not exclude thalheimer affidavit,which was not submitted with the pleadings.moreover,the district court relied upon an article from the detroit free press,submitted by the defendants as an exhibit to their rule c motion.finally,at no point did the district court exclude the exhibits submitted by either party on the rule c motion,even though it denied the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment.
the district court failure to exclude the extraneous materials is not reversible error for four reasons,however.first,max arnold does not require reversal and remand so long as the parties in fact had a sufficient opportunity to present pertinent materials.at.here,the plaintiffs themselves moved for summary judgment at the same time they responded to the motion for judgment on the pleadings and,thus,had every opportunity to present pertinent materials in support of their claims.the record shows they did exactly that.the plaintiffs submitted seven exhibits,including affidavits attesting to the economic impact of proposal on their businesses,legislative materials,and newspaper articles rebutting the defendants arguments.second,we have held 
a party can not raise for the first time on appeal an argument that it was surprised by the conversion of the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment when the party was aware that materials outside the pleading had been submitted to the court before the court granted the motion.
yeary goodwill,cir citation omitted.indeed,the plaintiffs submitted extraneous evidence in the exhibits that ostensibly applied only to the defendants rule c motion.third,the district court exposition of the background of michigan gaming considered matters outside the pleadings but those matters simply filled in the contours and details of the plaintiff s complaint,and added nothing new.id.the district court was well within its discretion to take judicial notice of the legislative and constitutional history of gaming regulation in michigan,especially where such materials did not speak to any disputed fact.see,commercial money.union ins,cir a court may consider matters of public record in deciding a motion to dismiss without converting the motion to one for summary judgment.citation omitted.finally,northville downs has shown no prejudice from its supposed inability to submit more evidence on the commerce clause claim.as we explain below,this claim lacks merit as a matter of law,and the plaintiffs had ample opportunity to submit evidence in their favor.any additional evidence would have no bearing on the underlying legal issues.
when considering a motion that has been converted from a rule c motion to a motion for summary judgment,we still review the district court decision de novo.max arnold,at.however,we apply rule c,which provides that the moving party is entitled to summary judgment if the pleadings,discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we must view the facts and all inferences drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.max arnold,at.
the equal protection clause protects against arbitrary classifications,and requires that similarly situated persons be treated equally.bowman united states,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,t o state an equal protection claim,a party must claim that the government treated similarly situated persons differently.braun ann arbor charter,cir citation omitted.
once disparate treatment is shown,the legal standard for analyzing any equal protection claim depends upon the classification used by the government.city of cleburne cleburne living.the general rule is that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.id.at citations omitted.when social or economic legislation is at issue,the equal protection clause allows the states wide latitude,and the constitution presumes that even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic processes.id.in areas of social and economic policy,a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.fcc beach commc ns,citations omitted.
in addition,the supreme court has recognized that laws restructuring the political system to the detriment of protected classes may run afoul of the equal protection clause.see hunter erickson,t he state may no more disadvantage any particular group by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf than it may dilute any person vote or give any group a smaller representation than another of comparable size.citations omitted washington seattle sch.dist,t he fourteenth amendment also reaches a political structure that treats all individuals as equals,yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
with respect to the claim of discriminatory treatment,northville downs contends that proposal creates two classes of gaming licensees one required to obtain voter approval for an expansion of gaming and another class exempted from such a requirement.it argues that proposal is discriminatory on its face because the law treats the plaintiffs and similarly situated casino gambling interests in michigan differently.
even if we accept this characterization of proposal,we must sustain it as economic regulation so long as there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.beach commc ns,at citations omitted see also city of cleburne,at.proposal easily passes this test because it is that the regulation of gambling,including limitations on gaming such as those contained in proposal,is a legitimate state interest.see posadas de assocs.tourism of,recognizing that a state has an interest in regulating gambling to protect the health,safety,and welfare of its citizens united states washington,cir the enactment of gambling laws is clearly a proper exercise of the state police power in an effort to promote the public welfare.the exemptions for indian gaming and detroit casinos similarly survive rational basis review under be
