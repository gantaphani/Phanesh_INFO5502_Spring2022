the wyandotte nation,a federally recognized indian tribe,appeals the entry of a preliminary injunction barring the tribe from conducting gaming on the shriner tract in kansas city,kansas.kathleen sebelius,the governor of kansas,and various other kansas officials,challenging an injunction preventing them from enforcing kansas gaming laws on the shriner tract and ordering them to return money and property seized when kansas raided a casino located on the property.because the district court acted properly when enjoining the state from enforcing its law on what is most likely indian land,we affirm the injunction against the state defendants.however,because the district court,in clear violation of.a,provided the wyandotte with no notice that they were going to be enjoined and because it relied on a misreading of a previous order of this court,the injunction against the wyandotte is vacated.
for ten years,the wyandotte nation,the state of kansas,and the united states have been locked in litigation in multiple fora over the fate of the shriner tract,a piece of land in downtown kansas city,kansas.this long battle has produced a procedural history as complex as a random maze.much of this history has been recapped in sac fox nation norton,cir.however,because the outcome of this case turns on developments in prior and concurrent litigation,it is necessary to review this epic tale of claims and,federal regulators and state agents,legislation and lots and lots of law suits 
this history of legal disputes between kansas,the united states and the wyandotte over the shriner tract began more than three decades ago.in,the indian claims commission held that the federal government illegally took tribal lands belonging to the wyandotte.strong united states.cl.comm,strong united states.cl.comm.in,congress enacted legislation that appropriated money to satisfy that judgment,stat.the legislation stated that a portion of the overall award to be used for the purchase of real property which shall be held in trust by the secretary of the interior for the benefit of the wyandotte nation,b.see also sac fox nation,at.
in,the wyandotte informed the secretary that they wanted to buy the shriner tract.id.at.the secretary published in the federal register a notice of intent to take the shriner tract into trust for the wyandotte.id.at.as long as only funds authorized by.were used,the secretary had a duty to take the land into trust.id.at.
worried that the wyandotte would build a casino on the shriner tract if it were taken into trust,the governor of kansas sprung into action and,along with several indian tribes,sued the secretary to stop the federal government from taking the shriner tract into trust for the wyandotte.id.at.this case was entitled sac fox nation norton.the district court granted a temporary restraining order tro preventing the secretary from taking the land into trust.id.at.because the tribe,which had moved to intervene,was under contract to purchase the land immediately,they challenged the tro.on july,july order,we vacated the tro,stating in relevant part 
we hear this matter on an emergency basis and wish to preserve,as best we can,the rights of all parties.in order to do so,we take into specific consideration the statement of the united states attorney and the counsel for the wyandotte tribe that acquisition by the secretary of this land in trust will not affect or bar the ultimate resolution of whether this land can be used for class iii gaming pursuant to the indian gaming regulatory act.igra 
in order to preserve the status quo,we grant the wyandotte emergency application for stay and hold that the temporary restraining order entered below is dissolved,subject to the conditions which constitute the law of this case,that the respective rights of the parties to obtain judicial review of all issues which have been raised in the complaint below shall be preserved,including standing of all parties,jurisdiction,compliance by the secretary with all requirements of law,and the ultimate question of whether gaming shall be permitted on the subject land.
on an emergency basis,the governor of kansas and the other a motion to clarify that class i and class ii gaming were prohibited on the shriner tract pending the resolution of sac fox nation.the next day,we issued an order the july order denying this motion 
kansas have filed an emergency motion for clarification of our order of july.they contend that the order inadvertently allows gaming on the subject property other than class iii gaming under the indian gaming regulatory act and suggests that the order be modified to prohibit any gaming on the land pending resolution of the suit below.after consideration of the motion,we conclude that it should be denied.paragraph five of our july,order specifically states that all issues raised below are preserved for judicial review,including the ultimate question of whether gaming shall be permitted on the subject land itself.this broad language clearly includes all classes of gaming.the motion is denied.
the secretary then purchased the shriner tract and took it into trust for the wyandotte.sac fox,at.
sac fox nation continued in district court until the court dismissed the case on procedural grounds.id.at.kansas and the tribes appealed the decision and we reversed the district court procedural ruling and addressed the merits of the case.on the merits,we affirmed the secretary ruling that she had a duty to take the shriner tract into trust if the tribe used only.funds to purchase the land.however,we found that the secretary had not provided substantial evidence that the wyandotte used only.funds to purchase the shriner tract.id.at we remanded the case to the district court with an order to remand the case to the secretary to determine the source of the funds.id.at.the district court did so and entered final judgment in the matter,seemingly ending the sac fox case.
on remand,the secretary determined that the shriner tract was purchased exclusively with.funds.march.kansas presented an administrative challenge to this determination,but it was rejected.kansas officials filed suit,challenging the secretary decision on remand.that suit is now pending in district court in kansas.governor of norton,wl.july.
on the basis of the secretary determination that the shriner tract was appropriately acquired in trust,the wyandotte opened a class ii gaming facility on the tract.tribes may conduct class ii gaming on indian land in states where such gaming is permitted,subject to provisions of igra.a,b.
the wyandotte decision to open the casino set off a furious round of legal maneuvering.the attorney general of kansas responded to the opening of the casino by sending a letter asking the national indian gaming commission nigc to exercise its power to regulate gaming on the shriner tract.the nigc responded to the attorney general letter,stating that it had jurisdiction to regulate gaming on the land and that it was in the process of investigating whether gaming was legal on the property under igra the nigc then sent the wyandotte a letter,informing them that it and not the state had jurisdiction over the new casino because it was on indian land but that the land could not be used for gaming because it did not qualify under igra requirements 
the wyandotte immediately brought suit in federal court in the district of columbia seeking review of the nigc decision under the administrative procedure act and requesting a declaratory judgment that they could lawfully conduct gaming on the shriner tract.wyandotte nation indian gaming comm n,case 
determined to shut down the tribe gaming facility and unwilling to wait for the case to travel through proper legal channels,kansas officials decided to simply bypass the federal court system.they sought and obtained a search warrant in kansas state court based on suspected violations of state gaming law.on april,armed officials from the kansas city police department,the kansas bureau of investigation,and the office of the state attorney general stormed the casino,seized gambling proceeds and files,and confiscated gaming machines.the law enforcement officers arrested ellis enyart,the casino general manager,for violating state gambling laws.that same day,the officers seized a bank account owned by the wyandotte.in total,the officers seized more than million in cash and equipment.criminal charges were filed against enyart but a state court rightly dismissed them because kansas has no authority to enforce its gaming laws on the shriner tract.kansas enyart,case.july,order 
in response to the state raid,the wyandotte amended the complaint then pending in federal court in the district of columbia to include the state defendants and requested a tro preventing the state from taking any further enforcement actions.the district court stated that the raid appears to have been unlawful because the shriner tract is indisputably indian land over which the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over gambling.wyandotte nation indian gaming comm n,case order of april.however,the court held that it had no jurisdiction over the state officers and transferred the case to kansas.
after the case was transferred,the wyandotte sought and the district court granted a preliminary injunction against the state defendants the court ordered the state defendants to return the monies and machines seized in the april raid and barred the state from exercising any jurisdiction over gaming or related activities on the shriner tract.the district court,however,went further.without providing notice to the wyandotte,the district court sua sponte enjoined the tribe from conducting gaming or related activities on the shriner tract.wyandotte nation sebelius,d.
the wyandotte now appeal this decision.kansas,challenging the injunction issued against its enforcement of its laws on the shriner tract.
the wyandotte challenge the district court order enjoining them from conducting gaming operations on the shriner tract until the legal status of the tract and the wyandotte ability to conduct gaming operations on it has been finally adjudicated.because the injunction was granted without notice,and because there was no legal basis for the district court action,we vacate the preliminary injunction against the wyandotte.
a district court grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.dominion video satellite,echostar satellite,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it commits an error of law or makes clearly erroneous factual findings.id.
on its own and without providing any form of notice,the district court issued its injunction against the wyandotte.kansas did not request this injunction nor did the court inform anyone in any public proceeding that it was considering issuing an injunction against the wyandotte.
a states clearly no preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice to the adverse party.although we have never addressed the matter,the text of this rule is clear courts simply can not issue injunctions without providing notice to the adverse party preliminary injunctions entered without notice to the opposing party are generally dissolved.united states microsoft.see also rosen siegel,cir parker ryan,cir reed cleveland bd.of,cir.the wyandotte were not given notice that an injunction was being considered.this is an obvious violation of rule and is a clear abuse of discretion.
the state defendants argue that the district court did not actually issue an injunction in violation of rule,but instead enforced two orders of this the july and july orders in the sac fox case.those orders,the state defendants claim,barred the wyandotte from conducting any type of gaming on the shriner tract.
the state defendants misread these orders.neither order addresses whether gaming is permitted on the shriner tract before final resolution of the various strands of litigation between kansas,the wyandotte,and the united states 
as noted above,the july order vacated a tro against the secretary of the interior,thereby permitting the secretary to purchase the shriner tract and place it in trust for the wyandotte,pending final determination of the propriety of the secretary determination that doing so was required by law.those portions of the july order cited by the state defendants do not discuss whether the wyandotte may operate a gaming facility on the shriner tract during the litigation.instead,they discuss the legal incidence of permitting the secretary to take the land into trust.the order states that both the federal government and the wyandotte agree that acquisition by the secretary of this land in trust will not affect or bar the ultimate resolution of whether this land can be used for class iii gaming pursuant to the indian gaming regulatory act.we endorsed the view of the secretary and the wyandotte,stating 
w e hold that the respective rights of the parties to obtain judicial review of all issues which have been raised in the complaint below shall be preserved,including the ultimate question of whether gaming shall be permitted on the subject land.
emphasis added.our july order thus allowed the purchase of the shriner tract,but ensured that the purchase would not affect the resolution of the ultimate question of whether gaming should be permitted.it simply did not speak to what activities were permitted on the shriner tract before the ultimate resolution of the case.
our july order was issued in response to the governor of kansas motion for clarification,which argued that the july order inadvertently authorized gaming on the subject property other than class iii gaming under igra.the motion requested that the order be modified to prohibit any gaming on the land pending resolution of the suit below.
we denied this motion because our july,order specifically states that all issues raised below are preserved for judicial review,including the ultimate question of whether gaming shall be permitted on the subject land.quoting the july order.the july order thereby confirmed that permitting the secretary to take the land into trust would not affect whether,as a final matter,any type of i,ii,or take place on the shriner tract.this second order makes very clear that nothing in the first order addresses whether gambling is permitted during the litigation.like the july order,nothing in the july order says whether the wyandotte can or can not conduct gaming on the shriner tract before the final resolution of the litigation between the parties.
because the injunction against the wyandotte was issued without notice,and because neither the july nor the july order justify an injunction,the preliminary injunction against the wyandotte is vacated 
on,the state defendants argue that the district court decision enjoining them from enforcing state gaming laws on the shriner tract and mandating that they return the money and equipment seized in the april,raid of the wyandotte casino was an abuse of discretion.although the district court applied an incorrect legal standard,an independent review of the record makes clear that an injunction is appropriate.as such,we affirm this portion of the district court order.
a preliminary injunction is appropriate when the movant will suffer irreparable harm unless the injunction issues there is a substantial likelihood the movant ultimately will prevail on the merits the threatened injury to the movant outweighs any harm the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party and the injunction would not be contrary to the public interest.kiowa indian tribe of oklahoma hoover,cir.in general,we review the decision to grant a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.winnebago tribe stovall,cir.the state must show that the district court committed an error of law for example,by applying the wrong legal standard or committed clear error in its factual findings.id.
the district court did apply the wrong legal standard,at least in part.the wyandotte concede that the relief they seek is not only prohibitory but is also asked the court to order kansas to both refrain from enforcing state gaming laws on the shriner tract in the future and to return the proceeds,files and equipment seized when the state raided their casino on april.the district court improperly relied on our
