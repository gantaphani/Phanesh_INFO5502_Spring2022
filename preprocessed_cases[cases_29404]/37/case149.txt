in this case,we consider whether the national labor relations board the board may apply the national labor relations act,et the nlra,to employment at a casino the san manuel band of serrano mission indians san manuel or the tribe operates on its reservation.the casino employs many and caters primarily to.we hold the board may apply the nlra to employment at this casino,and therefore we deny the petition for review.
san manuel owns and operates the san manuel indian bingo and casino the casino on its reservation in san bernardino county,california.this proceeding arose out of a competition between the communication workers of america cwa and the hotel employees restaurant employees international union here,each seeking to organize the casino employees.according to here evidence,the casino is about an hour drive from los angeles.it includes a bingo hall and over a thousand slot machines.it also offers live entertainment.here evidence further suggests the tribe actively directs its marketing efforts to,and the board found that many,and perhaps the great majority,of the casino patrons are nonmembers who come from outside the reservation.san manuel indian bingo casino,wl.the tribe does not contract with an independent management company to operate the casino,and therefore many tribe members hold key positions at the casino.nevertheless,given the casino size,the tribe must employ a significant number of to ensure effective operation.id.at.
the casino was established by the san manuel tribal government as a tribal governmental economic development project,id.at,and it operates pursuant to the indian gaming regulatory act of igra,which authorized gaming on tribal lands expressly as a means of promoting tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments.according to san manuel evidence,its tribal government consists of a general council,which elects from among its members a business committee.the general council includes all tribal members years of age or older.the record is not specific in regards to the size of the tribe,but the tribe articles of association call for monthly meetings of the general council,suggesting the tribe is relatively small.the record also does not indicate the casino gross annual revenues,but here submitted a declaration indicating that,as of february,the casino website was advertising in regard to its bingo operation over billion dollars in cash and prizes awarded since july.revenues from the casino are used to fund various tribal government programs and to provide for the general welfare of tribe members.
in the tribe case,igra appears to have fulfilled its purpose,as the casino has markedly improved the tribe economic condition.the tribe evidence indicates its reservation consists primarily of steep,mountainous,arid land,most of it unsuitable to economic development.for many years,the tribe had no resources,and many of its members depended on public assistance.as a result of the casino,however,the tribe can now boast full employment,complete medical coverage for all members,government funding for scholarships,improved housing,and significant infrastructure improvements to the reservation.in addition,according to the tribe evidence,the tribal government is authorized to make direct per capita payments of casino revenues to tribe members,suggesting that improved government services are not the only way tribe members might benefit from the casino.
on january,here filed an unfair labor practice charge with the board.the charge asserted the casino has interfered with,coerced and restrained employees in the exercise of their collective bargaining rights,and has dominated and discriminatorily supported the cwa by allowing cwa representatives access to casino property,while denying the of access to representatives of the charging party here filed a second charge on march,making similar allegations.on september,the board regional director for region issued an order consolidating the two cases,as well as a consolidated complaint.the complaint alleged the casino had permitted cwa to place a trailer on casino property for the purpose of organizing casino employees to distribute leaflets from the trailer and to communicate with casino employees on casino property during working hours.the complaint further alleged the casino security guards denied here equal access to casino employees.
the tribe appeared specially,seeking dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.the tribe asserted the nlra does not apply to the actions of tribal governments on their reservations.see fort apache timber.on january,the matter was transferred to the board in washington,and on may,the board issued a decision and order finding the nlra applicable.
the board began by reviewing its past decisions regarding application of the nlra to tribal governments.at.in fort apache,the board had ruled the nlra did not apply to a tribal government operating a timber mill on indian land,finding the mill to be akin to a political subdivision of a state government and therefore exempt.fort apache,at.this ruling would arguably apply wherever the tribal government enterprise was located,but in sac fox industries,the board found the nlra applicable to tribal enterprises.id.at,see also yukon kuskokwim health,a case involving an healthcare facility operated by a tribal consortium.analyzing these precedents,the board acknowledged reliance on two basic location is determinative and that the text of the nlra supported this found both flawed.at.first,the board concluded that the nlra applies to tribal governments by its terms and that the legislative history of the nlra does not suggest a tribal exemption.id.at.next,the board held federal indian policy does not preclude application of the nlra to the commercial activities of tribal governments.id.at.
in regard to the latter point,the board cited the supreme court statement in federal power commission tuscarora indian nation,d,that a general statute in terms applying to all persons includes indians and their property interests.the board noted several contexts in which courts had followed tuscarora and applied federal laws to indian tribes.at.in donovan coeur tribal farm,cir,for example,the ninth circuit found the occupational safety and health act applicable to a farm operated by a tribe and located on the tribe reservation the coeur court identified only three exceptions to tuscarora statement that federal statutes apply to tribes.according to the ninth circuit,an exception to this general rule is appropriate when the law touches exclusive rights of in purely intramural matters the application of the law to the tribe would abrogate rights guaranteed by indian treaties or there is proof by legislative history or some other means that congress intended the law not to apply to indians on their reservations id.at alterations in original quoting united states farris,cir.the board adopted the framework in this case,thus overruling the fort apache decision,at,and it concluded that none of the three coeur exceptions applied and that therefore what it characterized as tuscarora general rule was controlling,id.at.
but the board did not stop there.having found the nlra applicable according to its terms,and having concluded federal indian law did not preclude application of the nlra,the board considered as a matter of discretion whether to exercise its jurisdiction in light of the need to accommodate the unique status of indians in our society and legal culture.id.at.here,the board went beyond the coeur exceptions,asking if the assertion of jurisdiction would effectuate the purposes of the nlra,and noting that when a tribe is fulfilling traditionally tribal or governmental functions that do not involve or substantially affect interstate commerce,the board interest in effectuating the policies of the nlra is likely to be lower,id.at.the board considered the location of the tribal government activity that is,whether on or off the tribe reservation relevant but not determinative.id.because here the casino is a typical commercial enterprise that employs and caters to customers,the board found the exercise of jurisdiction appropriate,id.at.
failing in its effort to obtain a dismissal of the complaint,the tribe filed an amended answer,admitting the key factual allegations and again denying the applicability of the nlra.the board general counsel then moved for summary judgment,and the board granted the motion.the board reaffirmed its jurisdictional determination and,based on the tribe factual admissions,found an unfair labor practice in violation of the nlra.the board issued a order requiring the tribe to give here access to the casino and also to post notices in the casino describing the rights of employees under the nlra.the tribe petitioned for review,and the board filed a for enforcement of its order.
several factors make resolution of this case particularly difficult.we have before us conflicting supreme court canons of interpretation that are articulated at a fairly high level of generality.in addition,the nlra was enacted by a congress that in all likelihood never contemplated the statute potential application to tribal employers,and probably no member of that congress imagined a small indian tribe might operate like a closely held corporation,employing hundreds,or even thousands,of to produce a product it profitably marketed to.further,the casino at issue here,though certainly exhibiting characteristics that are strongly commercial employees and patrons,is also in some sense governmental the casino is the primary source of revenue for the tribal government.finally,precedent is inconsistent as to the applicability of general federal laws to indian tribes.
the gravitational center of san manuel case is tribal sovereignty,but even if we accept the paramount significance of this factor,our resolution of the case depends on how the supreme court and congress have defined the contours and limits of tribal sovereignty.our central inquiry is whether the relation between the tribe sovereign interests and the nlra is such that the ambiguity in the nlra should be resolved against the board exercise of jurisdiction.by focusing on the sovereignty question and addressing it first,we find the statutory interpretation question resolves itself fairly simply.thus,we analyze this case in two parts would application of the nlra to san manuel casino violate federal indian law by impinging upon protected tribal sovereignty and assuming the preceding question is answered in the negative,does the term employer in the nlra reasonably encompass indian tribal governments operating commercial enterprises 
when we begin to examine tribal sovereignty,we find the relevant principles to be,superficially at least,in conflict.first,we have the supreme court statement in tuscarora that a general statute in terms applying to all persons includes indians and their property interests.at.in tuscarora,the court applied this principle to permit condemnation of private property owned by a tribal government,finding a general grant of eminent domain powers applicable to the tribe.id.at.this tuscarora statement is,however,in tension with the longstanding principles that ambiguities in a federal statute must be resolved in favor of indians,see county of yakima confederated tribes bands of the yakima indian nation,d montana blackfeet tribe of indians,d bryan itasca county,d mcclanahan.state tax comm n,d squire capoeman.city of roseville norton,and a clear expression of congressional intent is necessary before a court may construe a federal statute so as to impair tribal sovereignty,see white mountain apache tribe bracker,d santa clara pueblo martinez,d.moreover,tuscarora statement is of uncertain significance,and possibly dictum,given the particulars of that case.unlike the nlra,the federal power act at issue in tuscarora included a specific limitation on eminent domain on indian reservations.see at.noting that lands within a reservation could not be taken by eminent domain unless the federal power commission found that the taking would not interfere or be inconsistent with the purpose for which such reservation was created or acquired internal quotation marks omitted.this limitation supported the inference that congress intended in other circumstances to include indians within the federal power act eminent domain provision.see id.at.the federal power act neither overlooks nor excludes indians or lands owned or occupied by them.instead,as has been shown,the act specifically defines and treats with lands occupied by indians the act gives every indication that,within its comprehensive plan,congress intended to include lands owned or occupied by any person or persons,including indians.
as discussed above,the board steered its way between these various rules by following the ninth circuit lead in coeur,at,which identified three exceptions to tuscarora general statement.the board concluded none of the exceptions applied,and therefore tuscarora general statement controlled.at.because the board expertise and delegated authority does not relate to federal indian law,we need not defer to the board conclusion.see,hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d nlrb bildisco bildisco,d southern nlrb.therefore,we decide de novo the implications of tribal sovereignty on the statutory construction question before us.
each of the cases petitioners cite in support of the principle that statutory ambiguities must be construed in favor of indians as well as the cases we have found supporting the principle involved construction of a statute or a provision of a statute congress enacted specifically for the benefit of indians or for the regulation of indian affairs.we have found no case in which the supreme court applied this principle of construction when resolving an ambiguity in a statute of general application.
with regard to the alternative principle relied on by petitioners,that a clear statement of congressional intent is necessary before a court can construe a statute to limit tribal sovereignty,we can reconcile this principle with tuscarora by recognizing that,in some cases at least,a statute of general application can constrain the actions of a tribal government without at the same time impairing tribal sovereignty.
tribal sovereignty is far from absolute,as the supreme court has explained 
indian tribes are distinct,independent political communities,retaining their original natural rights in matters of local.although no longer possessed of the full attributes of sovereignty,they remain a separate people,with the power of regulating their internal and social relations 
as the court has recognized,however,congress has plenary authority to limit,modify or eliminate the powers of local which the tribes otherwise possess.
santa clara pueblo,at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.an examination of supreme court cases shows tribal sovereignty to be at its strongest when explicitly established by a treaty,see,mcclanahan,at,or when a tribal government acts within the borders of its reservation,in a matter of concern only to members of the tribe,see,white mountain apache tribe,at.moe confederated salish kootenai tribes,d.examples of such intramural matters include regulating the status of tribe members in relation to one another,see fisher district court,d united states quiver,and determining tribe membership,see santa clara pueblo,at.conversely,when a tribal government goes beyond matters of internal and enters into business transaction with,its claim of sovereignty is at its weakest.mescalero apache tribe jones,d.in the latter situation,courts recognize the capacity of a duly established tribal government to act as an unincorporated legal person,engaging in privately negotiated contractual affairs with,but the tribal government does so subject to generally applicable laws.see,niagara mohawk power tonawanda band of seneca indians,cir gila river indian cmty.henningson,durham richardson,cir.the primary qualification to this rule is that the tribal government may be immune from suit.see kiowa tribe,d.
many activities of a tribal government fall somewhere between a purely intramural act of reservation governance and an commercial enterprise.in such a case,the inquiry as to whether a general law inappropriately impairs tribal sovereignty is not dependent on mechanical or absolute conceptions of tribal sovereignty,but has called for a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake.white mountain apache tribe,at.the determinative consideration appears to be the extent to which application of the general law will constrain the tribe with respect to its governmental functions.if such constraint will occur,then tribal sovereignty is at risk and a clear expression of congressional intent is necessary.conversely,if the general law relates only to the activities of the tribe,and in particular activities involving,see generally reich mashantucket sand gravel,cir e mployment of weighs heavily against a claim that activities affect rights of in purely intramural matters,then application of the law might not impinge on tribal sovereignty.of course,it can be argued any activity of a tribal government is by definition governmental,and even more so an activity aimed at raising revenue that will fund governmental functions.here,though,we use the term governmental in a restrictive sense to distinguish between the traditional acts governments perform and collateral activities that,though perhaps in some way related to the foregoing,lie outside their scope.
cases involving the application of state law to indian activities are also instructive.generally speaking,state laws do not apply to the activities of tribal indians on their reservations.california cabazon band of mission indians,d.nevertheless,the location of the activity is not the only consideration the supreme court has applied in these cases,and though the application of state law raises very different issues and therefore these cases are not directly on point,we find significant that the court has defined tribal sovereignty in these cases partly in terms of governmental functions.in williams lee,d,for example,the court determined arizona state courts lacked jurisdiction over a breach of contract action brought by a against an indian,based on a sale that occurred on an indian reservation.in measuring the scope of tribal sovereignty,the court commented t he question has always been whether the state action infringed on the right of the reservation indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.id.at.if essential tribal relations are at issue,then states may not intervene.id.at.the location of the activity in question was perhaps the primary consideration in the court analysis,id.at,but this consideration was expressly tied to preserving tribal,which the court defined in terms of the right of indians to be ruled by their own laws,id.at.
the supreme court again considered the application of state law to indian activities in organized village of kake egan,d.in that case,alaska sought to apply its state law to regulate certain fish traps operated by the thlinget indians in waters.id.at.this time,the court sided with the state,permitting state regulation of the tribal fish traps.after specifying several ways in which tribal sovereignty had given way to state regulation,id.at,the court concluded that even on reservations state laws may be applied to indians unless such application would interfere with reservation or impair a right granted or reserved by federal law.id.at.emphases added.based on this principle,the court held alaska regulation of the tribe exclusive fishing rights was permissible.id.at.
the supreme court reaffirmed the same principle in mescalero apache tribe jones,d.there,the tribe operated a ski resort on land that was outside the tribe reservation,though contiguous with reservation land.new mexico sought to impose a tax on the gross receipts of the resort.the court concluded s tate laws may be applied to the activities of indians and tribes unless such application would interfere with reservation or would impair a right granted or reserved by federal law.id.at.emphasis added.again,the fact that the tribal activity at issue was was a primary consideration in the court decision,id.at,but the court emphasized interfere nce with reservation as the underlying issue.
in sum,the supreme court decisions reflect an earnest concern for maintaining tribal sovereignty,but they also recognize that tribal governments engage in a varied range of activities many of which are not activities we normally associate with governance.these activities include fishing,investments in private property,and commercial enterprises that tend to blur any distinction between the tribal government and a private corporation.the supreme court concern for tribal sovereignty distinguishes among the different activities tribal governments pursue,focusing on acts of governance as the measure of tribal sovereignty.the principle of tribal sovereignty in american law exists as a matter of respect for indian communities.it recognizes the independence of these communities as regards internal affairs,thereby giving them latitude to maintain traditional customs and practices.but tribal sovereignty is not absolute autonomy,permitting a tribe to operate in a commercial capacity without legal constraint.
of course,in establishing and operating the casino,san manuel has not acted solely in a commercial capacity.certainly its enactment of a tribal labor ordinance to govern relations with its employees was a governmental act,as was its act of negotiating and executing a gaming compact with the state of california,as required by igra.see d.moreover,application of the nlra to employment at the casino will impinge,to some extent,on these governmental activities.nevertheless,impairment of tribal sovereignty is negligible in this context,as the tribe activity was primarily commercial and its enactment of labor legislation and its execution of a gaming compact were ancillary to that commercial activity.the total impact on tribal sovereignty at issue here amounts to some unpredictable,but probably modest,effect on tribal revenue and the displacement of legislative and executive authority that is secondary to a commercial undertaking.we do not think this limited impact is sufficient to demand a restrictive construction of the nlra.
therefore,we need not choose between tuscarora statement that laws of general applicability apply also to indian tribes and santa clara pueblo statement that courts may not construe laws in a way that impinges upon tribal sovereignty absent a clear indication of congressional intent.even applying the more restrictive rule of santa clara pueblo,the nlra does not impinge on the tribe sovereignty enough to indicate a need to construe the statute narrowly against application to employment at the casino.first,operation of a casino is not a traditional attribute of.rather,the casino at issue here is virtually identical to scores of purely commercial casinos across the country.second,the vast majority of the casino employees and customers are not members of the tribe,and they live off the reservation.for these reasons,the tribe is not simply engaged in internal governance of its territory and members,and its sovereignty over such matters is not called into question.because applying the nlra to san manuel casino would not impair tribal sovereignty,federal indian law does not prevent the board from exercising jurisdiction.this conclusion is consistent with the conclusion of several other circuits in regard to the application of federal employment law to certain commercial activities of certain tribes,although those cases resulted from the application of a framework coeur different from the one we employ here,and we do not decide how the framework we employ would apply to the facts of those cases.see.paraplegic,ass n,miccosukee tribe of indians,cir holding ada applied to restaurant and gaming facility operated by an indian tribe reich mashantucket sand gravel,cir applying osha to a construction business dep t of labor occupational safety health review comm n,cir applying osha to a timber mill that a tribe operated on its reservation and noting t he mill employs a significant number of americans and sells virtually all of its finished product to americans through channels of interstate commerce smart state farm ins,cir co
