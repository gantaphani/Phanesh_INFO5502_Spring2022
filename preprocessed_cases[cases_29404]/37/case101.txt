circuit judge 
we must decide whether shareholders may pursue a derivative lawsuit against a corporation board of directors despite their failure to demand that the board initiate this litigation itself.
this is a shareholder derivative suit.the plaintiffs are shareholders of wynn resorts,limited wynn resorts,a nevada corporation that owns and operates casinos in las vegas and macau,the latter through its subsidiary,wynn macau,limited.the defendants are wynn resorts itself and eleven individuals who sit or sat on its board of directors.the shareholders wish to challenge two actions the board took on behalf of its subsidiary wynn macau a decision to donate million to the university of macau development foundation,and a decision to redeem the shares held by a former director named kazuo okada,who was the only director to vote against the donation.
we recite the facts as alleged in the shareholders amended complaint,and we assume them to be true for purposes of this appeal.
in wynn resorts opened its first hotel in macau,china under a lease from the macau government with a term from.also in wynn resorts applied to the macau government for a second lease agreement to build a new resort and casino.central to the present dispute is the university of macau and its development foundation,which is presided over by many of the same government officials who have substantial control over gaming matters and the real estate industry in macau.
five years after wynn resorts submitted its application for a second lease agreement,the macau government still had not approved it,but in may the board authorized a donation to the development foundation totaling million over a ten year period.okada was the only director on the board to vote against the donation about a month after the donation,the macau government accepted wynn resorts application for a second lease.
in february,the securities and exchange commission sec launched an informal inquiry into the macau donation.the shareholders do not allege that the sec investigation escalated into a formal enforcement proceeding,and in fact,the shareholders acknowledge that after they filed this suit,the sec concluded its investigation without taking further action.the nevada gaming commission board gcb also undertook an investigation into the macau donation,but the shareholders complaint acknowledges that the gcb had terminated its investigation,finding no violations of state law,by the time the shareholders brought this suit.
meanwhile,in october or november,okada began demanding a separate investigation into the macau donation.around the same time,in november,steve wynn the company chairman and ceo hired former fbi director louis freeh to investigate allegations that okada had made improper gifts to gaming regulators in the phillippines.freeh concluded that okada was unsuitable to own shares of wynn resorts,under nevada law and the corporation articles of incorporation,and so the corporation forcibly redeemed okada billion equity stake in the company in exchange for a promisory note worth billion.the okada redemption is the subject of separate lawsuits between steve wynn and okada in nevada state court.
their eyebrows raised by these decisions,the shareholders decided to sue the wynn resorts board.in the shareholders estimation,the macau donation was nothing but a quid pro quo bribe,and the okada redemption had no legitimate business purpose but was merely a gambit steve wynn used to oust a dissenting director and intimidate the others into complying with his wishes from there on out.
the shareholders filed their derivative action in federal district court in,and after it was dismissed,they amended their complaint in april.at the time the shareholders filed their amended complaint,the wynn resorts board of directors had eight members steve wynn,elaine wynn,robert miller,boone wayson,edward virtue,john hagenbuch,ray irani,and alvin shoemaker.four of the defendants who are still parties to the suit linda chen,russell goldsmith,john moran,and allan zeman are former members of the board,and had ceased to be directors by the time the shareholders filed their amended complaint.
the complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties and committed corporate waste by approving the macau donation because,the shareholders allege,the donation caused the company to incur legal expenses and be exposed to potential liability.the complaint also alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by redeeming okada shares because,the shareholders allege,such action had no legitimate purpose and merely encumbered the company with a higher debt load.
before bringing their suit on behalf of the corporation,however,the shareholders were required either to make a demand on the board of directors or to explain why such demand would be futile.the shareholders did not make a demand.instead,they argued that demand would be futile,for three reasons first,steve wynn is interested meaning he can not be expected to exercise impartial judgment about whether it is in the corporation best interests to sue the board as the shareholders wish to do and a majority of the board is alleged to be beholden to him and therefore likewise incapable of exercising impartial judgment about whether to sue the board second,the directors allegedly can not be impartial because they face a substantial likelihood of incurring personal liability for their decision to approve the macau donation and third,the directors allegedly can not be impartial because there is a reasonable doubt as to whether their decision to redeem okada shares would be given the benefit of the business judgment rule if it were challenged in court.
the district court disagreed,and dismissed the amended complaint under federal rule of civil procedure.the district court found steve wynn to be interested,but held that the shareholders had not adequately alleged a majority of the board to be beholden to him.the district court also held that the shareholders had not sufficiently alleged a substantial likelihood that the directors would incur personal liability for approving the macau donation.finally,the district court held that the shareholders had not alleged enough to create a reasonable doubt about whether the okada redemption would be given the benefit of the business judgment rule if it were challenged in court.
the shareholders timely appealed.
before turning to the merits,we must address two issues with respect to our jurisdiction to hear this case 
this suit arises entirely under state law,with the shareholders bringing causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets,and seeking in response a permanent injunction and restitution for unjust enrichment.the shareholders complaint alleges federal jurisdiction exclusively under a,part of the diversity jurisdiction statute which covers suits between citizens of a state and citizens or subjects of a foreign state.there are two problems with that jurisdictional pleading.
first,a is an improper basis because the plaintiffs are alleged to be american citizens,and the defendants are alleged to be a mix of american citizens and foreign citizens.because there are american citizens on both sides of the case,jurisdiction can not be grounded in a.see,explaining that s ubsection a,which confers jurisdiction in the district court when a citizen of a state sues aliens only,could not be satisfied because one of the defendants is a united states citizen,and that such defendant united states citizenship destroy s complete diversity under a harris rand,cir.instead of a,the shareholders should have invoked a,which provides jurisdiction over suits between citizens of different states and in which citizens or subjects of a foreign state are additional parties.a.
this defect could be fixed without difficulty if diversity jurisdiction would have been proper under a.see defective allegations of jurisdiction may be amended,upon terms,in the trial or appellate courts.but that leads us to the second problem.
one of the defendants linda chen,a former director of wynn resorts is neither a citizen of a state nor a citizen of a foreign state.specifically,in response to a sua sponte order by this court,the defendants have filed a declaration by chen in which she swears that she is a united states citizen but do es not reside in the united states and ha s not been a permanent resident of any state in the united states since approximately.indeed,chen swears that by the time the plaintiffs first filed their complaint in august,she had already become a permanent resident of macau,a status she claims she still retains.
chen declarations establish that she is not domiciled in a state.see.band of choctaw indians holyfield,for adults,domicile is established by physical presence in a place in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one intent to remain there.she therefore can not be a citizen of a state for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,at in order to be a citizen of a state within the meaning of the diversity statute,a natural person must both be a citizen of the united states and be domiciled within the state.because chen is a united states citizen,but has no domicile in any state,she is stateless for purposes of a.id.such stateless status destroy s complete diversity under a.id.at.
in short,chen continued presence in the suit necessarily foils the plaintiffs attempt to comply with a.
fortunately,the jurisdictional defects described above can be remedied without need for a remand.first,even though chen is a nondiverse party,rule of the federal rules of civil procedure gives us discretion to dismiss her from the suit in order to perfect diversity jurisdiction,provided that she is not an indispensable party under rule.id.at holding that,under rule,the courts of appeals have the authority to dismiss a dispensable nondiverse party sams beech aircraft,cir.rule grants a federal district or appellate court the discretionary power to perfect its diversity jurisdiction by dropping a nondiverse party provided the nondiverse party is not indispensable to the action under rule.
we have no trouble concluding that chen is a dispensable party under rule.she was not a member of the wynn resorts board when the shareholders filed their amended complaint nor was she a member of the wynn resorts board that approved the macau donation.the shareholders have not made a single allegation about her during the course of this appeal,and in their supplemental briefing before us,they have not attempted to argue that she is indispensable.given those circumstances,it is evident that none of the parties will be harmed by her dismissal,at.there is no suggestion that her presence provided the shareholders with a tactical advantage,or that any party would be prejudiced by her dismissal.because n othing but a waste of time and resources would be engendered by remanding to the district court or by forcing these parties to begin anew,we exercise our discretion to dismiss chen from the suit without prejudice.
second,in supplemental filings with our court,the shareholders acknowledged that jurisdiction would be proper under a if we were to dismiss chen from the case.because we have decided to do exactly that,we construe the shareholders supplemental brief as a request to amend their jurisdictional allegation from a to a.we grant such motion,dismiss chen from the suit,and conclude that federal jurisdiction is thereby established under a.
a shareholder seeking to vindicate the interests of a corporation through a derivative suit must first demand action from the corporation directors or plead with particularity the reasons why such demand would have been futile.rosenbloom pyott,cir.quoting in re silicon graphics.sec,cir.as amended.such requirement follows from the general rule of american law that the board of directors controls a corporation.potter hughes,cir.the board control includes and ought to include the decision whether to pursue litigation when the corporation may have suffered harm.hence,a bsent sufficient reason to doubt the directors ability to make disinterested and independent decisions about litigation,the board is not only empowered but optimally positioned to make decisions on behalf of the corporation and,if appropriate,pursue litigation.mun.police emps.ret.pyott.ch,rev sub nom.on other grounds pyott.mun.police emps.ret.
the demand futility rule is also reflected in the heightened pleading standard set forth in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which requires shareholders who bring derivative suits to state with particularity a any effort by the plaintiff to obtain the desired action from the directors or comparable authority and,if necessary,from the shareholders or members and b the reasons for not obtaining the action or not making the effort.fed.civ.b.
because nevada is wynn resorts state of incorporation,nevada law governs whether the shareholders have adequately alleged demand futility.kamen kemper fin.nevada,in turn,looks to delaware law on shareholder demand futility.shoen sac holding.accordingly,w hen evaluating demand futility,nevada courts must examine whether particularized facts demonstrate in those cases in which the directors approved the challenged transactions,a reasonable doubt that the directors were disinterested or that the business judgment rule otherwise protects the challenged decisions or in those cases in which the challenged transactions did not involve board action or the board of directors has changed since the transactions,a reasonable doubt that the board can impartially consider a demand.id.
the relevant board is the board as it was constituted when the shareholders filed their amended complaint.braddock zimmerman.as such,the shareholders must allege that at least half of the board,as it was constituted when the shareholders filed the amended complaint,was incapable of entertaining a demand.such board consisted of eight members wynn,wynn,miller,wayson,virtue,shoemaker,hagenbuch,and irani.the defendants concede for purposes of this appeal that wynn and wynn are not independent.hence,to plead demand futility,the shareholders must make sufficient allegations that at least two of the remaining six directors lack independence.the shareholders focus on three miller,wayson,and virtue 
the shareholders offer three principal theories as to why they believe demand was futile.first,the shareholders maintain that a majority of the board is beholden to steve wynn.second,the shareholders argue that the directors face a substantial likelihood of personal liability for approving the macau donation.third,the shareholders argue that there is a reasonable doubt that the directors would get the benefit of the business judgment rule if the okada redemption were challenged in court.
the district court determination that the shareholders failed to comply with rule or state law governing demand futility is reviewed for abuse of discretion.potter,at 
to prevail,the shareholders must give sufficiently particularized allegations to support an inference that a majority of the board lacks independence.the shareholders need to pick up at least two of the three directors miller,wayson,and virtue.to show a lack of independence,shareholders must allege facts that show that the majority of directors is beholden to directors who are unable to consider a demand on its merits.shoen,at.this test requires the shareholders to plead facts that would support the inference that because of the nature of a relationship or additional circumstances other than the interested director stock ownership or voting power,the director would be more willing to risk his or her reputation than risk the relationship with the interested director.beam ex rel.martha stewart living omnimedia,stewart.
importantly,the simple fact that there are some financial ties between the interested party and the director is not disqualifying.in re mfws holders.ch.to that end,a plaintiff seeking to show that a director was not independent must meet a materiality standard,under which the court must conclude that the director in question material ties to the person whose proposal or actions she is evaluating are sufficiently substantial that she can not objectively fulfill her fiduciary duties.id.as to materiality,the delaware supreme court has rejected the suggestion that the correct standard for materiality is a reasonable person standard rather,it is necessary to look to the financial circumstances of the director in question to determine materiality.id.at.the same materiality requirement applies in the context of personal,rather than financial relationships.id.at.such relationships must be contextually material.id.at.
we consider each of the three relevant directors in turn.
the shareholders complaint alleges the following about miller he is a partner in a parent company nevada rose of a group of companies that sell rose nectar used at wynn resorts in macau he is a director of a company igt that makes casino games used at wynn resorts steve wynn helped miller win reelection as governor of nevada in by donating to his campaign and by trying unsuccessfully to discourage a potential rival from challenging miller in the primary in,miller testified on steve wynn behalf at a libel suit wynn had brought against the author of an unauthorized biography,and during his testimony miller described himself as a year old friend of wynn and finally,steve wynn and wynn resorts provided campaign contributions to miller son when he ran for nevada secretary of state between and.
we agree with the district court that these allegations are insufficiently particularized to plead miller beholdenness to steve wynn.the allegations about miller financial ties to wynn are inadequate because they fail to allege materiality,as they do nothing to compare the actual economic circumstances of miller to the ties the shareholders contend affect his impartiality.in re mfw,at.in other words,like the shareholders in mfw,the shareholders here have ignored a key teaching of the delaware supreme court,requiring a showing that a specific director independence is compromised by factors material to her.id.similarly,with respect to wynn campaign contributions,the shareholders fail to allege the relative importance that is,the contextual materiality of wynn contribution or of the pressure wynn exerted on one of miller potential primary challengers who never even heeded wynn request,and wound up losing by a wide margin anyway.moreover,the passage of time nearly years would seem to dilute whatever materiality such aid might have had in the first place.miller decision to testify on wynn behalf at a trial in,and wynn contributions to miller son campaigns,are too insubstantial and are likewise devoid of allegations as to materiality.
the shareholders complaint alleges the following about wayson wynn father and wayson father operated a bingo hall together in the wayson brother and sister have worked with steve wynn in various capacities over the years wayson has worked at enterprises for many years and has received substantial monetary compensation for doing so and wayson has an unspecified business interest in gaming activity in pennsylvania.
as with miller,we conclude that the complaint allegations about wayson are not enough to plead a lack of independence.again,any financial or economic ties are not alleged to be material.nor do the social ties support an inference that wayson and wynn are as thick as blood relations,in re mfw,at,or that wayson relationship with wynn is otherwise material to him in any way.taken together,we do not see how the allegations with regard to wayson cast his impartiality into doubt.it certainly was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that they do not.
finally,the shareholders complaint alleges the following about virtue that when he joined the wynn resorts board,he received a nearly million ownership stake,which was given to him partly to compensate him for having to close accounts he had previously managed at a private equity firm called midocean partners and in the late and early,virtue worked at deutsche bank,and deutsche bank provided financing to steve wynn for various ventures.
these allegations strike us as the weakest of all.the complaint has no allegations as to the materiality of virtue million stock options,and in any event the inference would seem to cut against the shareholders,insofar as virtue interest in the financial health of wynn resorts would incline him to pursue its interests rather than subordinate them to steve wynn personal interests.likewise,the allegations of vague and impersonal business relationships more than a decade and a half ago are too insubstantial to call into question virtue independence.see beam,at allegations that the controller and the other directors developed business relationships before joining the board are insufficient,without more,to rebut the presumption of independence.
finally,the shareholders complaint advances a generalized theory that steve wynn dominates the entire board because,the complaint alleges,each member of the board has been by stephen wynn,is virtually guaranteed election to the board by virtue of the voting agreement and,therefore,is beholden to stephen wynn for his or her nomination and selection to the board and will not take action against him.the complaint also alleges that wynn caused okada to be ousted from the board after okada opposed the macau donation.in their brief,the shareholders argue that such allegations support the reasonable inference that wynn would,and could,remove any directors who oppose him,and they argue that the district court erred in failing to draw such inference.
these allegations are inadequate to show a lack of independence.first,the complaint acknowledges that wynn in fact lacked the unilateral power to remove okada and second,the complaint acknowledges that the board had objective,independent evidence of okada potentially illegal activities unrelated to the macau donation,which served as the basis for his share redemption.what remains of the shareholders domination theory is simply too speculative and insufficiently particularized to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of rule 
in addition to arguing that demand was futile because a majority of the board is beholden to steve wynn,
