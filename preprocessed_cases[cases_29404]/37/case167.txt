facts and proceedings 
on august,the district attorney of plumas county filed a criminal complaint charging defendant with a violation of section,subdivision a in that he used vacuum and suction dredge equipment in a river,stream,or lake without a permit count i and with a violation of section,subdivision d in that he possessed a vacuum and suction dredge within an area closed to the use of that equipment and within yards of waters closed to the use of that equipment count ii.
on october,defendant demurred to the complaint arguing that,in light of section as amended,the state has indefinitely suspended the issuance of all permits for suction dredging,closing all waters of the state to that use.on december,the trial court overruled the demurrer.
on may,defendant waived his right to a jury and agreed to a court trial regarding the violations with which he was charged.the parties stipulated to the following facts 
on or about june,defendant brandon rinehart did use vacuum and suction dredge equipment in the county of plumas in a river or stream in the plumas national forest in an area closed to suction dredge mining by the state of california,and did not then possess a valid permit issued by the california department of fish and wildlife,then known as the department of fish and game,to use his vacuum and suction dredge equipment.
on or about june,defendant brandon rinehart did possess vacuum and suction dredge equipment in the county of plumas in the plumas national forest,and within yards of an area closed to suction dredge mining by the state of california.
the conduct identified in paragraphs and occurred within the boundaries of the nugget alley placer mining claim owned by defendant,and registered with the bureau of land management blm with serial number.
the court and the parties next turned to the defendant assertion of the affirmative defense that section is unenforceable against him because the statute,as applied,is preempted by federal law.
defendant made an offer of proof arguing that,if the evidence in the offer of proof was allowed to come before the court,it would establish that section was unenforceable under the circumstances presented here.the offer of proof was as follows 
defendant would testify that he was working in the water within the boundaries of the nugget alley mining claim,one of two contiguous mining claims owned by he and his father and four other locators.he would testify that he and his father obtained the claims by making a discovery of a valuable locatable mineral,posting a notice of location on the claim as required by law,filing the location notice with plumas county and then transmitting a copy of the location notice to the bureau of land management.he would offer as evidence a true copy of the location notice.he would testify that the location notice identifies,and establishes,upon acceptance by blm,the boundaries of the claim.he would offer pictures of the claim,and areas where gold is to be found,together with a picture of substantial quantities of gold recovered from the claim.
defendant would testify that blm accepted the location notice and registered the nugget alley claim with serial number,and offer a true copy of a printout from the blm system,showing that this claim and the adjacent claims are in good standing with the united states,all required fees having been paid to all governmental entities.he would testify that the nugget alley claim,though located on land which the federal government has legal title within the plumas national forest,is private property on which he and the other owners pay real estate taxes to plumas county,and offer a true copy of the most recent tax bill from plumas county.
he would offer a map of the area and testify that at the time he was cited by the game warden,he was within the boundaries the claim.
defendant would testify that placer claims,by their nature,contain gold deposited by water bodies.he would testify that much of california has already been subject to significant mining activity that has extracted the gold near to,but outside of,flowing waters,and that the nugget alley claim has been hydraulically mined in the past to remove such gold.
he would testify that he excavated test pits outside the areas of the claim to survey for the presence of recoverable gold and found no quantity of gold outside the areas.he would testify that the gold remaining on the claim,and additional gold brought from upstream sources,has been concentrated by flowing waters and may be found beneath the waters of the claim.
he would testify that the only method by which gold can be extracted from the nugget alley claim,and indeed most placer claims in california,is by utilizing a suction dredge to extract the streambed material underwater.he would testify that based on a typical day of five in the water,he has recovered roughly an ounce of gold per day,roughly,but on better days,he would recover an excess of an ounce,and that there is a continuing hope of hitting richer pockets which might lead to recoveries many times that amount.
defendant would testify that he attempted to use hand shovels and buckets to shovel out gravel from under the flowing water,which would then be processed outside the water by another miner using a highbanker to recover the gold.he would testify that this process was very difficult to accomplish because,among other things,the flowing water blew most of the gravel off the shovel,and visibility in the hole he was working would diminish to the point where it became unsafe to work.he attempted one day of this activity,laboriously filling buckets of gravel,and this backbreaking labor produced less than a tenth of an ounce of gold.
he would testify that,by contrast,the suction dredge moves and processes the gravel simultaneously without having to lift it out of the water,which is a much faster process in addition to recovering a greater quantity of gold.by way of comparison,it takes two men eight hours each to recover an ounce of gold or less by hand,while a single person working the suction dredge for five hours can recover half an ounce or more.for this reason,working by hand may be regarded as at least sixteen times less efficient than using the suction dredge.
defendant would testify that the alternative of digging by hand underwater is not a alternative,insofar as the backbreaking labor can not be sustained for extended periods and the economic return makes it unprofitable to pursue such an activity.for all these reasons,defendant would opine that the state refusal to issue a permit to operate his suction dredge is in substance a prohibition on mining his claim,and certainly represents material interference with his mining activities.
gerald hobbs would offer evidence that he has been a miner and prospector for over thirty years,has mined extensively throughout the western united states,and holds mining claims in california.he would testify that he has previously testified in litigation as an expert witness regarding suction dredge mining and evaluating stream deposits,and that he has previously taught suction dredge mining techniques and methods not only in california,but in other western states and abroad.
he would testify that he is the president and founder of public lands for the people,plp,a c nonprofit educational organization of small and medium size miners and prospectors,with constituent members totally roughly people.he would testify that as a result of his personal mining experience and role with plp,he has knowledge of both the methods and economics of small and mining,and the regulatory system of the state of california and the federal government.
he would testify that much of california has already been subject to significant mining activity that has extracted placer deposits of gold,and that early miners tended to mine the banks of california rivers and streams,but not underwater deposits.in particular,the technique of hydraulic mining using a high pressure hose to wash soil deposits near rivers and streams into a sluice removed much of the gold deposited adjacent to water bodies,but much gold was lost in the process,washed into the rivers and streams,and remains there for subsequent miners.in addition,lode deposits continue to erode and release gold into the rivers and streams,replenishing in stream deposits.
hobbs would testify that he has not yet had an opportunity to visit defendant claim but intends to do so if the trial is continued beyond and he is permitted to testify at trial,but has examined photographs of the claim and spoken with defendant concerning its nature.
he would testify that assuming the truth of defendant statements,the only deposits of gold likely present on the claim are located underwater,and that the only practical method of recovering those deposits is to vacuum the gravel up with a suction dredge.in particular,he would confirm that suction dredges are much more efficient at removing and processing gravels,and that mining by hand generally will not produce an economic return because,among other things,the richest deposits that could be profitably mined by hand are long gone.he would also testify that theoretical alternatives such as damming and redirecting entire rivers to expose the river bottom for equipment are not economically or legally feasible.
he would testify that the typical suction dredge costs approximately or more.additional support gear,such as a,diving gear,weight belts,pry bars,winching gear,chains,tools,and other needed items can cost easily an additional or more.the typical small scale placer suction dredge miner has easily or more invested in equipment alone.the mining industry as a whole has substantial investment in equipment for suction dredging.
he would testify that the state refusal to issue permits for suction dredging makes all this mining capital worth substantially less,and materially interferes with the development of california mineral resources on federal lands and elsewhere as a general matter,and amounts to a prohibition against the mining of the vast majority of federal placer gold claims in northern california and southwest oregon,including defendant claim.
thomas kitchar would testify that he has been employed in the field of gold mining as his primary source of income since december of when he was employed by the homestake mining company hmc in lead,for nearly four years at depths of over feet as a hard rock underground gold miner.during that period,he rose through the ranks gaining msha certification as an underground miner class,motorman class,lhd operator class,and cager class.while working for the hmc,in his spare time,he taught himself the practices of the placer gold miner,located claims of his own,and became familiar with,among other things,the forest service mining regulations at.
he would testify that in the fall of,he ceased working for hmc,and by the fall of had outfitted himself with placer mining equipment,including a suction dredge,and moved to sw oregon with the intent of locating valuable placer gold mining claims and then working them as his sole source of income.
he would testify that after several years of prospecting and searching for ground rich enough to work and claim,by he had located claims along a creek near the california border a dozen or so miles from the nearest town.he moved onto one of these claims,and has lived on this claim years to this day while working this and other nearby and adjacent claims.in the course of his mining work,he has become knowledgeable in the mining techniques employed by defendants and other small scale miners.
kitchar would testify that in response to baseless environmentalist attacks upon suction dredge mining,in about the year he joined and got involved with the waldo mining district wmd to help fight against these threats.in june of,he was elected president of the wmd,and continues to hold that office to this day.wmd was established through on april,and later pursuant to provisions of the mining law of,and is a federally recognized mining district with certain governmental authority over mining within the boundaries of the district.the purpose of the wmd is to preserve,protect,and promote mining within the district and elsewhere.the district is based in cave junction,oregon.
both as a miner and as president of the wmd,he has become familiar with the regulatory provisions concerning suction dredge mining.he has published a book entitled the gold prospector guide to researching and locating mining claims,and has testified in numerous judicial and regulatory proceedings concerning suction dredge mining at both the state and federal level.
he would testify that much of southwest oregon and northern california has already been subject to significant mining activity that has extracted placer deposits of gold,and that earlier miners tended to mine the banks of rivers and streams,and sometimes even the beds of those streams if they were not too deep,but that they could not mine the deeper underwater deposits.in particular,the technique of hydraulic mining using a high pressure hose or monitor to wash soil deposits near rivers and streams into a sluice removed much of the gold deposited adjacent to water bodies,but much of the gold was lost in the process,washed into the rivers and streams with the tailings where it has been reconcentrated and deposited,and remains there for subsequent miners.in addition,upland lode and placer deposits continue to erode and release gold into the rivers and streams,replenishing deposits.
he would testify that gold,because of its high specific gravity,tends to deposit in certain areas of live running streams,and has the tendency to sink down though the bed materials until it reaches some impervious layer,usually the underlying bedrock.in general,the closer the miner gets to the bedrock,more gold will be recovered with the best pay being found on the bedrock or in cracks in the bedrock.the modern suction dredge is the most efficient tool yet devised,and the only practical tool,for recovering gold from underwater bedrock cracks.
he would testify that he has not visited defendant claim,but has examined photographs of the claim.
he would testify that assuming the truth of defendant statements,the only deposits of gold likely present on the claim are located underwater,and that the only practical method of recovering those deposits is to vacuum the gravel up with a suction dredge.in particular,he would confirm that suction dredges are much more efficient at removing and processing instream gravels,and that mining by hand generally will not produce an economic return because,among other things,the richest deposits that could be profitably mined by hand are long gone or too far underwater.he would also testify that theoretical alternatives such as damming and redirecting entire rivers to expose the river bottom for equipment are not economically or legally feasible.
he would testify that the typical suction dredge costs approximately or more.additional support gear,such as a,diving gear,weight belts,pry bars,winching gear,chains,tools,and other needed items can cost easily an additional or more.the typical small scale placer suction dredge miner has easily or more invested in equipment alone.the mining industry as a whole has substantial investment in equipment for suction dredging.
he would testify that the state refusal to issue permits for suction dredging makes all this mining capital worth substantially less,and materially interferes with the development of california mineral resources on federal lands and elsewhere as a general matter,and amounts to a prohibition against the mining of the vast majority of federal placer gold claims in california,including defendant claim.
the parties stipulated that defendant had permits as required by the law when they were available and would have continued to apply for such permits if permits were being issued.the parties further stipulated that the court could accept into evidence a document entitled california department of fish and wildlife report to the legislature regarding instream suction dredge mining under the fish and game code dated april.
after extensive argument by both parties and questioning by the court,the trial court held that prosecution of defendant for violations of section,subdivisions a and d was not barred on the grounds that the provisions of the statute,and therefore its enforcement,are preempted by federal law.the court allowed into evidence defendant proposed testimony set forth in paragraphs through of the offer of proof,but,based upon the court ruling on the affirmative defense of preemption,excluded the testimony set forth in paragraphs through,and excluded the proposed testimony of hobbs and kitchar.
the court found defendant guilty of count i and count ii of the complaint,suspended imposition of sentence,and ordered that defendant be placed on three years summary probation.the court also ordered defendant to pay certain fines and fees but stayed payment of the fines pending successful completion of probation.
on august,the appellate division of the superior court of plumas county certified this case for transfer to this court pursuant to rule,california rules of court.on october,this court transferred the matter to this court for purposes of appeal.
on appeal,defendant contends the trial court erred when it rejected his defense that enforcement of the provisions of fish and game code sections and,operating together,are preempted by federal law.he further contends the trial court erred by excluding evidence that the state de facto refusal to issue suction dredge mining permits required by section results in an unconstitutional interference with his mining rights.as noted earlier,we will reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings on the issue of federal preemption.
discussion 
ifundamental principles of federal preemption 
we turn first to certain fundamental principles of the law of federal preemption as they relate to congress authority over federal lands.
the property clause of the united states constitution provides that congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states,art iv,cl.the united states supreme court has repeatedly observed that the power over the public land thus entrusted to congress is without limitations.kleppe new mexico,d,quoting united states san francisco.
even so,the state is free to enforce its criminal and civil laws on federal land so long as those laws do not conflict with federal law.citation.the property clause itself does not automatically conflict with all state regulation of federal land.rather,a bsent consent or cession a state undoubtedly retains jurisdiction over federal lands within its territory,but congress equally surely retains the power to enact legislation respecting those lands pursuant to the property clause.and when congress so acts,the federal legislation necessarily overrides conflicting state laws under the supremacy clause.citation.california coastal comm granite rock,d,citing kleppe new mexico,supra,at granite rock italics added.put differently,t he property clause gives congress plenary power over federal land however,even within the sphere of the property clause,state law is only when it conflicts with the operation or objectives of federal law citation.id.at d at.
s tate law can be in either of two general ways.if congress evidences an intent to occupy a given field,any state law falling within that field is.citations.if congress has not entirely displaced state regulation over the matter in question,state law is still to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law,that is,when it is impossible to comply with both state and federal law citation or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of congress,citation.silkwood kerr mcgee,d,see also,viva,supra,cal th at.
federal mining law 
the federal government policy relating to mining and minerals is set forth at title united states code section.except as otherwise provided,all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the united states,both surveyed and unsurveyed,shall be free and open to exploration and purchase,and the lands in which they are found to occupation and purchase,by citizens of the united states under regulations prescribed by law,and according to the local customs and rules of miners in the several mining districts,so far as the same are applicable and not inconsistent with the laws of the united states.
we deal here mainly with the mining act of.
under the mining act of,stat,as amended,usc et,a private citizen may enter federal lands to explore for mineral deposits.if a person locates a valuable mineral deposit on federal land,and perfects the claim by properly staking it and complying with other statutory requirements,the claimant shall have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines of their locations,citation,although the united states retains title to the land.the holder of a perfected mining claim may secure a patent to the land by complying with the requirements of the mining act and regulations promulgated thereunder citation and,upon issuance of the patent,legal title to the land passes to the patent holder.granite rock,supra,at pp.d at.
the united states supreme court has recognized that the intent of congress in passing the mining laws was to reward and encourage the discovery of minerals that are valuable in an economic sense.united states coleman,d.
constitutionally speaking,under most circumstances,the states are free to enact environmental statutes and regulations binding on those holding unpatented mining claims on federal lands so long as those statutes and regulations do not rise to the level of impermissible state land use regulations.see granite rock,supra,d.the line between environmental regulation and land use planning will not always be bright for example,one may hypothesize a state environmental regulation so severe that a particular land use would become commercially impracticable.however,the core activity described by each phrase is undoubtedly different.land use planning in essence chooses particular uses for the land environmental regulation,at its core,does not mandate particular uses of the land but requires only that,however the land is used,damage to the environment is kept within prescribed limits.id.at d at.
