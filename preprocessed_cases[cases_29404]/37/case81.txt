decision and order 
carl kramer,formerly the owner of the dog house saloon in the village of north fond du lac,wisconsin,brought this civil rights action under against the village and its police chief,larry wodack.he alleges that his civil rights were violated when the defendants,while acting under color of state law,selectively prosecuted him,in violation of the equal protection clause.the defendants also are alleged to have deprived the plaintiff of liberty and property without due process of law and to have caused him to be subject to an unreasonable search.before me presently is the defendants motion for summary judgment.for the reasons stated herein,the motion will be granted.
factual background 
much of the factual background of this case is set forth by the wisconsin supreme court in its decision remanding the plaintiff criminal conviction for commercial gambling crimes,state kramer,wi,and in my january,decision and order in this case which dismissed claims against defendant thomas storm,the fond du lac county district attorney.some facts are worth repeating,however,inasmuch as they remain relevant here.
in the,video gambling machines were widely offered in taverns in fond du lac county,including the plaintiff dog house saloon.the machines would not actually pay out money themselves,as in a typical casino slot or video poker machine.instead,a patron would accumulate points,or credits,on the machine and then ask a bartender to exchange those credits for cash.
while the machines were certainly popular with some bar patrons,they were not universally appreciated in the community.in,chief wodack received an anonymous call complaining about the gambling machines and asking the police department to get involved.wodack aff.in may,the north fond du lac police department received a letter from three anonymous residents who complained that their husbands were losing a lot of money every week in the taverns.wodack aff.later,in august,wodack department received another anonymous letter urging the department to do something about the video gambling machines in north fond du lac.that letter accused the police and politicians of ignoring the problem and letting the tavern owners rip off the taxpayers.lamb,ex.presumably,the tavern owners were not reporting their gambling earnings as taxable income.
the fond du lac county district attorneys had not regularly prosecuted offenses involving gambling machines because of what they viewed as the vagueness of the law.storm,ex.specifically,there was apparently some confusion about what constituted a gambling machine in violation of.stat.but that confusion was dissipated when the wisconsin court of appeals decided state hahn.in that case,the court emphasized that video gaming machines were not gambling machines,per se,because they could be used purely for amusement purposes.to violate the law,gambling machines must pay out money or something of value,even if the player prize is not automatically awarded by the machine but is awarded by the owner or lessee of the machine.id.at.
upon the heels of the hahn decision,a letter was sent to tavern owners and liquor license owners indicating that,following hahn,the policy of the fond du lac county sheriff department and district attorney office would be to investigate and prosecute complaints of commercial gambling.the september,letter was written on the sheriff department stationary and was signed by sheriff jim gilmore and district attorney tom storm,both of whom were previously dismissed as defendants earlier in this action.storm,ex.the letter was sent only to taverns in unincorporated areas of the county,however,because incorporated areas including north fond du lac are serviced by their own law enforcement agencies and are not normally policed by the county sheriff.dpff storm aff.thus,none of the tavern owners in north fond du lac or other incorporated areas of the county received the warning letter 
though the plaintiff did not receive the letter,he admitted that the letter contents became a hot topic among tavern owners in north fond du lac and that he became aware of the letter within a week after it was sent out.bitar,ex.at.the plaintiff central complaint in this action surrounds what happened following the letter transmittal.at his deposition,he alleged that chief wodack told other bar owners to keep operating as usual,and that it was all right to operate games like the cherry master video gambling machine involved here.id.at.the plaintiff admitted,however,that he never had a conversation with chief wodack about the issue himself.when asked whether wodack ever told anyone that it would be okay to make payouts for play on the machines the act which the hahn court found to be illegal,the plaintiff replied,i do know about payouts,but he told us to keep operating as we are.id.
in fact.chief wodack department,with the assistance of the lake winnebago area metropolitan enforcement group meg drug unit,had actually begun an investigation of commercial gambling in the village of north fond du lac in july beginning that month,meg unit officers went undercover to the taverns in north fond du lac and obtained cash payouts from bartenders,including the bartender at the dog house saloon.dpfof.in early december of,one of the investigators obtained anticipatory search warrants for eight village of north fond du lac taverns.each warrant was to be executed on december if,and only if,the investigators successfully completed a commercial gambling transaction,received money in exchange for points on the afternoon of december at the tavern for which the warrant was issued.bitar,ex.the warrants authorized the seizure of divers goods,chattels and property,gambling machines,ledgers,notes,envelopes,currency,utility bills,bank statements,tax returns and other items which identify persons in control of the property and other evidence of crimes of commercial gambling.bitar,ex.at seven of the eight taverns in the village,the officers were able to meet the requirements of the search warrants the two machines at one tavern were apparently out of order.dpfof.at the dog house saloon,the search turned up several ledgers and envelopes evidencing football and other gambling activity,as well as one dyna cherry master standing floor model video gambling machine containing in currency.bitar,ex.
several months later,kramer,along with the owners of the other six taverns at which the search warrants were successfully executed,were charged with various counts of commercial gambling,a felony under wisconsin law.stat.prior to his trial,kramer moved to suppress evidence seized from his tavern on the ground that it had been illegally obtained in violation of the fourth amendment and to dismiss the information on the ground he was being selectively prosecuted.the judge denied both motions,finding that the search was reasonable and that kramer had failed to make out a prima facie case of selective prosecution.bitar,ex.at.at trial,the plaintiff was found guilty of two counts of commercial gambling,and was sentenced to community service and ordered to make donations to gamblers anonymous.bitar,ex.
kramer successfully appealed his conviction to the wisconsin court of appeals,which reversed the circuit court judgment on the ground that he had been selectively prosecuted.state kramer,wi app.the court of appeals concluded that the gambling prosecutions had been arbitrarily limited to one geographic area,the village of north fond du lac.because the state had failed to demonstrate a valid reason for this limitation,the court held that the conviction could not stand.the wisconsin supreme court granted the state petition for review,however,and reversed.wi.although it agreed with the court of appeals that kramer had established a prima facie claim of selective prosecution,the supreme court concluded that the state had not been afforded the opportunity to rebut the prima facie claim by demonstrating a valid exercise of discretion.the supreme court therefore remanded the case back to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing on the rebuttal issue.at.on remand,kramer entered into a plea bargain with the state,and the judgment of conviction was amended by reducing the two offenses with which he was charged to class a misdemeanors contrary to.stat.b which prohibits setting up gambling machines to be used for the purpose of gambling.all other terms and conditions of the original judgment remained unchanged.dpfof.
in the plaintiff brought this civil rights action,alleging that several defendants violated his constitutional rights.on a motion to dismiss,i dismissed the claims against thomas storm,the fond du lac district attorney,based on prosecutorial immunity.later,pursuant to a stipulation,claims against fond du lac county and its sheriff,james gilmore,were dismissed.remaining are the plaintiff claims against the village of north fond du lac and its police chief,larry wodack.
ii.analysis 
to state a claim for relief under,the plaintiff must allege that he was deprived of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states,and that the deprivation was visited upon them by a person or persons acting under color of state law.gomez toledo,d alvarado litscher,cir.as the second element is satisfied here,the focus will be on whether the plaintiff has produced evidence such that a reasonable jury could find that either of the defendants actions deprived him of a right secured by the constitution or federal law.
summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with any affidavits,show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.the moving party has the initial burden of demonstrating that it is entitled to summary judgment.id.at.once this burden is met,the nonmoving party must designate specific facts to support or defend its case.id.at.
in analyzing whether a question of fact exists,the court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.anderson liberty lobby,d.the mere existence of some factual dispute does not defeat a summary judgment motion,however there must be a genuine issue of material fact for the case to survive.id.at.
heck humphrey 
one issue defendants have raised as to plaintiff fourth amendment claim should be addressed at the outset since,if decided in defendants favor,it would seem to dispose of the entire action without further discussion.defendants claim that plaintiff fourth amendment claim is barred under the rule of heck humphrey,d.in heck,the supreme court held 
in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,a plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,expunged by executive order,declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination,or called into question by a federal court issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.a claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not been so invalidated is not cognizable under.
at.in this case,plaintiff conviction has not been overturned or set aside.although his conviction on the original charges was reversed,he later entered into a plea agreement with the state that resulted in misdemeanor convictions for the same conduct.thus,under heck,it would seem that plaintiff action should be barred as to those claims that would have rendered his underlying conviction invalid.
in response,plaintiff points out that heck is not bar to claims that would not necessarily imply that the plaintiff conviction was unlawful.id.at.booker ward,cir.because his fourth amendment claim is the type that would not necessarily imply that the plaintiff conviction was unlawful,plaintiff argues that heck does not apply.br.in opp.at,quoting heck,id.
it is true that a conviction can often stand,despite the fact that police may have obtained evidence without probable cause or a warrant in violation of the fourth amendment.the availability of other evidence to support a conviction or,as the court itself noted in heck,the applicability of the inevitable discovery and independent source doctrines,which allow the use of evidence even though it was illegally obtained,make such an outcome more than a possibility.thus,plaintiff contention that his fourth amendment claim does not imply the invalidity of his conviction,a contention that defendants have not challenged,is sufficient to remove that claim from heck bar.but the same does not seem true of plaintiff other claims.in addition to his claim that the defendants violated his rights under the fourth amendment claim,plaintiff also claims that the defendants violated his fourteenth amendment right to equal protection by causing his selective prosecution,and his due process right under the same amendment by entrapping him into committing the crime.if proven,either claim would seem to necessarily imply the invalidity of plaintiff conviction.selective prosecution and entrapment are complete defenses to a crime.if he had successfully asserted either one of them at his trial,plaintiff would not have been convicted.
but notwithstanding the apparent applicability of heck to plaintiff equal protection and due process claims,i decline to apply it here.defendants did not assert heck as a bar to plaintiff equal protection and due process claims,and so plaintiff had no reason to address its applicability to them.it may be that there are reasons that are not apparent from the record before me that heck is not applicable to those claims.in any event,it appears defendants have waivedheck as a defense to those claims and thus it would be improper for me to apply it.see carr,cir i therefore proceed to address the merits of plaintiff claims.
selective prosecution equal protection 
the plaintiff claims that he and other north fond du lac bar owners were singled out for prosecution,in violation of the equal protection clause.in support of the claim that his equal protection rights were violated,the plaintiff relies on the decision of the wisconsin supreme court,which found that he had established a prima facie case for selective prosecution in the trial court.state kramer.as noted earlier,kramer argument in his criminal appeal was that north fond du lac tavern owners were selectively prosecuted solely on the basis of geography.id.at.the supreme court found that he made out a prima facie case for selective prosecution because the district attorney only prosecuted north fond du lac bar owners to the exclusion of owners in other parts of the county.but the issue of geography,the only alleged grounds for discrimination,dropped out of this case once storm,gilmore and fond du lac county were dismissed from this action.that is,the original argument charged the district attorney with going after north fond du lac residents while favoring residents outside the village.but because the plaintiff is now only proceeding against the police chief of north fond du lac and the village itself,he can not logically claim that north fond du lac or its police chief selectively prosecuted only taverns in the village,while favoring bars.the plaintiff does not explain how either the village or the chief could have investigated or brought charges against taverns outside their jurisdiction.here,the evidence is clear and not disputed that all similarly situated tavern owners in north fond du lac were treated equally.owners and bartenders at eight taverns were investigated and charged with gambling violations,and
