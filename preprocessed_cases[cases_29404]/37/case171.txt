the process of statutory interpretation 
in construing any statute,w rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citation.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.citation.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.whaley sony computer entertainment america,th,d.
with respect to legislative history,as a general rule in order to be cognizable it must shed light on the collegial view of the legislature as a whole.citation.kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,d.for example,t he statements of an individual legislator,including the author of a bill,are generally not considered in construing a statute,as the court task is to ascertain the intent of the legislature as a whole in adopting a piece of legislation.citations.citation.ibid.
the text of the statute 
section provides in relevant part 
notwithstanding the provisions of sections,and,or any other provision of this part,an agency shall not provide any form of direct assistance to 
c a development or business,either directly or indirectly,for the acquisition,construction,improvement,rehabilitation,or replacement of property that is or would be used for gambling or gaming of any kind whatsoever including,but not limited to,casinos,gaming clubs,bingo operations,or any facility wherein banked or percentage games,any form of gambling device,or lotteries,other than the california state lottery,are or will be played.
d the prohibition in subdivision c is not intended to prohibit a redevelopment agency from acquiring property on or in which an existing gambling enterprise is located,for the purpose of selling or leasing the property for uses other than gambling,provided that the agency acquires the property for fair market value.italics added.
notwithstanding the ambiguity created by the italicized language in the statute quoted above,we assume for purposes of this decision that section prohibits redevelopment agencies from providing either direct or indirect assistance to businesses in the development of gaming facilities.the legislative history clearly indicates that the legislature intended to prohibit agencies from providing both direct and indirect assistance to such entities.see,legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.this bill would further prohibit a redevelopment agency from providing any form of direct or indirect assistance to a development or business,italics added concurrence in,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,hereafter concurrence in amends.stating that senate amendments to assembly bill add a prohibition on indirect assistance to gambling enterprises.
section does not expressly define direct or indirect assistance.however,the use of the term assistance suggests that the legislature intended to prohibit redevelopment agencies from affirmatively aiding businesses that are engaged in the development of gaming facilities.see webster third new international dict.defining assistance as the act or action of assisting,and defining assist as to give support or aid.
further,the context in which the term assistance is used in section suggests that the legislature intended to prevent redevelopment agencies from using the powers granted to them by the community redevelopment law to assist businesses in the development of gaming facilities.the opening paragraph of section provides,notwithstanding the provisions of sections,and,or any other provision of this part an agency shall not provide any form of direct assistance to 
the legislative history of section 
the legislative history of section supports the conclusion that the legislature intended to prevent redevelopment agencies from providing assistance to businesses engaged in developing gaming facilities.section was initially adopted in to prohibit redevelopment agencies from using redevelopment powers to assist automobile dealerships and certain big box retailers.stats.in,the legislature amended section to add the prohibition on assisting gaming enterprises.stats.the legislative history of the amendment describes this history 
california community redevelopment law lets cities and counties create redevelopment agencies rda to improve blighted project areas.rda use eminent domain,extraordinary land management powers,and tax increment difference between the property taxes generated before and after the redevelop project areas.
for decades,the community redevelopment law has proved very lucrative for the communities that use its powers to attract and retain private investment,but very controversial with citizens,taxpayers,and businesses that must live under its powerful tools.in the last three decades,the legislature has responded to rda critics by enacting various reforms.
in,the legislature passed a comprehensive redevelopment reform measure to refine the definition of blight,standardize intergovernmental fiscal relationships,and limit agencies longevity assembly bill,isenberg.as part of the reform,the legislature banned the use of redevelopment funds for certain automobile dealerships,big box retailers,and new city halls and county administration buildings,but existing revenue pledges.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june.hereafter senate analysis.
the senate analysis also noted that two redevelopment agencies had been assisting gambling enterprises.the senate analysis characterized this assistance using the same language directly or indirectly that appears in section 
two of the state rda have recently been involved in assisting,directly or indirectly,gambling enterprises.in the,the city of bell gardens rda los angeles county signed a lease with the bicycle club,a card casino,to use land as a parking lot for a year.more recently,the city of palm springs rda riverside county proposed to give land to an indian tribe so that the tribe could establish a gambling casino downtown in conjunction with caesar.the rda would have received two to three percent of the casino profits.the attorney general unsuccessfully sued the city,and the case is currently on appeal.caesar,however,has terminated its plans to participate in the casino.senate analysis,supra,at.
this legislative history suggests that the legislature intended to prohibit redevelopment agencies from providing assistance like the direct assistance giving land and indirect assistance leasing land discussed in these examples.
there are numerous other indications in the legislative history that suggest that the legislature intend to prohibit redevelopment agencies from subsidizing gaming enterprises.see concurrence in,supra,at proponents argue that redevelopment agencies should not subsidize gambling enterprises com.on local,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,pp.after redevelopment agencies rdas expressed an interest in promoting gambling enterprises,state lawmakers grew concerned.worried that gambling would promote blight instead of abate it,they want to prohibit rdas from spending public money to promote gambling and gaming governor off.of plan.and,enrolled bill report on assem.bill reg.sess.july,hereafter enrolled bill report proponents contended that gaming enterprises can establish themselves without redevelopment help.
in contrast,there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the legislature intended to require redevelopment agencies to oppose any attempt by a business to establish a gaming enterprise within a redevelopment project area.citizens relies on the following quotation from the enrolled bill report the author staff explained that assembly bill no.is being introduced to stop any future development and assistance of gambling enterprises in redevelopment project areas.enrolled bill report,supra,at,italics added.however,the intention of the bill author in introducing the bill is not indicative of the legislature intent in passing the bill.kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,supra,th at,d.
the agency did not provide direct or indirect assistance to a gaming entity in adopting the 
in support of its claim that the agency violated section,citizens asserts that the msa provides direct assistance to the development of property inside the redevelopment project area which will be used for gambling or gaming.italics added.citizens notes that the opening paragraph of the msa states the following 
this msa is made by and between the city of hesperia hereinafter the city,which term shall include the city of hesperia,hesperia community redevelopment agency,the hesperia water district,and the hesperia fire protection district and the tribe.citizen also notes that the msa states that the city will provide various municipal services to the planned casino,including sewer and water service and police and fire protection.
