one of the oldest contracts between native americans and europeans in the united states was dutch representative peter minuit purchase of manhattan island from indians for guilders worth of goods in.the dutch west india company instructed its new netherlands representatives to pay something therefor to their satisfaction and to obtain a signed contract signed by them in their manner.times change.over three hundred and years later,native americans,in a reversal of roles,reached an agreement with city representatives that resulted in this litigation.the federated indians of the graton rancheria,a federally recognized indian tribe tribe announced plans to build a casino,hotel,spa and entertainment resort on land located west of the city of rohnert park city when the city approved an agreement with the tribe regarding potential local impacts of the proposed casino project,an individual and a citizens group filed a petition for writ of mandate to place a referendum on the ballot regarding the city action.
the superior court denied the petition,stating that the city agreement constituted an administrative act that merely pursued a plan adopted by a superior power.plaintiffs appeal from that judgment.for reasons we explain below,we agree with the superior court and affirm.
background 
in order to set the events giving rise to this appeal in the appropriate legal context,we first summarize the federal regulatory scheme concerning gaming on indian lands,then review the facts leading up to the superior court judgment.
regulation of indian gaming 
indian tribes have always held a special position in our society.it must always be remembered that the various indian tribes were once independent and sovereign nations,and that their claim to sovereignty long predates that of our own government t he relation of the indian tribes living within the borders of the united states is an anomalous one and of a complex character they were,and always have been,regarded as having a position when they preserved their tribal relations not as states,not as nations,not as possessed of the full attributes of sovereignty,but as a separate people,with the power of regulating their internal and social relations,and thus far not brought under the laws of the union or of the state within whose limits they resided.citation.mcclanahan arizona state tax comm,d.
in,the united states supreme court rejected california attempt to regulate gaming on indian reservations.california cabazon band of mission indians,d.in response to that decision,congress enacted the indian gaming regulatory act igra,et,which authorized tribal gaming,but allowed states some role in the regulation of indian gaming.artichoke joe california grand casino norton cir,artichoke joe.the senate select committee report on igra stated the intent to expressly preempt the field in the governance of gaming activities on indian lands,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news.
of the three classes of gaming authorized by igra,class iii gaming,which includes the types of games usually associated with gambling,as well as slot machines,is the most heavily regulated.artichoke joe,supra.among other requirements,class iii gaming on indian land is lawful only when located in a state that permits such gaming and only if the secretary of the interior has approved a compact b a.the igra provides for mediation if a state and tribe fail to reach agreement.d a b.igra also imposes on states an obligation to conduct compact negotiations in good faith,d a,and allows tribes to enforce that obligation in federal court citation.artichoke joe,supra,at.
because california law prohibited class iii gaming at the time the igra was enacted,california voters approved proposition,a constitutional amendment that authorized the governor to negotiate such gaming compacts.artichoke joe norton d,cal,art.iv,subd.f.
background of the city mou 
in this case,the tribe is comprised of coast miwok and southern pomo indians,whose aboriginal territory includes marin and sonoma counties.in,congress enacted the graton rancheria restoration act,restoring the tribe sovereign status.the same act of congress allowed the tribe to select land from its aboriginal territory to be accepted as a part of the tribe reservation.
in august of,the tribe contacted the rohnert park city council city council to advise them that the tribe had acquired an option to purchase acres in its aboriginal territory,near the city boundaries.the tribe asked to meet with the city council,to discuss the establishment of our reservation and the development of a casino on the optioned property.the tribe requested that the city authorize representatives to begin negotiating on a government to government basis the terms of an agreement to insure that the proposed project benefits the city as well as the tribe.an ad hoc committee authorized the mayor and a council member to meet with the tribe.
the city council held a public meeting on september,to discuss the proposed agreement with the tribe.the proposal drew comment from many opponents as well as supporters of the casino project.
in october of,the tribe and the city entered into a lengthy memorandum of understanding mou.it provided that the tribe intended to submit an application to the secretary of the interior,requesting the united states to take title to the property in trust for the tribe,and make a determination that the land shall be eligible for gaming under the igra.the mou recited that the tribe wished to enter into a voluntary contractual arrangement with the city to make contributions and community investments to mitigate impacts of the casino project.the mou provided for payments of over million to the city over years,considerably more than guilders.it also provided for termination of the mou if the land was not accepted in trust for the tribe or if the compact was terminated.
when the city council passed resolution number approving the mou,plaintiffs chip worthington and the referendum committee sought to place a referendum on the ballot to compel submission of the issue to the voters.the city refused to place the matter on the ballot,and plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate,seeking to submit the referendum petition to the voters or force repeal of the authorizing resolution.
the petition alleged that although the casino project is located in an unincorporated area of the county that is outside the city boundary,it was within the planning area described in the city general plan and was inconsistent with the sonoma county general plan.the petition specifically targeted a provision on page of the mou that stated in consideration of the covenants of the tribe as set forth in the mou,the city agrees not to oppose any efforts by the tribe to cause the secretary to accept trust title to the property for the benefit of the tribe and to otherwise develop the project.the mou gave specific examples of,that included writing letters as requested by the tribe in furtherance of the objectives of the mou,scheduling meetings with the tribe and taking such other appropriate actions as the tribe may reasonably request consistent with this section relating to the efforts of the tribe identified in this mou.
after the matter was briefed and argued,the superior court entered judgment denying the writ and plaintiffs appealed.
discussion 
we emphasize that the issues to be determined in this appeal do not concern the wisdom of allowing indian gaming in or near california cities or the advisability and ramifications of building a casino and resort complex at the designated location in sonoma county.these actions undeniably raise emotional issues that have resulted in heated debate and political action throughout the state.see,institute of governmental studies,university of california,indian gaming in california as of june.the only question resolved by this appeal is whether the city resolution adopting the mou is subject to referendum.
plaintiffs argue that the city made a legislative policy decision when it entered into the mou and agreed not to oppose the casino plan.plaintiffs contend that the lack of a compact with the governor or inclusion of the specified land into trust as a part of its reservation land precludes the city claim that it was only following a plan already adopted by a superior power.as an additional ground for invalidating the mou,plaintiffs argue that it requires actions that are inconsistent with the city general plan.
the city maintains that it was not exercising legislative powers that are subject to referendum,but was merely engaged in an administrative function like any other contract negotiation process.it also contends that the area at issue is outside the city and it has no jurisdictional authority over such lands.
after reviewing the action taken by the city in light of the extensive regulation of indian gaming,we conclude that the federal and state governments have sole authority to exercise legislative power in this area and that the city actions were administrative and not subject to the referendum process 
referendum applicable only to legislative acts 
the california constitution,article,section,subdivision a provides the referendum is the power of the electors to approve or reject statutes or parts of statutes except urgency statutes,statutes calling elections,and statutes providing for tax levies or appropriations for usual current expenses of the state.article,section,subdivision a of the constitution provides initiative and referendum powers may be exercised by the electors of each city or county under procedures that the legislature shall provide.
it is the duty of the courts to jealously guard the people rights of initiative and referendum.martin smith d.martin.but a fundamental principle of referendum law is that a referendum may be used to review only legislative acts and not executive or administrative acts of a local government.devita county of napa cal th,d,devita wheelright county of marin cal d,city of san diego dunkl th,d dunkl.legislative acts of a city which establish general policies and objectives,and the ways and means of accomplishing them,are subject to the referendum process.dean associates city of south san francisco d.dean.
the commonly stated test for determining whether a particular action is a legislative or an administrative act was set out in dunkl as follows.w e must apply the test well set out and explained in valentine town of ross d.the acts,ordinances and resolutions of a municipal governing body may,of course,be legislative in nature or they may be of an administrative or executive character.citation.also well settled is the distinction between the exercise of local legislative power,and acts of an administrative nature.following earlier authority,we said in martin smith d.the power to be exercised is legislative in its nature if it prescribes a new policy or plan whereas,it is administrative in its nature if it merely pursues a plan already adopted by the legislative body itself,or some power superior to it.dunkl,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.
when implementing a plan adopted by a superior power,a city acts in an administrative capacity.acts of a local governing body which,in a purely local context,would otherwise be legislative and subject to referendum may,however,become administrative in a situation in which the state system of regulation over a matter of statewide concern is so pervasive as to convert the local legislative body into an administrative agent of the state.yost thomas cal d.when a local governments discretion is largely preempted by statutory mandate its action is administrative and not subject to referendum.devita,supra,cal th,d.
when a local government implements federal policy,pursuant to a comprehensive plan of federal regulations governing matters of national concern,its actions are administrative and not subject to local referendum.dean,supra,d at.concerning development plan formulated pursuant to federal endangered species act et.as noted above,by enacting igra,congress intended to preempt the field of indian gaming and delineate a narrow role for the states in negotiating compacts that is only triggered by the request of a tribe.artichoke joe,supra,at,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news.
absent a request by a tribe,even the state does not have the power to influence class iii indian gaming.a state is not required to agree to a compact,but may enter what is otherwise a preempted field if the state follows the provisions of igra.d b vi,vii.if a state refuses to participate,it loses its ability to influence the terms upon which indian gaming occurs in the state.d b vii if state does not consent to proposed compact,secretary of the interior shall prescribe terms.in california,the power to negotiate the compact is specifically granted to the governor.
actions taken by the city in this case are administrative 
in this case,the city argues that it was acting in its administrative capacity in negotiating a contract,much like it would when negotiating contracts for road construction,wastewater treatment or any number of city services contracts.plaintiffs argue that the city made a policy decision to give up the right to oppose the casino development and the voters should have the opportunity to review that decision.they argue that other local governments have made the policy choice to oppose indian casinos or negotiate to apply local land use regulations which would otherwise be preempted.citing as examples city of roseville norton d,placer county and tribe agreed tribe would comply with the california environmental quality act,city and private individuals unsuccessfully challenged federal decision to take land into trust,aff roseville and tomac norton,d,taxpayer group sought more detailed environmental analysis of indian casino plan court found assessment under national environmental policy act sufficient.
plaintiffs argue that the decision to negotiate with the tribe rather than publicly oppose the casino plan is a policy decision.use of the word policy to indicate that a decision is subject to the referendum power is inaccurate.policy is a broad term that is not synonymous with legislation.collegiate dictionary defines policy in the broad sense as prudence or wisdom in the management of affairs.collegiate dict.ed.blacks law dictionary defines policy as the general principles by which a government is guided in its management of public affairs.blacks law dict.ed.
that a city action embodies what might be called a policy decision,in the sense that it represents a general guide in management of city affairs,does not make the act legislative in nature.by definition,a legislative act necessarily involves more than a mere statement of policy.it carries the implication of an ability to compel compliance.for example,black law dictionary defines legislate as to make or enact laws.the legislative power is the power to make laws and to alter them a legislative body exclusive authority to make,amend,and repeal laws.black law dict.ed.in an earlier version of black law dictionary,a part of the definition of the word law itself was stated as that which must be obeyed and followed by citizens,subject to sanctions or legal consequences.blacks law dict.ed.the body of rules,whether proceeding from formal enactment or from custom,which a particular state or community recognizes as binding on its members or subjects.oxford english dictionary ed.defining law.
thus,a city might make a statement describing a policy,but without the power to enforce or require compliance,it is not an exercise of legislative power.t he reserved powers of initiative and referendum do not encompass all possible actions of a legislative body.those powers are limited,under california constitution,article ii,to the adoption or rejection of statutes.as we shall explain,it does not include a resolution which merely expresses the wishes of the enacting body,whether that expression is purely precatory or serves as one step in a process which may lead to a federal constitutional amendment.american federation of labor eu cal d.a governmental entity legislates when it unilaterally regulates,or in addition to declaring a public purpose,makes provisions for the ways and means of its accomplishment,at,fn,see also,schloss city of indianapolis,taxpayers o
