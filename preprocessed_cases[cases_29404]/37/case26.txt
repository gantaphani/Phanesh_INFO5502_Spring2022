opinion of the court 
we seldom focus on how to balance the four factors that determine whether to grant a stay pending appeal despite the practical and legal importance of these procedural standstills.so we take this opportunity to do just that 
background 
in april appellee revel ac,et revel opened a story,foot high which we refer to simply as the casino in atlantic city,new jersey.the casino was marketed as a state of the art gaming and resort facility unlike any other in atlantic city.its cost billion,making it the most expensive hotel ever built in atlantic city.see tom corrigan,atlantic city revel casino files for bankruptcy again,wall street june,available at.as part of its plan for the casino,revel entered into a lease with appellant idea boardwalk,llc idea to run two upscale nightclubs and a beach club.the lease was for a year term with a year option to extend and obligated idea to contribute million of the million projected cost of construction of the clubs in addition to its monthly rental payments as lessee.
unfortunately the casino billion price tag was no indication of its future success.a sluggish atlantic city economy and the casino inability to turn a profit were too much for revel to overcome.after a failed sale attempt,revel cash flow problems made a second trip to bankruptcy the only option it filed a chapter on june,as part of its filings,revel asked the bankruptcy court for permission to sell its assets free and clear of all liens and interests which includes leases and to approve bid procedures to allow that sale as quickly as possible.the court approved the request and set august,as the auction date.
revel attempt to sell the casino in bankruptcy 
the request to sell the casino free and clear raised the ire of its tenants among them,idea its concern was that,were the sale as proposed to occur,the value of its lease would turn to zero notwithstanding its initial million investment.to protect that investment,idea filed objections to the proposed sale.it made clear that its intent was not to scuttle the sale,but to block revel from selling the casino stripped of its lease.citing h,idea argued that,notwithstanding a rejection of that lease,it can retain its possessory interest,as the subsection provides that a 
lessee may retain its rights under such lease for the balance of the term of such lease and for any renewal or extension of such rights to the extent that such rights are enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law.
h a ii.alternatively,idea contended that even if h did not secure its interest,f the code provision that allows for the sale of an asset free and was of no use to revel,as it could satisfy any of the five alternative conditions necessary to trigger a sale under its strictures.
notwithstanding the objection of idea,revel continued the auction process and embarked on a lengthy marketing campaign,communicating with over potential investors.unfortunately the market for revel assets proved thin,and,because not a single qualified buyer came to the table,the bankruptcy court postponed the august auction.
about a month later,on september,revel closed the casino doors and barred its tenants,idea included,from accessing the casino premises.when that happened,idea gave written notice that it intended to continue operating its beach club and one of its nightclubs notwithstanding the casino closure and it expected revel to continue to abide by the terms of its lease.more specifically,idea asked that revel continue to honor its obligation under the lease to provide uninterrupted utility service.am.compl,idea boardwalk,llc revel entm t,llc,ecf.to put its plan into action,idea met with representatives from various city agencies to secure approval to operate on a standalone basis and sued revel to enjoin it from failing to provide utilities and parking and engaging in any other conduct that prevents idea from operating the hq dayclub and hq nightclub in accordance with the terms of the lease.id.furthermore,and to assert its rights under h,idea sought a declaratory judgment that,under applicable law,the lease is a lease of real property as that term is defined and governed by and,as such,is entitled to all relevant statutory protections,including,but not limited to,h.id.a 
polo north becomes stalking horse bidder 
revel continued marketing efforts paid off when it came to terms on september,with polo north country club,an entity controlled by a real estate developer.under the proposed asset purchase agreement,polo north agreed to buy the casino for million and to serve as the stalking horse bidder at the upcoming auction.if polo north lost at auction,it would receive million as a fee.if,however,polo north walked away from the deal,it would surrender its million deposit.the bankruptcy court approved revel request to modify the auction bid procedures to allow for the payment of the breakup fee and set a revised bid deadline for september.at the postponed auction,which ultimately took place on october,the highest bidder was not polo north but brookfield holdings,llc,as its million bid topped the million bid of polo north.the bankruptcy court approved the sale to brookfield on october.
reentering the picture,idea argued that it has the right under section h of the code to elect to remain in possession and,in that event,revel is obligated to provide possession and rights appurtenant thereto,including various easements for utilities and other services.objection of idea boardwalk,llc,in re revel ac,ecf.idea also reaffirmed that,because it has direct access to the boardwalk and the streets,it can operate its clubs without impinging revel possessory rights.id.
before revel could respond,brookfield walked away from the deal,thus surrendering its million deposit and bringing polo north back into the fold as the winning bidder.the bankruptcy court thereafter granted revel motion to terminate the sale to brookfield and scheduled a hearing to approve the sale to polo north.
revel responds to idea at the hour 
late on the friday night just three days before the january,sale hearing,revel filed an omnibus reply to idea objections.regarding the latter h argument,revel urged the court to follow the seventh circuit decision in precision,qualitech steel sbq,llc,cir,which held that h does disable f authority to sell property subject to a lease free and clear of that lease and instead triggers only when a debtor seeks to reject a lease under.id.at.revel also asserted that it could satisfy one of f five conditions namely,f because a bona fide dispute exists with respect to the validity of idea lease.according to revel,though the form of its agreement with idea gives the appearance of a lease,because rent was based entirely on a percentage of the revenue derived from idea operations,it was not a true lease entitled to benefit from the applicable protections set forth in the bankruptcy code.debtors omnibus reply,in re revel ac,ecf.
d.the sale hearing 
at the sale hearing,the bankruptcy court considered the following legal issues whether sales of property under f can wipe out a lessee possessory interest under h and whether revel introduced enough evidence to show that the validity of idea lease was the subject of a bona fide dispute under f,thus satisfying an eligibility requirement to invoke subsection f only if the court found in favor of revel on each of these two issues could it sell the casino free and clear of idea lease.
on the first issue,the bankruptcy court pointed to a split of authority some courts hold that f does cut off a tenant possessory rights under h,see,in re zota petroleums,llc,while others go another path to say that h says nothing at all about sales of estate property,which are the province of section,qualitech,at,the result in the latter case being that sales of property under can cut off the possessory interests of lessees under.see sale hr g tr,in re revel ac,ecf.
the second issue,the bankruptcy court conceded,presented the more difficult legal question whether revel had enough evidence to show that the validity of idea lease was the subject of a bona fide dispute under f.id.at.the trouble was that revel did provide the purportedly disputed lease to the bankruptcy court or much of anything to cloud its validity,though f places the burden squarely on revel shoulders.see id.at revel did give me any of the leases or any,really,evidence in support of its position of the bona fide dispute.but,because of the need to push the sale through,the court maintained that it ca look at the result totally as to what the law requires,id.at,though,if time were of the essence,it probably would have put the hearing off to have more evidence presented,id.at.with not much to go on,the court concluded that,because idea and the other tenants were akin to partners of revel enterprise,id.at,rather than mere tenants,revel met its burden that there is a bona fide issue in dispute as to the leases,id.at.hence the court approved the sale and allowed revel to sell its assets free and clear of existing tenancies possessory rights,irrespective of any rights a tenant may hold under h,including,but not limited to,all possessory rights.sale order,in re revel ac,ecf.
idea appealed that order and moved to stay the court decision pending appeal,noting the risk that,if the decision were not stayed,its appeal would be moot under m once the sale closed.that provision provides,in relevant part,that 
t he reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization of a sale or lease of property does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under such authorization to an entity that purchased or leased such property in good faith,whether or not such entity knew of the pendency of the appeal,unless such authorization and such sale or lease were stayed pending appeal.
m.in a order,the bankruptcy court denied idea request.with its options dwindling and time winding down,idea filed an emergency motion before the district court to stay the bankruptcy court sale order.
e.the district court denies idea stay request 
in considering whether to grant a stay pending appeal,courts consider the following four factors whether the appellant has made a strong showing of the likelihood of success on the merits will the appellant suffer irreparable injury absent a stay would a stay substantially harm other parties with an interest in the litigation and whether a stay is in the public interest.see,republic of phil.westinghouse electric,cir.because idea is the only party before us,we limit our examination of the district court ruling to its treatment of idea objections.
likelihood of success 
on the first prong,the district court maintained that idea needed to show that it had a substantial or strong case on appeal.in re revel ac,internal quotation marks omitted.addressing h first,the court noted that,because the legal issue was the subject of an undisputed split of authority,idea at most showed a possibility and not a likelihood which we understood the court to mean more likely than not of success.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
it next addressed whether the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding that revel put forth enough evidence to show that a bona fide dispute existed as to the validity of idea lease.see id.at.despite the bankruptcy court failure to mention it,the district court emphasized that idea specifically sought a declaratory judgment concerning the nature of its agreement with revel,id.at,even though,as idea asserted,its lawsuit principally concerned its request for an energy easement,rather than an effort to challenge the characterization of its agreement,id.at.in the district court view,the pending litigation arguably provide d some objective basis to find some bona fide issue in dispute,id.at emphases added,because,in answering the complaint,revel specifically denied that the agreement constituted a lease,id.at.consequently,the district court concluded that idea did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of the f issue either.id.at 
irreparable harm 
on the prong,the district court considered whether idea had demonstrated the potential for an actual and imminent,rather than remote or speculative,irreparable harm.id.at.idea posited that,absent a stay,if revel and polo north closed on the sale,this would render its claim statutorily moot under m,leading to the loss of its lease and the end of its business at the casino.in the district court view,a mooted claim does qualify as an irreparable injury nor does the potential loss of idea possessory rights.see id.regarding the latter,the court noted that idea effectively had been dispossessed since september and would gain nothing by retaking possession of a space in an empty and building.id.at see also id.at t hough the tenants assert that the loss of their possessory rights would result in irreparable injury,they ignore that they have been without valuable possessory rights since september.hence,as with the first prong,the court held it did not weigh in idea favor.
harm to others 
for the third factor in the stay analysis,idea contended that,because it does seek a stay of the sale itself but only the provision of the sale order that terminates its lease,revel would be injured.the district court,focusing only on the debtor presumably because it was the only party opposing idea stay motion,thought otherwise.in its view,because of the easily terminable million option of polo north to purchase revel assets,there was a good chance it would elect not to proceed with closing if the court granted the stay.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.and the palpable risk of losing a ready buyer,the court maintained,demonstrates a risk of substantial harm to revel.id.emphasis omitted see also id.at describing revel exhaustive search for a buyer that yielded only two qualified buyers.thus it found that the third factor weighed against a stay.
public interest 
finally,idea asserted that the public interest favors a stay because the public has a strong interest in the correct application of bankruptcy law and the continuing operation of hospitality providers at revel.again the district court disagreed.in its view,even assuming that idea expressed valid public policy concerns,such concerns would not sufficiently outweigh the far more prevalent interest in facilitating the success of bankruptcy proceedings,along with the permanent loss of approximately jobs and substantial detriment to the city of atlantic city and surrounding areas a failed sale could trigger,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.as with the first three factors,the public interest favors the facilitation of the asset sale,and,accordingly,weighs against the imposition of a stay.id.
idea appeals.
ii.jurisdiction 
revel argues that we do have jurisdiction to entertain idea appeal from the district court stay denial under either d or a.we disagree.subsection d provides that t he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered under subsections a and b.though a stay denial is not technically a final judgment,it is here in a practical sense because,under m,the upshot of declining idea stay request is to prevent it from obtaining a full airing of its issues on appeal and a decision on the merits,as that provision protects purchasers from any modification on appeal of an order authorizing a sale.consequently,the district court decision denying idea stay request was final for purposes of d.see in re trans world airlines,cir acknowledging that finality must be viewed more pragmatically in bankruptcy appeals under d than in other contexts see also james grippando,circuit court review of orders on stays pending bankruptcy appeals to district courts or appellate panels,am,arguing that finality for purposes of section is a fluid concept to be determined on a case by case basis.
our decision in trans world airlines is not to the contrary.the question there was whether the district court grant of a stay was final for purposes of d.we held that it was not,e ven under the most relaxed concept of finality,because the stay grant did fully adjudicate a specific adversary proceeding between the parties.in re trans world airlines,at.the difference here is that the district court denied a stay,and the practical effect was to resolve idea appeal on the merits,as the combination of the imminent closing of the sale and m would have mooted its appeal.
thus,where it is all but assured that a statute will render an appeal moot absent a stay,a stay denial is appealable under d.we express no opinion on whether we have also have jurisdiction under a see generally in re forty eight insulations,cir exercising jurisdiction over a stay denial under a because the district court order had both the effect of an injunction and serious,perhaps irreparable,consequences quoting cent.states cent.cartage,cir internal quotation marks omitted and leave for another day whether we have jurisdiction to review a stay denial where the underlying appeal could become equitably moot.
iii.standard of review 
at this juncture,only the district court denial of idea stay request is at issue.we generally review appeals from a denial of a stay for abuse of discretion,see bradley pittsburgh bd.of,cir,giving proper regard to the district court feel of the case,omega importing petri kine camera,cir friendly,citation omitted.however,we review de novo the district court decision on the likelihood of success,for it involves a purely legal determination.see in re forty eight insulations,at.
iv.analysis 
despite the growing importance of stays pending appeal,we have provided little direction on how to balance the four stay factors,mostly b ecause this c ourt ordinarily grants or denies a stay pending appeal without opinion.westinghouse electric,at.despite its comprehensiveness,westinghouse unfortunately shed little light on how to balance the four stay factors when not all of them point in the same direction.the factors there all favored a stay denial.we take this opportunity to provide guidance on how to conduct a balancing of the stay factors.
a.the sliding scale approach to balancing the stay factors 
under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,a party can move to stay the effect of a bankruptcy court order pending a resolution on appeal.see fed.the factors considered overlap the familiar ones courts look to in ruling on applications for preliminary injunctions.see nken holder,d observing that similar concerns arise whenever a court order may allow or disallow anticipated action before the legality of that action has been conclusively determined.to repeat essentially what was already noted above,the following factors come into play 
whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding and where the public interest lies.
hilton braunskill,d.in order not to ignore the many gray shadings stay requests present,courts balance e them all and consider the relative strength of the four factors.brady football league,cir quoting fargo women health org.schafer,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.the four factors should be balanced thus,for example,if the balance of harms tips heavily enough in the stay applicant favor then the showing of likelihood of success need not be as strong,and vice versa.footnotes omitted.
t he most critical factors,according to the supreme court,nken,at,are the first two whether the stay movant has demonstrated a strong showing of the likelihood of success and that it will suffer irreparable harm the latter referring to harm that can not be prevented or fully rectified by a successful appeal,roland mach.dresser,cir posner.though both are necessary,the former is arguably the more important piece of the stay analysis.as judge posner has remarked,it is enough that the failure to obtain a stay will be a disaster for the stay movant but only a minor inconvenience to the defendant,as e quity jurisdiction exists only to remedy legal wrongs thus,without some showing of a probable right,there is no basis for invoking it.id.at.
just how strong of a merits case must a stay applicant show the formulations used to describe the degree of likelihood of success that must be shown vary widely.mohammed reno,cir emphasis in original.to give but a sampling of the range that exists,some require a showing that the underlying appeal is more likely to succeed than fail.abdul wali coughlin,cir overruled on other grounds by estate of shabazz,d.others call for a substantial possibility,although less than a likelihood,of success.dubose pierce,cir quoting hayes city of,vacated on other grounds.see also generally john gotanda,the emerging standards for issuing appellate stays,baylor.for our court,a sufficient degree of success for a strong showing exists if there is a reasonable chance,or probability,of winning.singer mgmt.consultants,milgram,cir en banc.thus,while it is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be better than negligible,nken,at citation omitted,the likelihood of winning on appeal need not be more likely than not,singer mgmt.consultants,at see also.metro.area transit comm holiday tours,noting that the trouble with a strict probability requirement is it leads to an exaggeratedly refined analysis of the merits at an early stage in the litigation.
on the second factor,the applicant must demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely not merely possible in the absence of a stay.winter natural res.def.council,d emphasis in text.while a reference to likelihood of success on the merits has been interpreted by courts to cover the generic range of outcomes,for irreparable harm we understand the supreme court use of likely to mean more apt to occur than not.see generally michigan army core of engineers,cir holding that for harm to be likely there must be more than a mere possibility that harm will come to pass but the alleged harm need not be occurring or be certain before a court may grant relief citation omitted.
once an applicant satisfies the first two factors,the traditional stay inquiry calls for assessing the harm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest.nken,at.we weigh the likely harm to the movant absent a stay factor two against the likely irreparable harm to the stay opponent s if the stay is granted factor three.this is called the balancing of harms or balancing of equities.we also take into account where the public interest lies factor four in effect,how a stay decision has consequences beyond the immediate parties.roland,at.
in this context,a number of outcomes are possible.where the balance of harms and public interest weigh in favor of a stay and the court deems that the stay movant has made a sufficient showing of success on appeal,a stay should be granted.where the opposite is true,the merits,balance of harms,and public interest favor the stay opponent a stay should be denied.between these easy examples are the more difficult cases,such as where the merits favor one party and the balance of harms favors the other.gotanda,supra,at.there along with the public interest we must evaluate the degree of irreparable injury with the prospects of prevailing on the merits.id.
in deciding how strong a case a stay movant must show,we have viewed favorably what is often referred to as the approach.see constructors ass of kreps,cir.river port auth.transamerican trailer,cir.under it,t he necessary level or degree of possibility of success will vary according to the court assessment of the other stay factors.mohammed,at second alteration in original quoting,at.stated another way,t he more likely the plaintiff is to win,the less heavily need the balance of harms weigh in its favor the less likely it is to win,the more need it weigh in its favor.roland,at.as we described in kreps in considering all four factors though in the context of deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction,
in a situation where factors of irreparable harm,interests of third parties and public considerations strongly favor the moving party,an injunction might be appropriate even though plaintiffs did not demonstrate as strong a likelihood of ultimate success as would generally be required.in contrast,where the threatened irreparable injury is limited or is balanced to a substantial degree by countervailing injuries which would result to third parties,or to the public interest from the issuance of an injunction,greater significance must be placed upon the likelihood that the party will ultimately succeed on the merits of the litigation.
at footnotes omitted internal quotation marks omitted see in re a f.ii,cir as with a motion for a preliminary injunction,a sliding scale approach applies the greater the moving party likelihood of success on the merits,the less heavily the balance of harms must weigh in its favor,and vice versa.mohammed,at the probability of success that must be demonstrated is inversely proportional to the amount of irreparable injury plaintiff will suffer absent the stay.simply stated,more of one excuses less of the other.alteration in original quoting.coal.of radioactive material users,griepentrog,cir.
keeping in mind that the first two factors are the most critical,if the chance of success on the merits is only better than negligible and the possibility of irreparable injury is low,a stay movant request fails.nken,at internal quotation marks omitted.likewise,even if a movant demonstrates irreparable harm that decidedly outweighs any potential harm to the stay opponent if a stay is granted,it is still required to show,at a minimum,serious questions going to the merits.coal.of radioactive material users,at quoting in re delorean motor,cir.
our dissenting colleague criticizes the approach as fail ing to honor third circuit precedent.dissenting.in her view,there is no balancing a court consideration of a stay request is an proposition.to merit a stay,she believes,the stay applicant must demonstrate,that it will satisfy,id.at,each of the four stay factors.if it does,then,even if the stay applicant chances of success on appeal are assured let alone more probable than not and the applicant will likely suffer an irreparable injury,a stay must be denied if,for example,it is in the public interest.that approach is not only impractical,it has the potential to be deeply unfair,and is one we have explicitly disavowed.in delaware river port authority transamerican trailer transport,for example,we could have been clearer in establishing that consideration of the four factors by the district court requires a delicate balancing.at.we reaffirmed that concept in kreps in observing that no one aspect of the stay analysis will necessarily determine its outcome,at,assuming,we pause to note,that the party seeking a stay has made a sufficient showing on the first two factors.therefore,where the balance of harms and public interest strongly favor a stay,a court may enter it even if the applicant did demonstrate as strong a likelihood of ultimate success as would generally be required.river port,at.relatedly,when considerable injury will result from either the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction,these factors,the balance of harms to some extent cancel each other and greater significance must be placed upon the likelihood that each party will ultimately succeed on the merits of the litigation.id.at.to the extent later statements in our opinions suggest the opposite that a complete failure to satisfy any one of the stay factors precludes a stay,dissenting they are not binding.see united states rivera,cir this circuit has long held that if its cases conflict,the earlier is the controlling authority and the latter is ineffective as precedents.
to sum up,all four stay factors are interconnected,and thus the analysis should proceed as follows.did the applicant make a sufficient showing that a it can win on the merits significantly better than negligible but not greater than and b will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay if it has,we balance the relative harms considering all four factors using a sliding scale approach.however,if the movant does not make the requisite showings on either of these first two factors,the inquiry into the balance of harms and the public interest is unnecessary,and the stay should be denied without further analysis.in re forty eight insulations,at internal citation omitted.but depending on how strong a case the stay movant has on the merits,a stay is permissible even if the balance of harms and public interest weigh against holding a ruling in abeyance pending appeal.
application 
because our assessment of how strong a case idea has is closely linked to the outcome of the balancing test,we begin with the test itself though we write from the first the stronger the balance of harms and public interest is in idea favor,the less a showing of potential success on appeal we demand keeping in mind that the likelihood of success must be at least a substantial case on the merits,hilton,at the lesser the harms,the showing of success must be stronger.
whom does the balance of harms and public interest favor 
to establish irreparable harm,a stay movant must demonstrate an injury that is neither remote nor speculative,but actual and imminent.tucker anthony realty schlesinger,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a later date,in the ordinary course of litigation,weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.sampson murray,d internal quotation marks omitted see also gotanda,supra,at defining irreparable injury as the harm the movant will suffer during the pendency of the litigation that can not be prevented or fully rectified by the tribunal final decision.
idea asserts that,absent a stay,its appeal will be batted out of court by m,rendering the continued operation of its business at the casino impossible.as to potential money damages,idea continues,the most it will receive is pennies on the dollar,which grossly undervalues its lease and the millions it invested in reliance of it.see idea br.arguing that a money judgment will not compensate it for the loss of its possessory rights under h because revel is insolvent and,as a result,has no ability to provide payment on any claim idea may have.for its part,revel responds that idea argument rests on a flawed assumption that continued possession is substantially more valuable than the rejection damages it would receive.according to revel and the district court,because polo north would likely walk away from the sale if it were stayed,idea would be left with nothing but a possessory interest in a vacant building.see in re revel,at i t is entirely logical that the absence of any occupant in the c asino would leave idea with,in essence,a possessory right in an empty and building.
we do not accept that assertion.first,there is nothing in the record to refute idea contention that it can operate independently of the casino.indeed,a principal purpose of its lawsuit against revel was to confirm idea right of access to a power source so that it can begin running its business again.see oral arg.tr.noting that idea needed a utility easement to continue to operate and work with the utility company.we thus deem unsupportable the suggestion of the district court that,if polo north walked away,idea would be left with a possessory right in an empty and building.in re revel,at.
that still leaves us with the lingering question of whether rejection damages would sufficiently compensate idea for the loss of possession and its business.on that question,we have previously observed that,though a purely economic injury,compensable in money,can not satisfy the irreparable injury requirement an exception exists where the potential economic loss is so great as to threaten the existence of the movant business.minard run oil forest,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.that exception applies here.if we deny the stay,idea will lose not only its multimillion dollar investment but also the opportunity to operate what was,until the casino closed,a profitable business.see oral arg.tr.in this context,idea shows sufficient irreparable injury to it absent a stay.thus we turn to the harm to revel the only party who opposed idea request for a stay and the public interest the latter,in essence,balances the benefits and harms to the public if a stay is imposed and if it is not.
in assessing this side of the balance,the district court credited revel position that the issuance of a stay would present a real and substantial risk that polo north would elect not to proceed with closing.in re revel,at.as it does on appeal,revel counsel had argued that even a limited stay would trigger bad things polo north walking away and revel having to liquidate its assets under chapter,which not only would cause the permanent loss of approximately jobs the casino once provided,but also could cause substantial detriment to the city of atlantic city and the surrounding areas,and possibly further hamper reorganization efforts at other casino resorts located in the city.revel br.
in our view,the adequacy of the proof provided plays an important role i n evaluating the harm that will occur depending upon whether or not a stay is granted.coal.of radioactive material users,at.absent some sort of declaration or other evidence in the record that a stay would cause substantial harm,the harm to revel was at best speculative.note the context revel counsel told the district court that granting idea a stay only to prevent its lease from being extinguished would nonetheless spoil the entire sale on the other hand,if idea lost its lease a result a stay denial virtually guaranteed its business at revel site would be permanently shuttered.as a result,at the time of our ruling in february,the tilted at least moderately in favor of idea.
does the public interest move the needle we have doubts that it moves much.while the public certainly has an interest in saving jobs and helping atlantic city often sullied reputation,nothing before us indicates how many jobs will be brought back of the lost,as we were not told what use polo north intended for the sold assets.on the other side,the public has a stake in protecting the rights of tenants in commercial properties.furthermore,public policy strongly favors the correct application of the bankruptcy code,especially where property rights are at stake.overall,though the public has an interest in preventing both outcomes,we ultimately believe the gain of some jobs in a facility that is operational in some way tilts slightly in revel favor.
in any event,our ultimate conclusion need not rest primarily on a rough estimation of whom the balance of harms and public interest favor.for,along with idea sufficient showing of irreparable harm to it should a stay not be granted,success to it on the merits was assured.we explain why below.
has idea made a strong showing of its likelihood of success on the merits 
idea makes three arguments before us on the merits,but we need address only one whether the bankruptcy and district courts erred in holding that revel met one of f statutorily enumerated conditions to sell its assets free and clear.revel contends they did err because idea twice sought to establish via declaratory judgment actions that it held a lease and revel denied that idea had a lease.in revel view,this proves that a bona fide dispute exists under f,as a declaratory judgment is only proper when an actual case or controversy exists.revel br.we disagree yet again.
as an initial matter,the mere filing of a declaratory judgment action does itself create a bona fide dispute under f,even if article iii case or controversy requirement has been met.the latter ensures only that the declaratory judgment plaintiff has standing and a redressable injury.further,that idea alleged and revel denied the former held a lease does mean there was a bona fide dispute as to the validity of its lease.bona fide dispute in the f context means that there is an objective basis either in law or fact to cast doubt on the validity of idea purported lease.to satisfy that provision,revel needed to show there was some factual or legal basis to deny that idea held a true lease.but it did nothing of the sort.
first,a review of idea complaint makes plain that its principal and only purpose was to invoke its rights under h and clarify its appurtenant rights for,among other things,a utility easement,not to litigate the nature of its interest.reply br.see also oral arg.tr.counsel for idea noting that its suit was meant only to have the court declare and enforce idea rights under h.the relevant paragraphs alleged the following 
o n or about may,revel and idea entered into a lease for nonresidential real property concerning certain premises at the casino.
on august,revel filed the rejection motion.
a hearing on the rejection motion is currently scheduled for october.
if the rejection motion is granted,idea will have an opportunity to make an election under section h of the bankruptcy code.
section h provides a lessee of real property under a rejected lease with the option of either retaining the estate,including,among other things,the continued right to possession or to treat the lease as terminated.
to the extent that idea elects to remain in possession,h allows it,despite rejection,to continue to enjoy its rights under such lease that are in or appurtenant to the real property,including the right to continued possession,utilities and necessary easements.
wherefore,idea seeks an order and judgment as follows 
declaring that,despite rejection of the lease,idea may continue to enjoy its right under the lease,including the right to continued possession,utility service and necessary easements and 
granting such other relief as is just.
reply br.emphasis omitted quoting am.compl,idea boardwalk,llc revel entm t,llc,ecf.
moreover,even if idea had squarely put the validity of its lease at issue,nothing revel said in response created an objective legal dispute.revel only argument was that its agreement with idea does qualify as a true lease because it provides for rent payments based entirely on a percentage of the revenue derived from idea operations and contains numerous examples of provisions atypical of true leases.mot.to dismiss,idea boardwalk,llc revel entm t,llc,ecf.yet revel failed to cite a single authority suggesting that a clause disqualifies a purported lease from being one.
to leave no doubt that a true lease exists,idea agreement with revel bars any argument to the contrary.it provides that
