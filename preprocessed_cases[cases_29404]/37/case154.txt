bally gaming international,bally technologies,and bally gaming,bally collectively appeal the district court grant of summary judgment of infringement of certain claims of reissue patent nos,patent and patent owned by igt.igt cross appeals the district court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement of certain claims of the two.we affirm.
background 
the share a common specification and are reissues of patent and.the specifications describe a networked system of gaming machines shown in figure 
the patents describe a system for controlling networked gaming devices and.the gaming devices shown here are a type having a pull handle for initiating a game,slot machines.patent ll.the gaming devices are connected to floor controllers and.the floor controllers monitor the activity on the gaming devices and may issue certain commands to reconfigure the gaming devices.id.ll.the floor controllers interface with file servers.the file servers store data and generate usage reports related to the gaming devices.
using this architecture,the describe and claim methods for rewarding players over and above the normal device payouts.id.ll.the floor controller configures a gaming device to pay out extra money if certain conditions are met.id.ll.for example,the gaming devices may be configured to payout a bonus when a player bets a certain amount of money.id.ll.these bonuses and promotions may be used to encourage players to use gaming devices during typically slow periods such as late nights during the week.
the patent claims at issue generally contain three steps tracking activity of a group of gaming devices,issuing a command to the gaming devices when a predetermined event occurs,and paying in accordance with that command.the patent claims at issue generally contain four steps issuing an initial command establishing the criteria to cause a bonus to be paid upon the occurrence of a predetermined event,storing the command at a controller for a gaming device,transmitting a pay command to the gaming device upon the occurrence of the predetermined event,and paying at the gaming device responsive to the command.the primary difference between the claims of the two patents is the requirement in the patent claims to initially send the command to the gaming device establishing the criteria for a payout.
igt accused bally of infringing these claims when it offers two promotions power rewards and power winners.the configuration for both promotions generally includes a host computer that communicates with a controller.the controller,in turn,manages a number of gaming devices.power rewards incentivizes players by rewarding them based on their game play at a particular machine.it is commonly known as a play x,get y promotion.for example,it could be a play,get promotion that rewards a player each time the player reaches in bets on a particular machine.power rewards allows a casino operator to define the limits of the promotion including the participating machines and the times.when a player comes to the machine,the player inserts an identification card.in response to the card insertion,the host computer sends a transaction to the controller associated with the gaming device.transaction includes the play x,get y amount that applies.the controller monitors the play and,when the play x amount is reached,the controller causes the gaming device to display a promo key.the player activates the promo key to place money in an account.more than one player may win a power reward during the promotion.
the other accused promotion is power winners.rather than rewarding players for specific amounts spent,power winners randomly selects a single player for a bonus.power winners applies to a set of devices selected by the casino operator.during the time period set aside for promotion,the system periodically decides whether to award a bonus.to decide whether to award a bonus,the system splits the allotted time into segments.at the end of each segment,the system generates a random number that determines if that time segment should produce a winner the exact mechanism for this is not relevant to the appeal.if not,then the promotion continues.if there is to be a winner,the system then randomly selects a winner from the qualified players playing on the machines.power winners only has a single bonus for each promotional time period.
the method of payout for power winners is important to this appeal.there are two pay methods.in the first method,acsc,the system pays out using a transaction message.it is set to play,get thus,the winner immediately can access the promo key.in the second method,the user is simply notified that he or she has won the promotion and it is paid out through the casino accounting system.
the district court construed a number of claim terms and turned to the question of infringement on summary judgment.the district court determined that,as a matter of law,the power rewards promotion infringes claims,and of the patent and claims and of the patent.igt bally gaming int l,d.regarding the patent claims,the district court determined that the transaction message is a command or message under the claims.id.at.as noted above,the patent claims require that the system issue a command establishing the criteria for a bonus and subsequently,the occurrence of a predetermined event to pay the bonus.the district court determined that the transaction message is the command and the predetermined event is the player fulfillment of the play x requirement.id.at.
the district court determined that power winners in its acsc embodiment infringes claims and of the patent.id.at.the court held that the predetermined event is the random selection that a given time period should produce a winner.id.at.the court further held that the command is the transaction message set to play,get y that causes the gaming device to pay out.id.at.finally,the court granted summary judgment of noninfringement by the embodiment because the only possible command does not cause payment,but merely notifies a winner.id.
bally appeals arguing that the district court erred in a number of its claim constructions and in its grant of summary judgment of infringement.igt cross appeals arguing that the district court erred in certain other claim term constructions.we have jurisdiction under a.

claim construction 
we review claim construction de novo.cybor fas,en banc.the words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and prosecution history.see phillips awh,en banc.
independent claim of the patent includes many of the claim terms in dispute 
a method of operating gaming devices interconnected by a host computer having a input device comprising associating each gaming device with a unique address code 
preselecting less than all of the gaming devices interconnected by the host computer 
using the network to track activity of the preselected gaming devices 
issuing a command over the network to one of said preselected gaming devices responsive to a predetermined event and 
paying at said one gaming device in accordance with the command.
emphases added.we address the disputed claim terms in turn.
claim of the patent requires issuing a command over the network to one of said preselected gaming devices and paying at said one gaming device in accordance with the command.bally argues that we should construe one to require that the command be sent to one and only one machine during a promotional period.it argues that there can be only one command sent to only one machine.similarly it argues that payment can be made at only one gaming device.bally contends that because power rewards pays at more than one gaming device,it can not be held to infringe.bally argues that we have held that the meaning of one is one and only one citing wms gaming,international game technologies.bally argues that,like wms gaming,the claims here rely on the one language for antecedent basis with the requirement of paying at said one gaming device.bally argues that this shows that the command and thus any bonus must only be awarded to a single player at a single device.bally also points to the fact that other claims use the terms each gaming device claim of the patent or at least one gaming device claim of the patent.it argues that this shows that when igt claimed one gaming device in claim of the patent,it meant one and only one device could receive a payout.
bally also argues that the three different types of claims one,at least one,and each correspond to types of promotions expressly disclosed in the specification.for example,according to bally,the disclosed mystery bonus may occur after a specific number of coins are played,and thus could be paid on each device.appellant br.citing patent ll.it argues that this shows that the applicants specifically claimed different embodiments and intended the word one to mean only one.
igt contends that the claims do not limit the system to pay out at a single one of the preselected devices.it argues that the claims only require that a single command pay out at a single machine.in other words,as long as one command goes to one machine and causes that machine to pay out,that command meets the claim limitation regardless of how many other commands are sent.igt also notes that bally ignores claim of the patent that states the command is sent to only one gaming device.it argues that this shows that the applicants knew how to claim a one and only one embodiment and that the word one should not be so limiting.finally,igt argues that the three examples from the specification cited by bally each pay out at one or more gaming devices,so none of them support bally conclusion that this claim term must mean one and only one.
we agree with igt.the meaning of the word one in this claim is clear from the words that surround it issuing a command over the network to one of said preselected gaming devices and paying at said one gaming device in accordance with the command.certainly the use of one in this claim is limiting in that a command will go to one of the preselected gaming devices.the command will cause one device to pay.hence one modifies devices that will receive a particular command,not the number of commands that might be issued.the second use of one further supports this construction one gaming device will pay in accordance with the command.these claim limitations are directed to a command which will go to one device and cause that same device to pay in response to a predetermined event.a single command must be issued to a single gaming device.the claim,however,does not limit the number of commands that could be issued to discrete gaming devices.nothing in this limitation requires issuing only one command to only one machine.bally would have us rewrite the claim to say issuing only one command to only one of said preselected gaming devices.we refuse to adopt this strained construction.
in addition to the claim language,a number of the promotions described in the preferred embodiments involve multiple commands sent to different devices.there is no justification for holding as bally requests that only one machine may receive a command and that only one machine may pay a bonus during a promotional period.the use of one in these claims clearly modifies the number of machines responsive to a particular command,but nothing in this claim prevents multiple commands to be issued to multiple machines.likewise the use of one in the pay command modifies the number of devices that will pay in accordance with the command,but does not prevent the issuance of other pay commands to other machines during the promotional period.wms gaming does not demand a different result.in wms gaming,the claim required selecting one of said numbers clearly limiting the number selected to one.at.here,the claim requires issuing a command to one of said preselected gaming devices,not issuing one command,which would more closely track the language in wms gaming.we caution that claim language must be construed in the context of the claim in which it appears.extracting a single word from a claim divorced from the surrounding limitations can lead construction astray claim language must be construed in the claim in which it appears.
in light of this construction,the district court correctly granted summary judgment of infringement by bally power rewards.the fact that power rewards pays a bonus at more than one gaming device does not render it noninfringing.
transmitting a pay command upon the occurrence of the predetermined event 
this claim term appears in claims and of the patent.the district court construed this term to mean 
transmitting an instruction related to payment from the controller to the gaming device in response or reply to the occurrence of one or more conditions chosen in advance.a pay command,an instruction related to payment,need not cause payment to be effected automatically.
bally argues that this term requires that the predetermined event causes the payment and does not cover a gaming device where a pay command is transmitted following some intervening step associated with the player.bally argues that power rewards does not infringe because when the predetermined event occurs play x,the gaming device does not pay,it displays a promo key,which the user then presses in order to cause the payment.
we agree with the district court that this claim term simply means that the system must transmit a pay command when the predetermined event has occurred.the limitation does not mandate a particular method of payment as bally suggests.nothing in the plain language of the claims precludes an intervening step by the user to accept payment.thus,we hold that the district court did not err in its claim construction.again we see no error in the district court summary judgment with regard to bally power rewards.
predetermined event 
the district court construed this term to mean the occurrence of one or more conditions chosen in advance.during summary judgment,the district court explained that the predetermined event may be random in its occurrence,as long as the condition itself is chosen in advance.
bally argues that the district court erred because the predetermined event can not be a random event.instead,bally claims that it must be something that will occur either at a given time or after a known occurrence such as a number of slot lever pulls or an amount bet.bally argues that the event must be determined in advance of its occurrence.it argues that the specification only gives examples of predetermined events that are.
igt responds that the district court correctly gave the term its plain and ordinary meaning a condition that must be chosen in advance.it relies on the plain language of the claim,issuing a command over the network responsive to a predetermined event.it argues that this simply means the claim requires a system to monitor network activity and,when a certain condition is met,issue a command.it argues that it is irrelevant whether this is a finite condition such as the passing of time,or a random condition.it also points to the specification that expressly states that certain bonuses are paid when certain conditions are met.appellee br.citing patent ll.
again,the district court correctly construed this term.the claims and the specification only require that some condition be met in order for the system to issue the claimed command.the district court properly held that the predetermined event must be a condition chosen in advance,but there is nothing in the claims or the specification that requires the predetermined event to be finite or.if the condition determined in advance is an entirely random occurrence,it is no less an event.bally is incorrect that this construction reads predetermined out of the claim.if the predetermined event is not chosen in advance,the claim limitation is not met.although the specification does include examples of nonra
