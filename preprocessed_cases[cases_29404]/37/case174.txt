we are asked in this appeal to determine which statute of limitations governs a challenge to an adjudicative decision of the california horse racing board the administrative procedure act statute,which is triggered by service of the decision upon a party,or the statute contained in the state horse racing law,which is triggered on the date of the horse racing board action.here,the horse racing board did not serve its decision upon the affected party,but the party nonetheless had actual notice of the decision.we conclude the statute contained in the horse racing law that is specific to the horse racing board applies,and we therefore reverse the trial court contrary decision.
facts and procedural history 
we summarized some of the relevant facts in an earlier related unpublished decision,bardis capitol racing,and borrow portions of that summary here while adding modifications and additional facts.
patrons at racetracks may enjoy a gambling experience wagering on the live races at the track and wagering on races telecast by satellite from other racetracks.impact fees are paid by the racetrack operator,whose live race is being telecast,to the racetrack operator that receives and displays the telecast while it conducts its own live races.the fees are designed to compensate the racetrack operator who displays and accepts wagers on the telecast races for the loss of wager income as money flows to the telecast races and away from that operator live races.
this appeal arises from a dispute regarding the refusal by the operator of harness racing at cal expo in sacramento county,plaintiff capitol racing,llc,capitol racing,to pay impact fees to the operator of quarter horse racing at los alamitos race track in orange county,real party in interest los alamitos quarter horse racing association los alamitos racing,and to the association representing the quarter horse owners,real party in interest pacific coast quarter horse racing association quarter horse association 
in january the california harness horsemen association harness association,an organization representing the owners of harness race horses,and other parties filed a lawsuit entitled zumbrun california horse racing bd.super.sacramento county,zumbrun.the suit alleged los alamitos racing and others conspired to violate antitrust laws.
at issue was whether tracks were required to accept satellite telecasts of each other races,whether they were required to accept wagering on those televised races,and what impact fees,if any,the track telecasting a race should pay to the receiving track for loss of wagering on the receiving track live races.
capitol racing,was not a party to the zumbrun litigation.however,because of the overlap between live quarter horse racing at los alamitos and live harness racing at cal expo,capitol racing,in negotiated reciprocal payment of impact fees with los alamitos racing.
in march,the parties to the zumbrun litigation entered into a settlement agreement the zumbrun agreement to end the dispute over impact fees.the parties agreed that racetracks would be required to show each other races and accept wagering on those races.they further agreed to a provision for reciprocal impact fee payments.the impact fee provision was derived from the agreement between capitol racing,and los alamitos racing.that agreement was attached as an exhibit to the zumbrun agreement.
neither capitol racing,nor capitol racing was a party to the zumbrun agreement.however,the harness association was a party,and its executive director was also the general manager for both capitol racing,and capitol racing.
for approximately two years,the parties to the zumbrum agreement and,despite not being a signatory,capitol racing,abided by its terms.however,in,an amendment to the california horse racing law bus,et took effect that called the impact fee provisions of the zumbrun agreement into question.this amendment,the maddy bill,required racetracks to show each other races and accept wagering on those races with no impact fees if the tracks had been licensed to conduct live racing in the previous year.stats,ch,see former bus.
almost immediately,the parties to the zumbrun agreement began to disagree on the impact of the maddy bill.capitol racing and the harness association asserted the maddy bill freed them from paying impact fees but that los alamitos remained obligated to show the cal expo races and accept wagers on them.in,based on their interpretation of the maddy bill,capitol racing and the harness association refused to pay impact fees to los alamitos racing.in response,los alamitos racing and the quarter horse association refused to receive the satellite telecasts of cal expo harness races and to accept wagers on those races.
the harness association filed a complaint with defendant california horse racing board racing board,accusing los alamitos racing of unlawfully refusing to accept the telecasts of capitol racing harness races during live quarter horse races at los alamitos.it asked for the racing board to take action,including the revocation of los alamitos racing licenses.
the racing board executive director filed a statement of issues with the racing board in september pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,et to initiate an administrative hearing to resolve the dispute.the executive director did not direct the hearing towards possibly revoking los alamitos racing existing licenses.rather,he framed the issues in the context of the next annual horse racing license applications he anticipated receiving from los alamitos racing and capitol racing for.to know whether to grant or deny those applications,the executive director asked the racing board to resolve all questions of law and fact concerning los alamitos racing display of capitol racing harness races and acceptance of wagers on those races,and payments between the parties on account thereof based on the zumbrun agreement 
the racing board referred the matter to an administrative law judge alj.after holding several hearings,the alj in july ruled in capitol racing and the harness association favor,finding the zumbrun agreement inapplicable.the racing board,the alj decided,had authority to enforce an impact fee only if there was a voluntary agreement to pay such fees approved by the racing board.the zumbrun agreement did not qualify because,in part,capitol racing was not a party to that agreement.
the alj also found los alamitos racing was required under the maddy bill to accept capitol racing signal of its live harness races from cal expo as well as wagers on those races so long as it accepted a satellite telecast from any other live racing event in the state.capitol racing was not obligated to pay impact fees to los alamitos racing.
however,on september,the racing board rejected the alj proposed decision and elected to render its own decision pursuant to government code section,subdivision c e the racing board issued a decision on may,in favor of los alamitos racing.it agreed with the alj that los alamitos racing was required to accept telecast signals from cal expo so long as it accepted telecast signals from any horse racing meet in the state.but los alamitos racing obligation to accept capitol racing signals was contingent on capitol racing paying impact fees that would be owing utilizing the formula s contained in the previously negotiated zumbrun agreement.the racing board made its decision effective immediately as of the decision date,may.
the racing board served its decision on the attorney representing capitol racing via certified mail on may.it did not serve the decision on capitol racing itself.
on june,capitol racing and the harness association petitioned the racing board for reconsideration.the racing board took no action on the petition,resulting in it being deemed denied.
on july,capitol racing and the harness association filed this petition for administrative mandate with the superior court challenging the racing board decision.the harness association subsequently settled its dispute and dismissed its claims.it is not a party to this appeal.
the racing board and los alamitos racing moved to dismiss the petition as unti
