the issue presented in this appeal is whether sb,which the new jersey legislature enacted in the law to partially repeal certain prohibitions on sports gambling,violates federal law.sess.law serv.ch,codified at stat.ann.a to.the district court held that the law violates the professional and amateur sports protection act paspa.we will affirm.paspa,by its terms,prohibits states from authorizing by law sports gambling,and the law does exactly that.
background 
congress passed paspa in to prohibit sports gambling.paspa provides 
it shall be unlawful for 
a governmental entity to sponsor,operate,advertise,promote,license,or authorize by law or compact,or 
a person to sponsor,operate,advertise,or promote,pursuant to the law or compact of a governmental entity,a lottery,sweepstakes,or other betting,gambling,or wagering scheme based on one or more competitive games in which amateur or professional athletes participate,or are intended to participate,or on one or more performances of such athletes in such games.
emphasis added.paspa defines governmental entity to include states and their political subdivisions.paspa includes a remedial provision that permits any sports league whose games are or will be the subject of sports gambling to bring an action to enjoin the gambling.
congress included in paspa exceptions for sports wagering in nevada and sports lotteries in oregon and delaware,and also an exception for new jersey but only if new jersey were to enact a sports gambling scheme within one year of paspa enactment.a.new jersey did not do so and,thus,the paspa exception expired.notably,sports gambling was prohibited in new jersey for many years by statute and by the new jersey constitution.see,const.art.iv vii stat.ann.stat.ann.in,however,the new jersey legislature held public hearings on the advisability of allowing sports gambling.these hearings included testimony that sports gambling would generate revenues for new jersey struggling casinos and racetracks.in,the legislature held a referendum asking new jersey voters whether sports gambling should be permitted,and percent voted in favor of amending the new jersey constitution to permit sports gambling.the constitutional amendment provided 
it shall also be lawful for the legislature to authorize by law wagering at casinos or gambling houses in atlantic city on the results of any professional,college,or amateur sport or athletic event,except that wagering shall not be permitted on a college sport or athletic event that takes place in new jersey or on a sport or athletic event in which any new jersey college team participates regardless of where the event takes place 
const.art.iv,vii,d.the amendment thus permitted the new jersey legislature to authorize by law sports wagering at casinos or gambling houses in atlantic city,except that wagering was not permitted on new jersey college teams or on any collegiate event occurring in new jersey.an additional section of the amendment permitted the legislature to authorize by law sports wagering at current or former running and harness horse racetracks,subject to the same restrictions regarding new jersey college teams and collegiate events occurring in new jersey.const.art.iv,vii,f.
after voters approved the constitutional amendment,the new jersey legislature enacted the sports wagering act in law,which provided for regulated sports wagering at new jersey casinos and racetracks.stat.ann.a et.the law established a comprehensive regulatory scheme,requiring licenses for operators and individual employees,extensive documentation,minimum cash reserves,and division of gaming enforcement access to security and surveillance systems.
five sports sued to enjoin the law as violative of paspa the new jersey parties did not dispute that the law violated paspa,but urged,instead,that paspa was unconstitutional under the doctrine.the district court held that paspa was constitutional and enjoined implementation of the law.the new jersey parties appealed,and we affirmed in national collegiate athletic ass governor of new jersey,cir christie i.
christie i rejected the new jersey parties argument that paspa was unconstitutional.in explaining that paspa does not commandeer the states legislative processes,we stated n othing in paspa words requires that the states keep any law in place.all that is prohibited is the issuance of gambling license s or the affirmative authoriz ation by law of gambling schemes.id.at alterations in original.the new jersey parties had urged that paspa commandeered the state because it prohibited the repeal of new jersey prohibitions on sports gambling they reasoned that repealing a statute barring an activity would be equivalent to authorizing the activity,and authorizing was not allowed by paspa.we rejected that argument,observing that paspa speaks only of authorizing by law a sports gambling scheme,and w e did not see how having no law in place governing sports wagering is the same as authorizing it by law.id.we further emphasized that the lack of an affirmative prohibition of an activity does not mean it is affirmatively authorized by law.the right to do that which is not prohibited derives not from the authority of the state but from the inherent rights of the people.id.in short,we concluded that the new jersey parties argument rested on a false equivalence between repeal and authorization.id.at.
the new jersey parties appealed to the united states supreme court,which denied certiorari.christie i is now the law of the circuit paspa is constitutional and does not violate the doctrine.
undeterred,in,the legislature passed the law,sb,which provided in part 
any rules and regulations that may require or authorize any state agency to license,authorize,permit or otherwise take action to allow any person to engage in the placement or acceptance of any wager on any professional,collegiate,or amateur sport contest or athletic event,or that prohibit participation in or operation of a pool that accepts such wagers,are repealed to the extent they apply or may be construed to apply at a casino or gambling house operating in this state in atlantic city or a running or harness horse racetrack in this state,to the placement and acceptance of wagers on professional,collegiate,or amateur sport contests or athletic events 
stat.ann.a.the law specifically prohibited wagering on new jersey college teams competitions and on any collegiate competition occurring in new jersey,and it limited sports wagering to persons years of age or older situated at such location s,namely casinos and racetracks.id.
ii.procedural history and parties arguments 
the leagues filed suit to enjoin the new jersey parties from giving effect to the law.the district court held that the law violates paspa,granted summary judgment in favor of the leagues and issued a permanent injunction against the governor of new jersey,the director of the new jersey division of gaming enforcement,and the executive director of the new jersey racing commission collectively,the new jersey enjoined parties the district court interpreted christie i as holding that paspa offers two choices to states maintaining prohibitions on sports gambling or completely repealing them.it reasoned that paspa preempts the law because the law is a partial repeal that necessarily results in sports wagering with the state imprimatur.the new jersey parties appealed.
on appeal,the new jersey parties argue that the law complies with paspa and is consistent with christie i because the new jersey legislature effected a repealer as christie i specifically permitted.the njtha argues that the district court erred in granting injunctive relief to the leagues because the leagues have unclean hands from supporting sports gambling in other contexts,and that any injunctive relief should be limited to the leagues games and should not include games of entities who are not parties to this action.
the leagues urge that the law violates paspa because it authorizes and licenses sports gambling.the united states submitted an amicus brief in support of the leagues arguing that the law impermissibly licenses sports wagering by confining the repeal of gambling prohibitions to licensed gambling facilities and thus,in effect,enlarging the terms of existing gaming licenses.
we conclude that the district court did not err in striking down the law.
iii.analysis 
a.the law violates paspa 
as a preliminary matter,we acknowledge new jersey salutary purpose in attempting to legalize sports gambling to revive its troubled casino and racetrack industries.the new jersey assembly gaming and tourism committee chairman stated,in regards to the law,that w e want to give the racetracks a shot in the arm.we want to help atlantic city.we want to do something for the gaming business in the state of new jersey,which has been under tremendous duress app.new jersey state senator ray lesniak,a sponsor of the law,has likewise stated that s ports betting will be a lifeline to the casinos,putting people to work and generating economic activity in a growth industry.app.and new jersey state senator joseph kyrillos stated that new jersey continued prohibition on sports betting at our casinos and racetracks is contrary to our interest of supporting employers that provide tens of thousands of jobs and add billions to our state economy and that s ports betting will help set new jersey wagering facilities apart from the competition and strengthen monmouth park and our struggling casino industry.app.paspa has clearly stymied new jersey attempts to revive its casinos and racetracks and provide jobs for its workforce.
moreover,paspa is not without its critics,even aside from its economic impact.it has been criticized for prohibiting an activity,sports gambling,that its critics view as neither immoral nor dangerous.it has also been criticized for encouraging the spread of illegal sports gambling and for making it easier to fix games,since it precludes the transparency that accompanies legal activities simply put,w e are cognizant that certain questions related to this case whether gambling on sporting events is harmful to the games integrity and whether states should be permitted to license and profit from the activity engender strong views.christie i,at.while paspa provisions and its reach are controversial and,some might say,unwise,we are not asked to judge the wisdom of paspa and i t is not our place to usurp congress role simply because paspa may have become an unpopular law.id.at.we echo christie i in noting that new jersey and any other state that may wish to legalize gambling on sports are not left without redress.just as paspa once gave new jersey preferential treatment in the context of gambling on sports,congress may again choose to do so or may choose to undo paspa altogether.id.at.unless or until that happens,however,we are to interpret the text of the law as congress wrote it.
we now turn to the primary question before us whether the law violates paspa.we hold that it does.under paspa,it shall be unlawful for a governmental entity to sponsor,operate,advertise,promote,license,or authorize by law or compact sports gambling.we conclude that the law violates paspa because it authorizes by law sports gambling.
first,the law authorizes casinos and racetracks to operate sports gambling while other laws prohibit sports gambling by all other entities.without the law,the sports gambling prohibitions would apply to casinos and racetracks.appellants urge that the law does not provide authority for sports gambling because we previously held that t he right to do that which is not prohibited derives not from the authority of the state but from the inherent rights of the people and that w e do not see how having no law in place governing sports wagering is the same as authorizing it by law.christie i,at.but this is not a situation where there are no laws governing sports gambling in new jersey.absent the law,new jersey myriad laws prohibiting sports gambling would apply to the casinos and racetracks.thus,the law provides the authorization for conduct that is otherwise clearly and completely legally prohibited.
second,the law authorizes sports gambling by selectively dictating where sports gambling may occur,who may place bets in such gambling,and which athletic contests are permissible subjects for such gambling.under the law,new jersey sports gambling prohibitions are specifically removed from casinos,gambling houses,and horse racetracks as long as the bettors are people age or over,and as long as there are no bets on either new jersey college teams or collegiate competitions occurring in new jersey.the word authorize means,inter alia,t o empower to give a right or authority to act,or t o permit a thing to be done in the future.black law dictionary ed the law allows casinos and racetracks and their patrons to engage,under enumerated circumstances,in conduct that other businesses and their patrons can not do.that selectiveness constitutes specific permission and empowerment.
appellants place much stock in our statement in christie i that their argument there rested on a false equivalence between repeal and authorization.at.they claim that the law does not authorize sports gambling because it is only a repeal and,in christie i,we stated that the lack of an affirmative prohibition of an activity does not mean it is affirmatively authorized by law.id.at.in other words,they argue that,because the law is only a repeal removing prohibitions against sports gambling,it is not an affirmative authorization under christie i.we agree that,had the law repealed all prohibitions on sports gambling,we would be,given christie i,to find an authorizing by law in violation of paspa.but that is not what occurred here.the presence of the word repeal does not prevent us from examining what the provision actually does,and the legislature use of the term does not change the fact that the law selectively grants permission to certain entities to engage in sports gambling.new jersey sports gambling prohibitions remain and no one may engage in such conduct save those listed by the law.while artfully couched in terms of a repealer,the law essentially provides that,notwithstanding any other prohibition by law,casinos and racetracks shall hereafter be permitted to have sports gambling.this is not a repeal it is an authorization.
third,the exception in paspa for new jersey,which new jersey did not take advantage of before the time limit expired,is remarkably similar to the law.the exception states that paspa does not apply to a betting,gambling,or wagering scheme conducted exclusively in casinos,but only to the extent that any commercial casino gaming scheme was in operation throughout the year period before paspa was enacted.a b.the exception would have permitted sports gambling at new jersey casinos,which is just what the law does.we can easily infer that,by explicitly excepting a scheme of sports gambling in new jersey casinos from paspa prohibitions,congress intended that such a scheme would violate paspa.if congress had not perceived that sports gambling in new jersey casinos would violate paspa,then it would not have needed to insert the new jersey exception.in other words,if sports gambling in new jersey casinos does not violate paspa,then paspa exception for new jersey would have been superfluous.we will not read statutory provisions to be surplusage.see marx revenue,t he canon against surplusage is strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.in order to avoid rendering the new jersey exception surplusage,we must read the law as authorizing a scheme that clearly violates paspa 
as support for their argument that the law does not violate paspa,appellants cite the law construction provision,which provides that t he provisions of this act are not intended and shall not be construed as causing the state to sponsor,operate,advertise,promote,license,or authorize by law or compact sports wagering.stat.ann.a.this conveniently mirrors paspa language providing that states may not sponsor,operate,advertise,promote,license,or authorize by law or compact sports wagering.
the construction provision does not save the law.states may not use clever drafting or mandatory construction provisions to escape the supremacy of federal law.haywood drown,t he supremacy clause can not be evaded by formalism.howlett ex rel.howlett rose,t he force of the supremacy clause is not so weak that it can be evaded by mere mention of a particular word.in the same vein,the new jersey legislature can not use a targeted construction provision to limit the reach of paspa or to dictate to a court a construction that would limit that reach.the law violates paspa,and the construction provision can not alter that fact.
appellants also draw a comparison between the law and the law,which involved a broad regulatory scheme,as evidence that the law does not violate paspa.it is true that the law does not set forth a comprehensive scheme or provide for a state regulatory role,as the law did.however,paspa does not limit its reach to active state involvement or regulation of sports gambling.it prohibits a range of state activity,the least intrusive of which is authorization by law of sports gambling.
we conclude that the law violates paspa because it authorizes by law sports gambling 
injunctive relief 
the njtha argues that the injunction should apply only to the parties who brought this suit and that gambling on the athletic contests of other entities,who are not parties to this suit,should be permitted.but paspa does not limit its prohibition to sports gambling involving only entities who actually bring suit.paspa provides that a civil action to enjoin a violation of section may be commenced by a professional sports organization or amateur sports organization whose competitive game is alleged to be the basis of such violation.the njtha conflates the leagues right to bring suit with the remedy they may obtain.paspa provides that the leagues may enjoin a violation of section,without any limiting language.the law violates paspa in all contexts,not simply as applied to the leagues,and,therefore,the district court properly enjoined its application in full.
finally,we need not dwell on the njtha argument that the leagues should not be entitled to equitable relief because they have unclean hands.the njtha contends that the leagues are essentially hypocrites because they encourage and profit from sports betting,noting that the nfl has been scheduling games in london where sports gambling is legal,that the ncaa holds events in las vegas where sports gambling is legal,and that the leagues sanction and encourage fantasy sports betting.these allegations fail to rise to the level required for application of the unclean hands doctrine.the equitable doctrine of unclean hands applies when a party seeking relief has committed an unconscionable act immediately related to the equity the party seeks in respect to the litigation.highmark,upmc health plan,cir.it is not unconscionable for the leagues to support fantasy sports and hold events in las vegas or london,nor is doing so immediately related to the law.we can not conclude that the leagues acted unconscionably,amorally,abusively,or with extreme unfairness,in relation to the law.
iv.conclusion 
the law violates paspa because it authorizes by law sports gambling.we will affirm.
in response to christie i,where we held that new jersey sports wagering law law violated paspa,the new jersey legislature passed the law.in addition to repealing the law in full,the law also repealed all prohibitions on sports wagering and any rules authorizing the state to,among other things,license or authorize a person to engage in sports wagering,with respect to casinos and gambling houses in atlantic city and horse racetracks in new jersey.the repealer also maintained prohibitions for persons under and for wagering on new jersey collegiate teams or any collegiate competition occurring in new jersey.likewise,the law stripped new jersey of any involvement in sports wagering,regulatory or otherwise.in essence,the law renders previous prohibitions on sports gambling.
the majority,however,takes issue with what it terms the selective nature of the partial repeal.first,that the repeal applies to specific locations.that is,under the law,wagering may only take place at casinos,gambling houses,and horse racetracks.next,the restriction against betting by persons under the age of would remain,and finally,restrictions against betting on new jersey collegiate teams or any collegiate competition in new jersey would remain.these restrictions,the majority concludes,amount to authorizing a scheme and,therefore,the law must also violate paspa.i disagree.as i see it,the issue is whether a partial repeal amounts to authorization.because this logic rests on the same false we rejected in christie i,i respectfully dissent.
the majority,however,maintains that the law authorizes casinos and racetracks to operate sports gambling while other laws prohibit sports gambling by all other entities according to the majority,this is not a situation where there are no laws governing sports gambling in new jersey and a bsent the law,new jersey myriad laws prohibiting sports gambling would apply to the casinos and racetracks.yet,the majority is mistaken as to the impact of a partial repeal.repeal is defined as to rescind or an abrogation of an existing law by legislative act.when a statute is repealed,the repealed statute,in regard to its operative effect,is considered as if it had never existed.a repealed statute is treated as if it never existed a partially repealed statute is treated as if only the remaining part exists 
the law,then,renders the previous prohibitions on sports gambling.after the repeal,it is as if new jersey never prohibited sports gambling in casinos,gambling houses,and horse racetracks.therefore,with respect to those areas,there are no laws governing sports wagering and the right to engage in such conduct does not come from the state.rather,the right to do that which is not prohibited stems from the inherent rights of the people the majority,however,states that a bsent the law,new jersey myriad laws prohibiting sports gambling would apply to the casinos and racetracks,and that,as such,the law provides the authorization for conduct that is otherwise clearly and completely legally prohibited.we have refuted this position before.in christie i,we held that the lack of an affirmative prohibition of an activity does not mean it is affirmatively authorized by law.such an argument,we said,rests on a false equivalence between repeal and authorization and reads the term by law out of the statute.we identified several problems in making this false equivalence the most troublesome being that it reads the term by law out of the statute.the majority position does just that.in holding that a partial repeal of prohibitions is state authorization,the majority must infer authorization.paspa,however,contemplates more.in christie i,we pointed to the fact that new jersey amendment to its constitution,which gave the legislature power to authorize by law sports wagering was insufficient to authorize it by law.we explained,that the legislature needed to enact the law itself belies any contention that the mere repeal of new jersey ban on sports gambling was sufficient to authorize it by law t he legislature itself saw a meaningful distinction between repealing the ban on sports wagering and authorizing it by law,undermining any contention that the amendment alone was sufficient to affirmatively authorize sports wagering.this is no less true of a partial repeal than it would be of a total repeal which the majority concedes would not violate paspa.thus,to reach the conclusion that the law,a partial repeal of prohibitions,authorizes sports wagering,the majority necessarily relies on this false equivalence.it concedes as much when stating the law the repeal provides the authorization for sports wagering.of course,this is the exact false equivalence we identified,and dismissed as a logical fallacy,in christie 
the majority does not believe it makes this false equivalence.to support its position,the majority relies on the selective nature of the law contending that the legislature use of the term repeal does not change the fact that the law selectively grants permission to certain entities to engage in sports g
