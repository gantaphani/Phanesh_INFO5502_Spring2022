the north county community alliance,alliance brought suit against the national indian gaming commission nigc,the department of interior,and those agencies principal officers collectively,appellees.the alliance claims that the nigc failure to make an indian lands determination either before approving the nooksack indian tribe nooksacks gaming ordinance the ordinance in,or before the nooksacks licensed and began constructing the northwood crossing casino casino in,violated the indian gaming regulatory act igra.the alliance also claims that appellees violated the national environmental policy act nepa by failing to prepare an environmental impact statement eis in connection with construction of the casino.
we hold that the alliance challenge to the nigc approval of the ordinance,insofar as it relates to the licensing and construction of the casino,is not.we hold on the merits that the nigc did not have a duty under igra to make an indian lands determination in before approving the nooksacks proposed gaming ordinance.we also hold that the nigc did not have a duty under igra to make an indian lands determination in when the nooksacks licensed and began construction of the casino pursuant to the approved ordinance.finally,we hold that there was no violation of nepa.
background 
the nooksack indian tribe is a federally recognized indian tribe with a reservation in northwestern washington state near the canadian border.beginning in the early,the nooksacks sought to engage in tribal gaming.
igra requires indian tribes to receive nigc approval of a gaming ordinance before engaging in class ii or class iii gaming.b,d.class ii gaming includes bingo and card games except for banking card games like baccarat,chemin de fer,and blackjack.id.class iii gaming includes banking card games and slot machines.id.the nooksacks submitted a proposed gaming ordinance to the nigc,which the nigc approved in.
since shortly after the approval of the ordinance,the nooksacks have operated a class iii gaming facility on reservation land in deming,washington.that facility is not at issue.
the ordinance does not identify any specific site or sites where gaming might take place.with respect to class ii gaming,it provides only that the nooksack gaming commission shall issue a separate license to each place,facility,or location on indian lands where class ii gaming is conducted under this ordinance.in,pursuant to the ordinance,the nooksacks licensed and began constructing the casino as a class ii gaming facility.
the casino is located on a parcel owned by the nooksacks about mile south of the canadian border and about miles by road from the nooksack reservation.according to the alliance complaint,this parcel of largely undeveloped rural land is mostly surrounded by vacant and farming lands and woodlands,is situated near lynden,washington,and is served by highways,public services and infrastructure provided by whatcom county and the state of washington.
the alliance is a organization whose stated goal is to protect the environment.according to the complaint,its members include residents and property owners near the casino site,as well as some members of the nooksack tribe.
in july,the alliance filed suit in federal district court against appellees.
igra limits tribal gaming to locations on indian lands as defined in.the alliance claims that the nigc violated igra by failing to determine whether the land on which the casino is built is indian land,either in when it approved the ordinance or in when the nooksacks licensed and began constructing the casino.the alliance also claims that appellees violated nepa by failing to prepare an eis in connection with the construction of the casino.
the district court dismissed the alliance suit with prejudice under federal rules of civil procedure b and b.the alliance timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo questions of law raised in dismissals under rules b and b.rhoades avon,cir rules b and b granite rock int l of teamsters,freight constr.drivers,warehousemen helpers,local,cir questions of law.this court must accept all allegations of material fact as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the alliance.parks sch.of,symington,cir.with respect to nepa,we must ensure that the agency has taken a hard look at the environmental consequences of proposed actions that constitute major federal actions under c.blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir.
iii.discussion 
we address the following questions.first,does the statute of limitations bar the alliance challenge to the nigc approval of the ordinance second,was the nigc required to determine the status of the land on which the casino could or would be built,either when it approved the ordinance in or before the licensing and construction of the casino in third,did appellees violate nepa by failing to prepare an eis before the licensing and construction of the casino 
statute of limitations 
the applicable statute of limitations provides that every civil action commenced against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.a.
the nigc approved the nooksacks ordinance in.the construction of the casino began in.the alliance filed suit in.the statute of limitations clearly does not bar the alliance claim that the nigc was required to determine in,before licensing and construction,whether the casino would be located on indian lands.the question is whether the statute of limitations bars alliance claim that the nigc was required to determine in,when it approved the ordinance,the status of the land on which the casino is now located.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the statute of limitations does not bar that claim.
our decision in wind river mining united states wind river,cir,guides our analysis.in wind river,the bureau of land management blm had classified certain federal lands as wilderness study areas wsas in.mining was forbidden within a wsa.in and,the wind river mining corporation wind river asked the blm to declare that its decision to create wsa was invalid because that particular wsa was not roadless as required by statute.the blm denied the request.in,the interior board of land appeals denied wind river administrative appeal.
wind river filed suit in alleging that the blm action in creating wsa was ultra vires.we permitted wind river claim to proceed 
if a challenger contests the substance of an agency decision as exceeding constitutional or statutory authority,the challenger may do so later than six years following the decision by filing a complaint for review of the adverse application of the decision to the particular challenger.such challenges,by their nature,will often require a more interested person than generally will be found in the public at large.for example,assuming that wind river challenge to the designation of wsa is merited,no one was likely to have discovered that the blm designation of this particular wsa was beyond the agency authority until someone actually took an interest in that particular piece of property,which only happened when wind river staked its mining claims.the government should not be permitted to avoid all challenges to its actions,even if ultra vires,simply because the agency took the action long before anyone discovered the true state of affairs.
in artichoke joe california grand casino norton artichoke joe,d,plaintiffs challenged the department of interior decision to grant federal recognition of the lytton rancheria of california as an indian tribe,even though the challenge was brought more than six years after the recognition occurred.applying wind river,the district court held that plaintiffs challenge was not.it wrote 
plaintiffs claim concerning recognition of lytton as a tribe is a substantive challenge to the secretary recognition decision.further,when the secretary made the decision to grant lytton federal recognition in,plaintiffs could have had no idea that lytton tribal status would affect them by leading to tribal gaming nearby.
like the plaintiffs in wind river and artichoke joe,the alliance argues that the nigc acted ultra vires in approving the nooksacks proposed ordinance in without first making an indian lands determination for locations where gaming would be permitted under the ordinance.n o one was likely to have discovered that the nigc approval was beyond the agency authority until someone actually took an interest in it.wind river,at.the alliance took an interest in when construction of the casino began near some of its members properties.the alliance could have had no idea in that the nigc approval of the nooksacks ordinance would affect them in by leading to construction of a casino miles from the nooksack reservation.see artichoke joe,d at.
we therefore conclude that the statute of limitations does not bar the alliance claim that nigc was required to determine in the indian lands status of the parcel on which the casino was built in.
nigc duty to determine indian lands status 
the alliance claims that the nigc was required to determine the status of the land on which the casino could or would be built,either in,when it approved the ordinance,or in,before the licensing and construction of the casino.the alliance contends that the parcel on which the casino is built is not indian land within the meaning of.however,this question is not before us,as the alliance acknowledges.rather,the question before us is whether igra required the nigc to determine the indian lands status of the casino parcel in or.
subject matter jurisdiction 
we first address our jurisdiction to review the action,and inaction,of the nigc.igra specifies various circumstances in which federal courts may review the decisions of the nigc decisions made by the commission pursuant to section tribal gaming ordinances,of this title shall be final agency decisions for purposes of appeal to the appropriate federal district court pursuant to chapter of title.the nigc approval of the nooksacks ordinance was a decision made by the commission pursuant to section.we therefore conclude that we have jurisdiction under to review that decision.that is,we have jurisdiction to determine whether the nigc was required,as part of its approval of the ordinance in,to make an indian lands determination with respect to the parcel on which the casino is located.
the administrative procedure act apa provides that a federal court has jurisdiction to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.appellees appear to concede that we have jurisdiction under this section.we agree with appellees apparent concession and conclude that we have jurisdiction.see confederated tribes of the umatilla indian reservation bonneville power,cir for judicial review under,petitioners must at least show agency recalcitrance in the face of clear statutory duty or of such magnitude that it amounts to an abdication of statutory responsibility ellipses in original.
nigc approval of the ordinance in 
it is undisputed that igra authorizes tribal gaming only on indian lands as defined in.igra provides that congress finds that federal law does not provide clear standards or regulations for the conduct of gaming on indian lands.emphasis added.igra establishes independent federal regulatory authority and federal standards for gaming on indian lands.id.emphasis added.igra provides that an indian tribe can engage in class ii gaming on indian lands within such tribe jurisdiction if certain conditions are met.id.b emphasis added.indian tribes are required to issue separate licenses for each place,facility,or location on indian lands at which class ii gaming is conducted.id.emphasis added.igra provides that class iii gaming shall be lawful on indian lands only if certain conditions are met.id.d emphasis added.
tribal gaming on lands is not authorized by or regulated under igra.a notice of final rulemaking published by the nigc in february stated that igra requires that all gaming take place on indian lands and g aming that does not take place on indian lands is subject to all state and local gambling laws and federal laws apart from igra.facility license standards,emphasis added.
the chairman of the nigc is required to approve any proposed tribal ordinance concerning class ii gaming if the proposed ordinance meets certain specified conditions.b the chairman shall approve any tribal ordinance if such ordinance provides emphasis added.for example,the proposed ordinance must provide subject to one exception not relevant here that the tribe will have the sole proprietary interest and responsibility for the conduct of any gaming activity that the net revenues from the gaming activity will be used only for certain specifically described purposes,such as funding tribal government and providing for the general welfare of the tribe that there will be annual outside audits and that the construction,maintenance,and operation of the gaming facility will be conducted in such a manner as to protect the environment and the public health and safety.id.b a c,e see also.
there is no explicit requirement in igra that,as a precondition to the nigc approval,a proposed ordinance identify the specific sites on which the proposed gaming is to take place.igra specifies only that,pursuant to an approved ordinance,a separate licence issued by the indian tribe shall be required for each place,facility,or location on indian lands at which class ii gaming is conducted.b.however,the alliance argues that nigc duty to make an indian lands determination before approving an ordinance is implicit in igra.
the alliance points out that igra provides that the nigc shall approve any tribal ordinance or resolution concerning the conduct,or regulation of class ii gaming on the indian lands within the tribe jurisdiction if it satisfies the conditions referred to above.id.b emphasis added see also id.d b same for approval of class iii gaming ordinances.the alliance argues that the italicized language not only limits the ordinances that the nigc can approve to those that permit gaming on indian lands,but also imposes on the nigc an obligation to make an indian lands determination when it approves a proposed ordinance.implicit in the alliance argument is a contention that a proposed gaming ordinance must specifically identify all of the sites at which gaming could or would take place.
in support of its argument,the alliance cites citizens against casino gambling in erie county kempthorne erie county,d.plaintiff in erie county challenged the nigc decision to approve a tribal gaming ordinance without first making an indian lands determination.the district court in erie county wrote 
whether proposed gaming will be conducted on indian lands is a critical,threshold jurisdictional determination of the nigc.prior to approving an ordinance,the nigc chairman must confirm that the situs of proposed gaming is indian lands.if gaming is proposed to occur on lands,the chairman is without jurisdiction to approve the ordinance.
id.at.the court held that the nigc chairman has a duty to determine whether a tribe proposed gaming will occur on indian lands before affirmatively approving an ordinance.id.at.
the gaming ordinance at issue in erie county was different from the ordinance at issue in this case.the ordinance in that case was a compact between the seneca nation and the state of new york that was submitted to the nigc as a proposed class iii gaming ordinance.the compact identified three possible sites for class iii gaming.it identified the precise location of two of the three sites.it identified the location of the third site more generally as land in erie county,at a location in the city of buffalo to be determined by the seneca nation.id.at.as part of the compact,the state agreed to assist the seneca nation in acquiring parcels at two sites,including the generally described site in the city of buffalo,and to assist the seneca nation in achieving indian land status for the parcels.after the ordinance was approved by the nigc,the seneca nation purchased a specific parcel in buffalo.plaintiffs,who objected to gaming on the buffalo parcel,contended that the chairman of the nigc erred when he approved the ordinance without making an indian land determination with respect to property the seneca nation intended to acquire for gaming purposes.id.at.the district court agreed and vacated the nigc approval of the ordinance with respect to the buffalo parcel,remanding to the nigc for a determination of the indian lands status of the parcel.id.at.
we are willing to assume without deciding that the district court in erie county was correct in concluding that the nigc had an obligation to determine the indian lands status of the buffalo parcel when it approved the interstate compact as a gaming ordinance for the seneca nation.but the ordinance in the case before us is quite different from the ordinance at issue in erie county in the nooksack ordinance,no potential gaming sites are identified,either specifically or generally.the only part of the ordinance that refers in any way to indian lands is,which provides that the nooksack gaming commission shall issue a separate license to each place,facility,or location on indian lands where class ii gaming is conducted under this ordinance.the letter from the chairman of the nigc approving the nooksack ordinance stated,it is important to note that the gaming ordinance is approved for gaming only on indian lands as defined in the igra.but,like the ordinance itself,the letter identified no potential gaming site,either specifically or generally.
the nigc states in its brief to us that when a ordinance is presented for approval it has an obligation to make an indian lands determination for the specifically identified site or sites.in that circumstance,it makes sense for the nigc to make an indian lands determination for the site or sites specifically identified in the proposed ordinance.however,the nigc contends that it has no obligation to make an indian lands determination when approving a ordinance.
the nigc contends that the text of igra does not oblige a tribe to specify in a proposed ordinance,as a condition of the nigc approval,all or even any of the sites at which the tribe might conduct class ii gaming.nor can we find such an obligation in the statutory text.absent such an obligation,it would be absurdly impractical to require the nigc to make an indian lands determination as part of its approval of an ordinance.in effect,the nigc would be required to make an indian lands determination for all lands that are owned,or could be owned in the future,by the tribe and on which the tribe might wish to conduct gaming.
the alliance appears to recognize the impracticality of requiring the nigc to make an indian lands determination as part of its approval of a ordinance.it argues,in effect,that any proposed ordinance submitted to the nigc must be.in support of this argument,the alliance points to one of the enumerated criteria that a proposed class ii gaming ordinance must satisfy.section b e states that a proposed ordinance must provide that the construction and maintenance of the gaming facility,and the operation of that gaming is conducted in a manner which adequately protects the environment and the public health and safety.b e emphasis added.the alliance argues that the italicized language necessarily implies that a proposed gaming ordinance must identify specific gaming facilities.we are not convinced.this is the only provision in igra that could be read to imply that gaming ordinances must identify specific gaming sites.it is undisputed that in practice most gaming ordinances approved by the nigc do not identify specific sites.moreover,if the gaming facility is meant to be read literally as the alliance suggests,this implies that each ordinance is limited to a single gaming facility.igra plainly contemplates otherwise.see id.b.
we conclude that igra does not require a tribe to submit a proposed ordinance as a condition of approval by the nigc under b.we also conclude that the nigc was not required in,when it approved the nooksacks ordinance,to make an indian lands determination for the parcel on which the casino is located.
nigc failure to act in 
in the alternative,the alliance claims that the nigc was required to make an indian lands determination when the nooksacks licensed and began construction of the casino in.however,the alliance points to nothing in the text of igra,or in any implementing regulation in effect in,that required the nigc to make an indian lands determination when a tribe licensed or began construction of a class ii gaming facility already authorized by a ordinance.nor have we been able to find anything in the text of igra,or in the regulations in effect in,so requiring.we therefore conclude that nigc was under no judicially enforceable obligation to make an indian lands determination in.see confederated tribes,at.
regulations 
we recognize that igra,and its implementing regulations in effect at the times relevant to this suit,operated somewhat awkwardly.a tribe could obtain nigc approval of a ordinance authorizing class ii gaming,and license and build a class ii gaming facility pursuant to that ordinance on land that does not constitute indian land under.if neither the nigc nor the state initiates a proceeding to enjoin the construction or operation of the facility on the ground that it is not located on indian land,the tribe could end up operating a class ii gaming facility on land in violation of igra.we do not say that this happened in this case,for we do not are not asked to the casino is located on indian land.but we recognize that because neither the nigc nor the state has initiated a proceeding seeking to stop the nooksacks from constructing and operating the casino,there has not been,and perhaps never will be,any authoritative indian lands status determination.
in,the nigc promulgated regulations that ameliorated the awkwardness we have just described.the validity and proper interpretation of these new regulations is not before us,and we mention them only to point out that the nigc seems to be aware of the practical difficulties presented under the law and regulations as they existed at the times relevant to this suit.under newly promulgated i,the nigc is authorized to require that a tribe submit indian lands information when submitting a proposed ordinance for approval.that section provides that a tribe shall provide indian lands documentation that the chairman of the nigc may in his or her discretion request as needed.further,newly promulgated,which regulates the licensing of gaming facilities already approved under an ordinance,now furthers the purpose of ensur ing that each place,facility,or location where class ii or class iii gaming will occur is located on indian lands eligible for gaming.id.a.the regulation requires a tribe to submit to the chairman of the nigc a notice that a facility license is under consideration for issuance at least days before opening any new place,facility,or location on indian lands where class ii or class iii gaming will occur.id.a.that notice must contain specified information about the location and status of the property on which the facility is to be located,so that the nigc may determine whether the property is indian lands eligible for gaming.see id.
the dissent states that we disregard the most salient fact of this case that the casino may or may not be on indian lands.diss.op.at.it goes on to state that under our approach,we may never know whether the casino is on indian lands,and the north county community alliance can not get judicial review to determine whether the casino is properly on indian lands or not.id.it is true that we may never get an authoritative determination of the indian lands status of the casino.but it is not true that we disregard the possibility that an indian casino might be built on land.we openly acknowledge that this is a possibility.nor is it true that under our approach there can never be an authoritative administrative or judicial determination of the indian lands status of a proposed or newly constructed casino.
both the nigc and the states have authority to bring proceedings against indian gaming facilities located on land.under b and,the nigc has the authority to order a closure of an indian game for substantial violation of the provisions of this chapter.such provisions i
