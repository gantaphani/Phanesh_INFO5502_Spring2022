factual background and procedural history 
the facts discussed below are based on the allegations contained in the complaint.
taylor employment and supervisory history 
plaintiff and appellant eric taylor is an electrical engineer employed by defendant and respondent city of los angeles department of water and power dwp.initially hired as an electrical engineering assistant in,taylor was promoted to electrical engineering associate ii and iii in and respectively.taylor supervisor,defendant and respondent bruce hamer,named him supervising lead engineer in.in this capacity,taylor directly supervised three dwp and three contract employees in the fiber optic enterprise group,including donald coleman,a dwp employee.hamer further recommended that taylor attend a series of classes leading to a certificate in supervision.taylor did so with the goal of advancing to full engineer,a promotion with a potential salary increase of and other benefits.
taylor opposition to alleged race discrimination against coleman 
on may,hamer terminated coleman for cause without first notifying taylor,coleman immediate supervisor.on may and,coleman filed two complaints with the dwp eeo office.coleman claimed wrongful termination because of his race black and alleged the reasons for his termination were pretextual.coleman identified taylor as a supporting and material witness,specified certain information to which he would testify,and subpoenaed him to appear at his termination hearing.over the next six months,taylor opposed coleman termination by providing information to the eeo office,participating in several investigative interviews,and testifying in coleman support at the hearing.dwp ultimately reinstated coleman with full backpay months later.
alleged retaliation against taylor for opposing discrimination 
taylor pleaded that hamer retaliated against him for opposing race discrimination against coleman.
after taylor was identified as coleman supporting witness 
on may,approximately one week after coleman identified taylor as a supporting witness on his race discrimination complaint,hamer showed taylor a new organizational chart that designated another employee to take his place as supervising lead engineer.on june,hamer threatened to eliminate taylor work schedule and implied he had abused time reporting.on july,hamer stripped taylor of his supervisory position and responsibilities.on july,hamer repeated his threat to eliminate taylor work schedule,and accused him of failing to fulfill his duties and of abusing time reporting.
after hamer meeting with eeo regarding coleman complaint 
on july,hamer met with dwp eeo office regarding coleman discrimination charge.two days later,hamer informed one of taylor former subordinates that taylor would be disciplined upon returning from vacation.
after taylor provided information to eeo on coleman complaint 
on july,taylor met with and provided information to the eeo office in support of coleman complaint.thereafter,dwp offered a promotional examination for electrical engineer under an emergency appointment procedure.having been a supervising lead engineer,taylor applied for the promotion.hamer headed up the promotional interviews for the position taylor interviewed with him on october.
after taylor testified in opposition to discrimination 
on november,taylor was subpoenaed to testify at coleman personnel hearing.on november,hamer told taylor he would not be selected for the electrical engineer promotion and stated,i hope you were counting on this the position was given to another employee with fewer qualifications and no supervisory experience whom taylor was instructed to train.
after taylor complained of retaliation 
that same month,taylor complained to dwp eeo office that he suffered retaliation from hamer.afterwards,hamer exchanged taylor more important assignments with less important ones.
on december,hamer replaced taylor as contract administrator on equipment and consulting contracts.hamer further transferred all his important technical contracts to the newly appointed electrical engineer trained by taylor.
on december,hamer created the laon city net initiative,a document that outlined all projects with client ita,including those assigned to taylor.however,hamer did not provide the document to taylor for another months.not knowing his assignments and scope of work affected taylor job performance,his involvement in meetings,and his ability to write and administer customer service contracts under the initiative.because hamer did not tell taylor about commitments made to customers,project schedules were delayed and customers were dissatisfied.on january,hamer further removed taylor as administrator of the customer ethernet contract and replaced him with a.
after taylor further opposed discrimination and retaliation 
on january,taylor again met with eeo investigators about coleman discrimination charges.in the interview,taylor provided more facts in support of coleman and reiterated his claim of retaliation by hamer.on january,hamer met with the eeo office on the coleman case.the following month,hamer barred taylor from attending all classes in the supervisory training series and restricted his attendance to only one to two classes per year.taylor felt this action effectively eliminated promotional opportunities for him to become a full engineer.
after taylor filed his formal retaliation complaint 
on february,taylor met once more with dwp eeo office and requested assistance on the alleged retaliation by hamer.on february,taylor filed a formal eeo complaint of retaliation against hamer.
on february,hamer allegedly barred taylor from an training class that all other members of the fiber optic group were permitted to attend.for the next months,taylor was excluded from meetings,conference calls,monthly vendor and contractor meetings on known occasions.in a constant position of being uninformed,uninvolved and undermined,taylor felt his ability to perform his job was significantly hindered.this shut out hampered taylor ability to carry out his duties,write and administer customer contracts,maintain customer satisfaction,and carry out timely projects.when taylor requested clarification,hamer allegedly accused him of being confrontation al and refusing to assume the assignments.
after taylor requested remedial action on account of retaliation 
on june,taylor met with eeo director paul wang concerning his complaints and the status of the investigation.taylor was told the report was caught up with a larger report that the general manager was sitting on and he was not to worry.
on june,taylor asked wang in writing for a transfer due to the alleged retaliation.on august,wang instructed hamer to accommodate taylor transfer request.that same month,hamer labeled taylor a troublemaker to managers of the groups to which taylor requested a transfer.no transfer occurred.
on september,hamer assigned taylor duties that allegedly fell outside of his job description.taylor filed a separate grievance against hamer.
on september,taylor again complained to the eeo office about the alleged ongoing retaliation,requested the status of the investigation and plans for remedial action.on september,hamer disclosed confidential information concerning taylor grievance to.
after taylor filed his labor relations grievance 
on september,taylor filed a grievance with dwp labor relations office.on october,hamer again excluded taylor from a meeting with his customer,city ita bureau of sanitation.
after taylor labor relations grievance was granted 
on october,taylor grievance was granted.on october,hamer allegedly wrote a memo to his supervisor,ed miller,recommending further promotion of the full engineer selected through the emergency appointment process.he included taylor responsibilities,the subject of his grievance,as a justification for promoting the other engineer.
meanwhile,having passed the written civil service examination for full electrical engineer,taylor took the oral portion of the civil service examination for the position.the opening questions were about his supervisory experience and training.taylor felt disadvantaged because he had been stripped of his supervisory position,restricted on supervisory training,and denied the emergency appointment position.he ultimately placed in rank on the civil service list for full engineer behind other applicants,including the full engineer appointed under the emergency procedure favored by hamer.
taylor claimed there was a causal link between his protected activity and the adverse employment action in that the retaliation commenced intensified shortly after each act of opposition to hamer retaliation.although taylor complained about the retaliation to dwp eeo and management,and requested that remedial action be taken,including transferring him to another department outside of hamer supervision,no immediate and effective action was taken and consequently the retaliation continued.as a result,taylor allegedly suffered emotional distress accompanied with physical symptoms,loss of salary,benefits,opportunities,and reputation.
taylor exhausted his administrative remedies.he filed a complaint with the department of fair employment and housing dfeh on september,and received his letter on november.
ii.procedure 
taylor filed this action on april.the complaint claimed retaliation,subd.h and failure to take necessary remedial action,subds.j k in violation of the feha.
the trial court dismissed the action after sustaining defendants demurrer without leave to amend on september.relying on yanowitz,the trial court determined that defendants could not be liable for claims of retaliation,because the adverse employment action claimed was not sufficiently material in affecting the terms and conditions of employment.it reasoned that there were no allegations of actual termination,demotion,discipline,reduction in pay or benefits,egregious or intimidating or harassing conduct,or any material significant employment action.the court held that the claimed denial of emergency appointment,threats of discipline,negative comments and alteration of job responsibilities did not amount to retaliation.the court also concluded that,as a public employee,hamer was immune from personal liability for performing discretionary personnel actions.it further found no cause of action for failure to prevent retaliation under the feha.
taylor timely appealed.while the appeal was pending,the united states supreme court issued its decision in burlington,supra,d on june.we requested that the parties file supplemental briefs addressing burlington.
discussion 
on appeal,taylor contends the complaint alleged facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for employment retaliation under either the yanowitz or burlington standards the feha imposes liability on supervisors as persons,who may be held personally liable for retaliation in violation of the feha retaliatory conduct does not constitute the exercise of discretion immune from individual liability employer failure to prevent retaliation is unlawful under the feha and the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing the action without leave to amend,particularly in light of new authority after the filing of the complaint

ii.the complaint alleged facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for employment retaliation 
the feha prohibits an employer,because of the race of any person,to refuse to hire or employ the person or to refuse to select the person for a training program leading to employment,or to bar or to discharge the person from employment or from a training program leading to employment,or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,subd.a.
with certain exceptions not at issue here,it is an unlawful employment practice for any employer or person to discharge,expel,or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint,testified,or assisted in any proceeding under this part,subd.h.regulations adopted by the fair employment and housing commission fehc additionally provide that it is unlawful retaliation for an employer or other covered entity to demote,suspend,reduce,fail to hire or consider for hire,fail to give equal consideration in making employment decisions,fail to treat impartially in the context of any recommendations for subsequent employment which the employer or other covered entity may make,adversely affect working conditions or otherwise deny any employment benefit to an individual because that individual has opposed practices prohibited by the act or has filed a complaint,testified,assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing conducted by the commission or department or their staffs,tit,subd.a.
in construing the feha,california courts,where appropriate,look to federal authorities interpreting title vii.however,it is not appropriate to follow federal decisions if feha evidences a legislative intent different from that of congress.page superior court th,d.here,the elements of title vii and feha claims require that the plaintiff establish a prima facie case of retaliation,the defendant articulate a legitimate nonretaliatory explanation for its acts,and the plaintiff show that the defendant proffered explanation is merely a pretext for the illegal termination.flait north american watch th,d.consequently,to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the feha,the plaintiff must show he was engaged in a protected activity the employer subjected him to an adverse employment action and there was a causal link between the protected activity and the employer action.ibid.we examine each of these elements below.
protected activity 
under the feha,protected activity includes opposition to any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint,testified,or assisted in any proceeding under this part,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing in an administrative proceeding,subd.h,tit,subd.a.
defendants assert taylor did not affirmatively show he was engaged in protected activity by merely pleading that he was named a witness on coleman two race discrimination complaints.however,the complaint did not plead only this single act of claimed opposition.taylor also pleaded that he affirmatively opposed race discrimination when he was subpoenaed to testify at the personnel hearing,met with and provided information to the eeo office in support of coleman discrimination charge.moreover,in his own behalf,taylor later filed a complaint for retaliation as a result of having opposed race discrimination,which constituted further protected activity under the feha.thus,taylor alleged that he engaged in multiple protected activities.in accordance with the statute plain language,we find taylor sufficiently pleaded that he engaged in a protected activity.
adverse action 
until recently,the law was unsettled although there was scant authority in california defining the meaning of an adverse employment action under the feha,a plethora of federal courts ha d considered the issue in construing the analogous federal antidiscrimination statute,and ha d reached differing conclusions.citations.akers county of san diego th,d.
the majority of federal circuit courts adopted the materiality standard,under which a retaliation claim lies only for an employment action that materially affects the terms and conditions of employment.see,torres pisano cir,employer single request for employee to withdraw eeoc complaint,without more,did not constitute adverse employment action von gunten maryland cir,temporary withdrawal of use of a state vehicle did not constitute an adverse employment action nguyen city of cleveland cir,mere temporal proximity between the filing of the discrimination charges and the failure to promote was not enough to support a retaliation claim ribando united airlines,cir,a letter of concern or counseling placed in the employee file did not rise to the level of an adverse employment action washington illinois of revenue cir,where the employee needed to work certain hours on account of her son medical condition,a reassignment that did not affect pay or promotional opportunities was a materially adverse change brown brody,denial of lateral transfer with no loss in pay or benefits was not adverse employment action unless accompanied by some other materially adverse consequences affecting the terms,conditions,or privileges of present or future employment rochon gonzales,employer failure to investigate death threats against fbi agent family was material to a retaliation claim.
the ninth circuit adopted a broader deterrence test,which,consistent with equal employment opportunity commission eeoc guidelines views adverse action as any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity.ray henderson cir,adverse employment policy found in the elimination of employee involvement program and flexible policy,institution of lockdown procedures,and disproportionate reduction of workload and pay of postal worker who complained about treatment of women.
the california supreme court in yanowitz elected to follow the materiality test.yanowitz,supra,cal th at,d.ten months later,the united states supreme court in burlington adopted the deterrence test.burlington,supra,at.at.although the materiality and deterrence tests differ in some respects,we find that taylor has sufficiently pleaded adverse action under both standards.
the materiality test under yanowitz 
in yanowitz,the california supreme court concluded that a sales manager refusal to follow a supervisor order to fire an insufficiently attractive sales associate,a policy she reasonably believed to be discriminatory,constituted protected activity under the feha.it held that an employer may not retaliate against an employee on the basis of such conduct when the employer,in light of all the circumstances,knows that the employee believes the order to be discriminatory,even when the employee does not explicitly state to her supervisor or employer that she believes the order to be discriminatory.yanowitz,supra,cal th at,d.
in so holding,the court expressly rejected the deterrence test,concluding that the proper standard for defining an adverse employment action is the materiality test,a standard that requires an employer adverse action to materially affect the terms and conditions of employment.yanowitz,supra,cal th at,d,see akers county of san diego,supra,th at pp,d.
the court further concluded that in determining whether an employee has been subjected to treatment that materially affects the terms and conditions of employment,it is appropriate to consider the totality of the circumstances.yanowitz,supra,cal th at,d.th ere is no requirement that an employer retaliatory acts constitute one swift blow,rather than a series of subtle,yet damaging,injuries.citations.enforcing a requirement that each act separately constitute an adverse employment action would subvert the purpose and intent of the statute.id.at,d.
the court held that the feha protects an employee against unlawful discrimination with respect not only to ultimate employment actions such as termination or demotion,but also the entire spectrum of employment actions that are reasonably likely to adversely and materially affect an employee job performance or opportunity for advancement in his or her career.although a mere offensive utterance or even a pattern of social slights by either the employer or coemployees can not properly be viewed as materially affecting the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment for purposes of section a or give rise to a claim under section h,the phrase terms,conditions,or privileges of employment must be interpreted liberally and with a reasonable appreciation of the realities of the workplace in order to afford employees the appropriate and generous protection against employment discrimination that the feha was intended to provide.yanowitz,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
examining the totality of the circumstances alleged,we find that taylor sufficiently pleaded that he experienced adverse employment action as a result of opposing race discrimination against coleman.taylor alleged that hamer stripped him of his supervisory position threatened to terminate his work schedule barred him from completing the supervisory certification courses embarrassed him before his subordinate excluded him from meetings and deprived him of the information necessary to carry out his duties undermined him by removing important contracts denied him the emergency appointment to full engineer but required him to train the appointee accused him of being confrontational labeled him a troublemaker to prospective supervisors in other groups disclosed confidential information about taylor to his and told him not to expect an emergency appointment to full engineer.this continuous course of conduct culminated in taylor low rank on the civil service list for full engineer,a position he was apparently groomed to assume prior to assisting coleman with his race discrimination complaints.under the yanowitz analysis,it is reasonable to conclude that these events do not fall into the category of mere offensive utterance or even a pattern of social slights.rather,under the realities of the workplace,they represent adverse employment actions material to the terms,conditions or privileges of taylor employment.
contrary to defendants contention,the case before us is not analogous to mcrae department of corrections and rehabilitation th,d mcrae.there,a surgeon alleged she was denied an appointment as chief medical officer at a separate prison facility because of her race.she argued that the complaint triggered a number of retaliatory actions by her employer that culminated in her involuntary transfer from the hospital where she worked to a position at the prison facility.id.at,d.the court held the jury finding that the employee had been subjected to an adverse action was not supported by the evidence.what the employee contended was a continuous course of conduct was in fact a series of events,each bearing little relationship to the others,and at least some of which clearly were not the result of unlawful retaliation,leaving the emergency room without physician coverage disobeying direct orders regarding patient family contact and failing to facilitate hospice making a telephone order to withhold antibiotics from a patient with pneumonia without an examination arguing with two nurses over the improper removal of an ultraviolet light.id.at,d.the court concluded these incidents were not part of a process of progressive discipline and did not create an abusive work environment.id.at,d.
the mcrae court was careful to explain that the case differed in significant ways from yanowitz,where as here,a continuous course of conduct was evident in that all of the allegedly wrongful acts were engaged in by the plaintiff immediate supervisor and his supervisor,and all were taken in response to a single protected act by the plaintiff.mcrae,supra,th at,d.in contrast,mcrae involved the allegedly wrongful acts taken by many different persons,for different reasons,some of which indisputably had nothing to do with the employee protected conduct.ibid.
given yanowitz broad interpretation of the materiality test,the trial court erred in finding that a claim of retaliation would not lie.
the deterrence test under burlington 
in burlington,a railway company female maintenance worker complained to her employer of alleged sexual harassment by her immediate supervisor.afterwards,the supervisor reassigned her from forklift duty to standard track laborer tasks.the worker filed a complaint with the eeoc,alleging that the reassignment was unlawful gender discrimination and retaliation for her complaint.subsequently,following a dispute with a different immediate supervisor,the worker was suspended without pay for purported insubordination.the employer later concluded that the worker had not been insubordinate,reinstated her,and awarded her backpay for the days she had been suspended.the worker filed another eeoc charge and a title vii action alleging that the employer retaliated against her for complaining about her supervisor sexual harassment by reassigning her from forklift duty to standard track laborer tasks and suspending her without pay before reinstating her.burlington,supra,at.at.
the united states supreme court granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement among the circuits on the applicable standard under title vii provision.burlington,supra,at.at.the court adopted the deterrence test.it determined that title vii provision a,unlike its substantive provision a,does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace.burlington,supra,at.rather,the provision covers those and only those employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant.ibid.in the context of the case,the court held that the employer actions must be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.ibid.
the court explained the language of title vii substantive and provisions differ in important ways.the underscored words in the substantive provision hire,discharge,compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,employment opportunities,and status as an employee explicitly limit the scope of that provision to actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace.no such limiting words appear in the provision.burlington,supra,at.at.given these linguistic differences,the court concluded that congress intended the differences that its language suggests,for the two provisions differ not only in language but in purpose as well.id.at.citing to mcdonnell douglas green,d,it reasoned that the provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial,ethnic,religious,or status the provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering through retaliation with an employee efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the act basic guarantees.burlington,supra,at.at.as a result,the provision,unlike the substantive provision,is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.id.at.the supreme court further determined that neither its precedents nor the eeoc interpretations support a contrary conclusion.id.at.
applying the deterrence test,the court found that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the jury verdict.burlington,supra,at.at.even though the worker former and present duties fell within the same job description,the court found a jury could reasonably conclude that the reassignment of responsibilities would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee.evidence presented showed the track labor duties were more arduous and dirtier,while the forklift operator position required more qualifications and held more prestige.id.at.given that title vii had been amended to permit recovery of compensatory and punitive damages,it also found reasonable the jury conclusion that the suspension without pay was materially adverse.ibid.
seeing no apparent differences in legislative intent for the provisions of the feha and title vii,we look to federal authorities interpreting title vii.to apply the deterrence test,we examine defendants actions to determine whether a jury could find they were so harmful as to dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.
here,taylor claimed that hamer stripped him of his supervisory position,made threats to end his work schedule,barred him from completing the supervisory certification series,excluded him from meetings and the flow of business information,removed important contracts,denied him appointment to and discouraged him from promotion to full engineer,made accusations against him,disclosed his confidential information to others,and discouraged him from anticipating a promotion to full engineer.he also pleaded that dwp failed to accommodate his transfer request so that he could work in another department away from hamer.assuming the truth of these allegations,we conclude that a reasonable city engineer with nearly two decades of tenure and similar promotional objectives would be deterred from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.
consequently,we also find taylor sufficiently pleaded that he suffered adverse employment action under the deterrence test 
nexus between protected activity and adverse action 
to establish a prima facie case,the plaintiff must show that there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer action.flait north am.watch,supra,th at,d.close proximity in time of an adverse action to an employee resistance or opposition to unlawful conduct is often strong evidence of a retaliatory motive.strother southern california permanente medical group cir,plaintiff made prima facie showing of retaliatory termination under the act where employee was fired one day after filing a complaint with the dfeh flait,supra,th at,d plaintiff made prima facie showing of retaliatory termination where employee was terminated a short time after complaining to supervisor of the supervisor sexual harassment of a,and harassing supervisor was responsible for termination.
here,taylor pleaded a causal link between his protected activity and the adverse employment action in that the retaliation commenced intensified shortly after each act of opposition to the race discrimination against coleman or retaliation by hamer.as a result of the ongoing retaliation,he engaged in further protected activity by opposing and reporting the retaliation by hamer to dwp eeo office and filing a formal complaint.he then further suffered adverse employment actions under hamer and enumerated those incidents on over occasions,including his exclusion from supervisory training courses,meetings,conference calls and project information.he pleaded that his involvement in the protected activity caused hamer to label him a troublemaker,reassign his duties and assignmen
