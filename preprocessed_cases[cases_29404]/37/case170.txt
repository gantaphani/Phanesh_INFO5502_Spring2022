candace cates appeals a judgment entered in favor of defendants former california state controller steven westley the controller,california gambling control commissioner sasaki and the california gambling control commission together with sasaki,the commission and former california state attorney general bill lockyer,now edmund brown,the attorney general,collectively with the controller and the commission,defendants on her taxpayer action seeking to compel defendants to discharge their statutory duty to collect money derived from gambling belonging to the state from various indian tribes.she also appeals orders denying her motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories seeking financial information about various indian tribes and requiring her to return confidential documents that she allegedly misappropriated from her former employer.
in this case,we conclude that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment because defendants have not shown,as a matter of law,that they have complied with their mandatory duties to collect money derived from gambling owed to the state.specifically,they failed to negate cates claim that the tribes are calculating their payments based on an incorrect definition of net win.even assuming defendants had met their initial burden of proof,the evidence cates submitted in opposition to the motion created a triable issue of material fact.we also conclude that cates has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories or in ordering her to return confidential documents that she allegedly misappropriated from her former employer.
introduction 
in,the state of california entered into gaming compacts with california indian tribes,permitting the tribes to operate public gambling casinos on their respective reservations.the gaming compacts between the various tribes and the state are substantially the same and will be collectively referred to herein as the compact.the compact provides that a tribe can not deny the state gaming agency,the entities authorized to regulate gaming under the gambling control act bus,et,access to papers,books or records to ensure compliance therewith.compact.
section a of the compact requires that tribes pay a percentage of their winnings to a special distribution fund the fund created by the legislature.the contribution amount is determined by the average device net win,which is calculated by dividing the total net win from all terminals during the quarter by the total number of gaming devices operated during a given quarter the quarterly device base.compact,a.the compact defines a gaming device as slot machines compact,but it does not define terminals and it appears that a terminal is another name for a gaming device.
once the average device net win is known,tribes contribute into the fund a percentage of this number based on the number of terminals operated.compact,a.for example,if a tribe operates to terminals the compact requires it to pay seven percent of the average device net win into the fund.ibid.the compact states that net win means net win as defined by the american institute of certified public accountants,which is the difference between gaming wins and losses before deducting costs and expenses.compact.since october,the tribes have been required to make payments into the fund on a quarterly basis and to submit with each contribution a report setting forth the quarterly device base,the net win from all terminals in the quarterly device base and the average device net win.compact,a c.
in,former governor gray davis issued executive order acknowledging that the tribes are required to make quarterly contributions to the fund pursuant to the formula set forth in section of the compact and submit certified quarterly reports to the state for such contributions and making the commission responsible for reviewing the quarterly reports and collecting and accounting for contributions to the fund.specifically,the order stated that the commission is authorized to and shall collect and account for all contributions to the fund and collect and analyze the certified quarterly reports submitted by the tribes.
cates,a former agent of the california division of gambling control the division,claims that since the commission has known that the tribes have been paying into the fund according to their own definition of net win.the division is part of the department of justice bus,subd.h and is responsible for investigating and enforcing controlled gambling in california,bus.in november,she filed this taxpayer action for injunctive and declaratory relief,alleging that the tribes were not paying the share into the fund and that the commission,the controller and the attorney general were not fulfilling their statutory duties to collect or require the tribes to account for the money.the gist of the complaint is that the tribes are not following the definition of net win contained in the compact resulting in an underpayment to the state.
procedural background 
in,the controller and the attorney general moved for summary judgment on the grounds cates lacked standing to maintain the action,they had no responsibility to collect or account for contributions to the fund and the tribes were indispensable parties to the action.the trial court rejected these arguments and denied the motion.
the following year,the trial court denied cates discovery motion seeking production of all quarterly reports showing the amount each tribe contributed to the fund and information about how much each tribe paid under the compact and how much each tribe owes under the compact.the trial court also issued an order compelling cates to return confidential documents that she allegedly misappropriated while working for the division.
in,the commission and the controller moved for summary judgment or in the alternative,summary adjudication,arguing that cates was not entitled to injunctive or declaratory relief because none of the tribes were delinquent in their payments to the fund the commission fulfilled its statutory duties and the controller had no collection obligation because the tribes were not delinquent in their payments to the fund.
after ruling on various evidentiary objections,the trial court noted that defendants had a mandatory duty to collect and account for contributions deposited into the fund and collect and analyze the certified quarterly reports.the court found that defendants evidence revealed they had a procedure for accounting for the contributions into the fund,that they actually accounted for the contributions and that they had collected and analyzed the certified quarterly reports accordingly,there was no controversy because defendants had fulfilled their statutory duties.because defendants have never formally determined that any tribe has been delinquent in its payments to the fund,there has been no reason for the controller to initiate a collection action and there was no conduct to enjoin.the trial court also found that defendants have not abused their discretion in conducting their affairs.thereafter,the parties stipulated to a consent judgment in favor of the attorney general to expedite the appeal of the summary judgment ruling.cates appeals from the resulting judgment and orders entered for defendants.

here,defendants admit that the commission has a mandatory duty to collect and account for all contributions to the fund and collect and analyze the certified quarterly reports submitted by the tribes.in this action,cates seeks a mandatory injunction requiring defendants to discharge these mandatory duties and a judicial declaration that defendants are obligated to collect monies from the tribes under the compact as money due the state.in moving for summary judgment,defendants relied exclusively on the language of the compact,the executive order and the declaration of gary qualset,the deputy director of the compliance division of the commission,to establish they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
qualset declaration stated that the auditing of payments made to the fund is discretionary under the compact and from april to the present,the commission commenced audits of nine of the tribes and completed one audit.the completed audit revealed an underpayment,which was corrected,and the commission has made no formal determination of delinquency as to fund payments generally.the commission also has a procedure for accounting for all fund contributions and as part of that procedure,the commission audit staff performs desk reviews of all quarterly fund contribution reports submitted by the tribes to insure the mathematical accuracy of the reports and the proper application of contribution rates in the compact to the numbers reported by the tribes.since fund payments first came due in october,the commission audit staff has accounted for all money contributed to the fund.
the trial court granted summary judgment on the ground the undisputed facts did not support the declaration,that defendants proved as a matter of law that they fulfilled all their statutory duties regarding collecting and accounting for all contributions to the fund and collecting and analyzing the certified quarterly reports submitted by the tribes.we disagree that the defendants made such a showing.
via executive order,the state delegated to the commission its rights to enforce sections and of the compact.these sections of the compact require that the tribes pay a percentage of their winnings to the fund and set forth a schedule to calculate the contribution based on the net win and the quarterly device base and submit with each contribution a report reflecting the quarterly device base,the net win from all terminals in the quarterly device base and the average device net win.compact,a a c.as a threshold matter,we note that the executive order does not define the terms collect,account or analyze.at this stage,however,we need not definitively resolve this issue as the evidence presented by the parties reveals that the commission has not even been acting under a common sense meaning of these terms.
it is well settled that the value of opinion evidence rests in the factors considered and the reasoning employed people lawley cal th,d,and an opinion unsupported by reasons or explanations establishes nothing.kelley trunk th,d.here,qualset states in his declaration that the commission has never made a formal determination of delinquency as to fund payments.qualset proclamation,however,fails to establish that a delinquency does not in fact exist.rather,when this assertion is viewed in connection with qualset statement that between april to the present the commission has only audited one tribe,it appears that the commission does not know whether the tribes have paid the appropriate sums into the fund.
this evidence is wholly insufficient to establish,as a matter of law,that the commission has discharged its mandatory duties regarding collecting and accounting for all contributions to the fund.while the commission may have discretion as to how it actually fulfills its mandatory duties,at a minimum,it must show that it acted based on generally accepted financial accounting principles and practices.the commission evidence does not constitute such a showing.
as to cates request for a mandatory injunction,the trial court reasoned that since the evidence showed no delinquencies,cates could not establish that the commission was not fulfilling its mandatory duties and thus there was nothing for the court to compel.as discussed above,the trial court reasoning rested on a faulty premise.accordingly,the trial court erred in concluding that,as a matter of law,cates was not entitled to a mandatory injunction requiring the commission to comply with its mandatory duties.
finally,defendants assert that summary judgment for the controller and the attorney general was proper because the duties of these entities are contingent on the existence of a delinquency and no delinquency exists.we do not agree that the controller and the attorney general have no duties unless a delinquency exists.be that as it may,defendants have not proven that there is not a delinquency accordingly,judgment in favor of these entities was inappropriate.because defendants have failed to establish every fact necessary to show the causes of action against them are without merit,they have failed to meet their initial burden and the motion must be denied.consumer cause,smilecare th,d.
even assuming defendants had met their initial burden of proof,the evidence cates submitted in opposition to the motion clearly creates a triable issue as to whether defendants are complying with their mandatory duties.cates presented the deposition testimony of dean shelton,the commission chairman,and michael palmer,a former commission member.
shelton testified that the definition of net win in the compact is ambiguous,that he understood many tribes use different definitions of net win and that if the
