the district court concluded that the patent and trademark office improperly revived patent after it was abandoned during prosecution,and therefore held it and the continuation patent that followed it invalid on summary judgment.we conclude that improper revival is not a cognizable defense in an action involving the validity or infringement of a patent.thus,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
aristocrat technologies australia pty,and aristocrat technologies,collectively,aristocrat compete with international game technology and igt collectively,igt in the market for electronic gaming machines.aristocrat is the assignee of patent the patent and the patent,both of which relate to a slot machine game and system with improved jackpot feature.prosecution of these patents began in australia,when,starting on july,aristocrat filed two provisional patent applications directed to the inventions embodied in the.one year later,aristocrat filed a patent cooperation treaty application the pct application in australia,claiming priority to the previously filed provisional applications.the pct application was subsequently published.pursuant to and,aristocrat was required to pay the fee for the national stage of the pct application by january,months after the filing date of the first australian provisional application.
the patent and trademark office pto did not receive aristocrat national filing fee until january,day late.the pto consequently mailed a notice of abandonment to aristocrat,which stated,among other things,that aristocrat may wish to consider filing a petition to the commissioner under cfr a or b requesting that the application be revived.at.in lieu of filing a petition to revive the abandoned application,aristocrat responded by filing a petition to correct the is,to correct the date on which the pto received its national filing fee.the pto denied the petition without prejudice,after aristocrat failed to provide sufficient evidence to corroborate the date the filing fee was mailed.it is unclear when aristocrat received the pto denial but it later filed a petition to revive the patent application under b,claiming that the delay in paying the national stage filing fee was unintentional.id.at.the pto granted the petition to revive on september,after concluding that a ll of the requirements of cfr b ha d been met.id.at.following the pto revival,aristocrat resumed prosecution of the patent application,and later filed the patent application as a continuation of the patent application.the patent issued on june,and the patent issued on september.
in june,aristocrat filed suit against igt for infringement of the patent in the united states district court for the northern district of california.aristocrat amended its complaint to assert infringement of the patent when that patent issued.igt answered and subsequently moved for summary judgment of invalidity.it argued that the patent was invalid because,after it was abandoned,aristocrat was required to show that its delay was unavoidable in order to revive the application,not merely that its delay was unintentional.thus,according to igt,the pto improperly revived the patent application by requiring aristocrat only to show unintentional delay.igt also argued that the patent was invalid,contending that since the patent application was not lawfully revived,it constituted prior art to,and thus anticipated,the patent under b.

the patent 
the threshold issue in this appeal is whether improper revival may be raised as an invalidity defense in an action involving the infringement or validity of a patent.the district court,relying on and,decided that question affirmatively.the district court also found that the apa provided a separate basis upon which to review the pto revival of the patent.we conclude that improper revival may not be raised as a defense in an action involving the validity or infringement of a patent 
section of title provides a catalog of defenses available in an action involving the validity or infringement of a patent 
noninfringement,absence of liability for infringement or unenforceability,
invalidity of the patent or any claim in suit on any ground specified in part ii of this title as a condition for patentability,
invalidity of the patent or any claim in suit for failure to comply with any requirement of sections or of this title,
any other fact or act made a defense by this title.
the first and third enumerated categories are not asserted by igt as bases for its invalidity defense.at issue are the second and fourth.we discuss each in turn.
section authorizes an invalidity defense based on any ground specified in part ii of this title as a condition for patentability.a defense falling under this section thus has two prerequisites it must fall within part ii of title and it must be a condition for patentability.the district court determined that b ecause section deadline for prosecuting an application is specified within part ii of title,it necessarily provides an available defense where a patentee has abandoned,and failed to lawfully revive,a patent application.aristocrat,d at.what the district court failed to address,however,is whether the proper revival of an abandoned application is a condition for patentability.
it has long been understood that the patent act sets out the conditions for patentability in three sections sections,and.see graham john deere,d the patent act sets out the conditions of patentability in three sections.an analysis of the structure of these three sections indicates that patentability is dependent upon three explicit conditions novelty and utility as articulated and defined in and,and nonobviousness,the new statutory formulation,as set out in.these conditions are included in chapter of the patent act,entitled patentability of inventions,and the titles of the sections themselves make clear that they relate to fundamental preconditions for obtaining a patent.section,relating to utility and patent eligibility is entitled inventions patentable.likewise,sections and,relating to novelty and nonobviousness,respectively,are explicitly entitled c onditions for patentability.
while there are most certainly other factors that bear on the validity or the enforceability of a patent,utility and eligibility,novelty,and nonobviousness are the only conditions for patentability.for example,section unquestionably provides certain additional requirements for a patent to be valid,one of which,fo
