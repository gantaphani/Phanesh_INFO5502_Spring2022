cadmus raises six contentions on appeal.first,cadmus asserts section does not apply to contracts made with a tribal corporation for work done on tribal land.second,cadmus asserts the trial court erred by sustaining palms objections to cadmus evidence en masse.third,cadmus asserts there is a triable issue of fact as to whether it held a valid license.fourth,cadmus contends that if it was not properly licensed,then there is a triable issue of fact as to whether it satisfies the substantial compliance requirements,subd.e.fifth,cadmus contends palms is estopped from seeking recovery pursuant to the unlicensed contractor statute.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
the facts in this subsection are taken from palms complaint.twenty nine palms band of mission indians the tribe is a federally recognized indian tribe.the tribe is sovereign,residing on its reservation in the coachella area.palms is a tribal corporation wholly owned and operated by the tribe.palms owns and operates the spotlight casino the casino.palms and the casino are on the tribe land in the coachella area.
on or about march,cadmus submitted a written bid proposal to construct a temporary access road and parking lot for the casino.the bid was in the amount of.palms accepted cadmus bid.cadmus performed the work on the tribe land,where the casino is located.cadmus finished its work and was paid in full around may palms paid cadmus.cadmus first received its contractor license in october.when cadmus entered into the construction contract and performed the construction work,it was not a licensed contractor.palms sought to have cadmus disgorge the.
in cadmus answer it denied the allegations and raised affirmative defenses,such as substantial compliance,consent,waiver,and unclean hands.cadmus answer is primarily legal assertions,without facts.
motion for summary judgment 
palms filed a motion for summary judgment on april.palms argued the undisputed evidence reflected cadmus acted as a contractor,but was not licensed when it performed the construction work at the casino,and therefore,palms should prevail,and cadmus should be required to disgorge the.
the declaration of darrell mike mike,a member of the palms board of directors was attached to palms motion for summary judgment.mike declared palms contracted with cadmus in march for construction work related to a temporary access road and parking lot.mike stated,a substantial portion of this work took place on an approximately acre lot adjacent to the tribe reservation the adjacent lot.mike denied that the adjacent lot was ever part of the tribe federally approved reservation land.mike believed palms held a temporary easement over the adjacent lot.
palms also lodged various exhibits in support of its motion for summary judgment.one of the exhibits was a transcript of bardos deposition.in the deposition,bardos stated cadmus was a general contracting company,and in it was operating as a general contractor.cadmus filed its fictitious business name statement with san bernardino county on april.cadmus entered into the contract with palms on march.bardos believed cadmus completed its work around the end of june.the state of california issued a contractor license to cadmus on october,license.
cadmus has always been a sole proprietorship,and bardos has always been the percent owner.bardos asserted that from april to october cadmus was operating under the contractor license issued to bardos construction,bci license.in,bardos applied for a contractor license as an individual doing business as bci.when asked if bardos informed anyone at palms that he was operating under bci license,bardos responded,i had no obligation to do that.i did need to.they had private investigators.
also lodged as an exhibit was the contract between cadmus and spotlight casino.term of the contract provided,license pursuant to legal requirements,notice is hereby given that contractors are required by law to be licensed and are regulated by the contractors state license board.any questions concerning a contractor may be referred to the registrar of the board w hose address is 
other exhibits included invoices from cadmus to palms,and checks from palms to cadmus.a fictitious business name statement reflected bardos filed for cadmus fictitious business name on april.the application for cadmus contractor license was dated june,and signed by bardos.cadmus contractor license reflected an issue date of october.an online printout related to bci reflected it had an active class b general building contractor license,which was issued in february.
opposition to motion for summary judgment 
declaration 
in a declaration,bardos asserted he had been a licensed general contractor in california since.in february,palms hired bardos to be its representative in regard to the construction of a parking structure near the casino.as the representative,bardos would help palms with the selection of architects and engineers review completed plans prepare schedules and budgets interface with local officials to expedite the permit process assist with drafting and negotiating contracts with contractors,subcontractors,or suppliers inspect work as it progressed and review contractor pay applications.
bardos asserted that during his time as palms construction representative,he learned the tribe always took the position that california licensing regulatory laws do not apply to the tribe work being performed on tribal lands,which was why local building inspectors did not inspect the construction work and palms hired bci to inspect the work.
in his declaration,bardos explained that worth group had been hired as the general contractor for the parking structure project.palms asked bci to prepare a bid for the temporary parking lot and access road,in order to replace worth group who prepared a bid higher than bci bid.bardos declared palms asked bci to perform the work under a different name,to hide the fact that bardos palms representative was performing the construction work.bardos created cadmus to hide his dual role.bardos said palms was fully informed bci contractor license would be used for the work on the temporary parking lot and access road,through conversations with bardos.mike told bardos construction work on tribal land was exempt from state licensing requirements.
bardos declared palms made payments to cadmus,which bardos then funneled to bci,in order to pay subcontractors.bardos explained that he did not immediately seek a contractor license for cadmus because he relied on palms representation cadmus did not need a license for work done on tribal land.
bardos further declared the written agreement between cadmus and palms only encompassed a portion of the work performed,because at the time the written contract was created palms was still trying to gain an easement across the adjacent lot.according to bardos,the written agreement had two parts the first part concerned constructing the access road,while the second part concerned construction of the temporary parking lot.bardos declared that,at the time of signing the written contract,the tribe had not yet acquired a temporary easement across the adjacent lot,so the access road could be built.thus,mike struck out the first part of the contract,only agreeing to the second part related to the parking lot.bardos stated the work related to the access road was eventually completed pursuant to collateral oral agreements.
opposition 
cadmus filed its corrected opposition to palms motion for summary judgment on june.in the opposition,cadmus set forth its version of the facts.cadmus asserted the general contractor on the casino renovation project was worth group.palms asked bci how much it would charge to perform the work on the temporary access road and parking lot.bci responded that it could perform the work for less money than worth group.palms then asked bardos,the managing officer and sole shareholder of bci to perform the construction work under a different name so that worth group would not discover that bci was the one performing the work.in order to accommodate palms,bardos created the fictitious business name cadmus construction company.the fictitious business name was designed to conceal bci identity from worth,so worth would not object to bci dual role as palms representative on the project and as a contractor on the project.
cadmus asserted palms performed an extensive background check on bardos including a status review of bci contractor license.further,cadmus argued palms expressly and impliedly approved of bci licensure as being sufficient to support its purported agreement with cadmus.citation.palms even went so far as to represent to cadmus that it did not require cadmus to have its own contractor license,but that the work could be performed under bci license because it was being performed on the tribe land.cadmus alleged palms knew bci would be performing the work,but insisted bci and bardos maintain the illusion cadmus was performing the work,so worth group would not discover bci dual role.cadmus argued palms should be barred from recovering disgorged profits due to the doctrine of unclean hands.
further,cadmus asserted the written contract did not cover all of the construction work.cadmus argued some of the work was performed subject to oral agreements between palms and bci.cadmus argued the checks for the construction work were made payable to cadmus solely for palms convenience,and to maintain the illusion that cadmus was performing all the work.cadmus argued summary judgment should not be granted because some of the money was earned by bci pursuant to the oral agreements.
further,cadmus asserted civil regulatory laws do not apply on tribal lands.cadmus reasoned the state trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide the issue,if section is determined to be a statute,as opposed to a criminal statute.cadmus then argued that section is a law because it is a regulatory licensing rule.additionally,cadmus asserted a triable issue of fact existed as to whether palms waived the licensing requirement,which it could do pursuant to its sovereign immunity.
finally,cadmus argued the motion for summary judgment should be denied because additional facts exist,and cadmus should be permitted to conduct further discovery.cadmus asserted it did not have a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery because after cadmus filed its answer,but before the summary judgment motion was filed,cadmus insurance company disclaimed cadmus coverage,which caused cadmus to spend time evaluating whether it would keep the insurance company attorney or retain new counsel.cadmus contended it could produce additional evidence related to triable issues of fact if given more time for discovery.
cadmus lodged a variety of exhibits in support of its opposition to the motion for summary judgment.one of the exhibits was a contractor state license board certification of records reflecting bardos construction company bcc was issued a class b general contractor license in.
another exhibit was the consulting services agreement the consulting agreement between palms and paul bardos,dba bardos construction,dated february.the consulting agreement provided bci would act as palms representative for the development and construction of a kampgrounds of america facility,the development and construction of a parking structure adjacent to the casino,and renovations to the casino related to the parking structure.the representative position included assisting in the selection of architects and engineers reviewing completed plans preparing schedules and budgets interfacing with local officials to expedite the permit process assisting with drafting and negotiating contracts with contractors,subcontractors,or suppliers inspecting work as it progressed and reviewing contractor pay applications.
included in the exhibits was a city of coachella building permit for work done on the temporary road and parking lot taken in the name of bardos construction in april.also included was an agreement between bci and laird construction,for laird to perform subcontracting work on the temporary road and parking lot.the agreement listed the general contractor as bci.the subcontracting agreement reflected laird would construct the temporary access road and parking lot for.
reply to the opposition to summary judgment 
in palms reply to cadmus opposition,it raised a variety of arguments.first,palms contended bardos declaration contradicted his deposition testimony.specifically,bardos contradicted himself by declaring that part one of the contract,related to the access road,was not part of the written agreement.palms asserted that during bardos deposition,he testified the written contract was the only agreement for construction between palms and cadmus.bardos testified,cadmus construction company completed its scope of work under this agreement,referring to the written contract.palms further argued the evidence reflected payments for the road construction corresponded exactly to those set forth in the written contract.palms also argued bardos contradicted himself by claiming he had conversations with tribal members about using bci license to perform the construction work.in bardos deposition,when asked if he ever informed a tribal representative that cadmus was using bci license,bardos responded,i had no obligation to do that.
second,palms asserted cadmus failed to produce evidence that it was a licensed contractor when it performed the construction work.third,palms argued the written contract encompassed all the work performed,so there were no collateral agreements with bci.fourth,palms contended the trial court found it had jurisdiction over the case during the demurrer stage of the proceedings,so cadmus should not be permitted to reargue the jurisdiction issue.
fifth,as to waiver,palms argued cadmus provided no authority that palms could waive state licensing requirements.palms asserted section was criminal in nature and therefore may be enforced on the tribe reservation,without regard to the tribe wishes.citation.palms further argued the express terms of the written contract reflected contractors must be properly licensed.palms concluded cadmus case law did not support the application of affirmative defenses in situations involving unlicensed contractors,unclean hands,estoppel,waiver,and fraud.
sixth,in regard to cadmus request for more time to conduct discovery,palms argued cadmus did not meet the statutory requirements for a continuance.palms argued cadmus failed to provide a declaration explaining why the discovery was not previously conducted the explanation was in the opposition,but not a declaration.further,palms asserted cadmus had not conducted any discovery as of june,despite being served with the complaint in october.palms asserted cadmus was only trying to delay the proceedings by requesting more time for discovery.palms filed objections to the evidence cadmus provided in support of its opposition.
surreply to the reply in support of the motion for summary judgment 
cadmus filed a surreply to palms reply.cadmus asserted bardos never testified that the written agreement covered all the construction work performed.further,cadmus asserted bardos testified that members of the tribe asked bardos to conceal the fact that bci was performing the construction,and bardos supplemented his testimony after the deposition to reflect that he spoke to tribal members about cadmus using bci license.additionally cadmus argued that the written contract showed mike wrote part ii only above the signature lines,indicating that part one was deleted from the written contract.cadmus asserted the motion for summary judgment should not be granted because the written agreement did not cover all of the construction work,so some work was done directly between palms and bci.
on june,the trial court held a hearing on palms summary judgment motion.at the hearing,palms argued its motion was primarily based on bardos testimony,and invoices reflecting cadmus was paid in the exact amounts set forth in the written agreement.palms asserted the burden was on cadmus to show it had a contractor license during the period of construction,and cadmus had not provided proof of a license.
cadmus argued the written agreement did not cover all the construction work performed.cadmus further asserted palms paid cadmus,as opposed to bci,because palms chose to conceal bci identity from worth group.cadmus argued it was unbelievable for palms to argue cadmus was wrong to perform the construction work without a license,because palms,cadmus,bci,and bardos all agreed to conceal bardos and bci dual roles.further,cadmus asserted a contractor license was not required to perform the construction work on the tribe land.
the trial court found cadmus did not have a contractor license at the time it performed the construction work,and therefore,palms was entitled to a judgment against cadmus in the amount of.as to substantial compliance,the trial court explained there was no evidence of sharing bci license,and using such a license is legally barred as a basis for substantial compliance.
as to who performed the work,the trial court pointed out cadmus submitted the construction bid palms accepted the bid without any changes cadmus hired laird to perform the construction work cadmus completed the work within the scope of the contract by the end of june cadmus invoiced palms for the entire written contract amount palms paid cadmus the full contract price and cadmus was not issued a contractor license until october.
the trial court cited the rule that a party can not create a triable issue of fact by contradicting its own prior discovery responses.thus,the trial court reasoned bardos declaration must be rejected in favor of bardos deposition testimony.as a result,the trial court concluded cadmus had not disputed any of palms facts.the trial court also found cadmus had not contradicted any of palms legal authority related to licensing laws,disgorgement laws,and the unavailability of substantial compliance.the trial court concluded cadmus had not provided any legal authority for its arguments related to waiver,estoppel,or unclean hands.the court found cadmus request for additional time failed because the request was not supported by affidavits or declarations.
as to palms objections to cadmus evidence,the trial court said,the court is sustaining palms objections to defendant evidence.cadmus responded,your honor indicated that the court was sustaining palms objections to cadmus evidence.all of the objections the court said,yes.the trial court granted palms motion for summary judgment.
discussion 
cadmus asserts the unlicensed contractor statute is not enforceable in a contract made with a tribal entity for work done on tribal land.we disagree because cadmus can not assert palms sovereign immunity.
cadmus contention is purely legal therefore,we apply the independent standard of review.ferguson city of cathedral city th,d fourth,div.two.
in three affiliated tribes wold engineering,d three tribes,the united states supreme court concluded the situation of an indian suing a in state court is very different from a suing an indian in state court for events occurring on tribal land.the united states supreme court explained,as a general matter,tribal is not impeded when a state allows an indian to enter its courts on equal terms with other persons to seek relief against a concerning a claim arising in indian country.id.at.
in state of arizona zaman,zaman,a mother,who was a member of the navajo tribe,brought an action in arizona state court against her child father zaman,who was not a member of an indian tribe.id.at.the mother sought to have zaman adjudged the child father and ordered to pay child support.ibid.zaman argued the trial court lacked jurisdiction.the trial court found in favor of the mother,but the intermediate appellate court reversed.the intermediate court held,the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because state action would infring e on the right of reservation indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.citation.ibid.
the arizona supreme court vacated the intermediate appellate court decision.zaman,supra,at.the arizona supreme court reasoned,zaman,a,seeks to use a protection afforded indians to defeat the claim of an indian who chooses the state forum.this attempt to clothe oneself in the immunity afforded another has already been rejected by the supreme court.three tribes,supra,at.zaman,supra,at.
zaman and three tribes reflect that the sovereign immunity defense is reserved for the tribe and its entities.thus,if a tribe or a tribal entity seeks to sue a entity in state court,then the entity can not assert a sovereign immunity defense.as the united states supreme court explained,a tribal entity selecting a state forum is very different from a tribal entity being brought as a defendant to a state forum.three tribes,supra,at.the difference,as identified in zaman,is that the sovereign immunity defense is only available to the tribe and its entities.
since the sovereign immunity defense is only available to the tribe and the tribal entities,the defense was not available to cadmus a entity.thus,cadmus can not rely on the defense theory that section was not enforceable in a contract made with a tribal entity for work done on tribal land,because that defense relies on principles of sovereign immunity.for example,in cadmus opening brief,it argues,i t is also well established that building and zoning codes are not operative on tribal property because of sovereignty interference cadmus further argues,the interference with indian sovereignty of licensing requirements is illustrated in this case had cadmus been forced to obtain a new license prior to commencing work,then the tribe would have had to choose between selecting another contractor or delaying the start of construction cadmus is asserting the tribe sovereign immunity to prevent the tribe from pursuing an action against him in state court.cadmus can not do this the sovereign immunity defense is reserved for the tribe and tribal entities.accordingly,we conclude the trial court did not err.
cadmus does not provide a detailed explanation as to why it is authorized to assert tribal sovereign immunity as a defense.in cadmus opening brief,it writes,palms seeks disgorgement of monies paid to cadmus for work done on indian property it appears cadmus is asserting the following theory section simply was not the law in the jurisdiction where the contract performance took place.the problem with this argument is that it relies on principles of sovereign immunity.cadmus is arguing a particular state law does not apply on tribal lands cadmus does not have the authority to assert this defense,only the tribe or its entities may assert such a defense.cadmus can not raise tribal immunity simply because the contract was performed on tribal land the defense of sovereign immunity is personal to the tribe and its entities.zaman,supra,at,three tribes,supra,at.accordingly,we find cadmus argument to be unpersuasive.
cadmus provides an argument as to whether section is civil in nature or criminal in nature.cadmus asserts the statute is a civil regulatory statute and therefore does not apply on tribal land.since we have concluded cadmus can not rely on the sovereign immunity defense,we do not address the merits of cadmus sovereign immunity argument 
evidentiary objections 
cadmus contends the trial court erred by summarily sustaining all of palms evidentiary objections,because some of the objections were unreasonable and it appears the trial court did not consider the individual objections.we agree.
we apply the abuse of discretion standard when reviewing the trial court rulings on evidentiary objections.powell kleinman th,d.summarily ruling on multiple evidentiary objections has been criticized by many appellate courts.tilley cz master th,d.when a trial court issues a blanket ruling on numerous evidentiary objections without providing any reasoning,there is hardly a ruling,as it could not provide any meaningful basis for review.nazir united airlines,th,d.when a trial court issues such a ruling,the appellate court is left with the nebulous task of determining whether the ruling that was purportedly made was within the authority and discretion of the trial court and was correct.sambrano city of san diego th,d.
although summarily ruling on numerous evidentiary rulings is a common practice in law and motion courts,the objections in this case needed individual attention.see sambrano city of san diego,supra,th at,d common practice.bardos submitted a declaration,excluding the signature and proof of service pages.palms submitted objections to that declaration,and the objections were pages in length.the objections were often to large sections of the deposition multiple lines long and were based on a variety of alleged problems,such as lack of foundation,vagueness,speculation,and lack of personal knowledge.
for example,objection was based on the following paragraph from bardos declaration on or about august,i personally became a licensed b general building contractor in the state of california doing business as the sole owner and proprietor of bcc,contractor license number.a true and correct copy of the certification of licensure for bcc is lodged concurrently herewith as exhibit since,i have been at all times and without interruption,a licensed general building contractor in california.at the present time i currently hold active licenses for both cadmus construction,cci issued october,and bci issued february,under license numbers and.true and correct copies of the certification of licensure for cci and bci are lodged concurrently herewith as exhibits b and c respectively.both licenses have always been active and in good standing without ever lapsing and without any disciplinary action taken against them.citation.boldface omitted.
palms objected to the foregoing paragraph on the bases of irrelevance,lack of foundation,and misstating the evidence.palms argued that bci and cci are not parties to this case and their licensure is irrelevant.first,as to relevancy,it is unclear how the evidence would be irrelevant,since palms raised the substantial compliance issue in its motion for summary judgment,specifically arguing about cadmus use of bci license,and cadmus could try to use the various other licenses to prove substantial compliance.second,as to lack of foundation,it appears the paragraph is attempting to lay the foundation for the various licenses being lodged as evidence,so it is unclear exactly what foundation is missing for the testimony.third,as to misstating the testimony,palms points out that bcc license has been inactive since.the problem with this objection is that bardos declared bci and cci licenses have always been active not bcc license.so there does not appear to be a misstatement of the evidence.in sum,it appears unreasonable for the trial court to have sustained this objection.
objection through related to cadmus exhibits.palms asserted the various documents cadmus presented were problematic,mostly due to the exhibits being irrelevant.for example,in objection,palms objected to bcc certificate of licensure on the basis of irrelevancy.palms argued the certificate was irrelevant because bcc was not a party to this case.contrary to palms assertion,bcc license is relevant to cadmus trying to establish substantial compliance with the licensing statutes.as will be explained in greater detail post,with bcc license,cadmus could try to prove bardos,and therefore,cadmus as a sole proprietorship had been duly licensed as a contractor in this state prior to the performance of the act or contract.thus,it was not reasonable to sustain the objection on the basis of the exhibit being irrelevant.
given the sweeping nature of the objections pages of objections to a declaration,numerous lines of the declaration being used in almost every objection,and multiple bases for each objection,and the problematic nature of some of the objections,as set forth ante,we conclude the trial court blanket ruling sustaining all the objections,without reasoning,was an abuse of discretion.see nazir united airlines,supra,th at,d order sustaining all but one of defendants objections was a manifest abuse of discretion.thus,the will be used in reviewing the trial court ruling on the summary judgment motion.ibid.
in regard to whether the evidentiary ruling was harmless,an erroneous evidentiary ruling requires reversal only if there is a reasonabl e probability that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.citation.robertson fleetwood travel trailers of california,th,d.in the instant case,the error in the trial court evidentiary rulings would not change the outcome on the summary judgment motion because cadmus failed to present any evidence creating a triable issue of fact,as will be explained post.
cadmus asserts the trial court erred by granting summary judgment because there is evidence cadmus was licensed.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.citation.we assume the role of the trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion.in doing so,we must strictly scrutinize the moving party papers so that all doubts as to whether any material,triable issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.citation calemine samuelson th,d.
the contractors state license law,section et,requires contractors to be licensed unless they are exempt from licensure,et ball steadfast blk th,d ball.section,subdivision a,requires a person to be a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of th e act or contract,when engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor.section,subdivision b,provides that an unlicensed contractor must disgorge all compensation earned under a contract.section,subdivision b,provides,a licensee shall not conduct business under more than one name for each license.
however,a sole owner is a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietorship is not a legal entity separate from its individual owner.so,for example,if smith heating is a sole proprietorship owned by smith,then smith heating can not hold a contractor license independent from smith.smith heating would not be a distinct legal entity it is the individual,smith,who is the licensee,and under that license smith can perform work under the name smith heating.ball,supra,th at,d.
cadmus has always been a sole proprietorship,and bardos has always been the percent owner.bardos asserts his role as the responsible managing officer of bci makes bci license the equivalent of an individual license for bardos,and thus,allows bardos to perform work under cadmus name the problem with cadmus argument is that bci,a corporation,is a separate legal entity from bardos and cadmus.see gottlieb kest th,d generally,a corporation is a distinct legal entity,separate from its shareholders and officers.the fact that bardos is the responsible managing officer for bci does not dissolve bci corporate status bci is its own legal entity.ibid.thus,bardos did not hold an individual license,under bci name,such that he could perform work under the name cadmus.
cadmus contends the corporate identity of bci should be disregarded via the alter ego doctrine or piercing the corporate veil.palms contends cadmus waived the alter ego argument by not raising it below.the appellate court can deem an argument raised in an appeal from a grant of summary judgment waived if it was not raised below and requires consideration of new factual questions.zimmerman,rosenfeld,gersh leeds llp larson th,d.we agree that the argument is waived for failure to raise it below.misik th,d t he determination of whether a corporation is an alter ego of an individual is ordinarily a question of fact.
cadmus contends the words alter ego may not have been uttered in the trial court,but the idea certainly was.the idea that appellant existing licensed corporation could not be used to do the work because the tribe wanted to hide its identity was argued ad naus
